      <P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate a matter of urgent public importance, namely, the revelation by Deputy Howlin on RTÉ's Liveline programme yesterday that, in relation to the inappropriate conduct of the State in the handling of the Brigid McCole case, the legal strategy was decided by the Government.  It is imperative that the Taoiseach explains to the House why the Government authorised a legal strategy which was so insensitively pursued against a defenceless and dying woman.</P>

It is imperative that this question is answered.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach join me in sending our sympathy and good wishes to the community in Wilmslow for the disruption and damage caused by this morning's bombs?  I am sure the Taoiseach and the House will agree that these criminal acts have to be repudiated in the strongest terms.  They are politically futile and only delay any possibility of the commencement of inclusive talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree.  The IRA attack in Wilmslow is a truly appalling event.  It represents an expression of a politically bankrupt strategy.  Those who engage in these actions do not put themselves at risk of physical harm.  They put others at risk.  This cowardly strategy of sneaky violence by the IRA has completely <Col N="4" /> failed.  It has done nothing but divide the Irish people more deeply than was the case when the campaign started.  It also renders more difficult political progress in dealing with the genuine grievances of the nationalist community.  This latest attack is to be strongly condemned.  I hope it will be the last such attack and that at last sense will surface within the republican movement and there will be a ceasefire and all inclusive talks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach and the leader of Fianna Fáil in deploring the bomb that exploded this morning near Manchester.  Probably it was too much to expect that the IRA would leave its evil ways behind during the British general election.  However, we must make it clear to Sinn Féin and the IRA that they will not bomb their way to the talks table.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday that people at the highest level in the United States Government were becoming impatient with the IRA.  Most people on this island are completely fed up with the IRA.  I call on Sinn Féin to put its faith in the democratic, political process, abandon violence in all its forms and not return to murder and mayhem as a means of achieving its political ends. While we are all very thankful that nobody was killed or injured this morning, that does not take from this awful evil act.  We must make it clear this is not the way to achieve anything.</P>

      <P>On another matter, will the Taoiseach say which of his Ministers, the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan or the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, he is disowning this morning.  The Minister for the Environment said on the RTÉ &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme yesterday that the legal strategy in the late Brigid McCole case was a collective decision of Government whereas continuously in this House &mdash; on at least five or six occasions of which I am aware &mdash; the Minister for Health stated that the Government had no knowledge of this matter, that it was an issue with which he dealt.  The Government cannot have it both ways, one or other Minister is wrong and I should like to know who the Taoiseach believes is telling the truth.</P>

      <P>It appears the Taoiseach answers questions when he chooses.  The Taoiseach was absent on business last week and yesterday, and was not here for the Order of Business for the past four sitting days.  Since he made a very strong point, when Leader of Fine Gael in Opposition in relation to the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, and was very critical that the previous Government did not allow any time for questions after that report had been debated in this House, can he tell me why his Government provided no time yesterday for questions at the end of the debate on the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board?  Does he accept there are many unanswered questions in relation to parliamentary responsibility that must be answered?  This issue will not go away until we have been given an opportunity to ask questions. When I raised this matter with the Tánaiste last week he assured me the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan would answer questions yesterday but all the questions on hepatitis C were ruled out of order, as were all the Adjournment debates we sought.  When will Members be given an opportunity to put questions to the present and former Ministers for Health about their mishandling of this whole issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health, in replying to the debate yesterday on the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board on behalf of the Government endeavoured to answer all of the questions raised.  His reply was comprehensive.  It is open to Members to table further questions on the matter which will be answered in detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any questions that are in order will be answered fully.  Obviously questions would have been ruled out while the debate was continuing but the same questions probably would be in order after the debate had concluded.  As far as the Government's involvement in the matter is concerned, clearly there were three defendants in the case in question, the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the National Drugs Advisory Board and the State.  As far as the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the National Drugs Advisory Board are concerned, they had separate boards, separate legal teams and separate insurance in regard to liability and pursued independent legal decisions and strategy on the basis of their advice and authority.  State boards of all kinds daily take decisions on legal cases being taken against them, not the subject of directions, authorisation or decision by Government.  It would be impossible for the State board system to function in any useful way if decisions about acceptance or otherwise of liability by a State board were to be referred <Col N="6" /> to the Cabinet for decision.  They were not referred to the Cabinet for decision in this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Minister for Health is concerned, he kept us informed in a general way of the situation as it developed.  The Government does not make firm decisions on these matters.  The Government received formal legal advice that the State, as distinct from the BTSB, did not have a liability in this matter.  That is obviously legal advice which when received by any Government, from the point of view of accountability for public funds, it must take due account.  It is not possible for the Government &mdash; as Deputies who are aware of the constraints on public finances will know &mdash; to ignore legal advice about liability in regard to taxpayers' funds. When the advice was given as to the State's liability in this matter it had to be taken seriously, as it was, in any discussions we had on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what the Taoiseach has said.  In other words the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is correct and the speech which attacked the legal team of the late Brigid McCole was drafted by the Attorney General.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time this discussion was taking place &mdash; I hope Members will appreciate and understand this &mdash; the Government's priority was to set up a non-adversarial system for the quickest dispensement of compensation to the victims.  We did not want to get involved, as a priority, in legal cases in an adversarial setting but rather to ensure, through the establishment of a non-adversarial tribunal, that compensation would be paid to the women as quickly as possible. That was our priority.  This problem existed for some time but this Government established a tribunal of compensation to ensure, without the requirement of being engaged in adversarial fault-finding, there would be quick compensation for the victims.  The issue of fault and liability is a separate matter.  Our first priority in all of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach answer one question?  In his statement yesterday, which I believe is the truth, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, indicated for the first time there was collective Cabinet responsibility for what happened in October.  Since the Taoiseach is responsible to the House for the Attorney General, was it the Attorney General, under the Taoiseach's control, who drafted the statement for the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on 16 October 1996 which attacked the legal team of the late Brigid McCole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise the Deputy &mdash; who I would have expected would not need advice on this matter &mdash; that the Government is collectively responsible for all its acts.  Everything any Minister does, whether on the authorisation of a Cabinet decision or not, is something for which he is collectively responsible with all his colleagues. There is no resiling from collective responsibility in this Government nor will there be.</P>

Will he confirm if political pressure was brought to bear on the BTSB at that stage since it has not been denied by the BTSB?

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this important Bill.  As Deputy Tom Kitt said, retailing trading hours have expanded inexorably over the past few decades. Most of us welcome the opportunity to avail of early morning and late evening opening hours for shopping.  We do not support what this Bill is designed to pre-empt, which is the steady encroachment of shopping on Sundays due to recent developments and the deterioration of working conditions which the extension of retail opening hours can mean.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to allow sufficient flexibility for the employer to run his or her business without undue constraint, while balancing the rights of the employee.  I compliment Deputy Tom Kitt on initiating this legislation.  He has addressed this issue for a considerable length of time and engaged in widespread consultation on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Government's indication that it accepts the principles underlying the legislation introduced by Deputy Kitt, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Labour Affairs.  Unfortunately, it seems that once again Fianna Fáil has had to prompt the Minister to take action.  Even if the <Col N="17" /> impetus came from the Opposition, the assent of the Government is nonetheless welcome.</P>
    <P>The indication by some larger retail stores that they intended to open on Easter Sunday drew our attention to the relentless extension of trading hours.  I do not think anyone will feel deprived in restraining themselves from heading to the shopping centre that day.  We may be living in a period where there has been a healthy growth in the economy and where some of those in employment enjoy increased purchasing power, but an increase in discretionary spending is precisely that.</P>
    <P>For most people, extra resources are spent on cars, furniture, holidays and other goods and services which we buy or refrain from buying, depending on the structure of the family budget. The most visible expansion of trading, particularly in Sunday retailing, has been in the supermarket sector and shopping centres, of which a food market is the anchor attraction.  An increase in purchasing power generally is not strongly reflected in increased spending on food.</P>
    <P>The demand for supermarket goods is much less elastic than for other products and services. The extension of opening hours is not likely to make an impact on overall turnover in that sector. Even if supermarkets were open and available for business 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the expenditure in total on food items is unlikely to expand significantly.  The overall profitability of stores will not increase proportionate to the extension of opening hours, neither will the remuneration of staff.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Bill is not to curtail retailing on Sundays, although there are valid grounds for reservations.  I hold strong reservations on the idea of widespread Sunday shopping.  Many people have genuine religious objections which should be respected.  Others hold that Sunday is a time for rest and recreation, attending and participating in sporting events and spending time with the family.  It does not have to be a time for shopping.</P>
    <P>More importantly, many feel that Sunday is not a day on which they should have to go to work. Nonetheless, staff of supermarkets who are required to work on Sundays undoubtedly feel they have little choice.  The retail trade uses part-time and casual employment to an increasing extent.  Part-time and casual employees feel or can be made to feel that they are ten a penny and that if they are not cheerfully available for work on Sundays, others will and that, ultimately, those reluctant to volunteer for Sunday working will find themselves eased out on Mondays or Tuesdays as a result.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not preclude Sunday opening.  It leaves operators of retail outlets and their customers with a choice.  What is important is that it also gives staff a choice.  Recent Governments have put many Bills through the House to legislate for equality in a wide range of areas and some have made great play of their endeavours in this regard.  The Government has an opportunity <Col N="18" /> to ensure that, within reason, those who choose to keep Sunday free to rest, study and participate in sport do not suffer discrimination <i>vis-à-vis</i> those who do not.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 6 (2) is designed to ensure that workers who give up their Sundays to facilitate trading on that day are appropriately remunerated.  There are very few professions &mdash; membership of this House is one of the exceptions &mdash; where Sunday working is not remunerated over and above the level of compensation for normal shifts or unsocial hours.  Neither the proprietors of retail outlets, nor the public whom they claim Sunday trading is designed to serve, have any grounds for complaint in this regard.  If my impressions are incorrect, that Sunday trading boosts the revenues of retail outlets choosing to open, the benefits should be shared with the employees who make it possible.</P>
    <P>Another area where I see severe repercussions, particularly for rural areas, is the increasing attraction of multiple stores sited nowadays in most provincial centres.  The capacity of those stores to remain open for extensive hours puts undue pressure on smaller stores, particularly family run shops and businesses.  In recent years there has been a marvellous upgrading of stores, pubs, shops, hotels and other businesses in rural areas.  Great credit is due to those who have to contend with severe competition due to the huge extension of the network of multiple stores.</P>
    <P>I have tabled numerous parliamentary questions to the Minister for Finance on the inequity in the system of rateable valuation of premises. When a premises is renovated or extensive improvements are carried out, the rateable valuation is increased.  This is wrong as it acts as a disincentive. In most cases the enhancement work or upgrading of premises is necessary to retain existing business, let alone attract additional business. It is wrong that those with initiative and commitment to improve premises, often in small towns, villages and rural areas, should be penalised in this way while there are substantial tax incentives available to start business in some large urban areas.</P>
    <P>The response of the Minister for Finance to my questions on each occasion did not, unfortunately, convey any indication that such penalties and disincentives would be removed.  I appeal to the Minister of State whose portfolio is an economic one to at least recognise the difficulties that exist for smaller stores in towns, villages and rural areas, as well as suburban areas of the larger urban centres, and to have a system devised under which the person who invests heavily in upgrading a business premises is not penalised for so doing while there are favourable incentives available to big business to locate in certain urban areas.</P>
    <P>The draw of business from smaller towns and villages is a source of concern to all interested in the future well-being of rural areas.  Major disruption can occur in the organisation of community and sporting activities when young people feel <Col N="19" /> compelled to work on some Sundays.  Football and hurling clubs and other sporting bodies in rural areas have a small number of people on which to draw.  Any further infringement on traditional Sunday activities will not benefit local communities.</P>
    <P>Since December 1994 Fianna Fáil has been one of the most constructive and responsible Oppositions in the history of the State.  It has engaged in healthy democratic debate and in healthy criticism of the Government, when necessary.  It has given broad support to the Government, where appropriate.  I compliment Deputy Kitt on producing this Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Party has produced more Private Members' Bills and well researched and substantial policy documents than any previous Opposition.  When Deputy Bertie Ahern is elected Taoiseach in a short time, Fianna Fáil in Government will be willing to take on board the valid views and concerns of the Government parties which will then be in Opposition.</P>

      <P>I do not doubt the sincerity of the mover of the Bill, Deputy Tom Kitt, whom I congratulate and with whom I have been discussing this issue, in which I have a great interest, for the past two years, since the multiples began to trade on Sundays.  Traditionally, Sunday trading has been confined to corner shops, news-agents, pubs and garden centres.  The Bill gives us a huge opportunity to regulate this area of activity.  The Government is not opposing the Bill on which, I am sure the Deputy accepts, some work remains to be done.  During the past two years Sunday trading by the large multiples has <Col N="20" /> become the norm rather than the exception.  I welcome the strong and unambiguous stance taken by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in favour of regulating Sunday trading and Sunday work.  This is vitally important as we sometimes separate Sunday trading from Sunday work and seem to think the work gets done by itself.</P>
      <P>There are two issues at stake here, first, the right of workers not to be constrained to work on Sunday and, second, whether Sunday should be turned into yet another shopping day.  I know Deputy Kitt shares my view that this should not happen.  The Bill addresses the issue of workers' protection.  In many ways the progressive attitude taken by Deputy Kitt is entirely different from the attitude taken by the Fianna Fáil Party to the working time legislation which was debated recently.  If one takes the comments by the previous speaker as true, then these political inconsistencies will not appear any more and Fianna Fáil as a party will listen.  It is a pity that Fianna Fáil does not listen to Deputy Kitt more often.</P>
      <P>I welcome the effort put in by Deputy Kitt in bringing the Bill before the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to debate some of the changes in retailing in general.  There are flaws in the legislation but this is probably due to a lack of facilities in terms of drafting and too hasty drafting rather than a lack of commitment to this area by Deputy Kitt whose bona fides are beyond question.</P>
      <P>Section 3 exempts relatives, those living in the house of the employer and those working less than eight hours per week from the terms of the Bill.  I assume the reasoning behind this exemption is to facilitate small family run shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that such shops which are already battling against competition from the multiples should be facilitated to the greatest extent possible.  However, I am concerned that this exemption could militate against young people and part-time women workers, many of whom may work less than eight hours per week and still wish to spend Sunday with their families. This matter can be discussed in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons many women take up part-time or casual work is that they want to combine the time they spend with their families with work outside the home.  It is essential that statutory provision does not prove counterproductive in this regard.  Section 5 stipulates that employees shall not be discriminated against on foot of a refusal to work on Sunday.  However, the Bill does not refer to potential employees, those who indicate during interviews that they do not wish to work on Sundays.  I appreciate that employers must take flexibility into account when employing workers and I hope this section will be examined on Committee Stage with a view to incorporating <Col N="21" /> some form of anti-discrimination protection for job applicants.</P>
    <P>Section 7 stipulates that employers who require employees to perform Sunday work should inform employees of this by means of a notice placed in a window or other prominent place four days in advance.  While this may be regarded as a technicality, it is possible that part-time workers who work after a certain time may not see a notice.  All reasonable steps should be taken to inform employees who may not see the notice.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with redress and the role of the rights commissioner.  We must ensure that an employee who makes a complaint to the rights commissioner is not discriminated against.  This provision mirrors the provision in the employment equality legislation.  This is another matter which can be debated in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The broader issues surrounding Sunday trading have not been dealt with in legislation &mdash; this point has been made by Deputy Kitt and me for many years &mdash; apart from the 1938 Act, the relevant Parts of which were effectively suspended by the Minister of the day.  Ireland is the only EU country with no effective legislation governing hours of trading, particularly trading on Sunday and public holidays.  It is unacceptable that the way should be left open for a few powerful retailers rather than elected legislators to set the agenda on this issue.  The current legislation leaves us in a vacuum and is fast leading to a Sunday free-for-all.  The victims of such a free-for-all will inevitably be the weaker players in the retail scene, small and medium sized shops many of which perform a vital role in their community.</P>
    <P>Dunnes Stores led the way in 1994 by opening 15 of their shops on Sunday and public holidays. Since then Sunday trading seems to have become an integral part of modern life.  According to all available evidence, this has resulted in a noticeable reduction in the trade of other retailers on subsequent days.  I welcome the decision by Dunnes Stores, in the face of considerable public pressure, not to open on Easter Sunday. However, what about Christmas this year and Easter next year?  What about all the other stores?  If we are to ensure that Sunday and public holidays are maintained as days when families rather than cash tills dominate then we must ensure that legislative pressure is brought to bear not only on Dunnes Stores but on all the multiples.</P>
    <P>Small and medium sized retailers are already bearing the economic brunt of social change and corner shops are finding it increasingly difficult to compete with large chain stores.  Every town has boarded up shop fronts, and we can only guess at the consequent job losses.  Workers in the retail sector already see their jobs threatened by &ldquo;fire as you like&rdquo; casual labour.  In Dunnes Stores less than 10 per cent of staff were full-time in 1995. Despite strike action, protracted negotiations and Labour Court recommendations there has been little substantial improvement in that area.  This <Col N="22" /> Bill will go some way towards addressing the concerns of workers employed by large multiples. However, it is a first step and should be seen as such.</P>
    <P>I would welcome an assurance that the Government intends to introduce its own legislation or regulation under the 1938 Act at the earliest opportunity to address the substantive issue of trading on Sunday and public holidays. In this context, the position adopted by MANDATE is reasonable and reasoned.  It demands that Sunday trading and trading on public holidays be regulated rather than banned outright. At a minimum, such legislation should regulate the hours during which Sunday and holiday trading can occur in stores above a given size.  On the Continent stores above a certain floor area cannot open on Sundays or public holidays.  As someone recently suggested, we could introduce a quota system whereby multiples could open for a certain number of Sundays every year on a similar basis as extensions are given to various pubs and places of entertainment. Seasonal and regional adjustments could also be taken into account in deciding this issue.</P>
    <P>Unregulated Sunday trading disrupts not only workers' lives but also the lives of their families and those who work in the supply area.  The bottom line is that if Sunday trading is allowed to continue unhindered it will fundamentally alter the family-centred culture of this country not only for the workers directly affected but also for the families encouraged to spend yet another day dragging trolleys around shopping centres.  I have heard it said that people shop on Sunday because it is the only time of the week they can do so, it is convenient and they can take their families with them.  However, no consideration is given to the men and women working behind the counter, stacking shelves or helping them with their queries who cannot spend time with their families. This is a selfish and unreasonable attitude.  Most multiples open until 9 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and this gives people who work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ample time to do their shopping.</P>
    <P>There is only a demand for Sunday trading in so far as, according to one of the most perverse laws of human nature, demand expands to meet supply.  I do not believe there is a need for families to go on major shopping expeditions on Sundays or public holidays.  It is the multiples who are demanding this.</P>
    <P>The introduction of legislation to curtail Sunday trading will be a step towards supporting families. We must remember it is not just social legislation that impacts on family life, but economics. This legislation will safeguard the position of small retailers who are already finding it difficult to compete with the large multiples.  If that is not done, permanent jobs will be lost and increasing numbers of workers will be forced to depend on casual employment.  They will not know on any day whether they will have work for the following day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> I welcome this long overdue Bill which provides an ideal opportunity for debate.  I congratulate Deputy Kitt on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear my colleague, Deputy Lynch, congratulate Deputy Kitt on his sincerity and the fact that he is not quite like the rest of the people in Fianna Fáil.  I admire Deputy Kitt's sincerity and commitment on most occasions, but I am not sure I can give the same plaudits today because not long ago Deputy Kitt and his colleagues opposed the Organisation of Working Time Bill introduced by the Minister of State for labour affairs, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, to implement the working time directive, which applies to all EU countries, thereby consolidating legislation enacted over a period of 60 years covering industrial relations and protection for workers.</P>
      <P>The attitude expressed by Fianna Fáil at that time was virtually contrary to the protection the Minister of State was enshrining for workers.  The 48 hour week was vehemently opposed by Fianna Fáil, despite the fact that only 5 per cent to 6 per cent of the labour force was affected.  Fianna Fáil opposed that Bill on the spurious grounds that it would in some way undermine our competitiveness on the international front.  That is not the case.</P>
      <P>Multinationals set up in this country because we provide attractive packages including excellent educational measures.  We have a good work morale and code, and it is extremely important that arrangements and regulations are put in place for both employers and employees.  It was irresponsible of Fianna Fáil to attempt to put in place a measure whereby people would work for 60 or 70 hours per week.  That compares closely with what is happening in Britain which opposed the Social Charter and which is trying to establish a work ethic on a parallel with many Third World countries and the sweatshops of the Far East.  I was very disappointed with the attitude adopted by Fianna Fáil on that occasion.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an exercise in opportunism.  Fianna Fáil is currently producing legislation like confetti. We have seen more Private Members' legislation from that party in the past few months than it produced when in Government.  From that point of view, I cannot give my wholehearted support to Deputy Kitt on the timing of the Bill, although I support the principle of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill essentially concerns Sunday trading and the large multinationals.  Sunday trading takes place at all levels including small corner shops, hotels, etc.  The principle of whether that is a desirable development has been subject to considerable debate over recent months and years.  The Archbishop of Dublin states regularly that it is contrary to Catholic practice, that Sunday is a day of rest and should remain sacred.  I am inclined to agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that one day in the week should be identified as a day for relaxation and adhering <Col N="24" /> to religious duties or other practices.  It must be recognised, however, that seven day trading has become the norm in many areas including the public service, utilities, agriculture, and the hotel and catering industries, but it is increasingly becoming the norm in relation to industrial production. Factory workers now work on a 24 hour basis, and approximately 36 per cent of the work-force is engaged in that type of seven day activity. It is important to regulate that across the board.</P>
    <P>In addition to dedicating one day in the week as a day of rest, we have moved towards making Saturday a second rest day, thereby enabling people to engage in a range of activities over an extended period.  The seven day trading development does not make that proposal very practical. I am particularly concerned about the effect of seven day trading on small shops throughout the country.  If the multiples open on Sundays on a regular basis, people might be inclined to do their weekly shopping on that day as they would have more time.  That would take away from the business done by small shops on a day to day basis, an issue on which RGDATA would have strong views.  I have no doubt it would put a question mark over the ability of many small family businesses to continue in operation.  It is important that would be regulated in a proper fashion both in terms of its operation, the hours worked by employees and the payment they receive.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, on the provisions in the working time legislation.  That is the reason I regard this as opportunistic legislation.  If people were serious about protecting the rights of workers, they should have waited until the working time Bill had been passed because that enshrines many of the principles and provisions in this legislation. If Fianna Fáil was serious about protecting the rights of workers they would have waited for that Bill to be passed into legislation because it enshrines many of the principles in this legislation. Voluntary Sunday work is covered by the legislation unless it is otherwise prescribed by contract, and if somebody is required to work on a Sunday, a Sunday premium is established in the legislation, a built-in pay structure which is appropriate to Sunday working.  We cannot cogently examine the possibility of including a voluntary opt-out clause until we see the final form of the Organisation of Working Time Bill.</P>
    <P>The organisation of working time legislation also provides for rest periods and a reduction in the amount of time any person is required to work in a given week.  Unfortunately, we got no support from Fianna Fáil on that issue.  The Bill provides for an increase in annual leave from 15 to 20 days.  Equally important, there is a <i>pro rata</i> increase for part-time workers.  One of the benefits of the new legislation is its recognition that an increasing proportion of the labour force is now engaged in part-time work.  In the past eight years the percentage of workers in part-time employment has gone up from 8.5 per cent to 13.8 per cent.  It is extremely important, therefore, that we <Col N="25" /> provide <i>pro rata</i> protection for those workers. This is being done through the Organisation of Working Time Bill, but there was very little support for the Minister and the Government in progressing those measures.  The obvious time to introduce a Bill dealing with retailing would be when the Organisation of Working Time Bill has been finalised.</P>
    <P>The zero hour contract, the banning of which was a key demand of the MANDATE trade union, was a major bone of contention in the Dunnes' Stores industrial action.  This will now be enshrined in legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt's Bill proposes that nobody should be obliged to work on a Sunday and shall not be discriminated against if they decide not to.  The outlawing of discrimination is being enshrined in various legislation currently being introduced by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  The provision for payment rates of at least time and a half for Sunday working is welcome.  This is reflected in the Organisation of Working Time Bill in which it is provided that a special premium should be paid for Sunday working and that four days' notice should be given by an employer if he wants somebody to work on a Sunday or by an employee if he or she cannot work on the following Sunday.  A right of appeal to the Rights Commissioner in respect of complaints may or may not be an appropriate mechanism, but we do need an appeal mechanism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt tabled an amendment to the Organisation of Working Time Bill both as an individual Deputy and in conjunction with other Deputies in relation to a voluntary opt-out clause. The mechanism enshrined in the Minister's legislation is the correct one.  An opt-out mechanism can work only if it is backed up by a collective approach.  If there is not a collective arrangement on an industrial basis, it would be hard to support an individual option to opt out.  A person could be extremely vulnerable in such a situation.  It would be very difficult to legislate against the possibility of discrimination against a person who voluntarily opts out, and discrimination can take many forms.  Some amendment in respect of that protection would be required.  Perhaps the Deputy would accept the principle in the Organisation of Working Time Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important that Sunday trading is regulated and that workers are protected in that respect. The Deputy has provided a measure to do that. Many of the provisions of this Bill are already overlapped by the organisation of working time legislation.  I hope to see that legislation in operation, at which time we can look at Deputy Kitt's legislation to see what measures have been dealt with and what measures remain to be dealt with and amend the Bill accordingly.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, Deputy Costello mentioned it was opportunistic of our party and of Deputy Tom Kitt to introduce this Bill now.  The Bill was introduced last November. I was with Deputy Kitt in the Shelbourne <Col N="26" /> Hotel when he presented it.  It was moved here in the Dáil, and we were awaiting an opportunity to have it taken in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was prepared and presented to the public last November.</P>
      <P>We are having two debates on this matter.  The wider debate is about the very vexed question of Sunday trading which is not amenable to a straightforward solution.  The Minister of State inherited an IPC report commissioned by me and which was produced just before Fianna Fáil left office.  Subsequently during the course of the two by-elections the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, gave a commitment to MANDATE that the issue of Sunday trading would be addressed, and I got a letter this morning enclosing one of the letters he sent to a MANDATE official in Cork in which he gave a commitment to address the matter.</P>
      <P>On the wider issue of Sunday trading, it is not a question to which there is a neat answer with which everybody in the land agrees.  Many issues come into it, including the wishes of people who find Sunday trading suits their circumstances. Husbands and wives or partners, family and children go out together to make a social occasion of doing Sunday shopping, usually in one of the large multiples.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of what is happening in Europe with regard to Sunday trading.  Different regimes operate there, some more regulated than others.  Consumer needs and demands must be taken into account.  People need a time of rest and they need time for their various forms of worship.  Those of us who go to one church may do so on Saturday night while other churches have their own arrangements.  There are also people who do not wish to go to church.  All those complexities must be taken into account.  To say that Sunday trading is an issue that can be addressed simplistically is incorrect, and we have never sought to do so.  My colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, has always been aware, as I have, that this issue will not be easily resolved.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about multinationals, particularly the take-over by Tesco of the Quinnsworth chain and its effects on employment and on small firms throughout the country that supply the goods.  This evening I will meet people from Tesco in the UK and I will be interested to hear what they have to say.  As well as the invidious position of large multiples, we must also consider the corner stores, which everybody accepts should open on Sundays, and public houses, which are exempt from the provisions of the Bill and which are usually the haven of the male on Sunday afternoon.  All those issues must be taken into consideration in regard to Sunday trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the wider debate, but the more focused debate today is the Protection of Workers <Col N="27" /> (Shops) Bill, 1996.  I applaud my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, who worked on this matter for the past 12 months or more and Deputy Bertie Ahern for giving him full rein in that regard. Deputy Costello may think we are being opportunistic, but it is timely that this Bill is being taken and we applaud the Minister for accepting it in an open fashion.  That receptiveness has much to do with the fact that we are approaching a general election.</P>

      <P>This outbreak of goodwill is too much for me.  I wish to address the predatory nature of the Minister with responsibility for commerce, science and technology who has taken unto himself powers unknown to man or woman in this land.  He is the authority on everything.  I call him the Marjorie Proops &mdash; God rest her soul &mdash; of the Government.  He spoke for half an hour on Radio Ireland this morning and gave opinions on everything.  If you have a problem, ring Deputy Rabbitte, alias Marjorie Proops, and he will answer your problem on Radio Ireland, for free, I presume.</P>
      <P>On the radio this morning he gave detailed opinions on Sunday trading and on this Bill.  He believes there is need for separate legislation for the protection of workers and that that would be in place before the general election.  He said that Dunnes Stores were not to trade on Easter Sunday and they said they would not do so.  The powers and capabilities, but most of all the predatory nature of our Marjorie Proops, are evident.  He talked, as he thought, in a funny, irreverent, supercilious way about my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, who gave the perfect riposte yesterday in the Dáil.  He talked about ample brain, and one does not wish to be personal, but ample neck and perhaps <i>avoirdupois</i> would be entirely suitable for the said Marjorie Proops.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, should assert herself because her Department is a hotbed of intrigue and intrusion &mdash; I am not talking about the public service but the political machinations in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the unclearly defined responsibilities of various Ministers.  The fact that Deputy Rabbitte is allowed sit at the Cabinet table allows him to run free when out of Cabinet.  I encountered similar issues and I am aware that one must listen to everything and act accordingly, but that Minister certainly stole a march on this issue.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, <Col N="28" /> has however asserted herself and I commend her on that.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate we are debating this Bill today.  It is interesting that on another issue, hepatitis C, debate on which will continue to rage because in the main a group of women was involved, efforts were made to dismiss it as a woman's issue and marginalise the case made. Similarly, shopworkers are mainly female, but because part time work suits females &mdash; their lifestyles allow for other activities &mdash; that does not mean they should not receive proper pay or that proper provision should not be made for them. The fact that many female shopworkers are suitable, available, ready and willing does not mean they should have to operate in an unregulated environment.  There is a definite need to define their working hours and their rates of pay, particularly for Sunday work, and that is what Deputy Kitt has done in this Bill.  With the incursion of British stores, it is important that workers be given proper status.</P>
      <P>Young women from large supermarkets in Athlone and Mullingar tell me that the worst part of their job is not knowing when they will be called upon.  Many of them have domestic responsibilities, with children and, in some cases, parents to care for.  They also wish for a social life, which is admirable, but that is difficult in the circumstances.  Nurses on temporary lists also have to wait for the call to their local hospital.  It is usually women who are involved in these cases. When we think back to World War I and World War II, women were called away from factories and shops to work in munitions firms, and when the war was over they were patted on the head and told that we would not have won the war without them.  Women are treated like goods on supermarkets shelves, they are also expendable. That is not the correct way to treat people.  Shop workers, who are mainly women, should be treated with respect.  Sean Lemass introduced the 1938 legislation, but it was not implemented because of an outcry from publicans.  MANDATE gave me a copy of that Bill, which I read with interest.  As a Dublin man, Sean Lemass was always interested in workers' rights.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill and congratulate Deputy Kitt on introducing it.  I also commend the Minister of State for accepting it.  I am sure Deputy Kitt will be anxious to know if she will table amendments on Committee Stage.  While the political future is uncertain in that we do not know when the election will be held, the outcome is not uncertain.  We look forward to dealing with the wider contextual issue of Sunday trading, which will not be amenable to pat answers.  The Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; our Marjorie Proops &mdash; should do the work for which he was appointed and leave other matters to those appointed to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Kitt, on the successful manner in which he introduced <Col N="29" /> the Bill and the wisdom of the Government in accepting it.  However, I am concerned the Government may fall before it is enacted.</P>
      <P>There are pros and cons to Sunday working. Because of the nature of their business, many retail industries have to work on Sundays and in most cases the employers and employees involved reach an amicable agreement.  However, in recent times major problems have arisen in regard to compulsory Sunday working, particularly in the grocery sector.  This is the main reason Fianna Fáil introduced this legislation.  In general, employees in the grocery sector are young females between the ages of 18 and 20.  For many of them it is their first job and they want to impress their employers.  However, they also want time off for a social life and weekend work and late night openings on Thursday and Friday interfere with that.  I note from recent newspaper advertisements that late openings have been extended to include Wednesday nights.  Young people often feel intimidated into working unsocial hours and Sunday trading causes major problems for them.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that up to now legislation did not cover such trading.  The Select Committee of Enterprise and Economic Strategy has been discussing Committee Stage of the Organisation of Working Time Bill.  I am disappointed the Government excluded the voluntary opt-out clause.  Acceptance of our amendment on Committee Stage would have satisfied workers in that regard, but the Government decided not to accept it.  As a result, we had no option but to introduce this Bill.</P>
      <P>It was amusing to listen to the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, Deputy Rabbitte, lecture all and sundry on radio over the past few weeks on everything from the price of the pint to the price of insurance.  He appears to be an expert on every trade.  I was disappointed he attacked Dunnes Stores, one of two supermarket chains that is 100 per cent Irish owned.  While I have no reason to defend Dunnes Stores, it was reacting to an English based company, Marks and Spencers, opening on Easter Sunday.  However, the Minister did not mention that company in his radio interview.</P>
      <P>Over the past 20 years many new shopping centres have been built, mainly in the Dublin area.  When a dispute arises involving the anchor tenant in such centres, many people do not use the centre.  Consequently, the smaller units &mdash; many of whom involve sole traders or family businesses &mdash; are severely affected.</P>
      <P>The standard of goods on sale and the manner in which they are displayed has improved greatly in recent years.  All aspects of retailing have changed and the standards here are as good if not better than those that apply in many retail groups in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned the ongoing dispute with environmental health officers will escalate.  The ramifications of an escalation in this dispute will <Col N="30" /> affect the retail grocery sector.  Because of the enormous input environmental health officers have in overseeing and policing aspects of our food industry, the Government should look seriously at how it can resolve this difficult dispute.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have been concerned about BSE and its effect on our food industry. If a knock on effect of the environmental health officers dispute is to highlight deficiencies in the food chain which are not being tackled, we will face a problem which will have to be addressed sooner rather than later.  I ask the Government to try to bring the parties together to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt's Bill aims to protect shop workers.  The unions, which have had long discussions with the Deputy, fully support the Bill, and the case they made is not unreasonable. Everyone accepts that shops see the run up to Christmas as a time to increases their turnover and that much of their business is done in the three to four weeks before Christmas and during other holiday periods.  It is right that Sunday trading should be allowed on those occasions.  It should, however, be done with the agreement of staff, who are not unreasonable.  They do their job in their interests, that of their employment and that of providing a service to the public, which appreciates it.  If, with the agreement of unions and employers, Sunday trading is extended beyond Christmas and other holiday periods, except Easter Sunday, it will become a social occasion where the public will be able to browse through shopping centres.  At this time of the year many husbands enjoy visiting DIY stores.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong if shops and shopping centres remained open on Sundays without the agreement of staff.  This free for all, which has developed and which has been highlighted recently by some English stores that wish to open on Easter Sunday, is worrying.  This development met with an understandable negative reaction, not only from a large section of employees but also from concerned members of the public. There was also a negative reaction from smaller retail trading units which must open if an anchor unit in a shopping centre decides to trade.  Such shops have no option but to open and pay the costs involved.  In many cases, it is unprofitable for small units to open and trade on Sunday.</P>
    <P>I question the wisdom of Sunday trading as only a certain amount of money is spent in a given week.  If one divides the amount over seven days, the same amount of money will be spent, so why not condense it into six days for most of the year?</P>
    <P>The ever increasing casualisation of the trade in the absence of legislation will condemn a further generation of workers, usually young females, to uncertainty.  It is time we introduced legislation to ensure their rights are protected. The Bill, which has rightly been accepted by the Government, is a protective measure and if it <Col N="31" /> becomes law it will protect the rights of workers in retail outlets.  I would not like Sunday working to become compulsory or obligatory, as it is at present.  It should be optional for employees.  This Government, which claims to be concerned about workers' rights, has turned its back on the thousands of workers in this sector who, under existing legislation, are obliged to work on Sundays.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are that a shop worker shall not be obliged to work on Sunday without his or her consent, which is a basic right for any employee, and that an employee who works on a Sunday will be paid not less than time and a half for Sunday work.  For employees who opt to work on Sunday, employers should give the employee notice of the work schedule not less than four days before Sunday work.  It is only fair and reasonable that if an employee must work on a Sunday, they should be able to make arrangements well in advance.  This aspect of the Bill deals with the unacceptable use of zero hour contracts, which have a part to play in current work practices in this sector.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that MANDATE and RGDATA, which represent small shop owners, have welcomed this Fianna Fáil Bill and are encouraged by the fact the Government has decided to take it on board.  Workers in the retail sector will be pleased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, that I made remarks on this issue during the week which could be taken as a reflection on Deputy Tom Kitt.  That was not my intention and I apologise to him and withdraw any such remark.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because Sunday trading by the large multiples is all too pervasive.  I do not believe there is widespread public demand for this extent of Sunday shopping.  The question of widespread shopping on Easter Sunday is over the top.  I received a letter from Dunnes Stores last night which states:</P>
      <P>The Board of Dunnes Stores last week, considered carefully your appeal and the opinions of others, that it was not in the public interest for retail outlets to trade on Easter Sunday.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Board announced last Thursday, that plans for trading on Easter Sunday had been changed and that no Dunnes Stores would now be open on that day, as had always been the case in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dunnes Stores went on to argue that I placed it in an invidious position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other stores, a point made by Deputy Nolan.  I do not accept that.  I spoke to Brown Thomas, Marks and Spencers and Debenhams.  Brown Thomas agreed not to trade on Easter Sunday, as planned, and the other two companies pointed out that they come into this country on certain understandings.  They <Col N="32" /> assert they have collective agreement for voluntary working on Sunday and that they are monitoring the situation.  I do not accept the charge that I placed Dunnes Stores in an invidious position.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell Deputy O'Rourke that my responsibility in this area arises from existing legislation which permits the Government to regulate Sunday opening, Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938.  This Act contains elaborate provisions prohibiting Sunday trading subject to certain exemptions and it exempts certain classes of business.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, dealt at some length with the legal advice we have on that and I do not have time to cover it now.  The Minister of State also dealt at some length with the measures she enshrined in the Organisation of Working Time Bill which deals with many of MANDATE's concerns on this.  The remaining issue is Sunday opt out which is what interests me about Deputy Tom Kitt's Bill.  A strong case can be made for it as it does not oblige workers to work on Sunday but legally buttresses their right to opt out of it.  It is necessary bearing in mind the conditions in some employments in this trade.</P>
    <P>I was surprised by Deputy O'Rourke's intervention and the personal descriptions she gave the House of my ample frame.  She reminds me of Hettie the hen, so I am delighted she has let Deputy Kitt out from under her apron strings on this occasion.  She made a rambling and meandering contribution dealing with the role of women in the trenches in the two world wars and said nothing about the merits of Deputy Kitt's Bill or the stance of the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald. She spoke of the paranoia she felt in my Department when she was not permitted to engage in some of her more madcap ideas.  She also spoke about my recent successes on a number of issues on radio and elsewhere.  One cannot go to a radio station these days but Deputy O'Rourke is ahead of one begging to be interviewed. She has radio producers driven crazy asking to be interviewed on anything under the sun. She believes herself qualified to speak on any subject whereas she possesses a very limited area of expertise.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have this brief opportunity to support Deputy Kitt on the critical aspect of Sunday opt-out.  If industrial relations were working perfectly in this trade, we might not need the Bill. There is a role for industrial relations in ameliorating the conditions which affect workers in this situation.  It is right the Bill should be allowed to proceed to Committee Stage and we will see what we can do to accommodate it as outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>

      <P>There is a thin line between good, decent debate and political banter and personalised attacks.  I will leave it at that and let the electorate be the judge.</P>
      <P>The point about ministerial responsibility made by my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, is valid because both of us have experience in Government. In my case, it is less than the former Minister and our deputy party leader, Deputy O'Rourke.  While we appreciate demarcation lines and ministerial responsibilities, they are not the central point.  We want to see political responsibilities clearly defined and that is a legitimate objective.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's acceptance of this Private Members' Bill which has been in gestation for some time.  The Bill was published in November after we involved ourselves in lengthy discussions, especially with the MANDATE trade union which has views on the broader issue of Sunday trading as well as on voluntary opt out. Because of the constitutional problems with regard to the broader issue, we confined ourselves in a focused way.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, acknowledged on the airwaves that this area required separate legislation and we have provided it.  We welcome the Government's acceptance of this Private Members' Bill.  It is my first effort at drafting a Bill and I am happy to have done so.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, stated publicly that he would like to see it become law before the election.  I want both Ministers of State to follow up on that commitment and I await a response.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome the comments of Deputy Lynch, colleague of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who has informally discussed this issue with me.  She is aware of my interest and work in this area and her comments were very constructive. In the context of the words we have just had, I welcome her approach as a member of Democratic Left.  She shares many of my concerns and acknowledged that this Bill is a good start.  I accept what she said that it is not possible to have everything perfect in a Private Members' Bill and that we will require assistance from those in Government to frame the legislation properly. We look forward to it and it must be put in place quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, said last night that it is important to get the views of the social partners.  Members of the Government listen to the views of the social partners on various issues, but they must take an ideological stand on them.  We have been derided by others, but the Ministers of State, Deputies <Col N="35" /> Fitzgerald and Rabbitte, must acknowledge that in regard to this aspect of legislation Fianna Fáil, from Lemass's time in the 1938 Act up to the its current leadership under Deputy Ahern, who was involved in labour legislation, has played a pivotal role in providing protective legislation.  The Government must take a stand to protect marginalised workers, those who are being exploited and who are involved in casual and part-time work.  I am aware from my experience of dealing with so-called social partners that IBEC has problems with this Bill.  That is because this is a workers friendly Bill.  When it comes to making a choice Fianna Fáil is allying itself firmly with the worker on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State asked how voluntary is an opt out if an employee is only offered Sunday work, or very little other work during the rest of the week, and should the opt out clause apply to only those who work on a Sunday.  That is a theoretical argument.  The Part-Time Employee Act, 1991 covers all labour legislation for those working more than eight hours.  The Minister of State will note that section 3(b) provides that the Act shall not apply in respect of an employee who is normally expected to work for the employer for less than eight hours in a week.  We thought this through and provided for, say, students who may wish to work a few hours over the weekend.  We discussed this under the protection of young workers Bill.  Under this Bill people can consent to work on Sunday and, if they do so, that is fine, but the Minister of State is stretching the case in putting forward the argument she used.</P>
    <P>She asked what would happen in regard to existing collective agreements.  My motivation in introducing this Bill is that one must have a bottom line on this issue.  We favour collective agreements, but in this context it is important that the Ministers of State opposite recognise that Fianna Fáil is adopting a particular position on this sector and we want this legislation to reflect that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also asked if the opt out clause should apply to all shops.  I look forward to debating that issue on Committee Stage.  The Bill excludes relatives defined as ranging from a wife, a husband to a brother-in-law or a sister. Section 11 provides for regulations to be adopted on any section of the Act.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the director of RGDATA who, on behalf of RGDATA, welcomes the Bill.  In the context of the family of shops it represents, its experience is that people are not coerced to work on Sunday.  That work practice is a voluntary regime.  We are targeting large retail outlets where practices have developed including coercion to work on a Sunday, inadequate notice is given and zero hour contracts reign supreme. That is the focus of our Bill.  I have worked with the Minister of State on various Bills during my time as spokesperson on labour affairs.  She is doing the right thing in supporting the passing of this stage of the Bill on behalf of the Government.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are technical.  They replace the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;absence&rdquo; where it occurs in the definition of disability in section 2.  These amendments achieve a common wording for disability in this Bill and the Equal Status Bill, 1977.  That Bill's terminology is being adopted here as it is reckoned to be the most comprehensive.  The term &ldquo;loss&rdquo; implies that the function concerned existed at some time in the past for that individual.  However, the term &ldquo;absence&rdquo; covers persons who are born without the function as well as those who may have lost the function since birth.</P>

      <P>I move that the Dáil agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Section 6: In page 13, between lines 6 and 7, the following inserted: </P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister shall review the operation of the Act, within two years of the date of the coming into operation of this section, with a view to assessing whether there is a need to add to the discriminatory grounds set out in this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides for the review of the legislation in the next two years to determine whether there is a need to add to the nine discriminatory grounds already covered by the Bill. This amendment is in response to proposals made in the Seanad and supported by Opposition amendments for addition to the existing list of nine grounds of the political opinion ground and the trade union membership ground.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a political opinion ground would require detailed preparatory work which would only delay the Bill.  Consideration would have to be given to a range of complex issues such as the limits on political activity in some branches of the public service including the Defence Forces and the Garda.  Account would also have to be taken of the need for an exclusion to cater for existing practices relating to the operation of party political preferences for a diversity of appointments, particularly public service appointments. The issue of indirect discrimination with regard to this ground would also have to be carefully examined.  Are there circumstances where a person's involvement in some non-political party organisation, for example, the GAA or the IFA might be construed as indirectly discriminating on the ground of political opinion, if, for example, the organisation concerned might be shown to have a preponderance of members of a particular political persuasion at a location or at a particular time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also serious difficulties in adding the trade union membership ground to the Bill.  For example, consideration would have to be given to the implications for closed shop or other collective agreements.  There are constitutional issues too, concerning the right to associate and the converse, the right to dissociate.  The question of trade union recognition is one that has remained unresolved over the years in industrial relations. Apart from its constitutional law aspect, it is one about which employer and trade union interests have different views.  Anti-discrimination legislation of the type before the House today may not be the appropriate vehicle to deal with this legally and historically fraught issue.  However, if this ground was added to the Bill the greatest difficulty arising would be the implications for collective bargaining generally.  Where a trade union <Col N="38" /> negotiated a rate of pay for work or conditions of employment in respect of a category or grade of workers, other workers not belonging to that trade union could resort to pursuing equal pay or similar conditions with the union workers on the basis that the pay rates or conditions were discriminatory. This would represent a major upheaval in Irish collective bargaining arrangements. It would invite employees to pursue future enhancements in pay and conditions through the equality redress system rather than by collective bargaining.  In view of the complexity of the issues involved any expansion in the scope of the Bill would demand careful review.  The amendment gives a firm legislative commitment to such action.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  Two years is an adequate review period.  However, the Minister has highlighted the complexities of the political opinion and trade union membership grounds so it may not be possible to complete the review within two years.

      <P>This amendment reflects an amendment the Minister made to the Equal Status Bill on Committee Stage.  Not withstanding that I was disappointed he did not accept the amendments to the political opinion ground and the trade union membership ground and extend the remit of the Bill, we will have a review of the operation of the Act.  Two years should be a sufficient period within which to complete that review. However, there are other grounds which it may be appropriate to examine.  It is positive if people are aware that a review mechanism exists.  This is an improvement on the original provisions and I support this amendment.</P>

The scope of the amendment is broad enough to cover other appropriate grounds.  Any future Minister for Equality and Law Reform will keep an open mind during the two year period on issues which may arise and on representations made.  Two years is an adequate period within which to assess the operation of the Bill, how the existing grounds have worked and whether further grounds should be added.</P>

    <P>(6)  The Director, equality mediation officers and equality officers shall be independent in the performance of their functions.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This group of amendments deals with the redress mechanisms under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 38 already provides for the appointment of a Director of Equality Investigations under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission to investigate cases of first instance and to issue binding decisions.  I am amending that section to provide, through the director, a single publicly identifiable forum for redress, both for discrimination cases arising under this Bill and under the Equal Status Bill, 1997.  To this end the amendments provide for the establishment of an independent statutory office under the aegis of my Department to deal with discrimination cases whether in the area of employment or in the provision of goods, services or facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> A provision to establish these redress arrangements for both Bills was contained in the Equal Status Bill, 1997 as initiated, but I consider this Bill to be the more appropriate vehicle for these amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 is the main substantive amendment which gives effect to these new arrangements.  Amendments Nos. 25, 29 to 32, inclusive, and Nos. 35 and 37 are related technical amendments.  Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 effect the necessary consequential amendments to the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and to section 29 of this Bill which deals with codes of practice.</P>
    <P>I know that both ICTU and IBEC are concerned that redress and employment equality cases should remain within the ambit of the Labour Relations Commission.  I met representatives of both organisations on Monday last and listened carefully to their concerns.  The issue they pressed with me was the need for a continued industrial relations focus in employment equality cases.  I explained to them that, in taking the decision to provide a single forum for redress of first instance under both Bills, I too was conscious of the need to have a labour relations context for these cases. Accordingly, the Labour Court is being retained as the court of appeal in cases arising under the Bill which are decided at first instance by the director.</P>
    <P>In addition, I provided that dismissal cases, those most likely to have strong industrial relations implications, will continue to fall to the Labour Court for redress at first instance.  Furthermore, my proposals ensure that the expertise in dealing with discrimination in employment, being developed by the equality service, will be utilised in the context of the present legislative proposals.  The new section 38 (4) allows for the assignment of equality officers from the Labour Relations Commission to work in the office of the director.</P>
    <P>I believe this initiative will give good value for public money in the new circumstances in which redress must be provided under two equality Bills, that it represents a sensible concentration of resources and will facilitate a high quality service.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned to provide one locus for complainants initiating discrimination cases and to aid the development of appropriate consistency and coherence in the case law merging under both Acts.  In providing a single locus for redress, I am also conscious of the special needs of some of the groups catered for by the Bill.  It is desirable, on economic as well as other grounds, to develop a single centre of excellence in this regard rather than seek to provide the necessary specialised resources in both locations.</P>
    <P>Other concerns of ICTU and IBEC were that the new redress mechanism may give rise to unnecessary confusion and duplication in the enforcement of employment rights.  I must say that the impetus from my decision to provide a single redress mechanism for both the Employment Equality and Equal Status Bills is also <Col N="47" /> motivated by a concern to avoid unnecessary confusion and duplication of redress procedures.  In this Bill I want to avoid a duplication of service, the Labour Relations Commission providing redress in employment discrimination cases on grounds of sex, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community and, in the case of the Equal Status Bill, a separate service providing redress on the same nine discriminatory grounds in the provision of goods, services and facilities.  I am convinced that such a state of affairs would give rise to more public confusion and duplication of public financial resources than that proposed in these amendments.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that there exists at present a diversity of redress arrangements under labour law, including, for example, the Employment Appeals Tribunal in redundancy and dismissal cases, the Circuit Court in dismissal appeals cases, the District Court in holidays cases, the Rights Commissioner service in maternity and payment of wages cases, the Labour Relations Commission in employment equality cases and the Labour Court in a wide range of industrial relations matters.  My proposals will have little impact on this broad array of options which has grown up as part of our industrial relations environment.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Labour Relations Commission issued a press statement on these proposals in which it maintained it was not consulted about the proposed changes with regard to the Director of Equality Investigations, an issue which I am sure Members will accept is primarily one for another Minister.  However, the provision before the House was the subject of approval by Government.  The provision first appeared in sections 57 and 58 of the Equal Status Bill 1997, as initiated on 5 February last.  I have examined carefully the points raised by ICTU and IBEC and have met them to discuss the issues involved. I am satisfied regard has been had to their concerns in the amendments before the House.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the removal of the equality section from the Labour Relations Commission.  The Minister talked about providing one focus, one conduit, whereby issues of equality and redress under equality law would be directed and said that was the purpose of what he was doing.  The Minister is diluting the considerable strengths and powers of the Labour Relations Commission and its clout in dealing <Col N="48" /> with such issues.  To take away this section diminishes the authoritative way in which the whole issue of redress against employment wrongs is viewed.  Why should one seek to separate the equality part from all the other admirable duties which the Labour Relations Commission carries out?  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, should not have conceded to the request from the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  Rooted in all of this is an attempt by the Department of Equality and Law Reform to gain powers and, therefore, ensure the Department remains when the Minister has left the office.  I do not know what the future holds and I make no forecast, but from an employment point of view the rights of people in employment and those who have been wronged by employers, the system or whatever, the removal of a section of redress from the Labour Relations Commission to another agency, albeit independent, is the wrong way to proceed.  The Labour Relations Commission has built up considerable expertise, knowledge and acumen in dealing with employment issues and issues of redress and I strongly oppose what is being proposed.</P>

      <P>I was disturbed on receiving correspondence from the Labour Relations Commission since it insists there has not been a consultation process.  On all the equality legislation the Minister has dealt with, he has had a great deal of consultation with the various bodies.  It is a matter of grave concern that the Labour Relations Commission believes it has not been consulted on this amendment.  I am concerned that we are receiving news that the commission views this as a serious industrial relations matter, that it is not a question of the commission simply losing a service but of placing an important employment investigation service outside the ambit of the specialised employment industrial relations arena.  At this late stage it is difficult to know what impact we can have.  This matter should be open to further discussion and consultation. At this eleventh hour the Minister should reassure the House, since it was not clear from his response that there was adequate consultation with the Labour Relations Commission.</P>

      <P>This legislation which we have finally passed is the most significant contribution to prohibiting discrimination in employment since the first anti-discrimination Act 23 years ago.  I am glad to have been able to bring to a successful conclusion a commitment made by the Government and the previous Government to introduce legislation to provide protection on a wide range of grounds to outlaw discrimination.</P>
      <P>The Bill responds to the radical change which is taking place in Irish society.  Discrimination in employment often weighs disproportionately on those who are already marginalised in our society &mdash; members of the travelling community, older people and people with disabilities.  I am convinced if real progress is to be made in the future we must focus on positive action to integrate women and other disadvantaged workers into the labour market.</P>
      <P>This employment equality legislation is one essential tool to help redress disadvantage.  I am pleased to have sponsored this Bill and the Equal Status Bill which, when enacted, will give Ireland one of the most modern equality codes in Europe.</P>
      <P>I thank sincerely all Members of both Houses for their constructive contributions and proposals for improving the Bill, many of which have resulted in subsequent Government amendments to the Bill.  The whole process has been beneficial in shaping key provisions in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the dedicated staff of my Department who have <Col N="50" /> worked hard in recent months and long into the night to ensure the passage of the Bill and its amendments through all Stages.  Their work in this regard is much appreciated.</P>

He is retiring from politics and it must be wonderful for him to see one of the most important Bills with which he was involved being brought to a successful conclusion.  We had a long debate about many issues on Committee Stage.  I thank the Minister for his courtesy and for taking on board the views of the Opposition parties.  He was willing to accept amendments although he did not go as far as I would have liked on some matters.</P>
      <P>This is complex and difficult legislation and I acknowledge the amount of work involved in drafting it.  I congratulate the staff of the Department who worked long and hard.  The many amendments confirm that the Bill was even more complex than we thought initially.  I hope it will go a long way towards eradicating discrimination in society and particularly against women in the workplace.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 12, to delete &ldquo;a near relative&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an adult&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At present family status is defined in the Bill as &ldquo;having a natural, step or adopted child, fostering or being the guardian of a child, or living with and caring for a near relative&rdquo;.  In the Employment Equality Bill family status means</P>
      <P>&ldquo;responsibility (a) as a parent or as a person in <i>loco parentis</i> in relation to a person under the age of 18, or (b) as a parent or the resident primary carer in relation to a person of or over that age with a disability which is of such a nature as to give rise to the need for care or support on a continuing, regular or frequent basis&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to change &ldquo;near relative&rdquo; to &ldquo;an adult&rdquo;.  This makes the definition broader than that in the Employment Equality Bill.  The difference between the two definitions is supported by the different contexts.  The definition in the Employment Equality Bill was drafted specifically <Col N="51" /> for the employment context.  It has an emphasis on the adult being cared for having a disability of a serious nature.  This element would not be appropriate in the Equal Status Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment brings the definition of victimisation into substantive alignment with the corresponding provision in section 39(2) of the Employment Equality Bill as passed by the Dáil. One of the changes I propose would bring within the terms of paragraph (j) the case of a person who, by lawful means, opposes a discriminatory act, for example, a member of the settled community who exhorts a service provider to cease discrimination against travellers.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4a:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 17, to delete &ldquo;Subject to subsection (2), a&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;A&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to make section 5(2) subject to section 5(1) and to section 10(2)(b)<i>(iv)</i> rather than <i>vice versa</i>, as in the present version of the Bill.  Section 5(2) provides that a person with a disability can be refused if, because of the disability, he or she cannot comply with reasonable conditions relating to the goods or services in question.  At present, this takes precedence over section 5(1) and over section 10(2)(b)<i>(iv)</i> which provide for the requirement of reasonable accommodation.  However, it would be better if the requirement for reasonable accommodation, subject to undue difficulty, took precedence over the reasonable conditions to which subsection (2) might apply.  That is the purpose of these amendments.</P>

    <P>It is not appropriate to set persons without a disability as the norm from which persons with a disability are regarded as deviating.  The subsection will now simply state conditions that reasonably apply to persons generally.

      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to standardise appeal periods at 42 days.  Parties to proceedings in the District Court on whether a club is a discriminating one will have 42 days to appeal to the Circuit Court against the District Court's order.  The order shall not come into effect until the expiration of the 42 day period.  In the same way, an appeal against a non-discrimination notice will be possible within 42 days as opposed to 28 days in the present version of the Bill.  The non-discrimination notice will not come into effect until the 42 day period is up.</P>

      <P>In page 17, line 6, to delete &ldquo;could reasonably be regarded as&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the victim considers it to be&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I only received the considerable number of additional amendments just before the commencement of Report Stage so I have not had an opportunity to consider the Minister's amendments.</P>
      <P>On the definition of sexual harassment, I am concerned that the Minister's proposal introduced an objective test of what acts or conducts a reasonable person would consider to be sexual harassment.  The onus is still on the victim to show what a reasonable person would have thought.  There should be a subjective test on behalf of the victim, which is why I have proposed this amendment.  This will provide a subjective test and put the primary focus on the victim. Rather than the victim feeling further victimised, which sometimes happens, the harasser will be under scrutiny.  I know the Minister has amended this section but I am not satisfied that the feelings of the victim are taken into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Government amendment No. 11 covers the situation where the victim is treated differently by reason of his or her reaction to the relevant act, conduct or request.  The section already covers the situation where such treatment could reasonably be anticipated.  This brings the section into alignment with the Employment Equality Bill.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Keogh's amendment, the words &ldquo;could reasonably be regarded as&rdquo; were included on Committee Stage to replace the reference to the &ldquo;reasonable person.&rdquo;  Parallel changes to the wording of the Employment Equality Bill and the revised wording of the two Bills has been welcomed in the House and among relevant interest groups.</P>
      <P>The new wording allows for wide discretion as to what is to be considered when assessing reasonableness in the circumstances of a particular case and does not preclude consideration of the subjective experience of the complainant. Therefore, I regret I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> In amendment No. 10a, I qualify the reference to &ldquo;offensive, humiliating&rdquo; by inserting the word &ldquo;sexually&rdquo;.  This aligns this section with the corresponding provisions of the Employment Equality Bill.</P>

      <P>`respondent' means a person who is alleged by a complainant in a case under section 23(1) to have engaged in prohibited conduct. </P>
      <P>23.&mdash;(1)  A person who claims that prohibited conduct has been directed against any person may, subject to this section, seek redress by referring the case to the Director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> (2)  No investigation of a claim by the Director shall be made unless the Director is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  the complainant has, within two months after the prohibited conduct is alleged to have occurred, or where more than one incident of prohibited conduct is alleged to have occurred, within two months after the last such occurrence, in writing notified the respondent of the nature of the allegation, the remedy sought by the complainant in respect thereof and the complainant's intention to refer the matter to the Director if the complainant is not satisfied with the respondent's response to the allegation, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the respondent has not, within a reasonable time after the notification referred to in paragraph (a), responded to the complainant to the satisfaction of the complainant.  </P>
    <P>(3)  Subject to subsection (4), a claim for redress in respect of prohibited conduct may not be referred under this section after the end of the period of six months from the date of the occurrence or, as the case may require, the most recent occurrence of the incident of prohibited conduct to which the case relates.</P>
    <P>(4)  If, on an application made by the complainant, the Director is satisfied that exceptional circumstances prevented the complainant's case being referred within the time limit in subsection (3)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Director may direct that, in relation to that case, subsection (3) shall have effect as if for the reference to a period of six months there were substituted a reference to such period not exceeding 12 months as is specified in the direction; and</P>
    <P>(b)  where such a direction is given, this Part shall have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>24.&mdash;On the request of a complainant, a respondent shall, in such form and within such time limit as the Minister may by regulations prescribe, provide the complainant with information in relation to the alleged prohibited conduct that will enable the complainant to reasonably decide whether the matter should be referred to the Director or, where the matter has been so referred, to reasonably present the facts involved in the matter.</P>
    <P>25.&mdash;The Director may dismiss a claim at any stage in the investigation where the Director is of the opinion that&mdash;</P>

    <P>(a)  prohibited conduct&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  is being generally directed against persons, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  has been directed against a person who has not made a claim under section 23(1) in respect of the prohibited conduct and it is not reasonable to expect that the person will do so, or  </P>
    <P>(b)  a person has contravened or is contravening section 14(1), 15(1) or 21 or a regulation made under section 19 or 20,  </P>
    <P>the matter may be referred by the Authority to the Director.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a matter is referred to the Director under subsection (1) it shall be dealt with in the same manner and to the same extent as if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it were a claim referred to the Director under section 23(1),</P>
    <P>(b)  the Authority were the complainant and the person alleged to have engaged in the prohibited conduct or to have committed the contravention referred to in subsection (1)(b), as the case may be, were the respondent, and</P>
    <P>(c)  where the matter involves a contravention referred to in subsection (1)(b), the contravention were prohibited conduct.  </P>
    <P>(3)  Where, on application to the High Court or the Circuit Court, the Authority satisfies the Court that a person has been determined to have&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  engaged in prohibited conduct, or</P>

    <P>27.&mdash;(1)  Subject to subsection (2), if, at any time after a case has been referred to the Director under section 23, it appears to the Director that the case is one which could be resolved by mediation, the Director shall refer the case for mediation to an equality mediation officer.</P>
    <P>(2)  If the complainant or the respondent objects to a case being dealt with by way of mediation, the Director shall not exercise his or her powers under this section but shall deal with the case under section 28.</P>

      <Col N="58" /> (3)  Mediation shall be conducted in private.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a case referred under section 23 is resolved by mediation&mdash;</P>

    <P>(b)  the written record of the terms of the settlement shall be signed by the complainant and the respondent;</P>
    <P>(c)  the equality mediation officer shall send a copy of the written record, as so signed, to the complainant and the respondent; and</P>
    <P>(d)  a copy of the written record shall be retained by the Director.  </P>
    <P>(5)  If, after a case has been referred to an equality mediation officer it appears to the equality mediation officer the case cannot be resolved by mediation, the officer shall issue a notice to that effect to the complainant and the respondent.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a notice has been issued under subsection (5) with respect to a case, and</P>
    <P>(b)  within 28 days from the issue of that notice the complainant makes an application to the Director for the resumption of the hearing of the case, and</P>
    <P>(c)  a copy of that notice accompanies the application under paragraph (b), </P>
    <P>the Director shall proceed or, as the case may be, continue to deal with the case under section 28.</P>
    <P>28.&mdash;(1)  Where a case which has been referred to the Director under section 23&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  does not fall to be dealt with by way of mediation under section 27, or</P>
    <P>(b)  falls to be dealt with under this section by virtue of section 27(6), </P>
    <P>the Director shall investigate the case and hear all persons appearing to the Director to be interested and desiring to be heard.</P>
    <P>(2)  An investigation under this section shall be held in private.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may by regulation specify&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  procedures to be followed by the Director in carrying out investigations (or any description of investigation) under this section; and</P>
    <P>(b)  time limits applicable to such investigations, including procedures for extending those limits in certain circumstances, </P>
    <P>but before making any such regulations, the Minister shall consult the Director and the Authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> (4)  At the conclusion of an investigation under this section the Director shall issue a decision and, if the decision is in favour of the complainant, it shall provide for redress in accordance with section 30. </P>
    <P>29.&mdash;If, in the course of an investigation under section 28, it appears to the Director that a respondent has failed to comply with section 24, the director may draw such inferences from the respondents failure as seem appropriate.</P>
    <P> 30.&mdash;(1)  Subject to this section, the types of redress for which a decision of the Director under section 28 may provide are either or both of the following as may be appropriate in the circumstances:</P>
    <P>(a)  an order for compensation for the effects of discrimination; or</P>
    <P>(b)  an order that a person or persons specified in the order take a course of action which is so specified.  </P>
    <P>(2)  The maximum amount which may be ordered by the Director by way of compensation under subsection (1)(a) shall be the maximum amount that could be awarded by the District Court in civil cases in contract.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a claim is made by a person on behalf of an organisation described in section 3(1)(a)(ii) in respect of prohibited conduct directed against the organisation, any award of compensation in respect of the claim shall be paid to the benefit of the organisation.</P>
    <P>31.&mdash;(1)  Not later than 42 days from the date of a decision of the Director under section 28, the complainant or respondent involved in the claim may appeal the decision to the Circuit Court by notice in writing specifying the grounds of the appeal.</P>
    <P>(2)  In its determination of the appeal, the Circuit Court may provide for any redress for which provision could have been made by the decision appealed against (substituting the discretion of the Circuit Court for the discretion of the Director).</P>
    <P>(3)  No further appeal lies, other than an appeal to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>32.&mdash;(1)  Every decision of the Director under this Part shall be in writing and&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  if the Director thinks fit, or</P>
    <P>(b)  if any of the parties so request, </P>
    <P>the decision shall include a statement of the reasons why the Director reached that decision.</P>
    <P>(2)  By notice in writing to the complainant and the respondent the Director may correct any mistake (including an omission) of a verbal or formal nature in a decision under this Part.</P>
    <P>(3)  If any person who participated in an investigation is not correctly identified in the <Col N="60" /> resulting decision, the correction of that error shall be regarded as falling within subsection (2). </P>
    <P> 33.&mdash;(1)  A copy of every decision of the Director under this Part shall be given to the complainant and the respondent and every such decision shall be published and a copy thereof made available for inspection at the office of the Director.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any reference in this section to a decision includes a reference to any statement of reasons included in the decision as mentioned in section 32(1).</P>
    <P>(3)  The contents of any document which is published or made available by virtue of this section shall be protected by absolute privilege. </P>
    <P> 34.&mdash;(1)  If a person who is bound by the terms of a decision of the Director under this Part fails to comply with the terms of the decision, then, on an application under this section, the Circuit Court shall, subject to section 35, make an order directing the person affected to carry out the decision in accordance with its terms.</P>
    <P>(2)  If a person who is a party to a settlement to which section 27 applies fails to give effect, in whole or in part, to the terms of the settlement, then, on an application under this section, the Circuit Court may make an order directing that person to carry out those terms or, as the case may be, the part of those terms to which the application relates, but the Circuit Court shall not, by virtue of this subsection, direct any person to pay any sum or do any other thing which (had the matter been dealt with otherwise than by mediation) could not have been provided for by way of redress under section 30.</P>
    <P>(3)  An application under this section may not be made within 42 days of the date of the decision or the date of the written record of the settlement, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(4)  An application under this section may be made&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  by the complainant;</P>
    <P>(b)  in a case where the Authority is not the complainant, then, by the Authority with the consent of the complainant if the Authority considers that the decision or settlement is unlikely to be implemented without its intervention.  </P>
    <P>(5)  On an application under this section, the Circuit Court shall exercise its functions under subsection (1) or (2) on being satisfied&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  of the existence and terms of the decision or settlement, and</P>
    <P>(b)  of the failure by the person affected to comply with those terms.   </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" />  (6)  Without prejudice to the power of the Circuit Court to make an order for costs in favour of the complainant or the person affected, where an application is made by the Authority by virtue of subsection (4), the costs of the Authority may be awarded by the Circuit Court. </P>
    <P> 35.&mdash;(1)  Where the Circuit Court makes an order under section 34(1), it may, if in all the circumstances it considers it appropriate to do so, include in the order the additional direction referred to in subsection (2).</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the order under section 34(1) relates to a decision requiring the payment of compensation to any person, the order may direct the respondent concerned to pay interest on the compensation at the rate referred to in section 22 of the Courts Act, 1981, in respect of the whole or any part of the period ending on the date of the order and beginning&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  42 days after the date of the decision; or</P>
    <P>(b)  if it is later, on the date on which the compensation was required to be paid under the decision.  </P>
    <P>36.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>`designated officer' means the Director, an equality officer or a person authorised in that behalf by the Director;</P>
    <P>`material information' means information which a designated officer has reasonable grounds for believing to be relevant for the purpose set out in subsection (2).</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purpose of enabling information to be obtained which the Director may require to enable him or her to exercise his or her functions under this Part, a designated officer may do any one or more of the following:</P>
    <P> (a)  at all reasonable times, peaceably enter premises;</P>
    <P>(b)  require a person to produce to the designated officer any records, books, documents or other things which are in that person's power or control and which the designated officer has reasonable grounds for believing to contain material information, and to give the designated officer such information and access as the designated officer may reasonably require in relation to the contents of any such records, books, documents and other things;</P>
    <P>(c)  inspect and copy or take extracts from any such records, books, documents or other things;</P>
    <P>(d)  inspect any work in progress at any premises.  </P>
    <P>(3)  The powers conferred by subsection (2) shall not be exercised in respect of a dwelling or any person, record, book, document or other thing in a dwelling unless the Minister (or an <Col N="62" /> officer of the Minister authorised by the Minister in that behalf) certifies in writing that there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is in the dwelling information which is material to the investigation of a case, or the consideration of an appeal, under this Part.</P>
    <P>(4)  If a judge of the District Court is satisfied by information on oath of a designated officer that there is reasonable cause for suspecting that any records, books, documents or other things containing material information are to be found at any premises, the judge may issue a search warrant under this section.</P>
    <P>(5)  A search warrant issued under this section shall be expressed and operate to authorise a named designated officer, accompanied by such other persons as the named designated officer thinks necessary, at any time or times within one month from the date of issue of the warrant, on production if so requested of the warrant,</P>
    <P> (a)  to enter the premises named in the warrant, if necessary by force;</P>
    <P>(b)  to search those premises; and  </P>
    <P>(c)  to exercise any such power as is described in subsection (2)(b) or (c) in relation to persons and records, books, documents or other things found at the premises. </P>
    <P> 37.&mdash;(1)  For the purpose of enabling the Director to exercise his or her functions under this Part, the Director&mdash;</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 13, despite its length, does not represent a fundamental change to the provisions of the Bill.  The approach taken at present in section 22 is to apply the enforcement mechanisms of the Employment Equality Bill to equal status cases subject to certain modifications and exceptions.  This approach may not be fully transparent and I consider it preferable for the convenience of all those who will have to refer to this legislation in the future to elaborate the redress procedures fully in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This amendment spells out what is already contained in sections 22 and 23.  It does not alter the enforcement mechanisms of this Bill, except in relation to partnerships.  The amendment dealing with partnerships is to ensure that in cases under section 9 to which the EU directive on self-employed activity applies there will be no upper limit on compensation.</P>
    <P>If the only redress available to a person alleging a breach of section 9 in this area were to be via the director of equality investigations, there would be an upper limit on the compensation which could be awarded by the director, namely that which applies in contract cases in the District Court.  The provision I now propose to insert would give an aggrieved party an option of taking an action in the courts for whatever level of compensation her or she seeks.</P>

      <P>The new section 24 states: &ldquo;On the request of a complainant, a respondent shall, in such form and within such time limit as the Minister may by regulations prescribe, provide the complainant with information...&rdquo;  This will cause problems in certain areas.  I cite as an example large licensed premises, particularly those under new ownership, where large numbers are barred on a weekly basis.  It may be impossible for a respondent after a period of two months to remember many of the complainants.  Would it be possible to include licensed premises in a special category whereby a complainant would have to lodge a complaint within a much shorter period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue arises under an earlier amendment.  I understand the point the Deputy is making and accept it is a difficult area to deal with.  The views of two sides have to be taken into account.  One has to have some sympathy for retailers, say, publicans.  They have made the reasonable point that they would require notice within a period that would enable them to recall an incident that had occurred.  That is understandable and I accept it.  On the other hand, the disgruntled person who feels he or she has been discriminated against would need time to consider his or her position and find out whether he or she has an entitlement to bring an action. Many people do not know that this legislation exists.  He or she would have to have reasonable time in which to make inquiries and arrange for the issue of a written notice, as required, in time. This is a stringent requirement.</P>
      <P>On balance, the two-month period prescribed is reasonable from the point of view of both sides of the equation.  When one takes into account that limitation periods for the bringing of actions in other cases are a great deal longer than two months &mdash; three years is a normal limitation period &mdash; a period of two months is reasonable in the context of the new remedies provided for in the legislation.  If one was to reduce it to one month, many people who should reasonably have the right to bring a discrimination case would be cut out and may suddenly find themselves stymied and have their rights removed.  However, if the period was six months a publican may say he had forgotten the incident and there would be no record.  One is faced with the dilemma of trying to strike a reasonable balance.  I do not know if Deputies are suggesting another period would be better, but to extend the period would be to go too far in one direction and to curtail it would be to go too far in the other.  The period proposed is reasonable, on balance, and I hope Deputies agree with it.</P>

This will depend on the results of the investigation to be carried out by the director.

      <P>This is an historic day for the nine categories of people being accorded protection under the Bill which deals primarily with the extremely important question of access to goods and services, education and premises.  Many groups, for example those dealing with disabled people, have been waiting a long time for this measure.  It is a matter of regret that it has taken so long to bring the Bill before the House.  I am pleased to have been a member of the Government which initiated this very important measure which is being looked at closely by disability organisations, women's organisations and people of different sexual orientation in the context of age discrimination, race, colour and membership of the travelling community.  For the first time <Col N="72" /> people in these categories are being given rights of redress.</P>
      <P>This is an historic day, and when history comes to be written it will be looked on with high regard.  When the Bill completes the Seanad process we can proudly say this country has a scheme of equality legislation in place that is unequalled anywhere in Europe or perhaps the world.  That is something of which this Oireachtas can be justly proud.</P>
      <P>I want to express my thanks and appreciation to my colleagues opposite for their encouragement and support in the passage of this legislation. I acknowledge the hard work of the officials in my Department who worked long hours, into the night on occasion, to have the measure ready for processing by the Dáil.  I apologise to my colleagues opposite for the rushed manner in which some of the late amendments came about.  That was unavoidable in the circumstances, but I very much appreciate their understanding and forbearance in that regard.</P>

I also congratulate the Minister and the staff in his Department for accepting many of the amendments tabled by the Opposition.  I agree with the Minister that there was consensus on the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is probably the last opportunity I will have to face the Minister across the House on this legislation &mdash; our other Bills will be dealt with by different Ministers.  I appreciate the help given to me by the Minister's officials in regard to the Bill, which I came to at a late stage.  Those of us on this side of the House were happy to facilitate the passage of this legislation through the House.</P>

      <P>It is a coincidence that the Minister put the final touches to the Equal Status Bill in the other House earlier today, while we are now reaching the final stages of the Employment Equality Bill.  He must be proud of that and we should give credit where credit is due.  I welcome the wide consensus in relation to this and the other legislation.  The detailed analysis of the Bill was done in an effort to bring forward this new <Col N="73" /> and far reaching legislation, and I commend the Minister and his officials on its production.</P>
      <P>Contentious issues arose during the debate on the Bill and it was difficult to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.  Notwithstanding the fact that nothing is ever perfect, the Minister went through every possible process to ensure a consensus was reached.  I thank him for accepting Opposition amendments because it can be frustrating if an Opposition Member, who works hard on legislation, thinks the Minister is not listening.  That certainly cannot be said about this Minister.  We may not have agreed on everything but he was prepared to listen and come back with appropriate amendments.  I thank him for that.</P>
      <P>The Minister apologised for the late introduction of some amendments.  In normal circumstances I would object to that but everybody accepted that time was not on our side and some issues needed to be tidied up.  We can all appreciate the reasons for that.  I know the Minister's officials worked hard to have the Bill ready for the stage we are at today.  I thank the various officials who have been helpful to me.  We can feel proud of this legislation which goes beyond the boundaries set by other countries.  We have come from behind in that respect.  The political will existed to introduce this legislation and I am glad the Minister has brought the Bill to fruition. I hope it will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will elaborate on his statement (details supplied) during his recent US visit that he supported the creation of a European Food and Drug Administration to be located in Ireland.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8373/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During my recent visit to the US, I met officials of the Food and Drug Administration. We discussed important issues about the separation of responsibility for primary production and consumer interests in relation to foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, such separation has been provided for by the Government with the establishment of the Food Safety Authority, at present on an interim basis but soon to be established on a statutory basis.  The legislation to establish the Irish Food Safety Authority will be published after Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At European Union level there has also been a separation of functions with the transfer of scientific committees from DG VI, i.e. the Agriculture directorate, to DG XXIV, the Consumer matters directorate, and the creation of a new <Col N="74" /> unit on the assessment of public health risks and inspection of foodstuffs in DG XXIV.  In this context, the veterinary inspection units, including those to be located at Grange, County Meath, have also been transferred to DG XXIV.</P>
    <P>However, as the Deputy will appreciate, apart from actually improving food safety which is crucial, there is a need to restore public confidence in the food industry and in the arrangements which are in place for the enforcement of safety standards.  In Ireland the Food Safety Authority will perform this function but there is a need at European level for a similar structure.</P>
    <P>While clearly national regulatory authorities such as the Food Safety Authority may meet the concerns of domestic consumers, we operate in a much larger single market where a single regulatory body across the union would be desirable. Such an EU authority could also be important in reassuring third country markets.  Should such an authority be decided upon, clearly Ireland would be a very suitable location.</P>
    <P>I was most impressed with the presentation made to me by the FDA.  I was especially impressed by the fact that they make their decisions on objective scientific grounds, uninfluenced by national economic, trade or political considerations.  The agency is headed by a scientist. It has strong powers, can undertake &ldquo;no notice&rdquo; inspections, can stop production lines and can prosecute offenders.  It has won wide consumer confidence, and in conjunction with Ministers, I will be making a further study of its work and powers to draw on its expertise to enhance consumer confidence in food products in Ireland, and in Europe generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter arose from an article in <i>The Examiner</i> on 17 March in which the Taoiseach was quoted as saying there was a huge loss of confidence abroad in some of our food. Specifically what food products have suffered from a major loss of confidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking in a European context and I am referring in particular to the dramatic drop in consumption of beef that has occurred in Germany because of consumer concerns about BSE in Germany and the suggested link between BSE and CJD.  That was a tangible and concrete example of loss of consumer confidence in a European food product, namely, beef. It was for that reason, as somebody who believes in a federal Europe, that I wanted to talk to the federal Food and Drug Administration in the United States which has the capacity throughout the United States Federation of enforcing good food standards.  In that context the meeting was extremely useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the security and safety of beef, is the Taoiseach aware that the FDA in the US has no responsibility for the safety of beef products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="75" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  I am aware that it is not responsible for chickens either.  It is responsible for all other food products and this was one of the issues I discussed in some detail with them. There is a difference of methodology between the operation in regard to food safety inspection that is carried out by the US Department of Agriculture in respect of beef and chickens and the methodology which is used by the FDA in regard to other food products.  The USDA tends to operate on the basis of having somebody in situ all the time, whereas the FDA tends to operate on the basis of &ldquo;no notice&rdquo; inspections from outside.</P>
      <P>I believe the FDA model is better, and I would like to say why.  It is better because it is clearly independent of producer interests and because inspections take place on a &ldquo;no notice&rdquo; basis. Because they are not there all the time, its people have no sense that they are responsible for any errors that may be made.  The FDA is much more independent in the decisions it makes than perhaps is the USDA.  That is one of the issues we need to look at in drawing on the American lessons here.  It is fair to say that the Food and Drug Administration in the United States has won tremendous consumer confidence which is the envy of the world.  One of the reasons is that it is so completely independent in its decisions.  For instance, on one occasion when there was political pressure from within Congress and elsewhere on the FDA to ban certain European food products in retaliation for a ban that Europe had imposed on US food products, the FDA said that that was not justifiable on scientific grounds and, even though it might have been a good thing to do from an American trade policy point of view, it refused to do it because it said that its decisions were made exclusively on scientific grounds.  That is a very sound principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Taoiseach and everybody else is concerned about the status of Irish beef and beef generally throughout Europe, but I find it incomprehensible that the Taoiseach would hold up as an example an authority that has no responsibility for a product about which he is concerned.  That is why I asked him to elaborate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other characteristics of that agency which are particularly important, namely, its powers, its independence and so forth which apply in regard to all other food products. Of course, the Irish Food Safety Authority which this Government is about to establish will have responsibility for beef and chicken as well as all other food products, and such disabilities as may exist in the Food and Drugs Administration in the US will not, I am glad to say, apply to the Irish Food Safety Authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan approved by Government on 5 March 1996 set out to undertake an additional study to review the existing operations of the Naval Service and Air Corps and to make recommendations to ensure the optimum use of resources to fulfil the role set down by Government. In May 1996 the steering group was established to oversee the review.  In June 1996 Price Waterhouse was appointed as consultants to carry out the review.  It was expected the review would be completed by November 1996.</P>
      <P>The original terms of reference envisaged that the consultants would recommend numbers and grades required to deliver on the existing roles and tasks.  A draft report has been prepared on the basis of those roles.  As the study has progressed, however, it has become clear that from a Government perspective further consideration of future arrangements for providing services such as search and rescue and fishery protection would be necessary to allow long-term strategic decisions to be taken on those issues.  The consultants are being asked to consider the issues and their report is expected before the end of summer 1997.</P>
      <P>Related issues emerged in the course of the investigation and, instead of dealing with those by way of further investigation and a further report, there was an onus to undertake the investigation immediately so that the report would be as comprehensive as possible.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference include the appropriate numbers and grading of personnel to carry out tasks assigned; a most effective management structure, taking particular account of the overall organisation of the Permanent Defence Forces and the need for close liaison with public and private sector organisations; appropriate systems of financial control, delegation and accountability; the optimum procurement and maintenance systems including store stock ordering; opportunities for civilianisation and-or contracting out; the development of appropriate operational cost benefit matrices and performance indicators for the medium or longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specific to the Naval Service the consultants were asked to make recommendations on the required balance of resources as ship and shore operations demand and activities to maximise the availability of sea-going personnel to optimise sea time for service vessels.  In regard to the Air <Col N="77" /> Corps the consultants were asked to make recommendations on the following issues: the role and necessity for each element of the Air Corps fleet, together with the number, composition and deployment of associated personnel, and the training strategy and facilities necessary to meet requirements, in particular the extent to which aspects in regard to training should be undertaken by outside agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will he agree the report to examine the adaptations for the Defence Forces in the future has been put on the back burner by the Government? Will he accept the delay is to avoid bringing out the report before the general election?  I understand it has been ready, or at least almost complete, for some time.  While a constitutional review group reported in six months, a report of this nature, which was obvious from the outset and which could have been published in three months, has taken more than 12 months.  Will the Minister agree that creates great problems in terms of morale for the Air Corps, in that people may want to be released and there is uncertainty about their future, and for the Naval Service? Since we will not see the report before the election, will he ensure that the personnel difficulties in the Naval Service and the Air Corps are addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's reference to <Col N="78" /> the election, the Government has seven months to run.  There is no indication that the delay in producing the report affects morale in the Naval Service or the Air Corps.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware from his experience in Government, very often in the course of investigations and reviews various issues are unearthed which lead to the need for further investigation.  In the course of the Price Waterhouse investigation, other issues were unearthed and these are being examined in detail. It is anticipated the final report will be available at the very latest before the end of the summer and, I am confident, well in advance of the next general election.</P>

      <P>The Western Development Commission has been appointed to promote the economic and social development of the region.  It will add value and focus to the activities of State agencies and local development organisations in the region.  It will encourage enterprise and job creation.  The Western Investment Fund will provide the necessary long-term venture capital and equity for developing businesses in the western region.  It is too early at this stage to say precisely what projects will receive aid from the fund.  The Government is making available from the Exchequer up to £25 million over six years as matching funds.  The commission will be provided with the necessary resources for promotion and management.</P>

I have met Iarnród Éireann's former chief executive, Mr. Waters, and the newly appointed chief executive, Mr. Maher and we discussed the matter of western railways and the western corridor. Like Deputy Kitt &mdash; I acknowledge his support for this matter &mdash; I am anxious that the freight line between Limerick and Claremorris will be brought up to a proper standard and it will be fully utilised.  Mr. Maher and his management team are examining a venture capital project that may be put to the Western Development Commission for assessment.  I encouraged them to examine all the details and they said they would return to me quickly on the matter.  I have not received a reply but I expect it soon.</P>

I asked them to put particular emphasis on the use of the educational facilities in the west, particularly at third level.  I had in mind industrial parks of the nature of Plassey Park in Limerick and proposed that, together with the Western Development Commission, they consider industrial development parks for Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar, Athlone, Galway and Limerick.  We hope to hold meetings with the management of regional technical colleges in the near future with a view to promoting this idea.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national network arrangements under the Leader II programme are being co-financed by the European Commission on the basis of 75 per cent EU and 25 per cent Exchequer contribution rates. The European Commission insisted, at the outset, that the contract for the administration of the national network would be awarded on the basis of an open competitive tendering procedure.</P>
      <P>The procedures for the award of public service tenders are laid down in Council Directive 92/50/EEC of 18 June 1992.  These procedures were followed in every respect by my Department and included publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 9 August 1996 of the notice of the invitation to tender; the preparation of a detailed brief for organisations to administer the network &mdash; this document was issued to more than 30 bodies and individuals who indicated an interest in the tender &mdash; convening an information session in my Department's offices on 4 September 1996 to further brief and respond to questions from interested parties &mdash; this session was open to all those who had requested copies of the brief and was attended by 13 people representing various interested bodies.</P>
      <P>Following these arrangements, seven bids were submitted to my Department on or before the closing date of 20 September 1996.  These were subject to rigorous evaluation and assessment based on objective criteria.  The evaluation procedure included requests to four of the tenderers to make formal presentations to my Department on their submissions and subsequent formal discussion with three of those tenderers.  The Department's recommendation on the award of the contract was submitted to the Government Contracts Committee, a body which is independent of my Department.  The Department's recommendation was ratified by that committee. My Department maintained close contact with the European Commission throughout the process I have described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> While the tender recommended and selected was not the lowest tender received, it was the lowest priced of the three tender bids considered most suitable.  The successful tender was selected on the basis of being the most economically advantageous having regard to the terms and conditions contained in the brief and the service to be delivered.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that proper procedures were followed at all times, that the tenders were examined in a thorough and objective manner and that the correct decision was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>To date we have not published the value of each bid, but I can submit that information to the Deputy at a later stage.  However, I can outline the bids without naming those who tendered.  In descending order, the bids were £1,780,000, £819,000, £816,000, £760,000, £670,000, £596,000 and £351,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fourth lowest.  It was the lowest of the tenders considered acceptable under the criteria outlined.  The evaluation and assessment process was carried out over a period of time and involved close scrutiny by officials from my Department whom I hold in high regard. They worked with the Deputy when he was Minister. I accept their credibility in this matter.  The Minister and I kept at arm's length from the procedure and accepted their final decision on the grounds that the tender complied with EU procedures and was accepted by the Government Contracts Committee.  I stand over the procedures employed in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is grave concern about this matter.  The Minister of State knows that the Leader network, Comhar, and ICOS submitted tenders.  Three tenders were lower than the successful one.  Of the seven tenders, three were sent to the Government Contracts Committee.  On what basis was the third lowest tender accepted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department undertook thorough and detailed analysis of the tenders submitted on the basis of the quality of the bids received, the skills, expertise and knowledge of rural development and Leader matters of the tenderers and the price and value for money of the tender by reference to the service being sought. The Department's view was that Farrell Grant Sparks was the most suitable and economically advantageous of the bids submitted.  Lower tenders were not considered acceptable because of their failure to comply with the terms of the tender, poor quality of submissions or failure to demonstrate that the tenderer had a good understanding of the requirements or an ability to deliver the service required.  Farrell Grant Sparks was selected on the basis of the quality of the <Col N="83" /> tender submitted, the expertise available to the company, its capacity to deliver and the cost of its proposals.</P>
      <P>In addition to its administrative competence, the company engaged, as part of the team which will deliver the networking arrangements, Dr. Andy Conway, an acknowledged expert on rural development who has wide experience and knowledge of Leader and other programmes and policies relating to Network and rural development. The company has also engaged an IT consultant as part of the team.  It was selected on the basis of its competence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the disquiet is that a Dublin city centre firm got this tender.  How it could have knowledge of Leader and a rural development programme is beyond me?  Will the Minister confirm that a partner in the company is a programme manager with the Labour Party?  Is this not a cosy cartel where a Labour Party programme manager, Mr. Sparks, was fixed up with a tender?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order to mention names.  If the Deputy wishes to make an accusation against someone outside the House, he should do so in a more responsible manner and table a motion, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The leaders of Network said they will refer this matter to the Ombudsman and if I do not get a satisfactory answer, I will refer this matter to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that Dr. Andy Conway is an acknowledged expert on rural development and I have absolute confidence that he and those working with him will deliver the service required.  It is outrageous and unworthy of the Deputy to suggest there was any political motivation behind this decision which was left to officials in my Department.  The Minister and I kept at arm' length and accepted the final proposal.  There was no suggestion of political involvement in this decision.</P>

      <Quest>whether he will provide pound for pound from Exchequer funds to match the EU aid in respect of the recent green pound revaluations as provided for in EU regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Council of Ministers' meeting on 17-19 March I secured agreement to the payment in 1997 of EU funded compensatory aid of some £45.77 million to producers in the milk, beef, cereals and sugar sectors.  EU funded compensation of approximately £30.5 million will be <Col N="84" /> available in 1998 and approximately £15.3 million in 1999.  This compensation is for income losses suffered by producers as a result of price support cuts following the green rate revaluations of 8 November last and 11 January this year.</P>
      <P>I am planning for the payment of this compensation to producers in May.  The green rate applicable to the CAP reform premiums, including payments under the accompanying measures, was not affected by either of these green rate revaluations.  Farmers will, therefore, receive the same amounts in Irish pounds this year as last year by way of such payments.  At this stage there are no proposals to supplement the EU compensation from Exchequer funds.</P>
      <P>I am monitoring the situation carefully as we face the prospect of a further revaluation on 28 March.  I will discuss with my Cabinet colleagues what would be appropriate <i>vis-á-vis</i> matching funds as we monitor agricultural prices generally. My mind is not closed on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept he gave an undertaking to the IFA at a meeting in a Dublin hotel in early February that he would match pound for pound EU compensation for revaluation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I state categorically that I have never been in a position to give such an undertaking and am unaware the IFA holds such a view.  I am monitoring other member states which also have the opportunity to put up matching money, but which have not done so.  To date, seven other member states, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and Luxembourg have qualified for similar aid.  Of these countries, only Germany and Luxembourg paid the full amount of national funds while Belgium only paid it for beef.  I understand in the current revaluation, the UK will certainly not do so and Italy's position is unclear.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to preserve farm incomes and pleased we got a change in the rules at this Brussels meeting whereby instead of this money being paid after 1 August &mdash; no electoral significance should be read into this &mdash; a time when the Department and Brussels are quiet, farmers will receive the £77 million in May.  With BSE compensation, it ensures the cash flow needs of farmers will be met.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy raised the question of my deportment because a Sunday newspaper article was brought to my attention on Monday.  The author of the article did not contact me and was not present in Brussels and the report was fallacious.  I found it faintly amusing but I was <Col N="85" /> as astonished as others as regards the contents of the article.  I confirm it was utterly untrue, however amusing.</P>
      <P>As regards my comments on 19 March, if there is a further revaluation and full matching moneys, the requirement on the Exchequer this year could be in excess of £70 million.  Because of the time of the budget and the Estimates, no provision was made.  In addition to that, because this is the year of the Maastricht criteria <i>vis-à-vis</i> the public finances and because of the nurses' and hepatitis C awards which must be met, there has been no positive response to my representations to date from the Minister for Finance.  If, however, there is a further revaluation, I will consider raising this question again with the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach and will be sympathetic to sponsoring such a case.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say the Government has taken a final decision on this matter or that money is being provided at this time.  The package of £122 million which I put together is one of the largest cumulative packages of compensation and that money will be winging its way to farmers from 12 May.</P>

      <P>As regards the meeting at which a portion of this money was allocated, the Minister's information officer was quoted on his prowess at genuflection and bear hugging.  There was a graphic description of him pleading for money to buy farmers' votes ahead of a general election. The fact remains that it is a concession to EU member states to match this pound for pound. The Minister indicated he will consult his Cabinet colleagues and has made this known to the farming organisations.  He stated it would cost too much for the Exchequer.  Is there anything in this for the farming community which has lost £120 per head in livestock and 25 per cent in dairy incomes?</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a formal complaint to the fraud squad of the Garda Síochána regarding the Bureau Veritas certificates which purported to show the import of Irish beef into Iraq; and if not, the reason therefor.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8632/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be referring to the apparent addition of dates of shipment on some Bureau Veritas certificates.  These dates were cross-checked and verified against certification provided directly to the Department by Irish customs officials present at the ports.  Furthermore, the commercial transport documentation was examined for each shipment. None of the export details was misrepresented.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence to suggest the beef concerned did not enter Iraq.  No disallowance of refund has been imposed by the European Commission on foot of these particular certificates relating to 1988.  I have no basis for a complaint to the Garda Síochána.  However, if the Deputy has information which he believes is relevant to this issue, I will arrange to have it examined immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to hear the Minister say there is no evidence of any incorrect statement of amounts exported.  On 2 February 1993 at the beef tribunal, Monsieur C. Peron gave evidence in the course of which evidence given the previous week by Mr. McGill from the Irish customs was put to him.  He agreed that a tonnage of 855 tonnes shown on a Bureau Veritas certificate as having been imported to Iraq was shown in the documentation of the Irish customs as being 604 tonnes when it was exported.  An additional 251 tonnes mysteriously appeared in the meantime.  The adequate payments were no doubt made on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the Minister's extraordinary statement that he has no evidence this beef ended up anywhere other than Iraq, I refer him to the evidence of the Secretary and accounting officer of his Department who told me in the Committee of Public Accounts a fortnight ago that, among other places where the beef, purportedly exported to Iraq, ended up were Poland, Romania, Gabon, Lebanon and the Canary Islands.  Is he aware that some of this beef, of which he says he has no evidence it did not arrive in Iraq, is still <Col N="87" /> in the Canary Islands where police are investigating it and where some strange activities seem to have been engaged in as a result of it?  Since the premise on which he bases his reply that he refuses to report this or complain to the Garda about it is patently wrong, will he reconsider and report it to the Garda?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of the beef on the Canary Islands, the export refund for that has not been finalised and is under investigation and I answer that in detail in Question No. 21 on today's Order Paper.  The answer I gave was based on the assumption that the Deputy requested at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts to see the Bureau Veritas certificates relating to export refunds for 1988.  The Bureau Veritas was responsible in this case for confirming the import of the beef to Iraq.  We make advance payments from export declarations sent to us by the customs and excise staff, not from Bureau Veritas certificates.  Even if the dates were wrong or altered on the Bureau Veritas certificate in this case, it would be the export declaration, not the certificate, which was the basis on which the payments were made.  The answer I gave relates to the £2.29 million disallowance in 1988.  That was not a total disallowance but a disallowance of 10 per cent as there was £32 million in that year.</P>
      <P>Any evidence given at the beef tribunal has already been referred to various authorities.  If the Deputy has further information unavailable to me &mdash; I do not deal with these files on a day-to-day basis &mdash; or if he has a credible third party who has such information which suggests that this beef might not have gone to Iraq or that there might be questions relating to the volume of consignments, I am only too anxious to ensure the truth is revealed and that any information he has is be assessed by the proper authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only too anxious also but I am sure I have no information which is not already available to senior officials in the Minister's Department.  I cannot accept his efforts to distance himself from those officials and say he knows nothing about it because the information is available in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My question is not confined to 1988 or 1989 but relates to all Bureau Veritas certificates.  As a further example of how these Bureau Veritas certificates were altered, defaced or had information superimposed on them, to use his Department's phrase, I refer him to certificate No. 1093 where it is certified by the Irish Ambassador in Baghdad as having been signed by T. Gurney when that person did not sign it and where the covering letter says that the particular stamp is attached to it when it is not.  Can he explain why certificate No. 1093 is dated as 31 October 1988 and the certificate beside it for the same sailing, No. 1092, is dated 31 August?  Is he aware the accounting officer of his Department told me the <Col N="88" /> Department could easily have changed the dates if they had to make them correspond with those on shipping documents?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was raised by Deputy O'Malley in relation to one certificate, No. 1093, the signature to which had been authenticated by the Irish Ambassador to Iraq.  It was not signed by T. Gurney but by C. Peron on behalf of T. Gurney.  I advise the House that this certificate was one out of 20 presented at the same time to the Ambassador.  All the others contained T. Gurney's signature.  Mr. C. Peron is a senior Bureau Veritas employee in Paris known to this Department.  We are satisfied the certificate in question is genuine.</P>
      <P>The question of the advance payment is not triggered by the date on the Bureau Veritas certificate but by the date of the export declaration sent to us by the customs and excise staff.  I am advised that if someone were perpetrating a fraud, customs and excise officials would also have to produce fraudulent material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why people went to so much trouble to change the Bureau Veritas certificates if there was no money to be made out of them?  Why does he still insist on his assertion that he has no evidence that none of this beef went anywhere other than Iraq when I referred to five countries to which it went?  How does he reconcile his statement about the authenticity of the certificates signed by Mr. Peron, and allegedly witnessed by the Irish Ambassador in Baghdad, when Mr. Peron gave evidence again on 2 February 1993 under oath to the tribunal and said that the stamp of the Irish embassy in Baghdad, which was on the documents he was shown, was the first time he had seen it and it was obviously put on afterwards?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these questions which I am not trying to evade enter into a realm of detail.  If the Deputy is alleging this beef, based on the Bureau Veritas certificates, did not end up in Iraq, I am extremely interested in pursuing that. Any evidence he can procure to that effect will be investigated by me.  I spoke to the principal officer and the assistant principal officer in that division today to obtain as much information as possible for the Deputy.  Those officers assure me they can give detailed answers.  I do not want to go into the details of the files, but they said forfeitures occurred where they believed there was any impropriety.  They closed the files with UCLAF and others on these issues and as this is EU money the public administration of this matter has been dealt with.  If new information comes to light from a credible witness, we will be very interested in pursuing it.  We will take each issue, file and certificate and analyse it fairly.  The records of my Department can be made available to the Deputy for further inspection, if that would be of assistance in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and I am grateful to the Chair.  I put it to the Minister that he was incorrect in saying the files are all closed on this matter.  UCLAF is investigating matters of which it was not previously aware.  Under regulation 3665/87 the Minister has an obligation to recover all sums unduly paid and, to use the phrase of that regulation, there are sums unduly paid.  The Minister has an obligation to recover them, but he has made no attempt to do so.  He was also wrong in saying all the files are closed because the Government withheld its consent to the release of £7 million in securities and that sum is still the subject of investigation from a fraud point of view by various authorities here and in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the files that are closed and those that are open, it is the case that as Minister I authorised the release and the largest forfeiture ever in relation to many of these papers. There was a residual file of about £6 million which is still under investigation and, pending that consideration, those guarantees have not been released.  Regarding the points raised at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, they related to export refunds in 1988 and 1989. I am informed by my officials that UCLAF completed its investigation of those files and it is in that regard I referred to them as being closed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 13, 19, 33, 43, 46, 50, 54, 75 and 218 together. Since the introduction of the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (Specified Risk Material) Order 1977 on 21 February it is a requirement that specified livestock offal, which is mainly the skulls and spinal cords of cattle and sheep over one year old will be separately collected, treated, transported, processed in a dedicated rendering plant and disposed of outside the <Col N="91" /> animal feed chain.  The order, which is part of our BSE eradication plan, has implications for the livestock industry, including meat processors and additional costs arise as a result.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured to ensure the disposal costs at the dedicated rendering plant are kept at a minimum.  Consequently I do not believe the disposal costs which are now being applied are such as to warrant the imposition of a special levy and, in any event, should be seen in the context of protecting the overall viability of a very valuable industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As the cattle and beef industry has experienced great difficulties this year and this problem is an additional cost, will the Minister consider reducing or seeking to have reduced the levy imposed by factories on the price of cattle which reduces the price of cattle to farmers? Will the Minister take some steps to ameliorate this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of financial assistance and the £3 per head levy concerns me greatly. There was no choice but to put in place a specified risk material ban because we were not able to export.  We introduced a ban on exports of meat and bonemeal unless SRM was taken out of it.  It was essential for our beef industry, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EU Commission and the SVC that this be done and we volunteered it as part of our eradication plan.  This is a permanent sea change in the rendering industry.  EU financial assistance is not available.  We sought it, but it has been ruled out. We have a dedicated plant at Monery in County Cavan exclusively dealing with specified risk material.  There have been teething problems in distribution and so on.  My officials and I are working actively with the abattoirs, the knackeries and the beef industry to try to get a workable solution.  Further to the progress we have made in these talks, I understand the cost of taking in specified risk material has been substantially reduced from £350 per tonne to a fraction of that figure.  That makes this £3 levy no longer necessary. I appeal to the Irish meat industry to drop this levy.  I see no justification for it and I believe the concessions we obtained in reducing the charges being imposed by Monery on the meat processors can justify waiving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>What implications are there for the storage of specified risk material?  The county manager in Cavan requires planning permission for its storage.  Is the Minister concerned about the number of fallen animals which are left on farms because of the cost of disposal?  Where is this material stored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The rendered product from the specified material is being stored separately pending arrangements for its final disposal by the firm involved in the dedicated plant in County Cavan.  No definitive decisions have yet been <Col N="92" /> taken on disposal.  I am aware that the Cavan county manager, as the local planning authority, has been in contact with the plant concerned. Additional costs will arise from the processing plants in regard to specified offal but I do not believe that these costs are such as to require the imposition of a special levy.  In any case these costs have been seen in the context of the overall industry.</P>
      <P>As regards the disposal of dead farm animals, the plant concerned is accepting animals at £30 per tonne for specified material.  I have asked the plant to look at ways in which the transportation costs of delivering material can be reduced.  I am prepared to look at further ideas as to how the efficiency of collection and disposal of fallen animals can be improved.  Under the European Community regulations, knackeries are required to be licensed by my Department.  No licences have been revoked by my Department in the Louth area.</P>
      <P>Considerable consideration has been given to the question of disposing of animal waste.  An interdepartmental committee which was set up by the Government last August examined all options.  The committee forwarded an interim report to the Government in October and an updated report in December.  Those reports were of assistance to the Government in determining its policy on the issue.  However, it is not my intention to publish those reports and this matter is being kept under continuing review.</P>

      <P>The Minister is correct in saying that the £350 per tonne imposed by the Cavan firm has been significantly reduced to £220 per tonne.  However, the corresponding figure in the UK is £80 per tonne.  Last month the Minister announced grants for renderers amounting to £6 million to enable them to deal with this problem. Can he make the payment of those grants conditional on the abolition of the levy?  He said that he does not believe the levy is justified.  If this is so can he withhold the payment of the grants to ensure that it is removed?</P>

      <P>There are two issues involved.  First is the specified risk material.  Second is the EU directive whereby each member state, from 1 April, must heat treat all manufactured meat and bone meal to 133 degrees centigrade for 20 minutes at 3 bar pressure.  None of Ireland's nine rendering plants can carry out this heat treatment and, therefore, they have to be modernised to bring them up to this standard.  That will cost £12 million of which we are giving grant aid of £4.7 &mdash; £4.8 million.</P>
      <P>The levy is being imposed by meat factories who buy cattle from farmers who are being charged £220 per tonne for SRM.  It is not being charged by the renderers.  The £220 per tonne is only being charged by Monery By-Products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a common ownership of both and that is why we have been involved in discussions.  The SRM only arises in one dedicated rendering plant.  The Deputy has spoken of the £220 charged in Ireland as opposed to £80 in the UK.  I will pursue this point.  There are economies of scale.  We might consider a second dedicated plant to introduce competition.  These discussions are ongoing but there is a transition period while the new procedures come into effect. I am concerned about this and my objective is to ensure that no levy is imposed.  Farmers are not prepared to slaughter their cattle if a levy is being charged.  There is an interim market factor occurring in relation to the supply and delivery of cattle to meat processing plants.  I will call on the Irish meat industry to remove this levy on the basis of the reduction in the SRM charge from £350 per tonne to £220 per tonne.  This is a substantial reason to waive the levy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans to grant a licence for a dedicated plant in the southern part of the country in view of substantial transport costs involved for people in that area? This would provide competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had an application from Cashel, County Tipperary, from a renderer who wishes to establish a dedicated plant.  I am considering this application.  The difficulty is that we produce approximately 100,000 tonnes of meat and bone meal every year which is rendered from offal.  The SRM is only a small fraction of this produce.  Therefore, it would not be adequate to sustain an entire dedicated plant.  The question of capacity and economy of scale must be balanced against transport costs and competition.  I will keep this under active review.</P>
      <P>I wish to see the Monery plant up and running with an adequate throughput without imposing a levy so that the knackers can operate. This partly involves the introduction of a transport network.  This is easier said than done but that is my focus of attention.  All of these measures will have to be based on commercial criteria.  We will do what we can to aid its development in the early stages.  However, the fallout of these changes whereby meat and bone meal excludes specified offals is a permanent change arising from concerns about food safety. Every state will have to accept this.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are approximately 200,000 fallen animals every year?  Heretofore the knackers yards or kennels took the animals from the farm.  Many of the Minister's and my constituents want to know what will happen to these animals.  Will they have to be transported to County Cavan?  Are the beagles in the kennels going to be fed Pedigree Chum?  Some farmers live 250 miles away from <Col N="94" /> County Cavan.  What about their position?  In the past we have seen animals left on the roadside, on beaches and in rivers.  Will the Minister's new proposals bring about a repetition of this, creating environmental and health hazards?  Has he considered the fate of the 200,000 fallen animals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been concerned about the knackeries.  This is why we negotiated the £220 per tonne charged by Monery for ordinary skulls, spleen and SRM.  This is only £30 per tonne in the case of the knackers.  This is a non-commercial rate which, in effect, is being subsidised.  We have met the Association of Animal Collectors but there is no representative body for the knackery industry.  There are almost 100 knackeries.  It is a disparate and unregulated group.  We have received applications from 40 of these knackeries and they will have to be regulated.</P>
      <P>They will have to be licensed and put on a proper footing.  I foresee them having the throughput of scale to justify their putting a distribution network in place.  I have many details on the different categories and so on.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to sanction a transport subsidy for these fallen animals &mdash; that would be a Pandora's box of endless liability for the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>It is not permissible for farmers or anybody else to leave dead carcases lying around, it is a danger from an animal health point of view and illegal.  Through local authorities we will come down very rigorously on people who throw dead animals in rivers and so on whenever we have evidence of that practice.  As a former farmer I often dug holes and buried animals, a facility available to farmers if they do not wish to use the local knackery.</P>

Perhaps it is opportune to reassure him that I am and that I and my family are dependent on farming for our livelihood.  Like everybody else, I would much prefer not to have any mortality rate but this disease has presented an unfortunate hazard.  Heretofore farmers had the option of having dead animals removed by kennels, a fantastic service, on the day they died. In present circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <QRef>[8660/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>While a small number of third countries have imposed restrictions on the import of cattle and beef from Ireland, we are trading normally on a wide range of international markets. Strenuous efforts are being made to have these restrictions lifted and the current position can be summarised as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Russia is by far the biggest third country market for Irish beef.  This trade is covered by a veterinary protocol concluded in November last which, <i>inter alia,</i> categorises counties according to their level of BSE.  Currently meat derived from cattle from eight counties is excluded from this trade.  While this is a serious development, trade is continuing from the <Col N="97" /> other counties.  We do not envisage difficulties in meeting the likely level of demand from Russia. Some 16,000 tonnes of beef have been shipped to date in 1997 and a figure in excess of 100,000 tonnes is forecast for the full year.  It is envisaged that further discussions will take place with the Russian authorities next May.  The Russian interests have signalled their commitment in the long term to trade in beef from Ireland.</P>
    <P>Egypt is Ireland's largest third country market for live cattle and our second largest third country market for beef.  Imports of live cattle from Ireland were banned in January 1997 for a six months period.  At the same time, new veterinary requirements were introduced in respect of beef. I am glad that agreement was reached with the Egyptian authorities last week on a revised veterinary certificate to accompany beef exports to Egypt, thus ensuring the continuation of that trade.  I am continuing my efforts to have the live cattle market reopened.  An Egyptian veterinary delegation has been here.  The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and I all have had conversations with and made representations to Cairo, and contact is being maintained.</P>
    <P>In relation to Libya, I am glad to report further progress, since Libya always has been an important outlet for live cattle from Ireland.  In March 1996 a ban was imposed on Irish imports. As is known, I travelled to Tripoli last year and a technical delegation from Libya is now here to observe our controls.  I will meet this delegation tomorrow morning and will impress on them the high quality and safety of Irish cattle.</P>
    <P>The Iranian market has always been volatile but, in the past, has taken considerable amounts of Irish beef.  A veterinary delegation from Iran visited Ireland last autumn.  I am organising a follow-up technical mission to Iran in coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Restrictions on Irish beef have also been imposed by the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and Turkey.  As regards the United Arab Emirates, the authorities there have now agreed to lift their restrictions, formal confirmation of which I expect to receive later in the week.  I also understand that the restrictions applied by Qatar will be lifted in coming days.</P>
    <P>I will continue to pursue remaining restrictions on Irish beef with the relevant authorities of the countries concerned.  Given the nature of the BSE-related difficulties, I believe our beef export trade has achieved a good performance in third countries over the past year.  The number of BSE cases in March is five.  This is a significant development given there were about 11 cases of BSE in November and December, nine cases in subsequent months and five in March.  Given that all our difficulties have related to the incidence of BSE and the increase in 1996 over 1995 this is the first indication of hope that the situation is coming back into line and a further vindication of the eradication measures I have put in place.</P>

What precise measures will the Minister take and can he give a commitment to farmers that he will visit the capitals of those countries?  Cattle are down £120 per head and the Minister sits there and says a delegation is coming and soon everything will be OK.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will issue a missive from Tralee to announce a similar message.  Nothing is happening. Will the Minister give a commitment to embark on a visitation of those capitals to open up those markets and give confidence to farmers heading into the summer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be uniquely aware that when we had no cases of BSE in 1990, Ireland was banned from many of those North African countries and related countries for three years.  During his tenure and that of Mr. O'Kennedy, nine out of every ten steers in 1989 and 1990 were sold into intervention.  We have succeeded in much worse circumstances where we have had over 200 cases of BSE in Ireland and have kept the show on the road with real markets. On the specific question of visiting countries, I have already been to Libya and Russia.  I had been advised not to visit Egypt while the certification issue was taking place &mdash; it related to cuts of meat close to the spine, and has been sorted out &mdash; but the optimum time would be during a major trade fair in Egypt on 8 and 9 May.  If my diary permits me to go at that time I will give it active consideration.  In the discussions I have had with officials in Cairo, they were not in a position to reverse the decision immediately.  May would be the most appropriate time for a visit.  In all of these matters I rely on the best diplomatic advice, the best trade and technical advice from the live shippers, our Embassy in Cairo and so on as to the best time for a trip.  Deputy Walsh, as a former Minister, would take advice as to the most timely and effective purpose of a visit, rather than run around like a headless chicken visiting every capital in the world.  This must be done in a measured, timely and strategic way and when I am advised it is appropriate I will be happy to lend my weight to all the diplomatic, technical and political efforts already under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the likely effect the additional cut in export refunds will have on efforts to re-establish these markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. Obviously I am concerned about the competitiveness of Irish and European beef against Australian and South American customers.  The <Col N="99" /> decision of the Commission yesterday to cut export refunds by 7.5 per cent was unjustified notwithstanding the heavy prefixations this week and last, some of which is related to currency speculation.  I will be redoubling my efforts to have that 7.5 per cent cut reversed.  Long before BSE and the statement of 20 March 1996 there were cuts in refunds in late 1995, all of which is connected with the management of the GATT quota.  The Deputy will be aware of this since he negotiated the GATT quota while Mr. MacSharry was Agriculture Commissioner.  We had to reduce the volume and value of exportable beef to third countries with export refunds by 21 per cent and 36 per cent respectively.  The cuts in the refunds are designed to keep us in that volume quota.  Each GATT year begins on 1 July and ends at 30 June.  We are over quota for this GATT year.  All the problems with refunds are directly related to the Commission's independent powers to monitor the quota.  I am concerned about that issue and that we maintain our competitive position by providing the cheapest meat to those markets.</P>

The checks have also been made mobile.  This makes sense.  Who would drive to a fixed Garda checkpoint with an illegal consignment of animals?  Based on intelligence and cover right around the Border I am advised the system now in place is as effective.  I rely on the Garda and Army authorities and I am advised the system in place effectively polices the Border and preserves the integrity of our animal health status and delineates us from Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Since most of this question relates to the level of live trade, will the Minister state unequivocally that he fully supports the live trade?  Will the Minister inform the House that no Minister or Minister of State has made a statement, inside or outside the House, against the live trade since that made by Deputy Joe Walsh when Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, deploring the high level of live trade in 1993?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy on the live trade is as follows.  It is essential, given that we produce the equivalent of 550,000 tonnes of beef and consume about 50,000 tonnes, that there be adequate competition between all segments of potential buyers of cattle, weanlings and adult animals, within Europe for live exports to third countries but we <Col N="100" /> must get a balance.  Obviously we want the maximum added value.  Some element of competition is vital.  History has shown that in the 1970s and 1980s where the meat factories have a cartel, a monopoly and are the sole purchaser, they use that strategic strength against farmers.  That is the reason I put in place the credible long-term rules in relation to the condition and duration of animal welfare conditions.  We have run into a temporary difficulty with BSE but I expect it will be overcome as the number of cases diminish.  Some of the plainer animals &mdash; the dairy breeds of male cattle and so on &mdash; are more suitable to the live trade.  Since they do not slaughter that well, there is a strategic need for them to be exported live.</P>

      <P>The figure increased in 1995.  In 1996 a number of factors, not least the reduction in refunds, changed the situation.  The particular difficulty with the live trade is that what we are doing with the specified risk material, by removing certain offals, obviously cannot be done with live animals.  That is a problem.  In Egypt, for example, people eat the animals' brains.  Eating those offals is banned in this country.  I have offered to make the sophistication of our industry publicised in Egypt and we are working with Dr. Ali Moussa and the other chief veterinarians to have the trade restored as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I will make a few points in the midst of the crossfire.  Some Deputies wish to highlight the live export figures for 1994 and 1995.  In 1990 and 1991 there were no live exports.  We can all pick a year to find statistics to suit us.</P>
      <P>We have a serious problem with Egypt.  It requires urgent action and I am in constant touch with our ambassador about an appropriate follow-up. We have received the report submitted by the senior technical people from Egypt who visited this country.  They saw all facets of our industry and we have just resolved the beef issue. It became more difficult than was anticipated.  At an appropriate time I hope to visit Cairo to seek the lifting of the ban.  It is a six-month ban and the earliest time it can be reviewed is in May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Walsh has referred to a £120 reduction in the price of cattle.  Notwithstanding the difficult <Col N="102" /> BSE situation, the part played by CAP reform in the beef sector should be remembered.  In 1991 the price of beef was £101 and the premium was 4p per pound.  The Commission can confirm to Deputy Walsh that it was agreed that the value of the premium be increased from 4p to 25p per pound on the basis that prices would decrease by about 15p per pound.  Even if the BSE problem had not occurred, cattle prices would have decreased.  We have had an exceptional difficulty. However, CAP reform, through lowering product prices to provide direct income aid, was not something I negotiated but something I have had to endure in my period as Minister.</P>

      <P>The introduction of tax incentive schemes is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural development policy advisory group, which I established to advise on the formulation of future policy for rural development, will include in its report a recommendation that private investment in enterprise development in rural areas should be offered special tax reliefs for capital investment and profits.  The report of the group will be examined by the Department in the context of the preparation of a strategy for rural development, for which I will seek Government <Col N="103" /> approval.  I will discuss the various elements of the strategy with appropriate Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In this year's budget there was a tax concession for the control of farmyard pollution. I support that and I urge the Minister of State to continue his representations to the Minister for Finance to extend that concession and to extend incentives which are available in urban areas and in towns, under the resort towns scheme.  This offers an opportunity to enhance the rural development programme.  Can the Minister of State say if we can look forward to such a development, particularly during the month of May?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft report recognises the problem posed by the outflow of savings from rural areas and the absence of adequate mechanisms to channel local funds into local investments. Large amounts of money are being spent in tax shelters in urban areas, which represents an outflow of capital from rural areas.  If tax incentives were provided in rural areas it is possible that those funds would remain in those areas.</P>
      <P>The report suggests that a level of positive discrimination in terms of tax breaks and grants in favour of people investing in rural areas should be considered, particularly offering special tax reliefs for capital investment and on profits linked to enterprise development in rural areas and tax incentives to support rural renewal schemes in towns and villages mentioned in the report.  The group has been meeting for the past 18 months and has made numerous proposals for the renewal of rural areas.  I am supportive of these proposals.  I will make a strong case to Government to accept them and I am sure it will be receptive.  There is a final consultative conference on 15 April where the report will be finalised and presented to Government immediately.  I hope the report will be accepted with all its recommendations as it should be the forerunner to a Government White Paper on rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that one of the best ways to prevent rural decay and help rural renewal is to stop planting large tracts of land for forestry purposes where local smallholders wish to buy such land to make their own holdings viable?  Does the Minister of State or the Government propose to regulate the sale of land, particularly as regards the change of land use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons forestry has been so popular in rural areas is because it is tax driven.  The Minister has made it clear in public statements and in his strategy that the incentives for forestry are directed at the farming population. We want to see forestry as part of the cash <Col N="104" /> crop of farmers who use marginal land to plant and see it as part of their everyday income.  That is the philosophy behind our forestry plan.  In those circumstances, forestry can be productive for the rural population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the unpopularity of forestry in many locations where people are deprived of the opportunity to make their holding viable and where large tracts of forestry are planted in front of private dwellings.  It should be possible to eliminate such activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of course aware of objections to forestry throughout the country. However, in the strategy launched by the Minister some months ago, we showed our sensitivity to rural dwellers by ensuring that forestry will have to be removed to an acceptable distance from private dwellings.  Overall, a much tighter forestry regime than previously is in operation. This is due to the Minister's commitment to bringing forward a policy document and a new regime for the forestry sector.  Some of the Deputy's concerns have been expressed by those living in rural areas.  Nevertheless, I think we can achieve a balance between forestry and those living in rural areas.  Forestry is an attractive alternative to mainstream farming provided more farmers take it up and the grants available are attractive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>What arrangements are in place to ensure there is harmony and compatibility between the Leader programme, the towns and villages development programme and peace and reconciliation funding in the Border counties? There is a view that many of these schemes are not in harmony with one another.  As a result, the sustainability of some of the developments may be in question in the future.  Is the Minister sure there will be tangible evidence in five years' time that investment was made under these schemes in 1996 or 1997?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A serious effort is being made to co-ordinate the various schemes.  We are setting up a working group to supervise them and to ensure their effectiveness.  These initiatives have already begun to impact on rural areas and I am confident they will do so in the years ahead. There are strategies in place and we have focused on the problems of rural areas.  There are also programmes to implement those strategies.  I am confident major progress will be made in rural areas and that identifiable projects will yield employment and give life to rural areas in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>There has been a delay in issuing area aid application forms for 1997.  The issue of application forms, with a helpsheet and terms and conditions to farmers who have previously submitted an area aid application, will commence this week and is expected to be completed by the end of next week.  This is in line with the situation in 1996.  To facilitate completion of area aid applications by those farmers, their forms are pre-printed with personalised details including details of land parcels previously declared by them. Maps to facilitate the completion of the 1997 application are currently issuing to those farmers who submitted maps previously and this issue is expected to be completed by 5 April.  Non-personalised area aid application forms for new applicants will be available from local offices of my Department and from Teagasc offices from the beginning of next week.</P>

      <P>Details of prosecutions relating to illegal growth promoters which have been dealt with by the courts in the period 1992 to 1997 are set out in the following statement.</P>
      <P>The penalties for use of illegal growth promoters which are laid down in the Animal Remedies Act, 1993, are as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash; on summary conviction, a fine of up to £1,000 or imprisonment for up to 12 months or both;</P>
      <P>&mdash; on conviction on indictment, a fine of up to £100,000 (or, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, £250,000) or imprisonment for up to ten years, or both. </P>
      <P>Under the legislation the courts may also ban a person who has been convicted, on indictment, from keeping animals, animal remedies or being engaged in the production of food for human or animal consumption.  The duration of such a ban is at the discretion of the court and may be for life.  In addition, a court may order the forfeiture of an animal or animal remedy to which an offence relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> I should add that since 1 July 1996 where an illegal growth promoter is found on a farmer's premises or where residues of growth promoting substances are found in an animal, the farmer is deemed ineligible for bovine headage or premia payments for a period of one year.  In the case of a repeated infringement, the period may be extended to a period of up to five years.</P>
    <P>I consider that the legislation and the other penalites which I have referred to constitute meaningful sanctions for abuses in this area.  The appropriate penalty to be imposed on conviction in each instance is, of course, a matter for the courts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17, 27, 36, 38, 62 and 226 together.</P>
      <P>In general this country is trading normally in cattle and beef on a wide range of international markets although a number of countries have imposed BSE related restrictions.  Strenuous efforts are being made to have these restrictions lifted.  I have led delegations to Libya and Russia and my officials have been actively involved in missions to Russia, Egypt, Libya, Iran and the Gulf States.  I have also met visiting delegations from these countries and I have been in direct contact with the Egyptian Minister for Agriculture. The current position in relation to each individual market can be summarised as follows.</P>
      <P>As regards Russia, trade in beef is covered by a veterinary protocol concluded in November last which, <i>inter alia,</i> categorises counties according to their level of BSE.  Currently meat derived from cattle from eight counties is excluded from the trade.  I regard this as a serious and regrettable development and I am well aware of the concerns of producers in the counties in question.  I envisage having further discussions on the issue with the Russian authorities in May next.</P>
      <P>It is worth pointing out that trade is continuing from the other counties and the Russian side have signalled their commitment in the long term to trade in beef from Ireland.  Some 16,000 tonnes of beef have been shipped to date and the volume of exports forecast for the full year exceeds 100,000 tonnes.  We do not anticipate difficulties in meeting that demand.</P>
      <P>Egypt banned imports of live cattle from Ireland in January 1997 for a six months period. At the same time, new veterinary requirements were introduced in respect of beef.  Agreement was reached with the Egyptian authorities last week on a revised veterinary certificate to accompany beef exports to Egypt thus ensuring continuation of the trade.  I am continuing in my efforts to have the live cattle market reopened.  I should point out that the type of beef exported to Egypt is boneless beef.  Traditionally, Ireland has not traded in carcase beef on the Egyptian market.</P>
      <P>In March 1996 Libya imposed a ban on the import of live cattle from Ireland.  I have made a number of efforts to secure a lifting of this ban.  I led a delegation to Tripoli last July and this visit was followed up by a series of contacts at official level.  A technical delegation from Libya is in Ireland at present to observe our controls.  I will be meeting this delegation later in the week and I intend to impress on them the high quality and safety of Irish cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> The Iranian market has always been volatile but has taken considerable quantities of Irish beef in the past.  A veterinary delegation visited from Iran last autumn and I am organising a follow-up technical mission to Iran in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Restrictions on Irish beef have also been imposed by a number of countries in the Middle East including United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and Turkey.  As regards UAE, the authorities there have now agreed to lift the restrictions.  I expect to receive formal confirmation of this later in the week.  I also understand that the restrictions applied by Qatar will be lifted in the coming days.  I will continue to work with the relevant authorities of the countries concerned to secure elimination of all remaining restrictions.</P>
    <P>Given the nature of BSE related difficulties which it has faced the beef export industry has performed well in third countries over the past year.</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for the promotion of Irish food, including beef, is vested in An Bord Bia.  To assist it in carrying out that function the board receives an annual grant-in-aid from the Exchequer and an allocation of EU funds under the marketing and promotion measure of the Structural Fund Food Sub-Programme. The amounts involved are substantial and, consequently, I have not found it necessary to provide extra funding to cater for additional promotional work necessitated by the BSE crisis. At the onset of that crisis the board engaged in an extensive information and promotional programme as a result of which, and as was announced last week, significant progress has been made in restoring consumption of Irish beef.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Irish beef that was purportedly exported to Iraq in 1988 is still held in the Canary Islands, Spain where it is the subject of police investigation; whether export refunds were paid on this beef; if so, whether the securities therefor were forfeited; and if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this beef appears to have come from intervention and is likely to have been slaughtered in or before 1986; and his views on whether this is a satisfactory way to deal with Irish beef.</Quest>

      <P>A quantity of beef which had been exported to Iraq in 1988 was diverted to the Canary Islands following rejection by the Iraqi authorities.  This diversion was notified to my <Col N="110" /> Department at the time and was permissable under EU regulations as the Canaries were then outside the European Community.  While export refunds had been paid for this beef in advance, as is the normal practice, the relevant securities have been held pending the outcome of a Commission investigation which has been undertaken in co-operation with my Department.  My understanding is that this beef became the subject of a commercial legal dispute in the Canaries which proved very lengthy.  However, with regard to payment of export refunds, the issue to be determined is the quality and type of beef at the time of its release into free circulation in the Canaries, following its importation.  We will act upon the findings of the investigation when it is completed.</P>
      <P>While it is totally unsatisfactory that Irish beef remains uneaten years after it has been imported, this is a matter for the importer and is of course completely outside my control.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 59 and 79 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions applicable to the import of livestock from other EU member states are set out in a number of EU Directives.  These include, <i>inter alia,</i> requirements that the animals have tested negative for certain diseases and that they are accompanied by a health certificate issued by an authorised veterinarian in the country of dispatch. Strict conditions are laid down in those Directives as regards the introduction of additional health guarantees by member states in <Col N="111" /> relation to such trade.  These normally include requirements in relation to national surveillance and control programmes in the member state in question.  Such guarantees are in place in Ireland in relation to diseases such as PRRS, transmissible gastro-enteritis, maedi visna and contagious agalactia.  Except where otherwise prescribed by the directive in question, I am unable to apply additional health conditions to such trade.</P>
    <P>Although it is not always possible to apportion the blame for an outbreak of a contagious disease in a herd or flock to imported or domestic animals, a small number of outbreaks of mycoplasma bovis, Johnes disease and warble fly infestation discovered in herds have been attributed by the veterinary services of my Department to imported animals.  PRRS (also known as blue ear disease) has never been recorded in a pig herd here.  As far as BSE is concerned, the last case of BSE in an imported animal occurred in 1994.  The importation of all cattle from the United Kingdom is now prohibited.  The nomination of a single port through which livestock must be imported would not be in accordance with the rules of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>Voluntary codes of practice which set out additional health requirements in relation to the importation of the major livestock groups are in place and I have on many previous occasions urged importers to follow closely the terms of these codes when importing livestock.</P>

      <P>My main concern in relation to the price quotation system used by beef factories is to ensure that the system is transparent and does not mislead producers.  In general, the position is that factories quote prices on a VAT inclusive basis, with the level of the VAT rebate being clearly indicated.  Vendors are then in a position to compare prices on offer from the various meat factories.  I believe, therefore, that the current cattle price quotation system operated by meat factories is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The position is that to date over £657 million has been paid to farmers under the various 1996 headage and premia schemes.  These are recorded payment levels under these schemes at this time of year.  Over £132 million has been paid out since 1 January 1997.  The estimated total amount remaining to be paid under these schemes at present is £116.5 million.  It should be noted, however, that almost £70 million of this amount, representing payments under suckler cow applications submitted in October 1996 and 1996 extensification premium, is not yet due for payment.  Under EU requirements, payment of October 1996 suckler cow applications cannot commence until the end of the retention period in April next.  Similarly, payment of extensification premium for 1996 cannot commence until all 1996 special beef premium and suckler cow premium payments have been processed.  It is expected that, in line with the commitment in the charter of rights for farmers, payment of suckler cow premium to October, 1996 applicants will be made in April and May, 1997 and that payment of 1996 extensification grants will be made in the period April to June 1997.</P>
      <P>Balancing payment under May 1996 suckler cow applications and special beef premium applications submitted in the period January-November 1996 are continuing at present with a view to having most cases paid by end March and the remainder paid by 30 June in line with EU requirements and commitments in the charter of rights for farmers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Since my detailed reply of 29 January to the Deputy on the current position as regards the Kearney report (including the imposition of the £3,000 ceiling limit), formal negotiations with the Commission's services have commenced on the proposals which I put to the European Commission in October 1996 but I am not yet in a position to indicate when this process will be completed.</P>
      <P>As regards the implications involved for those farmers affected by the proposed £3,000 ceiling, the position is that around 4,000 farmers get average payments of approximately £3,600 annually and they would cease, therefore, to get any amount above the £3,000 level from 1 January 1998.  When premia schemes are included, such better-off farmers are on average in receipt of overall payments of approximately £15,700 per annum.  Restriction of headage to a ceiling of £3,000 would therefore involve an average reduction of approximately 4 per cent.  As indicated in a previous reply to the Deputy, one of the provisions in Partnership 2000 is that implementation of the £3,000 ceiling measure should proceed unless agreement is reached on an equitable alternative within the current level of the programme's resources.</P>

      <P>The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, in conjunction with my Department, as well as the relevant farming and environmental interests have agreed farming conditions for the majority of habitat types designated as special areas of conservation &mdash; SACs. These farming conditions were agreed for the Burren on 17 November 1995 and for blanket bogs, heaths and upland grasslands on 4 October 1997.  It has been accepted that such farming conditions agreed for proposed natural heritage areas &mdash; NHAs &mdash; will also be the conditions to apply to SACs of the same habitat types.  Farming conditions for a number of habitat types have yet to be agreed by the various interests.  However, the consultation process in this regard will continue until appropriate farming conditions are arrived at.</P>
      <P>The matter of boundaries of SACs is the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  However, as the Deputy is probably aware, any farmer or landowner whose lands are designated as a SAC may appeal such designation on scientific grounds.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that my Department and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht have made and will continue to make every effort to have farming conditions agreed for all habitat types which meet the twin objectives of sustainable farming and habitat conservation.</P>

      <P>A significant increase last year in the area under potatoes, combined with improved yields, resulted in a level of production in excess of domestic requirements.  The surplus production, for which there was not a ready market, led to depressed producer prices.  A similar situation occurred throughout the EU.  This comes after a number of years of relatively good prices. Collective action, by everyone involved in the trade, is needed to deal with the present situation. Poor quality produce, some of which is only suitable for animal feed, must be kept off the market as there are adequate supplies of quality potatoes available.  I have requested An Bord Glas to increase promotion of potatoes over the next two months in an effort to boost demand.</P>
      <P>For the future, the market needs more discipline, especially as regards the area and varieties planted, so that production will be brought more into line with the quantity and quality demanded by consumers and processors.</P>

      <P>In April 1996, the Comptroller and Auditor General published a Value for Money Report on the borrowing activities of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry for FEOGA purposes.  While the report concluded that the borrowing and associated risks were managed quite well by the Department, it did recommend, <i>inter alia,</i> that consideration be given to the involvement of the National Treasury Management Agency &mdash; NTMA &mdash; to a much greater extent in the management of the borrowings involved.</P>
      <P>Since then, following discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, our officials have examined the feasibility of transferring the treasury management functions of FEOGA to the NTMA.  A critical factor in considering such a change is its impact on the various budgetary aggregates, particularly on the Maastricht measure of general Government debt.  Clarification was sought by the Department of Finance from the EU Commission last year on the relevant accounting conventions.  The clarification sought, which was received very recently, established that the bulk of FEOGA borrowings should be classified as part of the general Government debt irrespective of the management arrangements.  This has removed an important constraint on the transfer of FEOGA borrowing to NTMA.</P>
      <P>In the light of the clarification received, proposals which would enable the treasury management functions of FEOGA to be transferred to the NTMA are currently being formulated.</P>

This includes balancing payments under 1995 and earlier years' schemes as well as payments made under the 1996 schemes.  Comparative figures for 1990 are not readily available but the number of payments made in 1990 under the 1990 schemes was 209,986.  The number of payments over £100,000 issued under the 1996 schemes was 21.  There was no arable aid or setaside scheme in 1990.  Consequently no payments in excess of £100,000 were made in that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 202 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965 are the principal statutes governing cruelty to animals, and are enforced by the Garda.  Any act of cruelty which might be perpetrated against an animal during field sport activities, including coursing, would fall in the normal course to be dealt with under these Acts.  I am satisfied that the scope of such Acts is sufficiently broad to encompass most if not all acts of cruelty against <Col N="119" /> animals.  Deputies will be aware that, in order to reflect public feeling on this issue, I have recently availed of the opportunity provided by the passage of the Control of Horses Act, 1996 to increase significantly the penalties for cruelty to animals under the Protection of Animals Act, 1911.  The new penalties are; a fine of up to £1,500 and/or six months imprisonment on summary conviction and a fine of up to £10,000 and/or two year's imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>I believe that these tougher measures will be supported by the vast majority of people and will act as a greater deterrent against acts of cruelty to all animals.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, and in the context of the Deputy's concern about coursing, Bord na gCon investigates all complaints it receives regarding the alleged involvement of any persons connected with the greyhound industry and the blooding of greyhounds.  The board has wide-ranging legislative powers to undertake investigations and, following such investigations, to exclude any person from participating in the racing or public sale of greyhounds by means of a special exclusion order.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that, as I indicated in the House on 4 March, 1997 &mdash; in response to Question No. 235 &mdash; since the muzzling of greyhounds was introduced in 1994 there has been a very substantial reduction in the recorded number of hares killed at coursing meetings, from 267 in 1993-94 to 33 in 1996-97.</P>
    <P>Deputies will of course recognise the reality that the statutory protection afforded to animals is critically dependent on the willingness of the public generally and of those who witness acts of cruelty in particular to make complaints to the Garda.  I want to make it clear that I condemn absolutely all acts of cruelty to animals.  I urge anyone who is aware of cases of cruelty to alert the Garda so that they can pursue the perpetrators.</P>

      <P>As part of the meat inspection service, my Department carries out the supervision of deboning operations in export approved meat plants, at a cost of approximately £1.5 million, of <Col N="121" /> which close to £1 million is recouped from the meat industry under the current system of cost recovery for the meat inspection service.  Part of the cost relates to the supervision of market measures, such as intervention and export refunds, and are not legally recoverable from the industry.  It is my intention to introduce a system of full cost recovery for the service provided to the beef sector later this year.</P>
      <P>In view of the importance, both in terms of human health and market confidence, of an independent system of hygiene control of meat for human consumption, this expenditure is fully justified.</P>

      <P>The proposed national beef assurance scheme is a very large undertaking requiring significant resources in the area of technology, communications, administration, certification, testing, etc., and will require the commitment of all links in the beef production and related chains. Initial funding of £4 million is provided in the Vote for my Department for 1997 towards the development of aspects of the scheme.  I expect further funds will be required at a later stage for aspects which will be undertaken by my Department. Beyond this certain costs of complying with the elements of the scheme will fall on the various sectors: producers, meat processors, livestock marts and animal feed compounders.  It is envisaged each sector will carry its own costs.  The full cost of the scheme has not been established.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the objectives of the scheme include reinforcing consumer confidence by raising the standards and increasing the transparency of production and processing.  This will enhance the performance of the sector on the home and export markets, with the main beneficiaries being producers and processors.</P>

      <P>I have received two reports from Trócaire on the impact of subsidised EU beef exports on the South African economy.  One report by the European Research Office is a summary of statistical data and the second is a report by Christian Aid.  Both reports outline the effects EU policies on subsidised beef exports are having on the beef industry and the overall agricultural development of South Africa and neighbouring countries.</P>
      <P>Export refunds to South Africa have already been reduced by 17.5 per cent since the beginning of the year.  Because of the revaluation of the Irish Agricultural conversion rate against the ecu this reduction translates into a 22 per cent cut in Irish currency and this has significantly diminished the competitiveness of Irish beef on this market.  Given that Ireland is the major European supplier to the South African market, these developments will lead to a reduction in the volume of European exports to South Africa.  The total removal of export subsidies as suggested in the reports would jeopardise this trade, resulting in the loss of this market to our competitors, particularly from South America and Australia.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to ensure that the export refund system does not undermine the economic and agricultural development of the region. The European Union, through the Lomé Convention, provides significant export opportunities under preferential arrangements for the beef industry in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Zimbabwe which also supply the South African market.  These countries did not make full use of the export opportunities available to them under these arrangements in 1996, which suggests there are reasonable market outlets available to them locally or in South Africa.</P>

      <P>The inclusion of ruminant meat and bonemeal in animal feed destined for ruminant <Col N="123" /> animals has been prohibited in Ireland since 1990. The testing for the presence of such meat and bonemeal in ruminant diets is carried out by my Department by use of the microscopy test which is the most sensitive test available.  Because of the very minute nature of the fragments of bone detected by this method, it cannot distinguish between poultry bone, which poses no risk as far as BSE is concerned, and animal bone.  Accordingly, where a sample tests positive for bone fragments, it is not evidence of breach of the prohibition already referred to.  As a result, I do not propose to release the names of the feed compounders in whose premises positive samples have been found.</P>
      <P>As far as the distinction between poultry and mammalian bone is concerned, the result levels have been suggestive of a level of incorporation of 0.0075 per cent or lower of either poultry or animal bone and in no case has evidence of deliberate incorporation been found.  Trials carried out by my Department on the ELISA test which can distinguish between poultry and animal bone have shown that an incorporation rate in excess of 1 per cent is required before a satisfactory result is achieved.  Mammalian meat and bonemeal can be incorporated into any animal feed other than those destined for ruminant animals. Poultry offal can be incorporated into any feed ration.  To ensure any cross-contamination suggested by the test results found by my Department did not continue in animal feed mills, I made an order effective from last October which, <i>inter alia,</i> limited the use of mammalian meat and bonemeal to those feed mills dedicated to the manufacture of animal feeds for non-ruminants.  I subsequently made a further order in February 1997 which requires a licence for the use of poultry offal as an animal feed ingredient.  I am satisfied the effect of these two orders has been to eliminate the risk of contamination of ruminant feeds by mammalian meat and bonemeal.</P>

      <P>A submission to establish a new category of extremely disadvantaged areas in Ireland was formally presented to the Commission on 9 October 1996.  The criteria established to facilitate selection of areas for reclassification as extremely disadvantaged were as follows: the areas must have already been designated more severely handicapped, and should not extend beyond the boundary of the original MSH designation of 1975; there must be a high proportion of &ldquo;rough grazing&rdquo; land in the areas; the areas must be subject to extreme climatic conditions; to ensure homogeneity of physical characteristics and farming types, areas must be at least 20,000 hectares in extent.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of Bureau Veritas certificates submitted to my Department in support of export refund claims covered beef exported to Iraq in the period August 1988 to December 1989.  These certificates have not been demonstrated to be unreliable &mdash; the £2.29 million allowance which has been imposed on Ireland by the EU Commission represented a percentage of the refund paid on export transactions covered by four certificates.  The reason for the disallowance was that detailed back-up documentation was not available as it had been destroyed in Baghdad during the Gulf War.</P>
      <P>In the case of other certificates, I believe the Deputy is referring to the apparent addition of dates of shipment on some certificates.  These dates were cross-checked and verified against certification provided directly to the Department by Irish customs officials present at the ports.  Furthermore, the commercial transport documentation was examined for each shipment. None of the export details was misrepresented. No disallowance of refund has been imposed by the Commission on foot of these certificates.</P>
      <P>With regard to a review of more recent years the Deputy may be interested to learn the results of an intensive systems audit carried out by the Commission into beef export refund prefinancing expenditure in six member states.  In Ireland the total expenditure audited amounted to £361 million in 1993 and 1994.  The results have just been received &mdash; major disallowances of the order of 5-10 per cent of total expenditure have been imposed on the other five member states concerned, with no disallowances for Ireland.</P>

      <P>The level of the ewe premium in any year is determined by the average prices paid in the EU markets for that year.  During 1996, both the EU and Irish market prices for lamb were at record levels from March onwards, due to buoyant consumer demand.  Irish lamb producers who sold their lambs in 1996, benefited from prices about 21 per cent higher than those available in the previous year.  The premium is designed to compensate producers for poor market returns and in a year of good prices the premium paid is inevitably lower.  The combination of market prices and premium in 1996 resulted in a significant improvement in returns to producers compared to 1995.</P>

      <P>It will not, however, assume any of the primary functions of those other agencies and Departments, consequently the necessity for discussions between my Department and the Department of Health in regard to the staffing of the new board does not arise and no such discussions have taken place.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the normal consultation procedure involved in the preparation of new legislation, discussions have taken place between my Department and the Department of Health on the draft heads of the Bill to establish the new board.  Given that the core principles, as set out above, on which the board will operate had already been agreed by the Government, these discussions related to points of detail and clarification rather than substance and did not give rise to any difficulties.</P>

      <P>There are 19 staff currently employed in my Department's pesticide control service, of which 5.2 staff equivalent are exclusively engaged in monitoring pesticide residues. Plans are at an advanced stage to expand the residue monitoring programme, to provide more testing facilities and to recruit additional staff, nine of whom will be allocated to pesticide monitoring <Col N="129" /> work.  The enhanced monitoring programme will provide added assurance to consumers about the quality of the food being marketed in this country.</P>
      <P>Maximum residues limits &mdash; MRLs &mdash; are set down under EU legislation and to date MRLs have been fixed for 43 per cent of all plant protection products on the Irish market.  The pesticide control service of my Department monitors the level of residues in foodstuffs and of 9,398 samples analysed in the period 1990-96 only 62 samples &mdash; 0.66 per cent &mdash; were found to exceed the MRL.  By international comparison these results compare very favourably with other countries.</P>

      <P>My Department was consulted both on this draft and on an earlier draft in late 1996 and provided extensive comments on both occasions on both the orientation and the content of the guidelines. I anticipate future meetings with the Department of the Environment on the matter as the guidelines need to be agreed between both Departments so that the forest service of my Department will be able to participate in their operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission's proposals for an optional labelling system for beef were submitted to the Council last October.  Following the delivery of the opinion of the European Parliament last month, the Commission amended its proposal to provide for the introduction of a compulsory labelling system from 1 January 2000.  The revised Commission proposal was adopted last week, following some further amendments in the course of discussions in the Council.  While the proposal as adopted by the Council provides for the compulsory labelling of origin from 1 January 2000, it also permits member states to waive this requirement in respect of beef sold on their own territory.</P>
      <P>In the discussions on the proposal I was concerned to ensure that it would not be discriminatory and that the degree of bureaucracy involved in supervising the system was kept to the minimum necessary to guarantee the accuracy of information being placed on labels.  I am satisfied that the regulation as adopted substantially meets these concerns.</P>
      <P>I am considering how best to apply the provisions of the new regulation in Ireland in the context of the beef assurance scheme which I hope to have fully in operation in 1998.  The new regulations will also provide, as an aid to better animal traceability, for the introduction of a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals from 1 January 1998.  I do not foresee any difficulty for Ireland in complying with the requirements of the new system as most of its elements are already in place here under the national tagging and registration scheme which I introduced earlier last year.</P>

      <P>Based on the level of planting approvals issued, the level of planting this spring may be down by about 10 per cent on the corresponding period last year.  It is too early at this stage to determine whether the planning outturn for 1997 as a whole will be down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason for the decline this spring may be that planters are anticipating higher levels of <Col N="131" /> forest premium following the announcement of an upcoming review of premium levels in Partnership 2000.  There may also be competition from other support schemes in certain parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The review of premium levels provided for in Partnership 2000 is under way.  Where revised rates are called for, as a result of this review, it is my intention that they will apply to all beneficiaries under the current scheme, including those who have already planted.  The review will also provide information on the level of competition from other schemes.</P>

      <i>Further events:</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government's Famine Commemoration Committee have chosen a site for the National Famine Memorial at Murrisk in County Mayo. The memorial itself will consist of a very fine and moving sculpture by John Behan entitled &ldquo;The Coffin Ship&rdquo; which will be unveiled on 20 July this year.  Having examined many sites suggested to us, we chose the beautiful setting of Murrisk and we feel that it is entirely fitting that the national famine memorial should be located in the west, which suffered most during the Famine with one in four of the population of Connaught dying in those terrible years.</P>
    <P>The events which the Government propose to organise or contribute to include:</P>
    <P>&mdash; a major international conference on the famine in Dublin Castle on 9 and 10 May;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the Great Irish Famine Event</P>
    <P>&mdash; a set of stamps commemorating the Famine to issue in May</P>
    <P>&mdash; publication of an atlas of Famine sites of Ireland</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" />&mdash; publication of a book of Irish Famine Manuscripts</P>
    <P>&mdash; an ecumenical service</P>
    <P>&mdash; a photographic exhibition</P>
    <P>&mdash; continuing programme of support for the renovation of Famine graveyards.  </P>

    <P>I hope to make further grants available within the next couple of weeks to a number of local groups who have not previously been assisted in the restoration and marking of famine graves.</P>
    <P>Since January 1995 I have visited a number of workhouses around the country including Bawnboy in Cavan, Ballyshannon in Donegal, Birr in County Offaly and Swinford in County Mayo. Given the limited budget available to the Famine Commemoration Committee and the extensive programme being undertaken it would not be possible to make large capital grants available towards the restoration of workhouses.  My committee, however, would be happy to assist in bringing projects to the attention of the National Heritage Council and other bodies for its consideration.</P>

      <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that in June 1996, on my initiative, an interdepartmental working group was established to examine the <Col N="139" /> feasibility of Ireland making a bid to host the Special Olympics World Games in 2003.  The group was chaired by my office and comprised representatives from across Government Departments. Two representatives of Special Olympics Ireland worked with the group.  Subsequently I reported back to Government with the group's report which recommended that a bid be made and I secured Government agreement to this course.</P>
      <P>Following from this bid a steering group has been established to enable the bid to be prepared. I have arranged for this work to be carried on under the aegis of and with the full support of my office.  I am also making a once off grant of £120,000 available to Special Olympics Ireland to further assist in the preparation of the bid.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Deputy will appreciate from the foregoing that I have provided every practical support towards bringing about the hosting of the Special Olympics Games in Ireland.  I reassure the Deputy of my absolute intention to ensure that the extensive progress which has been achieved to date is built upon and I look forward to the holding of the Special Olympics in this country in 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 91, 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The situation in Colombia is very complex.  The Colombian Government has been involved in counter-insurgency operations against various guerilla groups for over 30 years.  Colombia also suffers gravely from violence perpetrated by armed drug traffickers and narco-terrorists.</P>
      <P>In December 1996, I wrote to Dr. Lemos Simmonds, Vice-President of Colombia and Ambassador to London, expressing my grave concern in respect of the activity of paramilitary groups.  I asked Dr. Simmonds to inform me of the results of his government's investigation into acts of violence in the area.  I received assurances from the Colombian Government that the issue and specifically the killings at the Marulanda Ranch would be investigated.</P>
      <P>An agreement to establish an office in Bogota, under the auspices of the UN, to monitor human rights abuses and to offer technical assistance has been signed with the Government of Colombia. The office will be funded largely by the European Union and will be headed by a national of an EU member state, Spain.  This indicates the degree of commitment which both the EU and the UN have to continue to address directly the question of human rights in Colombia and to press the Colombian Government to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to fully honour its commitments in that regard under the relevant international instruments and conventions.</P>
      <P>Ireland as a member of the UN Commission on Human rights is concerned to ensure that proper attention is paid to the human rights situation in Colombia.  This year, as in previous years, it is expected that the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights will make a statement, on behalf of the Commission, detailing its concern at the human rights situation in Colombia, and measures necessary to redress this.  Ireland will play a full part in seeking to ensure that recent developments are fully reflected in the Chairman's statement.</P>
      <P>I will continue to monitor closely the situation in Colombia and to press the Colombian government to respect human rights.</P>

      <P>While the Deputy has not supplied a copy of the document to which he refers, I assume it is one of a batch of documents circulated at a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts which was authenticated by the Embassy, Baghdad on 5 March 1990.</P>
      <P>The then Ambassador in Baghdad has confirmed that he autenticated the signature of the Bureau Veritas Commercial Manager, Mr. J. Lopuszynski, whose signature appears on all the documents in the batch in question, and that this person's signature was known to him and would have been on record at the Embassy.  The fact that one certificate was signed per pro T. Gurney by C. Peyron was overlooked by the Ambassador and possibly by Mr. Lopuszynski.  This probably because it was the only one of over 20 certificates presented for authentication on that occasion not to bear T. Gurney's signature.  The only signature requiring authentication and the only signature actually authenticated by the Ambassador was that of Mr. Lopuszynski.  I understand that the Department of Agriculture accepts that the certificate was genuine.  Furthermore, I understand also that no fine was imposed by the European Commission on foot of any certificate in the batch which was authenticated by the Embassy on 5 March 1990.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that the sole function of Irish diplomatic and consular officers in authenticating foreign documents abroad is to certify the authenticity of the signature or seal on the document, not the genuineness, legality, or credibility of the documents or their contents.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is entitled to and has been granted total tax free allowances of £4,388 for 1996-97.  In addition to her employment income, the taxpayer is also in receipt of a widow's pension from the Department of Social Welfare.  This pension is taxable but is paid gross, without tax being deducted, by the Department of Social Welfare. The method of taxing social welfare pensions is that an amount equivalent to the annual social welfare payment is deducted from the person's annual tax free allowances.  Consequently, the taxpayer's tax free allowances are reduced by £4,362, i.e. the amount of the pension, leaving a net tax free allowance of £26 per annum, or 50p <Col N="143" /> per week, available for allocation against her employment income.</P>

      <P>The total cost of mobile telephone to my Department in 1996 was £24,223.52.  This figure includes rental, airtime and purchase costs.  Mobile telephones are made available to personnel in the Department as required.  While it is difficult to estimate the costs for 1997, I expect total costs to be lower this year given the particularly high costs in 1996 associated with the Irish Presidency of the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Within recents months, I have taken several measures in relation to the monitoring and surveillance of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, CJD. In September last, I established an expert group to advise me on the public health dimension of developments in relation to CJD and other similar diseases.  The group consists of experts in disciplines relevant to this subject, including neurology, neuropathology, public health, veterinary medicine and microbiology.  It is chaired by Professor William Hall, Director of the Virus Reference Laboratory and Professor of Microbiology in University College, Dublin.  The remit of the group is to advise me on CJD related matters, including surveillance, research strategies and international developments generally in this area.</P>
      <P>Surveillance of CJD is a priority to establish the true incidence of the disease and to determine any changes in the pattern or nature of its occurrence. The Deputy may be aware that I have announced the established of a national active CJD surveillance system.  The aims of the surveillance project are to build a database of information on CJD cases in Ireland and to provide a facility to medical practitioners for the vertification of suspected cases of the disease.  Two reference centres have been designated &mdash; Beaumont and Cork University Hospitals &mdash; to which all clinically suspected cases of CJD can be referred for further analysis and confirmation. The surveillance project also involves the compilation of an information database on CJD cases in Ireland.  This surveillance system corresponds broadly with the systems operating in other countries, including several EU member states.</P>
      <P>I recently made regulations under the Health Act, 1947, which have the effect of making CJD and new variant-CJD notifiable diseases.  This means that all diagnosed cases of CJD and nv-CJD are now compulsorily notifiable to my Department and ensure that we have full knowledge of the incidence of the disease in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and my Department are giving serious consideration to the public health aspects of CJD.  I am confident that the above measures which I <Col N="145" /> have taken, with the availability of expert advice, will ensure that we have an informed basis on which to consider the CJD issue.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>IMPACT, on behalf of environmental health officers, withdrew from negotiations which were being pursued under clause 2 (iii) &mdash; annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and pursued industrial action in the form of a &ldquo;work-to-rule&rdquo; with effect from 15 January 1996. This has resulted in environmental health officers not co-operating with the implementation of any legislation which has been enacted since 1981 and not carrying out any duties outside normal working hours.</P>
      <P>Based on pre-1981 food hygiene and safety legislation, environmental health officers have continued to undertake inspections of food premises since the commencement of this dispute.  If, arising from an inspection, it is considered that there is a risk to public health, the health boards have made arrangements with the trade union that the appropriate measures be put in place. This procedure has been availed of on a number of occasions and has ensured that any risk to public health has been kept under control.</P>
      <P>Under the food hygiene regulations, persons who commence certain types of food business are obliged to apply to the health board for registration of their premises.  Having received legal advice, health boards consider that they are unable to process applications which have been received during the dispute for the registration of these types of food premises.  Accordingly, applicants are informed by health boards that they cannot consider their premises registered and that the health board will get in touch with them when the dispute is resolved.  In the meantime, I understand these premises are subject to inspection by environmental health officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the health <Col N="146" /> boards, is keeping the situation under review and I am satisfied that the arrangements currently in place ensure that any risk to public health and any damage to the food industry is kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to settle this dispute. Following renewed contact between both sides, the Health Services Employers' Agency and IMPACT met yesterday morning with a view to reopening discussions and I am hopeful of a resolution of this dispute.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is my intention that a full range of dental treatment designed to achieve oral health goals will be extended to all adults with medical card entitlements under the dental treatment services scheme.  The dental treatment services scheme is part of the dental health action plan and private dental practitioners, under contract to health boards, are significant providers of services under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> As provided under the dental health action plan, the scheme is being introduced on a phased basis.  In the initial phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 November 1994, emergency dental treatment was made available to all adults. Routine dental treatment and priority full denture treatment was made available to persons 65 years of age or older.</P>
    <P>Under the second phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 June 1996, routine dental treatment was extended to persons in the 16-34 year age group and full denture treatment was extended to all edentulous persons.</P>
    <P>In 1997 my Department is providing an additional £4 million to health boards for the development of the scheme.  A total of £15.5 million is now available to health boards annually for the scheme.</P>

As part of the Mid-Western Health Board's acute hospital strategy of providing specialist services locally, three new clinical specialties were introduced last year to Ennis General Hospital on both an out-patient and day care basis.  These were, urology, genito-urinary medicine and gynaecology.</P>
      <P>The development funding which I provided in 1997 to the Mid-Western Health Board will enable the specialties of haematology and oral surgery to be provided locally this year.  In addition, the Mid-Western Health Board hopes to recruit an additional consultant orthopaedic surgeon and this will enable additional orthopaedic out-patient clinics to be held at Ennis General Hospital.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> In February, 1996 I announced approval to the commencement of planning for the provision of an acute psychiatric unit to be located at Ennis General Hospital, which will replace the current acute admission facilities at Our Lady's Hospital, Ennis.  A draft planning brief for the proposed new unit has been drawn up and is at present being considered in detail by my Department.

    <P>As far as the future of Our Lady's Hospital is concerned, I understand that Clare County Council has entered discussions with the Mid-Western Health Board regarding the possible acquisition of the hospital site following the opening of the new acute psychiatric unit at Ennis General Hospital.  I am informed by the Mid-Western Health Board that non-acute in-patient facilities will continue to be provided at Our Lady's Hospital for a period after the new acute unit comes into operation.  It is the board's intention to develop a range of alternative community based facilities of an acceptable standard for these patients and I can assure the Deputy that <Col N="150" /> the hospital site will not be disposed of until such facilities are in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Health boards are responsible for the delivery of health services, including mental health services and services to persons with a mental handicap in their functional areas.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Departmental to provide, where appropriate, residential services for persons with mental illness and those with a mental handicap in community based facilities.  Health boards are developing comprehensive community based services for these two groups in line with the recommendations of the report on the development of the psychiatric services, Planning for the Future, and the report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, Needs and Abilities.</P>
      <P>A key objective of psychiatric service development policy modelled on the recommendations of Planning for the Future is the provision of appropriate psychiatric service facilities to persons with a mental illness who require varying degrees of support, care and treatment.  These varying needs can be met in many instances through the provision of care to patients in community residential facilities in place of in-patient care in psychiatric hospitals.  Progress towards more appropriate provision of services from in-patient to community based care is reflected in the accelerated development of community residences since 1984 when Planning for the Future was published.  In 1994 there were 121 community residences providing a total of just over 900 places compared to 377 community residences providing a total of 2,666 places in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period 1990 to 1996 over 1,000 new residential/respite places for persons with a mental handicap have been in place, most of which are in the community.  Placements in the services are made following an assessment of each individual's needs and the level of support required to maintain them in a residential setting.  Programmes are put in place for each individual which are reviewed on an ongoing basis and the persons concerned also receive support, as required, from various health care professionals. The role of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in relation to standards of care in mental health services is of great importance.  The inspector is required under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, to visit public psychiatric hospitals and services <Col N="151" /> once a year and private psychiatric hospitals biannually. The inspector's most recent report for 1995 refers to a continuing improvement in the quality of care provided to patients while recognising that there is still scope for improvement.</P>
    <P>In the case of persons with a mental handicap, both the progress of individuals and the overall operation of the residential services are subject to ongoing review by the agencies concerned and in the broader context by the health boards.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I fully recognise the importance of research towards assisting in the formulation of effective suicide prevention programmes.  In November <Col N="157" /> 1995 I established a National Task Force on Suicide to address the growing problem of suicide in Ireland.  In September 1996 the task force published its interim report which contained a detailed analysis of statistics relating to suicide and attempted suicide in Ireland.  The final report of the task force, which will contain a national suicide prevention/reduction strategy, is at an advanced stage of preparation and will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>Current research into suicide also includes a national suicide inquiry being undertaken in each of the eight health boards.  This study aims to establish the incidence of suicide in Ireland with a view to developing prevention programmes.  The National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork is also involved in extensive suicide and parasuicide research which is being funded by my Department through the Health Research Board.</P>
      <P>Health boards, in many instances, work closely with local voluntary organisations who provide specialised suicide bereavement counselling services. As part of its terms of reference, the National Task Force on Suicide will be making recommendations on how service providers can most cost effectively address the problems of attempted suicide and parasuicide.  The recommendations of the task force will be fully considered by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is my intention that a full range of dental treatment designed to achieve oral health goals will be extended to all adults with medical card entitlements under the dental treatment services scheme.  The dental treatment services scheme is part of the Dental Health Action Plan and private dental practitioners, under contract to health boards, are significant providers of services under the scheme.  As provided under the Dental Health Action Plan, the scheme is being introduced on a phased basis.  In the intitial phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 November, 1994, emergency dental treatment was made available to all adults.  Routine dental treatment and priority full denture treatment was made available to persons 65 years of age or older.</P>
      <P>Under the second phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 June 1996, routine dental treatment was extended to persons in the 16-34 year age group and full denture treatment was extended to all edentulous persons.</P>
      <P>In 1997 my Department is providing an additional £4 million to health boards for the development of the scheme.  A total of £15 million is now available to health boards annually for the scheme.  The significant level of funding now being provided together with the exercise of more effective control on the emergency element of the scheme will enable health boards to put in place service plans for dealing effectively with existing waiting lists for routine and full denture treatment.</P>
      <P>As regards the provision of dental treatment to children the position is that for the past number of years health boards have been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand-led system.  This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
      <P>The school based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools.  Children in specific classes are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach.  The children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary.  The provision of fissure sealants for vulnerable teeth is an important element of the preventive programme. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.  The small number of children who require more frequent attention will be identified and the required level of advice, checkups, treatment, etc, provided as necessary.  An emergency service for acute conditions requiring immediate attention is available on demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> Under the Dental Health Action Plan, eligibility for dental services will be extended, on a phased basis, to children who have left national school and are under 16 years of age.  The necessary legislation is now in place and I have made regulations extending eligibility to children under 14 years of age.  The purposes of this extension is to achieve continuity of dental health care between the health board service for pupils of national schools and the health board service for medical card holders and their dependants.  The range of dental services to be provided will include preventive primary care dental services such as dental health education, examination, scaling and polishing and preventive treatments such as fissure sealing and topical applications.  Health boards are being provided with the additional resources necessary to implement this extension.</P>

      <P>The housing and display of the museum's folklife collection was an issue under discussion for many years before the Collins Barracks facility was considered.  I had earmarked £8 million available from the Structural Funds aided allocations under my aegis for a project to house the folklife collection but I envisaged this at a location outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In establishing the interim board of the National Museum in March 1994 I asked it as part of its terms of reference to draw up a five year strategic plan for the museum which would address, among other issues, the &ldquo;housing of appropriate elements of the Museum's collections, including the national folklife collection at venus outside Dublin having regard to the Collins Barracks development&rdquo;.  I saw it as important that regional access to culture and heritage be enhanced by a range of measures including those building up regional cultural infrastruc <Col N="161" /> ture and those making the collections of the key national institutions more accessible.  The interim board's second and final report recommended that the folklife collection should be located at Collins Barracks for the reasons of locating coherent integrated exhibitions at Collins Barracks and because it believed this approach would provide economies of scale.</P>
    <P>In arriving at my decision on the proposed location of the folklife collection, I considered the report of the interim board, along with a number of proposals for locating the folklife collection in different sites around the country.  I considered it consistent with my policy of developing cultural infrastructure throughout the regions to locate part of the national collections outside Dublin. The folklife collection seemed particularly suitable in this regard.  However, in order to accommodate the concerns of the interim board regarding the mounting of integrated exhibitions at Collins Barracks I decided in principle that the folklife material necessary for a first class integrated exhibition should be located at Collins Barracks with the balance at Turlough Park House, Castlebar, County Mayo.  In this regard I should also point out that a working group in 1992 involving members of the Board of Visitors of the National Museum and National Museum staff considered a number of possible sites for a folklife museum and recommended that, of the locations then under consideration, Turlough Park House would be the preferred option.  This project, the outline design and other details of which are currently being assessed, represents a <Col N="162" /> major partnership between the State and a local authority which will provide a significant part of the investment.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the only way of ensuring houses are affordable for the majority of Irish people is to provide a continuing stream of new reasonably priced houses, where they are required, in the suburbs; and his views on whether, if cities cannot expand outwards, the only option is for them to expand upwards.</Quest>

      <P>There was a record number of new houses completed in 1995 and again in 1996.  In addition it is important to bear in mind that the existing stock of starter houses, including former tenant purchase and private <Col N="163" /> starter houses, provides a continuous stream of reasonably priced houses in established communities with households moving to different houses as their needs and circumstances change. In fact, 58.5 per cent of mortgage loans approved for second-hand houses in 1996 were in respect of houses costing £60,000 or less, and 22.4 per cent were in respect of houses costing £40,000 or less.</P>
      <P>Given demographic changes and the need to revitalise our inner urban areas, both apartment and suburban type housing will continue to be important components of the overall housing stock.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide physical education facilities on a phased basis at all second level schools where such facilities are not already available.

The provision of PE facilities where these are not being planned at present will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for classrooms has eased.</P>

      <P>There are signs that the status of the Irish language is stronger today in many Galltacht areas than in the recent past.  My Department's role in relation to the Irish language is concerned with the effectiveness of its teaching in schools.  It is a function of the education system to provide the means for students to learn the Irish language and to make them aware of its inherent value.  Institúid Teangeolaíochta na hÉireann has conducted a number of surveys over the past 20 years on the attainment of Irish in primary schools which has shown that there is no decrease in standards.</P>
      <P>A revised Irish primary curriculum will be available towards the end of 1997.  The minimum objective of the revised curriculum, as stated in the White Paper <i>Charting Our Education Future</i>, is that on completion of primary education students will be able to conduct a simple conversation in Irish and will have acquired a knowledge of the basic structures of the Irish language as a foundation for further study at second level and an awareness of Irish history and culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there has been a decrease in the percentage of students taking higher level Irish in the leaving certificate, the availability of foundation level Irish has enable all pupils to take a programme in Irish suitable to their abilities.  Revised syllabuses have also been introduced at higher and ordinary levels and my Department has provided significant funding for the in-career <Col N="177" /> development of teachers of these new syllabuses. Every development and happening that increases the profile of Irish as a living language helps the teaching and learning of Irish in schools.</P>

      <P>The only CCTV schemes currently sanctioned for funding by my Department are the Temple Bar scheme, which has been operational since October 1995, O'Connell Street, Dublin, Tralee and Finglas. Work on the O'Connell Street system is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed shortly.  Preliminary work has commenced on the Tralee and Finglas systems.</P>
      <P>An advisory committee has been established by the Garda Commissioner, comprising of higher officers in the Garda Síochána and an official from my Department, to examine all applications and proposals for CCTV systems as an aid to policing. I am informed that to date applications have been received in respect of over 20 locations, including Ennis, for the installation of CCTV schemes and that these will be considered by the advisory committee with a view to determining priority.  I should point out that the extension of Garda CCTV system to other areas will have implications for Garda personnel and resources and must, of course, be viewed in the context of overall policing operations.  These CCTV system must be carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, before any such schemes can receive public funding they will be subject to specific technical and procedural standards set by the Garda and will be subject to open tendering in accordance with the normal public procurement procedures.  While I have provided additional funding this year for the expansion of CCTV systems, the commitment to fund the O'Connell <Col N="178" /> Street, Finglas and Tralee schemes limits the opportunity to make further funding available for systems for other areas this year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the maximum level of funding which I propose to provide for the installation of any Garda CCTV scheme would be in the region of 50 per cent of the total cost of the project, the balance of which would have to be met by commercial-local interests in the proposed location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Delays in the hearing of court cases have been a matter of concern for some time.  To address the problem of delays in the courts I introduced the necessary legislative provisions under the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, the Courts Act, 1996 and the Courts Act, 1997, to increase the total maximum number of judges who can be appointed to the courts from 86 to 110.  To date all but seven of the additional judges provided for have been appointed.  The necessary court support staff have also been provided.</P>
      <P>I am happy to note that the additional judicial and staffing resources provided, which represent an annual investment by the Government of approximately £2.5 million have already produced a significant reduction in the backlog of cases awaiting hearing and I am confident that they will continue to assist in the prompt disposal of cases.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that delays in the hearing of civil cases in Donegal Circuit Court have been reduced from 12 months in July 1996 to approximately six months at present and that there are no delays in the hearing of family law business and criminal business.  I also understand that the President of the Circuit Court is arranging for the temporary assignment of an additional judge to Donegal for a three week special sitting of the Circuit Court in April to further assist in the elimination of arrears.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are delays of up to two months in the hearing of civil cases in the District Court in Donegal and delays of up to four weeks in the hearing of family law cases and that these delays have only arisen recently.  I am particularly concerned that there should be any delay in the hearing of family law cases.  I understand that the President of the District Court arranged for the temporary assignment of an additional judge to Donegal for a special sitting for one week in March and that he has arranged for further special sittings of this court in May.</P>
      <P>Closure of some District Court venues in Donegal has not contributed to delays in the hearing of cases.  Court sittings have been rearranged to enable the hearings, which, in the past had been held in non-court accommodation, to be held in dedicated court facilities.</P>
      <P>In relation to a review of the District and Circuit Courts areas, I would remind the Deputy that I established the Working Group on a Courts Commission to examine all aspects of the operation of the courts system and I await any recommendations the working group wish to make in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reform of the family courts structure, in particular, was the subject of the recent Law Reform Commission Report on Family Courts.  The recommendations contained in the report call for <Col N="182" /> a combination of structural and legal reforms and a major injection of resources.  These recommendations fall to be considered in the context of available resources and the Government's commitment to complete the steps necessary to strengthen family courts.  The report will also, I expect, be given full consideration by the Working Group on a Courts Commission.</P>

      <P>The staffing complement of my Department's probation and welfare service is not sufficient to enable it to supervise all offenders on temporary release from custody.  The service already supervises about 4,300 offenders.  The majority of these are on probation type orders &mdash; i.e. probation orders, supervision during deferment of sentence, and community service orders &mdash; and some are on temporary release.  In July 1996, under the anti crime package approved by the Government, I was successful in obtaining approval for ten additional probation and welfare staff to supervise about 120 offenders on temporary release from custody.  Recruitment for these posts is ongoing and I understand that all posts will be filled in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the expansion of the probation and welfare service would be of considerable benefit to the criminal justice system and indeed to society.  I should add, however, that recruitment is subject to public sector restrictions on numbers employed.  Offenders who have completed their sentences cannot be compelled to accept supervision from the probation and welfare services.  The probation and welfare service has, however by tradition, offered voluntary support and guidance to offenders who seek it on release from custody.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question about the merit of the USA probation model, I am aware that there are a variety of models in operation in the USA.  I am not sure which model the Deputy has in mind but if he supplies me with details of the particular model that he finds attractive I will certainly have it examined by my Department.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to convene a forum in relation to criminal law reform as outlined by the Deputy.  The Law Reform Commission, which provides reports from time to time on aspects of criminal law reform generally publishes consultation papers before finalising their reports and this provides an opportunity for any person or body who may wish to do so to offer observations on proposals for change.  In addition, I recently established an Advisory Group on Criminal Law and Procedure which comprises a wide range of practitioners in the criminal justice area.  Incidentally, the suggestion that most legislation in the criminal justice area is pre-constitutional and Victorian in origin overlooks the many laws which have been enacted particularly over recent years including those which I have undertaken as part of a major programme of criminal law reform.</P>

      <Quest>her views on whether the provision of airport-type security for visitors to prisons would reduce the over-high incidence of drug abuse in our prisons which is contrary to the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984; and her views on whether it is appropriate for visitors to prisons to have physical contact with prisoners whereby they can pass drugs by way of kissing.</Quest>

      <P>A number of measures aimed at curbing the supply of illegal drugs are already in place in prisons.  These include video surveillance of the visiting area in some prisons and facilities for the searching of prisoners following visits.</P>
      <P>The improvement of such detection measures in Mountjoy Prison during 1995, has led to a significant increase in the number of drug seizures made there.  This is illustrated by the number of seizures in Mountjoy (main) Prison involving illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia which resulted in formal prison disciplinary proceedings against prisoners over the last three years which were as follows: 1994 &mdash; 172; 1995 &mdash; 392; 1996 &mdash; 423.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other steps have and are being considered.  In this regard I have asked for a report on the use of sniffer dogs and if the indications are positive, I will have no hesitation in employing this and any other means of cutting off the supply of drugs to prisoners.  The arrangements for the conduct of visits which are currently in place allow limited physical contact between visitors and prisoners.  It is considered that to impose closed visits, prohibiting all physical contact in every case, would cause undue hardship, particularly in the case of prisoners with young families.  In addition such <Col N="186" /> arrangements would be inappropriate and impractical in the open prisons.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.</P>
      <P>The free fuel allowance is a weekly cash payment of £5 which is payable for six months of the year, from mid-October to mid-April.  An extra allowance &mdash; a smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week &mdash; was introduced in October 1990 to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin and Cork to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban by the Department of the Environment on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas.  The ban on the sale of bituminous coal has not been extended to other urban or rural areas and the question of extending the smokeless fuel allowance to recipients living in these areas does not arise.</P>
      <P>The average weekly number of recipients of the free fuel allowance is 274,500 of which 90,000 are in receipt of the smokeless fuel allowance. The additional annual cost of extending the smokeless fuel allowance to all recipients is £14.4 million.</P>
      <P>A review of the scheme is currently being carried out by independent consultants to ensure that it is operating effectively and equitably.  The adequacy of rates of payment is one of the issues being examined in this context, and the final report is expected shortly.  Any recommendations arising from the review can be considered only in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Statutory Instrument No. 389 of 1996, entitled Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Scheduled Substances by Road) (Trade or Business) (Amendment) Regulations, 1996 was signed into law on 13 December 1996 by the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs.</P>
      <P>From 1 January 1997, Council Directive 94/55/EC applied the ADR (European agreement concerning the international transport of dangerous goods by road) to national transport.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will introduce legislation to effect ratification of the ADR by Ireland.  The ADR will introduce new more stringent standards for vehicles and tanks which will be used to carry dangerous goods on Irish roads.  The main reason for the making of S.I. No. 389 of 1996 was to enable existing vehicles and tanks covered by the ADR to continue their useful lives (subject to national safety provisions) without having to have every existing vehicle and tank refitted before 1 January 1997.  Council Directive 94/55/EC provided a derogation for this purpose.  If S.I. No. 389 had not been enacted, there would have been a major disruption to the transport within Ireland of substances such as petrol, oil and gas.</P>
      <P>The application of the ADR to national transport is an obligation imposed under Council Directive 94/55/EC.  This requirement applies to every member state without exception.  The Deputy will be aware that it is for the Commission of the European Union to ensure that member states are correctly transporting European law.</P>
      <P>S.I. No. 389 was the result of an extensive consultation process.  Since the making of the S.I. further concerns have been expressed about the potential consequences of the legislation.  The Minister for Labour Affairs is examining these concerns and consulting with the Health and Safety Authority with a view to devising means by which these concerns can be overcome.</P>

      <P>The effect of this order made by the Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology, which entered into force on 11 March and applies to all areas of the country except the county borough of Dublin, the county of South Dublin, the administrative county of Fingal and the administrative county of Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown, is to stipulate that the prices charged for intoxicating liquors indicated in any particular part of a licensed premises shall be the prices obtaining and displayed on 4 November 1996.</P>

Unlike alcoholic drinks, soft drinks are offered for sale in a diversity of outlets and price saving sizes particularly in small shops, grocery multiples, supermarkets and off-licences.  Thus, there is wide availability of choice for consumers to enable them to shop around and secure the best value.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the butter vouchers allowable to old age pensioners; the reason his Department found it necessary to change the butter entitlement for old age pensioners from £2 per month to £1 per month, that is a quarter of a pound of butter per week; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this cutback is most unfair on old age pensioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>This measure is fully funded by the European Union without any national Exchequer contribution.  Ireland is the only member state operating the scheme.  Since 1988, EU legislation requires the Commission to review the scheme every two years.  On foot of the recent review, the European Commission, in its report to the Council, proposed that the scheme should be extended for a further two years at an unchanged aid level. The Commission also recommended that the monthly entitlement be halved to reflect the general decline in per capita butter consumption in Ireland which has fallen from 2lbs per month to under 1lb.  The Agriculture Council agreed in December to continue the scheme for a further two years on the basis of the Commission proposal.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the importance of the scheme to pensioners and the less well off.  With this in mind, Ireland succeeded in having the scheme extended on the most viable basis possible. The reduced entitlement to butter under the scheme reflects the significant fall in national butter consumption and, as a result, had to remain part of the overall decision to continue the scheme.</P>

Plantations are subject to inspection at the pre-planting, post-planting, maintenance stage &mdash; four-year-old &mdash; and up to the 20 year old stage.  If problems are discovered during inspection, the payment of grants and premiums is withheld until such time as the plantation concerned is brought up to standard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201, 212 and 217 together.  The level of exports of live cattle up to the week ending 9 March 1997 was 10,748 head.  Since the beginning of the year there have been no live exports to third countries. In 1996 approximately 90 per cent of cattle produced in Ireland were slaughtered in Irish abattoirs with 10 per cent exported live.  Under the Government strategy for the food industry, the objective is to maximise the value added aspect of the cattle and beef industry.  Grants are available for investment, market promotion and research in the beef sector.  The deseasonalisation premium which is payable on slaughterings of steers between 1 January and 10 June is also a very important element of this strategy.  The premium has served to even out the level of slaughterings throughout the year, thereby providing a steady throughout of cattle and allowing factories to operate their enterprises and marketing arrangements more efficiently.</P>
      <P>While it is Government policy to maximise the added value potential of the beef industry, a certain quantity of live exports is necessary to maintain competition in the market place.  Following is a breakdown of total cattle slaughterings, live cattle exports and beef exports over the years in question.</P>

      <P>Under the European Communities Beef Carcase Classification Regulations the processor is obliged to give the vendor full details of the weight, carcase classification and other characteristics on the purchase document.

    <P>Price differentials for the various conformation classes are usually applied and they depend on supply and demand at any given time and on the requirements of those outlets which have the greatest influence on the market at any particular time, as well as, of course, the commercial realities of the business.  While the method of payment is a private contractual matter between the purchaser and the vendor I am very much in favour of the price being related to the quality characteristics of the animal.

      <P>As the formulation of policy relating to the general ownership and purchase of land in EU countries is essentially a matter for the relevant national authority in each country, the policies pursued will inevitably vary from one country to another.  However, restrictions, if any, imposed by individual member states on the purchase of land within their territories must, under EU law, be non-discriminatory and apply equally to the member state's own nationals as well as to nationals of other member states.  In addition, any such restrictions must be compatible with the requirements of Council Directive of 24 June 1988 which provides for the free movement of capital between persons resident in member states.  I am not aware of any breaches by other member states of EU law in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>In November 1995 my colleague the Minister for Finance, at the request of the Government commissioned a study of the likely economic implications of European Monetary Union for Ireland.  That study was carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute whose report, published in July 1996, concluded that for the manufacturing sector, which includes the food industry, the impact of European Monetary Union membership would vary depending on whether the United Kingdom joins the system and by reference to company size, trading and export patterns.</P>
      <P>Prospective membership of the European Monetary Union is the latest in a series of challenges for the food industry.  As I have indicated many times in the past the appropriate response to such challenges is to improve competitiveness and to intensify marketing activities.  In this regard there is generous financial assistance available to the food industry under the Structural Fund food sub-programme.</P>

      <P>A submission to establish a new category of extremely disadvantaged areas in Ireland <Col N="203" /> was formally presented to the EU Commission on 9 October 1996.</P>
      <P>The criteria established to facilitate selection of areas for reclassification as extremely disadvantaged were; the areas must be already designated more severly handicapped, and should not extend beyond the boundary of the original MSH designation of 1975; there must be a high proportion of rough grazing land in the areas; the areas must be subject to extreme climatic conditions; to ensure homogeneity of physical characteristics and farming types, areas must be at least 20,000 hectares in extent.</P>
      <P>All potential areas were considered in light of the above criteria when the submission was being prepared.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission is carrying out a technical examination of the submission, involving discussions with my Department.  Until this process has been completed, it is not possible to say for certain which areas will be approved for reclassification as extremely disadvantaged.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate to comment on the inclusion or otherwise of specific areas in the submission prior to final approval being received from the Commission.</P>
      <P>I expect that a decision on the extremely disadvantaged areas will be forthcoming in 1997.  Since the proposal envisages additional payments to farmers in the new areas, the implementation of the measures will not involve a separate application from farmers but rather a top-up on the normal application in respect of the relevant schemes.  I have ensured that funding will be available for this scheme within the overall Structural Funds allocation.</P>

      <P>The request to which the Deputy refers is still under consideration in the context of current developments in relation to fleet policy under the general framework of the European Union multi-annual guidance programmes, MGP for the fishing fleet.</P>
      <P>The particular circumstances of the case require that it be considered in the light of overall fleet policy objectives and constraints.  The forthcoming Fisheries Council on 14 April may clarify the position in relation to MGP III and MGP IV and following the Council I would hope to be in a position to expedite a decision in this case.</P>
      <P>It had been hoped that decisions on this case and many other outstanding cases could have been made last December but this did not prove possible in the light of developments at EU level.</P>

      <P>As I stated in the House on 13 March 1997 a fully complaint marine emergency helicopter was expected to be in service at Shannon Airport by the middle to end of March 1997.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that a fully compliant helicopter, with autohover, was delivered to Shannon Airport on Sunday, 23 March 1997.  Crew training and formal certification by the Irish Aviation Authority are due to be completed tomorrow.  On this basis I understand that the aircraft will be fully certificated and operational by the end of this month.</P>

      <Quest>if the Waterford Harbour Authority recently sold a site at Merchant's Quay, Waterford, to Bus Éireann; if this site was advertised for sale publicly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Plans by Waterford City Council for the road network on the north side of the City Bridge necessitated the relocation of Bus Éireann's offices and terminal to the South Quays which had not been used by Waterford Harbour Commissioners for shipping purposes for this last decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The site was not advertised for sale.  The agreement with CIE reflected the special circumstances which involved the move from the location adjoining the railway station and the special value of the South Quays site because of its proximity to the station.  I am satisfied that the consideration <Col N="208" /> received for the site more than equalled its market value.</P>
    <P>In response to a request from Waterford Harbour Commissioners, under section 159 of the Harbours Act, 1946, my predecessor indicated his approval in October 1993 for the sale of the site. The deeds of conveyance were finally signed and sealed by my Department on 10 April 1996.</P>
