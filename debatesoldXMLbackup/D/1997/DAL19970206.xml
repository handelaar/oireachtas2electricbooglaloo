      <P>It is proposed to take No. 19, Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance (resumed); No. 7c on the supplementary Order Paper, a technical motion concerning the tribunal of inquiry into alleged payments by Dunnes Stores and No. 7b on the supplementary Order Paper, the motion concerning the tribunal of inquiry into the alleged payments by Dunnes Stores.  Nos. 7c and 7b shall be taken at 1.15 p.m. and the Order shall resume thereafter.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 7c and 7b shall be moved and debated together and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 2.15 p.m. by one question. Speeches shall be confined to the Taoiseach and to the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil party and the Progressive Democrats party; and shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case.</P>

      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with Nos. 7b and 7c satisfactory and agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Government Whip for his early morning telephone calls and co-operation on those matters.  There are still a number of matters to be concluded on this issue.  Fianna Fáil is anxious to make sure we can reach agreement on these matters before they are debated today.  We have received short notice on them, which I understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make three points.  First, I thank the Government for changing the position whereby the Taoiseach was to receive all reports.  It is more appropriate that the Clerk of the Dáil receives them if the tribunal is to be independent. As it is a political inquiry, it is better that he receives the reports.  The second issue relates to the timing of the report.  I am not satisfied that it will be published ten days after oral presentations, based on what happened to Judge Buchanan's investigations.  It could take several weeks before oral presentations begin.  Perhaps that is <Col N="854" /> the intention; if it is not, I cannot see why it cannot be removed.</P>
    <P>Third, whoever else may be involved in this inquiry it started based on matters concerning former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry.  It seems incredible that we are setting up a tribunal to investigate these matters, yet the person who triggered the investigation is not mentioned in the terms of reference. That seems an extraordinary oversight, or perhaps it is not.  Will the Taoiseach deal with these matters, if not now, during the morning so that we can unite on this inquiry in the House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is happy to agree that the Clerk of the Dáil should receive the report.  The original terms of reference simply provided that the Taoiseach would receive the report and immediately publish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the beef tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no question of the Taoiseach having the opportunity to issue his own statement about the report, as happened in the case of a previous tribunal report.  This was for immediate dissemination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to assuage the concerns which were expressed, the Government is happy that the Clerk of the Dáil rather than anyone else should be the recipient and publisher of the report.  It does not make any difference.</P>
      <P>As far as the second point is concerned, the formula for the interim report following the hearings is the same one adopted in respect of the hepatitis C tribunal.  The reporting mechanism has worked well in that case and the Government does not see any need to change it but, needless to say, the Opposition can make its case on that matter in the debate.</P>
      <P>As to the third matter, a number of names have been mentioned as recipients of money.  They have not been named publicly but have been referred to and suggested in many conversations. One name was mentioned in a publication.  Given that Deputy Lowry has acknowledged the position, made a public statement and co-operated with the Buchanan report &mdash; as is acknowledged in the report &mdash; there is no need to single out any one name.  It is important that the terms of reference of the inquiry should be neutral and should refer to all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the terms of reference cover all recipients of funds, including any funds which may have been received by Deputy Lowry.  It would be invidious to pick out one name given that many other names have been mentioned both publicly and privately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government is establishing a tribunal of inquiry because it is time the air was cleared on this matter. We are all under investigation in this tribunal even though the genesis of this inquiry is what is known as &ldquo;the Michael Lowry affair&rdquo;.  There are issues surrounding his tenure of office and other matters which Deputy Lowry referred to on 19 December which should be dealt with by the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the Government is proceeding is akin to having Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien's committee sit at the same time as the hepatitis C tribunal, and we know how crazy that would have been.  It is proposed that Mr. Justice Buchanan's investigation will stay in place, even though he has no powers, and if he misses a public servant, the tribunal cannot inquire into him. If he misses a public servant or a politician&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Public servants are not covered in the terms of reference.  It is only if Mr. Justice Buchanan, having gone through the list, identifies a public servant that he or she can be dealt with by the tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be as if the hepatitis C tribunal could only look into the Hederman-O'Brien inquiry.  If that was all it could do the truth would never have come out.  I ask the Government to include specific reference to Deputy Lowry and the issues surrounding his statement to this House on 19 December, to include public officials in the terms of reference and to stand down the Buchanan inquiry.  I do not believe we need two inquiries running at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference include any payments made to Deputy Lowry at any time, including the ones acknowledged and contained in the report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The considerations, motives and circumstances for such payments are also encompassed and, in so far as any claim is made that the payments were normal income which was taxable, that matter is encompassed by &ldquo;considerations, motives and circumstances&rdquo; for the payments. That is a comprehensive definition of any motive, whether income, the creation of income which is taxable, a payment as a gift which is taxable in a different way or a political donation, which is in a different category again.  Any and all of those categories of payment are encompassed <Col N="856" /> in the terms of reference.  The attempt to single out one name, when everyone in this House knows that many others have been mentioned, seems to me to spring from a political motivation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than from a concern about the terms of reference.  It is clear that those terms do encompass any payments made to Deputy Lowry and an attempt to single out his name from the others mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is simply designed to create a bias in the terms of reference in respect of one individual.  I believe that is not the appropriate way to handle any tribunal which is supposed to be neutral in its operations and comprehensive in its examinations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, Deputy Harney seems to be under the misapprehension that the tribunal will be constrained from inquiring beyond the contents of the second instalment of the Buchanan report, which will deal with relevant persons or entities who are in a position of public trust, other than politicians.  That is simply not true.  The positions in paragraph (b) of the terms of reference clearly indicate that a resolution of this House will decide on the matters which are to be investigated by the tribunal in respect of relevant persons other than politicians and their families.  We can frame that resolution as comprehensively as we wish &mdash; to go beyond the Buchanan report, to be confined to certain matters within the report, or in whatever way we wish to frame that further order of reference for the tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear to me that the problems with regard to the cost of tribunals in the past &mdash; there have been some notably expensive tribunals of which all Members are cognisant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems with regard to cost arose because of the absence of specificity in <Col N="857" /> regard to the matters to be investigated.  A general trawl on the part of the tribunal was invited&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that led to cost and to a lot of irrelevant matters being the subject of expensive legal investigation, whereas if more focused terms of reference had been chosen, that unnecessary problem would not have arisen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe, and I think the House will agree, that the second part of the Buchanan report will provide us with the means of ensuring that the further inquiry which we may require the tribunal to undertake in regard to persons other than politicians will be properly focused on the problems we wish to see brought to light and will not invite the tribunal to engage in an expensive, extensive and never-ending examination of matters which are not properly defined in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has already done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Deputy probably will, on reflection, understand that matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no gain whatever in suspending the remaining work of the Buchanan inquiry.  Judge Buchanan is half way through the examination of a report.  He has picked out one category&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and will now look at the second category.  It would be an extremely uneconomic use of time and expertise to bring in a second entity to examine work which Judge Buchanan is already half way through.  It is my understanding that his inquiry will be completed in no more than a month and probably less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, these matters can best be sorted out between the Whips if they can reach agreement and they have made <Col N="858" /> a certain amount of progress.  I am glad the Taoiseach acknowledged the inquiry should be an independent one.  The wording, that any tribunal be asked to report on an interim basis not later than the tenth day of any oral hearings to the Taoiseach and that any matters which the tribunal believes should be drawn to the attention of the Taoiseach at that stage, including any matters relating to the terms of reference, was very political.  I am glad the Taoiseach has changed his view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not to be trusted with this issue.  Dermot knows too much about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that the Buchanan inquiry was on the same basis as the hepatitis C tribunal.  Whether it was right or wrong, the Taoiseach initiated the Buchanan inquiry and it involved a great deal of work. Surely what Judge Buchanan found out, that this is extremely complicated and will be very time consuming, should not be ignored.  It is not like the hepatitis C tribunal where people had to explain themselves.  In this case we do not know who will give evidence, what cross-referencing will have to be done and how hundreds of items are to be tracked down.  How, therefore, can the Taoiseach use the basis of a tribunal that is entirely different &mdash; we know that from Judge Buchanan's work?  I ask the Taoiseach to consider, in the next few hours, the provision that the tribunal should report in ten days.  If the chairman of the tribunal were to start calling evidence on the first day, that might be different, but how can he do so before he does the administrative work, and surely, given what Judge Buchanan has said, the administrative work will take a long time? The logical conclusion is that the ten day rule in respect of oral hearings is unreasonable because the initial work could take weeks or months.  I ask the Taoiseach to find an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern is making a very good case against Deputy Harney's suggestion that we should not continue the Buchanan process to its conclusion.  It is clear from what Deputy Ahern says that he acknowledges there is administrative work to be done in terms of assembling information, and an adversarial tribunal with counsel representing everybody is not the best way of doing that preliminary administrative work.  It would be better, as I think Deputy Ahern agrees, if Judge Buchanan were allowed to complete his task so that that administrative work will be done in the most economic way possible so that the tribunal will be able to concentrate on the matters it needs to investigate.  It should be noted that, logically, what Deputy Ahern is saying points in the opposite direction to what Deputy Harney has suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach answer my question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="859" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, of course.  I allowed him to make his interventions in the way he wished; he should afford me the same courtesy.  I will say what I wish to say, as the Deputy will in his turn.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the matter, what we are talking about is a report from the tribunal on the number of parties to be represented at the tribunal, the best estimate of the likely duration of the tribunal and any other matters the tribunal wishes to draw to the attention of the Clerk of the Dáil.  Given the number of parties likely to be represented at the tribunal, that are likely to want to be considered for representation at the tribunal, the tenth day of oral hearings, which, on the assumption that the tribunal sits five days a week, is approximately two weeks into the period of oral hearings, is not a very long delay.  Furthermore, it is the case that if the tribunal wishes to make an earlier report on these matters, it can do so, because the tribunal is simply asked to report not later than the tenth day of oral hearings.  If we put our confidence in the tribunal and in the distinguished judge who is being asked to undertake it, it is important that we should allow him at least the leeway of up to ten days of oral hearings to decide when he is in a position to make this report.  We do not want a situation where he has to make a report after five days, if the Deputy had his way, and because he says he cannot actually make a final report we have to change the terms of reference to allow him to make a later report.  That would be a waste of his time and a waste of parliamentary time.  The ten day period is a prudent period to allow him.  If he wished to report earlier, he can do so.  That is my considered view on that matter.  I listened both in the House and in the consultations I had with the Opposition earlier today to their point of view on these matters and this is my considered response.</P>

      <P>Let us not attempt now to discuss the substance of a motion that has yet to come before the House and which, I understand, will be part of deliberations between the Whips in the meantime.  All we are discussing this morning is setting out the procedural arrangements for taking this motion.  The details should be left until later.  I want the Deputy to abide by that in his interventions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that.  In his efforts to emphasise differences between what I said and what Deputy Harney said, the Taoiseach has, perhaps, answered my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it then that the work already done by Judge Buchanan, which relates largely to political donations, can be taken into account by the chairman of the tribunal?  On that basis will oral evidence on that aspect start immediately?  That seems the logical conclusion of what the Taoiseach said.  If that is the case, I have no difficulty with the ten days.  If the Taoiseach <Col N="860" /> did not say that, I am back to my original point.  Judge Buchanan did nine or ten weeks' work, some of which was done over Christmas, and I thank him for his work but, effectively, he got nowhere.  If the new tribunal is to go over the same work there will not be a report to this House until some time in April.  One Member on the Government side gloated last night about that timing.  He may or may not be right; that is for him to judge.  The Taoiseach knows what I am referring to.  It has been reported to the Government Whip and others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important point.  If Judge Buchanan's work can be taken into account by the chairman he can move straight to oral hearings on the political aspects.  Is that correct? If it is not correct, we will not have a report to this House until at least the end of April.  Will the Taoiseach clarify that position, if not now, before we agree the terms of reference?  It seems a reasonable request to make.  My legal advice is that the way it is written is very poor and not in the interests of the tribunal.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is arguing for one formulation of the terms of reference, which have not yet been circulated, and I am arguing for the existing terms of reference.  Therefore, we are getting to the substance of the matter.  I would like to be as helpful as I can to the Deputy.  It will be a decision for the tribunal itself, but it will be able to take the existing Buchanan report and use that as material on which to start work straight away and, when it receives the second instalment, to take that into account.  The issue of when oral hearings start will be a matter for the tribunal, not for this House.  If we set up an independent tribunal, it is important that it be independent both as to what it does and as to what it finds, but also as to its method of operation.  I cannot answer the question as to when oral hearings will start, and the Deputy should not ask me because if I attempted to answer, I would trespass on the independence of the tribunal.  That will be a matter for the tribunal and Mr. Justice McCracken. Deputy Ahern knows that perfectly well. Obviously there will be arrangements to be made in regard to the establishment of the tribunal, where the hearings will take place, physical arrangements, staffing arrangements.  All of that will take some time anyway.  That does not mean, however, that considerable preparatory work will not be done in parallel with it.  I cannot, for all <Col N="861" /> those reasons which are matters for which the tribunal will have to take primary responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As he said in the report.  Some of the names occur 500 or 700 times in the telephone directory.  He could not establish to whom the payments were made and he could not talk to bank managers.  Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that all the matters dealt with in Deputy Lowry's statement to the House on 19 December in relation to his tenure of office as a Minister and revenue matters will be dealt with by the tribunal of inquiry?</P>
      <P>Why will the Government not now stand down the Buchanan inquiry?  It is a complete waste of time.  The public will not understand why two inquiries are taking place at the same time, and they have every reason not to.

The case being made by the Deputy that the Buchanan report was a failure is actually the reverse of the facts.  It represents a prudent way of collecting voluntary information which now provides the basis for the use of compulsory powers in respect of the remaining information which needs to be obtained.</P>

They could say, for example, that the <i>Nenagh Guardian</i> should be read but that there was no need to read the <i>Tipperary Star;</i> that the <i>Western People</i> should be read but that there was no need to read the <i>Mayo News</i> and that there were allegations in an American newspaper.</P>

      <P>Two days ago the Taoiseach said we would hear from the Government about the terms of reference that day.  Yesterday, a Cheann Comhairle, you kindly allowed me to raise the matter with the Tánaiste who said we would know them after a Cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon.  I was informed at about 6 p.m. yesterday that we would have the terms of reference shortly.  Thanks to the work of the Government Whip who contacted me a number of times last night I got the terms of reference at about 11.30 p.m.  We spent until about 2 a.m. dealing with this matter with the legal advice we could get as an Opposition party.</P>
      <P>We intended to meet here at 8 a.m. today but we had to sit outside until about 8.30 a.m.  We had a very limited amount of time to deal with the matter.

    <P>If Judge Buchanan's work is, as the Taoiseach says, very useful and beneficial there is no need for the new tribunal to redo it.

The Taoiseach's great Buchanan I report only identified 50 per cent of the money which Fine Gael received.  How can the Taoiseach tell us that a report that could only identify 50 per cent of what he himself admitted he received was adequate and a success?  The only Deputy referred to in the Buchanan report is Deputy Michael Lowry.  Were it not for the article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 29 November 1996 we would not be establishing a tribunal today.  I do not understand why we must have another resolution of this House, after Buchanan II, before public officials are included in the terms of reference.  That is unnecessary and the Taoiseach should consider that matter.  It is wrong and is unfair.  If some public official slips through the Buchanan net the tribunal will not be able to inquire into that particular person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned last Thursday, I referred to the inconsistency between the two Opposition parties and between members of the main Opposition party in terms of their reaction to the budget.  Fianna Fáil claimed the budget is of no assistance to those in the lower income group while the Progressive Democrats said it is of no benefit to those in the middle income group.  Members of Fianna Fáil put forward both points of view. What worries me most is that two parties which aspire to forming a future Government should hold such diverse views on the important matter of whether the economy is being properly handled in the long and short-term interests of the public.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government have struck the right balance.  If the parties in Opposition were in Government during an election year would they do what they suggested the Government should have done in this budget? Would they hand out money to everyone to buy votes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are willing to do this, they have no part to play in Government during the foreseeable future.  That is the kind of attitude which left the country in bondage for 15 years, made it subservient to other countries and treated the public as second class citizens: we could not hold up our heads because of what had happened in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If further proof is needed, one has only to look at other jurisdictions.  I am not an economist but the one golden rule I have learned is that if the economy is doing well one does not throw more money at it.  Economic experts throughout the world marvel at our economic performance, and this speaks volumes.  If the reverse was the case, what would the Opposition parties say?  Those parties should address their very obvious problem. Given that they say the opposite to what economists throughout the world are saying about our economy, I would like to know where they are going, what their answers are and what <Col N="871" /> they intend to do if they are returned to Government. It would be dangerous to return them to Government given their past performance in office.  The public recognises that the Opposition parties have a very serious credibility problem and knows full well it is not in its interests to sink the economy to buy votes.  This sort of policy does nothing for the credibility of those in public life.</P>
    <P>The budget is caring, well focused and conscious of the needs of the country in the medium and longterm.  The economy has been managed in an exemplary way in recent years.  The function of Opposition parties is to oppose but one would expect them to adopt a balanced approach.  Very few countries have enjoyed the same level of economic success as this country in recent years.</P>
    <P>The budget has something for everyone.  It gives an incentive to the unemployed to seek work and to employers to take on more employees, while the reductions in PRSI and taxation encourage those at work to proceed in a positive fashion.  I do not understand how one Opposition party can say too much money was spent while the other believes not enough money was spent.  What exactly does this mean?  Does it mean one party would spend more and the other would spend less?  Would they pay out more by way of income tax concessions and, if so, to whom would they pay them and at what cost?</P>
    <P>What would have been the effect of that?  Would it have been for any purpose other than to gain electoral supremacy in an election year?  The Opposition should talk positively about this budget because its parties have a role to play in promoting Ireland's image at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance, my departmental colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Government in general for producing a blueprint that will lead this country into the next millennium in a positive and constructive way.  Future generations will look back with pride and say that the right measures were taken at this time and the correct balance struck.  They will savour the fruits of the positive decisions taken now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the budget debate.  I am concerned about a number of problems currently facing the country.  The Government had an opportunity to contain expenditure over the past two years.  If it had adhered to its self-imposed targets it would have had an additional £500 million to give back to hard-pressed taxpayers.  The Government should have been more responsible in relation to expenditure, given that the national debt is currently in excess of £30 billion and set to increase by an additional £2 billion arising out of this budget.  That is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people will agree that the biggest problem currently facing the country is our huge national debt.  Our first priority is to meet our requirements in that regard and make the necessary payments.  That is an enormous burden <Col N="872" /> which I have referred to in the past as a ball and chain around this country's neck in terms of taxpayers getting real value for money by way of major tax reform.  If we can address that problem we will be in a position to address the other related issues.</P>
    <P>Much play was made by the Government of social welfare increases in the budget but on examination it is obvious that it contains little for social welfare recipients.  There was a public outcry last year over the miserable social welfare increases and that is the case this year also.  We have heard a great deal about increases in child benefit but child dependants of social welfare recipients, who may have received a miserable £3 increase, did not receive anything.  There are other such examples in the budget, including the reduced entitlement to the butter voucher scheme.</P>
    <P>Much play was made by successive Governments of funding for our health services.  Hospital services are currently facing a serious crisis. People awaiting urgent elective surgical procedures must wait months before they are seen for consultation.</P>
    <P>Another crisis facing this area is the threatened industrial action by nurses.  From speaking to many nurses, who are professional and caring individuals, I know they do not wish to take industrial action but are being forced to do so by the Government.  Many hospital procedures have been cancelled because of the threatened strike. Patients have been notified but they have not been given alternative dates for those procedures. That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to urgently address this matter by responding to the demands of the nurses' unions which are warranted because of the pressures experienced by the nursing profession. The threatened strike will cause further chaos if it occurs, and the longer the Government allows the issue to go on without a resolution, the greater the problems we will face in our hospital services.</P>
    <P>The Government should think about the plight of an elderly person who has waited 12 or 18 months to be called for an elective procedure and who was informed in the past number of days that the appointment is cancelled due to the threatened industrial action by nurses and that an alternative date will be given in due course.  That procedure has probably been put back a number of months rather than weeks.  Hospital administrators should now take the necessary action to notify patients awaiting elective surgical procedures that they have been cancelled due to the threatened industrial dispute.  The Government should intervene at this late stage and take the necessary action to resolve this dispute and prevent further chaos in our hospital services. There are long waiting lists for urgent treatment in our health services.  The position is particularly serious for the elderly for whom there is insufficient long stay accommodation or community support services.  We should ensure services are <Col N="873" /> available for the elderly because they have paid into the system, participated in the workplace and helped the economy develop.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I received a letter from a constituent about the appalling treatment his 83-year-old uncle received in one of the main accident and emergency hospitals on the north side of the city. He spent hours waiting on a trolley and was then threatened with discharge even though he was very sick.  This is not an unusual letter to receive from a constituent.  People encounter similar difficulties in hospitals, particularly in Dublin, on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The Government is well aware of these difficulties. A number of meetings have been held with those who run the services and they have clearly outlined the problems.  Periodically the Minister throws a few pounds at the problem but that will not solve it.  Health professionals have described what is provided as &ldquo;appropriate step-down facilities&rdquo;.  I urge the Government to address the problems which occur all year round in our accident and emergency hospitals.  During the winter months an outbreak of influenza puts pressure on hospital beds and during the summer months wards are closed because of annual holidays.  A properly planned programme must be devised to meet the demands of our accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>A number of Dublin hospitals have been closed recently, but the beds have not been transferred to the new hospitals.  The population of Dublin, particularly in centre areas, is increasing.  The Meath, Adelaide and National Children's hospitals are due to close and services are to move to Tallaght Hospital, the plans for which are already being revised.  If difficulties are being encountered with the physical plans for that hospital at this early stage of its development, perhaps we should reconsider the reports on the provision of services after the three hospitals close.  Additional funding is required for extra car parking facilities at Tallaght Hospital even though it has not opened yet.  The original plans did not provide for sufficient car parking at the hospital.  As similar difficulties arose in respect of the hospital in Mullingar and Beaumont &mdash; relatively new developments &mdash; I am baffled the same could happen with Tallaght Hospital.  Additional funding has also been sought for an extension to the accident and emergency department because the proposal in the original plans will not meet the demand.</P>
    <P>The Minister should acknowledge the increase in population in inner city areas, which is obvious from the number of cranes in the skyline, and provide adequate hospital services to meet the increasing demands.  The Eastern Health Board, as the statutory health authority, has indicated a desire to purchase the Meath Hospital.  That would help fill a vacuum in hospital services, including the provision of a possible accident and emergency department, in the inner city.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister to closely monitor the development of our hospitals.  If we miss the boat <Col N="874" /> now, the buildings will be sold and we will not be able to adopt a proactive approach in regard to our health services.  Will the Minister communicate with me in regard to the Meath Hospital and the need for additional beds and funding to provide health services for the citizens of Dublin?</P>
    <P>There are also long waiting lists for orthodontic treatment.  Some people have been waiting years for treatment.  As we have the expertise in this area, it is only a matter of utilising it properly. There should be greater flexibility in the system. People with disabilities may not require medication but may periodically require appliances, in some instances only every three or four years. These can be expensive.  A mother contacted me recently in connection with her son who requires a simple foam ring for his head to keep him in balance and prevent him from going under water while swimming, an exercise he enjoys and the only kind that gives him full movement.  It costs £75.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the chief executive officers of the health boards must look at the cost of such appliances.  Medical card cover must be provided for those who need them, regardless of considerations of their income levels.  The present strict guidelines oblige some to appeal to the chief executive officers who consider their income levels. While these could be relatively high, allowance is not made for other demands faced by a household with a disabled person.</P>
    <P>Are we denying cover to the profoundly handicapped children of parents whose incomes exceed medical card eligibility guidelines and who require much medical care and attention, whether it be institutionalised or at home?  Are we compelling them to make medical card applications, which include supplying the local director of community care with information on the disability of the individual and the income of the household? Where the director has no option but to deny a medical card they must then appeal to the chief executive officer.  They are obliged to undertake these procedures even though it is recognised that their child will require long-term medication and intermittent use of appliances.  Much time is also wasted in this, as public representatives, health board members, programme managers and chief executive officers become involved.  The issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>When elderly people in need of appliances are discharged from hospital they must wait for an assessment by occupational therapists, which takes time.  It is crazy to allow this, especially when the hospital authorities identify the appliances required.  I have raised this matter at local health board level and progress is being made.  However, a direction from the Government would save money and time.  It would also ensure more comfort for those discharged from hospitals and in need of appliances.</P>
    <P>Before I was elected to this House I heard name calling of Ministers for Health within the health system, which was appalling.  I will not engage in it because we should focus on the provision <Col N="875" /> of services.  The present industrial unrest is exacerbating the chaos in the health services.  The Government should consider the points I have raised, rather than throwing money at problems. Much research has already been done.  It is now time to put the step-care provisions in place, such as the step-down facilities and the other matters to which I have referred.  We must also ensure there are adequate places to meet the demand for health services.</P>
    <P>Last week I tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister for Justice regarding the prison service.  I was shocked to learn that 4,000 prisoners got early release while 4,780 prisoners availed of temporary release.  We have a serious problem with crime, including the lack of appropriate detention places, especially for juveniles.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that there is such a vast number of early and temporary releases.  Prison staff have raised the matter, and the appalling situation regarding overcrowding.  Rather than delaying projects, such as the building of Castlerea and the delay in the use of units at the Curragh, which I pushed for, the Government must indicate that serious attempts are being made to ensure that perpetrators of crime found guilty by the courts will go to prison, will stay there and will pay their debt to society.  We must give this message clearly.  It is not there at present and it is farcical to read of the amenities and facilities which are available to prisoners but not to law abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting this week in a Christian Brothers school in my constituency which has 800 pupils.  The brothers have put a huge amount of the trustees' money back into the school and they are seeking a gymnasium which would cost the small sum of £500,000.  The school has a staff complement of 60 and three physical education teachers but no gymnasium for 800 pupils and no changing or shower facilities.  I informed the meeting that the prisoners in Mountjoy Jail have ball facilities in the yard, a physical education teacher to instruct them individually or on a group basis and gymnasium and training facilities.  The current Minister has also provided swimming facilities for them.  It is difficult to weigh it up.</P>
    <P>The response to one of my questions to the Minister last week in relation to the library facilities included the list of the daily and weekly magazines and newspapers which are available to prisoners.  The list included <i>The Irish Times</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Star</i>, the <i>Sun</i>, <i>The Farmers' Journal</i>, <i>Ireland's Own</i>, <i>Woman's Weekly</i> and the <i>Beano</i> and the <i>Dandy</i>.  When I outlined the list to the parents' council, the meeting erupted in laughter.  There is something wrong with the Government if gymnasium and other facilities are made available to prisoners but not to 800 young pupils.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas in my constituency where the Government is not spending money appropriately, particularly in relation to the provision <Col N="876" /> of public service vehicles and the development of the public service network.  I encourage the Minister to respond to my proposals regarding the development of the DART service.</P>

      <P>I wish to respond to some of the points made by Opposition Deputies.  Deputy Cowen asserted that the budget took little regard of considerations relating to the proposal to join economic and monetary union a most important policy issue for the country in the years ahead. However, I do not understand why the Deputy made that assertion and I reject it.</P>
      <P>The criteria for entry to economic and monetary union includes a serious reduction in the debt towards 60 per cent of GDP.  Under the Government the debt percentage has fallen from 88 per cent to 73 per cent and it is targeted to fall to 69 per cent at the end of 1997.  By any yardstick, we are comfortably complying with that requirement. The next criterion involves inflation.  The inflation rate which we must be beneath is approximately 2.5 per cent and our inflation rate is approximately 2.2 per cent.  It is not a matter for complacency but it is well under control.  We must have a general Government deficit less than 3 per cent and the target this year is 1.5 per cent. Most other EU states which are hoping to be among the first group of countries in economic and monetary union are having great difficulty keeping below 3 per cent.  However, Ireland's target is 1.5 per cent.  The other criteria include stable, low interest rates.  Historically, Ireland has never been in better shape on that issue.  A stable currency remaining within the EMS bands is also required.  Ireland is at the top of the band.  The Deputy's assertion that the budget disregarded considerations relating to economic and monetary union is not true and I reject it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowen also stated that the tax package was not significant in light of the current tax buoyancy.  The package, at almost £300 million this year, is the largest in the history of the State. The Deputy's comment that it is not significant and his party spokesman, Deputy McCreevy's statement on budget day that it was dangerously generous highlights an inconsistency which is difficult to defend.  Deputy Cowen said the public is especially disappointed with the continuing tapering of mortgage interest relief.  He must have a short memory because that concept was introduced by Deputy Bertie Ahern when he was Minister for Finance and it is generally considered fair and reasonable by all parties in the House.  I do not understand the Deputy's criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowen said that the general increases in social welfare should be limited to the cost of <Col N="877" /> living.  However, Deputy Joe Walsh said he welcomed many aspects of the social welfare package but that much more was required.  I fail to see a consistency between those two distinguished Fianna Fáil Front Bench spokesmen.  If one took a position half way between the two, we must be about right.  The social welfare package indicates compassion in addition to working within affordable limits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh criticised the Government for failing to implement in full the measures proposed by the commission on social welfare. However, the Government has made more significant progress on that than any of its predecessors. It is totally committed to its implementation within the timeframe of Partnership 2000. The Deputy also said the Government, obsessed with self-preservation, had tried to maximise tax giveaways in an election year.  Deputy Cowen said the tax package was not significant but Deputy Walsh said the Government maximised it for election rather than economic reasons.  The inconsistency is startling.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen referred to the explosion in public expenditure and the miserable reduction in the standard tax rate.  Effectively, the standard rate reduction is not 1p, as he stated, but 2p because of the reduction of 1 per cent in PRSI. While I admit and accept that public expenditure is higher than the Government's target and it is a reasonable criticism to make, it is not consistent, relative to the facts and the performance of previous Governments, to refer to it as an explosion.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, who has a strong interest in the development of small and medium sized businesses, also commented on the failure to provide more corporation tax reductions.  I do not understand the logic of the Deputy's argument.  The Government has, over three budgets, reduced the corporation tax rate for small businesses from 40 per cent to 28 per cent.  That is far and away the most significant focused tax reduction made by any Government in recent times.  It is directly focused on small businesses with profits of up to £50,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen also said the Government is pushing our economic and monetary union qualification criteria to the limit.  I already dealt with that aspect and it does not bear serious examination. While I am not complacent about the matter, we will have some difficulty on the inflation front because the rate at which the economy is growing is bound to stoke up some inflationary factors.  That is certainly occurring in the construction industry in Dublin.  I am not in the least complacent about it.  The Government is focused on the economic and monetary union criteria which we will meet reasonably comfortably. Deputy O'Dea referred to inflation as a serious problem and I take his point, but nonetheless he has exaggerated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey commented on the failure of my party to impact seriously on the budget deliberations. The budget sub-committee of the Cabinet which discussed much of the framework for <Col N="878" /> the budget &mdash; obviously the Cabinet made the final decisions &mdash; comprised the leader of my party, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and myself representing Fine Gael, the Leader of the Labour Party, the Tánaiste, and the Minister for Finance representing the Labour Party and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa representing Democratic Left.  There was proportionate representation of the parties in Government and the overall package was roughly in line with that proportion of 3:2:1.  One could argue that matter for ever, but I reject out of hand the notion that Fine Gael did not have a serious hand in framing the budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill said that we should do more for the needy and make more tax cuts.  In fairness to Fianna Fáil, it did not make the case for massive tax cuts while at the same time doing more for the needy.  The Progressive Democrats proposals avoid all the hard choices in terms of spending, yet favour a massively greater tax package.  I do not see how that party will make a comfortable partner; the Fianna Fáil Party is much more responsible in its approach to those matters.  The Progressive Democrats received much favourable comment by the public &mdash; anybody who favours massive tax cuts will find themselves in that position &mdash; but that party will be uncomfortable to deal with if it insists on doing more for the needy while making massive tax cuts.  That would be impossible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill referred to Progressive Democrats budgets in the past, but there is no such thing because the Progressive Democrats Party was the junior partner in Government with Fianna Fáil.  The assertion that it delivered more tax cuts in less favourable economic circumstances does not stand up because the present tax package, which has been criticised as too generous, is the largest by far in the history of the State.  The Deputy said that if Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats had remained in power the higher rate of tax would be 40 per cent.  I do not know if that would be at the expense of the lower rate or how it would be paid for.  Nobody would deny the desirability of reducing tax rates from 48 to 40 per cent and 26 to 20 per cent, but everybody knows that is not possible in the short-term except at the expense of some other area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill said that the tax regime is a barrier to the attraction of multinational companies, but that flies in the face of what is happening at present.  There never were as many international companies setting up in and around this city and to some extent around other large cities.  In the past six months there has been a boom in multinational companies, household names from around the world, setting up here.  Deputy Quill also referred to the lack of Fine Gael influence on the budget, which I have dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue made a plea for more spending in the area which he strongly represents. He sought additional resources in the area of crime prevention, in other words, more spending, yet that is an area in which the Progressive Democrats proposes to make cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon said that there are no specific <Col N="879" /> measures in the budget to reduce the national debt.  The Deputy did not listen to the Minister because for the first time in the recent history of the State the budget provides for such a reduction, and there is much more to be done in that regard in the years ahead.  The Deputy referred to making adequate provision to tackle problems raised by the reduction in EU Structural Funds post 1999.  If he looks at the three year projections he will see that the Minister for Finance has included prudent contingency provisions. It is not easy and it would be very unwise in terms of negotiation to give specific figures for that purpose because that would give away our strong negotiating position.  In terms of the three year projections, even in the final year there is a contingency provision which will, I hope, cushion any such development in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe suggested that the Government, in its tax proposals, should have sought to abolish levies.  I find that surprising because the levies, which amount to 2.25 per cent, were introduced by previous Governments led by Fianna Fáil and the cost of abolishing them would be £400 million in a full year.  While it would be desirable to abolish the levies, and it must be faced up to in some measure in the years ahead, it would have the effect of swallowing up more than the entire package of one year.  The levies impact least on the less well off; the higher one's income the greater the impact of the levies.  Any budget that would seek to abolish the levies would be very one-sided, but I accept the desirability of reducing and ultimately abolishing them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe put forward the proposal to offset pre-trading expenses against tax liabilities for small start-up businesses.  That is being done. He said that corporation tax should be further reduced for small businesses, but the previous reduction in the rate from 40 to 28 per cent over a couple of years is significant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews claims there are no incentives for tourism in the budget.  Tourism prospers most in an economy where there are low interest rates, a stable currency, low inflation, a stabilising factor in terms of wages and costs which results from Partnership 2000, and an expanding economy, all of which are self-evident.  Tourism is prospering and will continue to prosper as long as the Government and its successors continue that framework.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Smith made a plea for the reinstatement and expansion of farmyard pollution schemes as a boost to tourism.  There is a measure in the budget to provide generous capital allowances for farmers investing in such schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seamus Brennan raised the issue of the establishment of an EU compensatory fund to provide assistance to member states suffering in the event of currency turmoil.  That is a double-edged sword because if it were introduced we would also have to contribute.  As ours is a well-managed economy, it would be likely that we would pay into that fund rather than receive payments from it, so that is not a good idea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> Deputy Haughey referred to the stamp duty increase as an anti-Dublin and anti-young people measure.  That is incredible, given that we are removing service charges and RPT, which were both seen to be adversely affecting Dublin.  Those two reductions are the single biggest pro-Dublin measure that any Government has taken in recent times so I reject his suggestions.  I do not know how he can suggest it is anti-young people because stamp duty does not apply to new houses and very few young people buy houses for more than £150,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callely referred to several issues, one of which is prison accommodation.  That is my area and this Government, in a very accelerated prisons programme, will provide 800 additional prison places in just over two years.  That programme is well in hand.</P>
    <P>The leader of Fianna Fáil recently proposed increasing overseas development aid spending significantly.  I welcome that but it is an additional commitment to public expenditure by a party that is criticising us for excessive spending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State saying this Government is opposed to the commitment to increase overseas development aid, in line with Deputy Bertie Ahern's proposal, to between 4 and 5 per cent in the lifetime of the next Government? That is still heading toward the figure of 0.7 per cent overall which is the UN target.  Does the Minister of State object to that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say I objected.  I welcome it in many respects but it is a commitment made by the Deputy's party leader, who criticised the Government for public expenditure excesses. He glibly made a commitment to an additional £52 million under one heading.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Neither was the commitment made in this House.  This relates to spending; this Government, as the Deputy knows, has also committed itself to ultimately achieving the target of 0.7 per cent.  I accept we are a long way from that target.</P>
      <P>On the document referred to as <i>Budget</i> by Deputy Michael McDowell, it is not credible to put a set of figures forward that avoid all the hard choices, apart from introducing the idea of a tax package of £475 million gross in 1997 against the Government's figure of £293 million, which was supposedly too generous.  The method of saving £200 million and contributing to that package is in the most extraordinary document I have ever read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document states that on public service productivity, £55 million is to be saved on the following: a comprehensive deal for the whole public service, a reduction of 3,750 posts that are unspecified, no reduction in Gardaí, teachers or health professionals although they account for well over 50 per cent of the public service and overtime reductions of £30 million, with a particular focus on the prison service, where Deputy <Col N="881" /> O'Donoghue wants to spend further moneys. There is to be a miraculous reduction in live register numbers by control measures, saving £115 million.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to suggest £200 million can be saved without making a single specified hard choice. That is what the Progressive Democrats are offering and they will make very curious partners for a more responsible party like Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I support this outstanding and progressive budget.  This rainbow coalition is working well and has introduced policies that are bringing benefits to all the people.  With a rising tide all boats are being lifted.</P>
      <P>Contrast that with the policies of the Progressive Democrats, where the rich get richer and poor get poorer.  That creates unwelcome divisions within society.  Everybody should share in the wealth and the policies outlined in this budget will give people confidence they will get a fair deal, or, as per the Ford slogan long ago, &ldquo;a square deal&rdquo;.  That is especially true of people on low incomes or welfare.  They deserve the benefits they will get from this budget.  I am delighted social welfare payments have been brought forward to 1 May.  There was a stigma on social welfare recipients although they could not get work because the jobs were not there due to the failure of successive Governments to create a climate for jobs to be created.  Those people depended on social welfare, but in budget after budget, payments were made in August or September while tax changes for people fortunate enough to have work came in during April.  This was a very sore point.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is still the bedrock of the economy and I am delighted with the number of initiatives in farm development.  There is encouragement to pass on farms to younger farmers, relief on stamp duty and various other benefits.  The EU package of grants relating to the control of farm pollution has unfortunately been suspended but I hope it will return.  In the meantime, the tax benefit of 50 per cent in the first year and a further 50 per cent in the following seven years for farmers making investments in farms coupled with REP, will be very important in encouraging others to invest in care for the environment and in modernising agriculture to meet the demands on it without getting too intensive.  Intensive farming may have caused some current problems.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney on his excellent work in Government.  We are fortunate to have a man of his ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be more emphasis on family life. The housewife is entitled to recognition through payments from the State.  I have nothing against the wife who goes out to work; in many instances <Col N="882" /> it is necessary.  However, there seems to be a belief that the housewife at home has nothing else to do, which is wrong.  She is the most important person in the country, particularly when we see problems with young people.  They may not be related to the fact that some mothers cannot stay at home but where the wife can stay at home, she should be encouraged to do so during the years the children need the parents' influence.  There should be a State contribution and Dr. Garret FitzGerald had such an idea.  Unfortunately, it never came to fruition and seems to have been buried somewhere.  The economy has improved and we should protect family life.  In that way we can deal with many current problems.  Multinational companies are flocking to this country. They have confidence in the Government because it has vision and is led by the Leader of Fine Gael.  Such trust is important in business and foreign investors have that trust in the Government.</P>
    <P>The computer and electronics industries are providing thousands of jobs that will give our young people a future.  Companies such as Intel and IBM which are established here have been very successful and provide worthwhile, well paid employment for our skilled young people.  The educational system, particularly the regional colleges, has provided those skills.  While the universities and professions have a role to play, many parents had the foresight to realise that the regional technical colleges would provide young people with the skills for future employment.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges and the institutes of technology have provided the skills for jobs in these companies who have, in turn, sent out the signal that the Irish workforce can produce products comparable to the best in the world.  These multinational companies have no allegiance to the country.  They set up here because they see Ireland as a base where they can manufacture their products and have ready access to European and world markets.  They have confidence in the Government and its Leader.  They no longer see Ireland as a banana republic but a country with skilled young people to take up the jobs they can offer.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be a member of a party of the Government which has brought forward this budget.  I look forward to many budgets in the future from the Government in its present form.</P>

      <P>At two weeks remove from the introduction of the budget and the hype which surrounded it created by the numerous Government handlers, who tried to portray it as a panacea for all the country's ills, it is easier to make a calm reflection on it.  By any judgement of whether it was prudent in terms of the public finances, whether it tackled the jobs crisis for the long-term unemployed, whether it was fair to the family or whether it showed proper concern for the less well off, this budget has been a failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, spoke of the Fine Gael input to the budget.  He rejected <Col N="883" /> any suggestion that it had not played a serious part in framing it.  It is obvious from an examination of the budget that Fine Gael is a bit part player in this sordid theatre that is the tripartite Government.  It is led by the Labour Party, pushed along by Democratic Left and Fine Gael make up the numbers.  It has had no input which is obviously a source of deep concern to its more responsible electorate.</P>

      <P>They would be concerned at the lack of financial prudence in regard to public expenditure shown over the lifetime of this Administration.  When the Government was formed it promised to raise public expenditure by 2 per cent above inflation per year or about 6 per cent in total to date.  There has been an increase in public expenditure of over 20 per cent in that time.  It has lost the opportunities for the radical tax reform which is needed and for a package to look after the less well off.</P>
      <P>The Government talks of the budget as a radical policy.  However, during the term of the Labour Party Minister for Finance there has been a 1 per cent reduction in the standard rate of tax over three budgets.  This at a time when the economy has been booming thanks to the stable foundations for growth provided by Fianna Fáil from 1987.  At a time of unprecedented growth this supposedly reforming Administration has reduced the standard rate by only 1p in the pound.</P>
      <P>As a result of the budget the Government will take in £1 million extra in tax every day.  If there was any serious political will we would be on the brink of eliminating the Exchequer borrowing requirement, thus freezing the amount paid on debt interest, in many cases to foreign banks. Instead, the cost of debt servicing this year is set to rise by £200 million to £2.56 billion &mdash; equivalent to about 50 per cent of income tax revenue. If this coalition Government is re-elected it proposes to borrow a further £2.2 billion.  This is irresponsible and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>All parties should agree in principle to cap the national debt at £30 billion and reduce it.  The national debt was just over £1 billion in 1973; it now stands at £30 billion and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, plans to add another £2 billion by 1999.  It is irresponsible for this generation of politicians to pass such a burden to our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is being done for the family with regard to crime and lawlessness, job creation for the long-term unemployed, assistance for business and agriculture and for social welfare?  The Government gave a 40p per day increase to social welfare recipients, yet it claims this is a great reforming budget.  It was anything but that because the Government had frittered away the opportunities available through irresponsible increases in public expenditure.  This Government <Col N="884" /> lacks a cohesive foreign affairs policy.  The Taoiseach speaks of his goal of working towards a federal Europe.  A Government White Paper on foreign policy was published recently and there was no reference to a federal Europe in it.  Fianna Fáil believes, and it has been the policy of successive Governments through the years, that we should continue to take a pragmatic approach to the development of Europe.  We should actively work for a closer Europe, but not for a federal Europe and what that means for sovereignty.  Europe is very important to us and should be crucial to our foreign policy, along with the reformed United Nations, but this Government speaks with various voices on this area.</P>
    <P>The Government is totally divided on the question of European defence.  It does not have a policy, as was seen in its White Paper, yet the Taoiseach comes into the House and speaks about a common defence policy.  What is involved in a common defence policy?  Mr. Douglas Hurd, former British Foreign Secretary, said that common defence within Europe means that if the Greeks and the Turks go to war over some island in the Aegean Sea in the morning, the rest of Europe will be at war in the afternoon.  The Irish people do not want that, nor do most Labour Party voters. As to what DL voters want, that is a matter for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach speaks on behalf of his Government and says we want common defence.  I reject it.  Fianna Fáil wants to play a role within Europe and the general affairs council.  We want to make our forces available to the EU on the basis as we do to the UN.  We have a proud peacekeeping record with the UN since the early 1960s when at the request of the Security Council we first sent troops to the Congo.  Over 45,000 army personnel and gardaí have served abroad in that time.  We assess individual cases on the need for humanitarian aid, peacekeeping personnel and emergency relief but the Taoiseach wants us to go much further.  He wants us involved in a common defence of Europe.  We will play a role but it should not be that one.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his view of common defence as distinct from the Taoiseach's.  It was ruled out of order on the basis that it impinged on collective Cabinet responsibility.  Of course it is about Cabinet responsibility but the Tánaiste, Taoiseach and Minister for Social Welfare like to speak with different voices and then tell us about the cohesion of the Government.</P>
    <P>Irish people have strong views on the issue of neutrality and are committed to the principle of military neutrality.  There will be no change with Fianna Fáil in Government on the question of military neutrality or the use of our forces and there will no joining in Partnership for Peace and no extension of membership of the Western European Union beyond our present observer status without putting the question to the people in a referendum.  At present, we have an insidious, creeping change by the Tánaiste who is trying <Col N="885" /> to include us in Partnership for Peace and the Taoiseach who wants to go further and bring us into common defence.  That is not the way forward the people want and it is important that we have a clear statement from this Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, questioned the commitment of Deputy Bertie Ahern to overseas development aid, a commitment made at a conference on human rights held recently by Fianna Fáil.  He committed Fianna Fáil in Government to increasing overseas development aid to between 0.4 and 0.5 per cent of GNP as we head towards the target of 0.7 per cent set down by the UN.  He also indicated that matter would be reviewed in the context of increasing it further depending on the growth of the economy.  This is a serious commitment on behalf of the people and reflects their view that we should be sharing our blessings and our growth with those less fortunate around the world.  Every time a request for emergency relief is received, the people, through our non-governmental organisations, subscribe generously.  They will want the Government to act in their interests through taxes on the basis of increasing overseas development aid.  I am proud of that commitment and I worry when I hear Fine Gael querying this commitment through the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney.</P>
    <P>I refer to issues of concern to my constituents which reflect greater concerns in society generally. Ireland recently held the EU Presidency.  It was important that we handled that Presidency well on behalf of the Union and that we used the opportunity to push forward some national interests.  Duty free sales is a matter of major concern in my constituency which affects jobs in the manufacturing and services industries.  During the Presidency the Minister for Finance presided over the Council of Finance Ministers and did not even succeed in getting the duty free issue on the agenda.  One of his back benchers is bleating about the future of duty free sales now that the Presidency is over.  Labour should have done something about duty free sales in our airports during the Presidency.  This matter is of vital importance not only to the hundreds of people in Dublin Airport whose jobs are affected but to the distillers and the manufacturers of other products sold in the duty free shops in Dublin and throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>We should strongly press for an extension of the duty free system past the projected closure date, which is coming fast.  We should not allow ourselves to be sidetracked by some of the larger member states which have particular interests. Ireland is the last country in Europe without a land frontier to the mainland &mdash; the UK is connected through the tunnel &mdash; and duty free facilities are crucial to our tourism trade, airport revenues and employment, and the sales of our manufacturing companies.  Even at this late stage, I appeal for some action or even an indication of interest, which was sadly lacking during the Presidency when the Labour party and the Government <Col N="886" /> had an opportunity to do something about this.</P>
    <P>We had a debate over the last two nights on the present shambles within CIE because of management and board decisions.  The train services available to the people of north County Dublin are appalling.  People attempting to board the train at Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Malahide and Portmarnock are being treated like cattle.  One young lady felt faint because of the overcrowded train at Lusk and had to be taken off.  The service being provided is a disgrace &mdash; it is inadequate, overcrowded, undependable and dangerous from a health point of view.  There have been train derailments; thankfully the incident before Christmas involved an empty DART but it could just as easily have been an overcrowded commuter train at 8.30 a.m.  Something serious must be done but the Government has made no indication of having a policy for upgrading the train service to the people I represent in north County Dublin.  There is a commitment to extend the DART to Malahide &mdash; when that will happen is another day's work &mdash; but that does not take into account the concerns of the rest of my constituents, who are currently not receiving the service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The threatened nurses' strike is of national importance.  How did the Government allow this position to develop?  Why was the strike not settled either in the context of Partnership 2000 or well before it during last autumn?  The negotiation skills shown by the Government have been abysmal.  The 26,000 nurses have a deserving case but they are being abominably treated.  We should not leave things until the last moment in the Labour Court.  I hope the dispute is resolved in the next few days because the last thing we want is a nurses' strike.</P>
    <P>Retired nurses deserve recognition in the resolution of that dispute.  The principles of relativity and indexation have been accepted since the 1960s, when they were introduced by my then colleague, the late George Colley.  It is an important principle for State pensioners generally but it is of crucial importance in the context of the nurses' dispute.  The principles of relativity and indexation for the pensions of retired staff must be recognised and honoured and if they are broken in any settlement it will be a sad day, not just for retired health care staff but for State pensioners generally.  Our retired nursing staff worked hard all their lives in difficult jobs and are entitled to receive recognition from the State for the work they put in on behalf of patients. Their rights as pensioners should be recognised.</P>
    <P>As regards pensions in the health area, the care workers play a crucial role in providing back-up to hospital nursing staff and without their assistance hospitals could not continue.  They are being disgracefully treated in their present pension arrangements.  They receive £1 per week for every year of service, so if one works for 40 years as a care worker your pension will be £40 per week. We are supposed to have a booming economy &mdash;<Col N="887" /> every morning on the radio we hear about various growth patterns and percentage increases &mdash; and we claim to be a caring society, but where is that reflected in our pension schemes for nurses and care workers?</P>
    <P>We are told the matter is being reviewed by the Minister for Health, who will reach a decision before July.  How convenient that it should be postponed until then, when the dogs in the street know that there will be a general election before that.  Those care workers deserve better from the Minister and the Government.  Their legitimate claim should receive serious consideration and I demand that their case get attention.</P>
    <P>The horticulture area appears to be the Cinderella of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The Department is not interested if it does not have four legs but horticulture is an important industry in my constituency and should be as important nationally.  Given the quality of our soil, we should not import vegetables we could grow at home.  Horticulture is an area that needs special attention.  During Fianna Fáil's time in Government a Minister of State was responsible for horticulture, but that was abandoned by the present Government which knows nothing about horticulture.</P>
    <P>Nineteen ninty-five was a very bad year for tomato growers.  Since then they have lobbied continuously and made a very strong case, which has been accepted in principle, for a 50p subsidy per box of tomatoes grown in this country.  That amounted to about £650,000.  Given overall Government expenditure and wastage in so many other areas, and the present growth in the economy, the legitimate claims of the tomato growers should be met.</P>
    <P>One final point relates to security.  The Oberstown complex, which houses many young offenders, some on remand, some in detention, is located in my constituency.  The number of breakouts there is a source of continuing concern and distress to the residents in the area.  The residents have submitted a list of demands to the Government but no action has been taken on them.  One in particular relates to the need for a security fence around the former Trinity House.  I make a special plea to the Government for funding to provide this badly needed security fencing.  It has been requested in Government reports, but it has not been constructed.  If the people of the area are carrying this burden on behalf of the rest of the country, they deserve security and peace of mind in their homes and as they go about their business.  I request that urgent action be taken on the provision of this fencing and the other requests made by the Lusk Community Council on behalf of the residents in the area.</P>
    <P>Two weeks after the hype created by the handlers, this budget can be seen for what it is.  To take 1p off the standard rate of income tax after three budgets is not radical reform.  It is merely a stutter.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</P>
      <P>This budget was introduced in a period of unique economic progress, presided over and well managed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  The figures speak for themselves &mdash; growth rates for 1996 are at 6.1 per cent with a forecast growth rate next year of 5.5 per cent; there was a 9 per cent increase in manufacturing output in 1996 with 10 per cent forecast for next year; an average growth rate in manufacturing output of 11.5 per cent in the 1993-6 period; employment has grown by 150,000 in the past four years and is now at the highest level ever recorded.  In addition, unemployment has declined by 38,000 since 1992, reaching a level of 182,000 this year and forecast to decline further next year.</P>
      <P>While unemployment is still unacceptably high in some parts of Dublin, and especially in parts of my constituency, it is noteworthy that levels of unemployment in Dublin are somewhat above the national average.  However, it does bear saying that in the past year or so quite a number of very spectacular and significant industries have located in Dublin and in the greater Dublin area. That level of progress should be seen in the context of the successful renegotiation of Partnership 2000.  That framework document lays the foundation for a continuation of the huge levels of progress that have been made over the past few years which can continue until the turn of the century and into the new millennium.</P>
      <P>In terms of the tax proposals, it is noteworthy that it is proposed to return to taxpayers in the order of £1,000 million between now and the completion of that programme.  That represents, in practical terms, a tax saving for the average taxpayer in the order of £1,000 over that period. That is very significant.  In this year's budget there is a tax return to taxpayers in the order of £400 million, which means about £400 a year per taxpayer. A married worker with four children will get an increase of about £14 a week.  That is very significant progress by any standards which nobody could seek to diminish or ignore.  It is huge progress and compares very favourably with what has been achieved in the recent and more distant past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Welfare increases in the budget are twice the level of inflation, with an extra sum of £114 million being made available this year.  While the absolute sums which people receive are small, it <Col N="889" /> is fair to point out that welfare changes over the past four or five years have been well ahead of inflation.  Inflation since 1993 was in the order of 10 per cent.  During that period, child benefit increased by 90 per cent, old age pensions increased by 18 per cent and unemployment assistance and benefit increased by 23 per cent. That represents substantial progress in real terms, well ahead of inflation, which nobody should seek to diminish.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased by the child benefit increases which are spectacular and exceptional by any standards.  They are very worthwhile for two reasons.  First, they promote employment and, second, they are pro family.  Those are both very valuable aspects of those changes.</P>
    <P>These spectacular improvements, which have been achieved while the Labour Party has been in Government, have been the target of an unremitting attack from Ireland's only real party of the right, the party which has modelled itself on the policies of Margaret Thatcher.  It is the party with all the answers to our economic problems. Its nostrums are based on a simple recipe &mdash; cut taxation to the bone.</P>
    <P>That is quite appealing at a superficial level but where will the inevitable cuts which must follow the logic of what is being proposed fall?  That party, despite incessant bleating about openness, accountability and other politically correct lingo, will not say where the tax cuts will hit.  Let us have some openness from them on where those cuts are about to fall.  Let us hear it tell public service workers what its preoccupation with excessive spending on the public service means in practice.  Let us hear which jobs in the public service will be lost and which services will be cut back.</P>
    <P>It would not be out of place to carry out a brief examination of the broad dimensions of the budget so that we can see where some of these parameters lie.  Social welfare expenditure next year will be £4,576 million.  Is that party proposing to cut back social welfare?  If the answer is yes, let us hear it and then be told the specifics.  If the answer is no, it means that 30 per cent of the budget will be left static.  Is it going to cut back next year's health expenditure of £2,424 million? If it proposes to do that it is quite in conflict with the caring facade it presents to the public when it talks about health concerns.  Is it saying that education, the great source of future prosperity, should receive less?  Is it really saying that the foundation stone of progress should be reduced? Let us hear from that party on those questions because those three main headings in the budget account for 58 per cent of taxpayers' money.  If it proposes to make cutbacks in those areas let us hear the specifics.</P>
    <P>In addition, 16 per cent of the budget goes to service international debt.  Given that it is a party of economic propriety and proper behaviour, I am certain there would be no question of it suggesting not paying back the national debt.  Is it proposing cutbacks in the remaining 26 per cent <Col N="890" /> of the budget, in areas such as EU payments which generate a huge benefit for us?  Is it proposing to cut back security?  I have not heard any radical proposals from that party in that area.  Is it proposing to reduce expenditure on the environment, tourism and so on?</P>
    <P>The reality is that if what it is proposing were implemented it would be a recipe for social chaos. Its proposals will murder the social cohesion which laid the foundation for, and has been at the root of, the huge progress made over the past few years.</P>

      <P>Do the Progressive Democrats really expect anyone to accept that the social partners will stand by and allow social progress to be wrecked in that manner?  That party should take a break from its constant mantra which resonates with blame and failure, with which it seems preoccupied.  That is no help in terms of making progress.  Those simplistic proposals, which I accept can have a superficial appeal, are really disastrous.</P>
      <P>It is also worth asking what the Progressive Democrats achieved when they were in Government. One of their achievements was a remarkable level of brinkmanship.  It was a fairly dull week when they did not take their partners to the edge of the cliff and say that &ldquo;If you do not...&rdquo; there would be a grave situation.  Many grave situations arose in that period.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, notwithstanding Standing Order 53 and anything in Standing Orders,</P>
      <P>(i)  the Resolution of the Dáil of 11th December, 1996, in relation to the consideration by the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Report on Dunnes Stores prepared by Mr. John Gerard Buchanan; and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the Order of the Dáil of 19th December, 1996, referring such Report to a sub-Committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges;</P>
      <P>are hereby rescinded.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Speaking in the debate in this House on 11 December on the motion to set up the Buchanan inquiry, I noted that the common point in the contributions by Deputies from Government and Opposition parties was the view that the political process as a whole and the reputations of those who work in it had been tarnished by allegations regarding payments to politicians and public servants by Dunnes Stores and/or Mr. Ben Dunne.</P>
      <P>I said then and I repeat today that I am determined that everything that can possibly be done will be done to remove that tarnish.  I am determined it will be done as efficiently, effectively and economically as possible.  There is no point in engaging public funds in a legal wild goose chase that leads nowhere because the basis for taking action is insufficient.</P>
      <P>The basis for the allegations about payments appears to rest, in the main, on two documents. First, a report dated 12 April 1994 prepared by Price Waterhouse for Dunnes Stores.  Second, an affidavit sworn by Mr. Ben Dunne in High Court proceedings.  There may, of course, be additional relevant information which is not contained in either document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the allegations appeared in the media last November, all of us in this House shared the public concern.  Our concern did not relate to the mere fact of the payments.  There is nothing improper in political parties and politicians receiving or seeking donations for the funding of the political activity which is essential to the working of democracy.  Nor is there anything improper in individuals and companies contributing to politicians and political parties.  Without <Col N="894" /> such support, as all of us in this House well know, it would not be possible to sustain the level of activity required to maintain the political system as we know it.  In a debate here on 3 December, Deputy Bertie Ahern drew a distinction between contributions raised in a legitimate way to meet legitimate electoral expenses and any suggestion that people were being given money to do things in office for the benefit of those giving the money. I fully agree with that distinction.</P>
    <P>The public concerns &mdash; which I believe we all share &mdash; are twofold.  The first is that the payments may have been made either to influence decisions in favour of the donor or as a reward for past decisions which may have benefited the donor.  The second is that some of the payments may have been excessive and gone beyond what would be reasonable to support the normal political activity of any individual recipient or even any normal political party.</P>
    <P>From the first moment that the allegations were made, the Government moved with speed to allay public concern.  We also sought to ensure that any moves made were those most likely to achieve the desired results.  What is the desired result?  It is to establish and expose the facts and to ensure that, if there is any evidence of impropriety, it will be dealt with in the appropriate way in accordance with the laws of the land.  The process in which Judge Buchanan is involved is, as I made very clear in this House on 11 December, &ldquo;the first and, I believe, the most appropriate initial step to establish the facts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his interim report, addressed to the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad on 3 February, Judge Buchanan completed the first stage of this initial step.  I know I speak for all in this House and for the public when I convey thanks and appreciation to Judge Buchanan, and to those who are working with him, for a job well done.  In a very real sense, he and his assistants have performed a public service and they have done so with efficiency, skill and speed.</P>
    <P>The interim report deals with one of the sources of the allegations, namely the Price Waterhouse report.  It addresses payments, covered in that report, that were made to Members or ex-Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and to Fine Gael.  The interim report also notes the limitations of the Price Waterhouse report which had been commissioned principally for the purpose of investigating certain transactions which had been undertaken by Mr. Ben Dunne without the knowledge or consent of other members of the board of the relevant company. It deals only with the circumstances of very specific transactions, selected by Dunnes Stores &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;selected by Dunnes Stores&rdquo;&mdash; and the accounting treatment of these transactions in the records of the company.  This shows how limited the Price Waterhouse report was at the outset.  The interim report notes that: &ldquo;As Mr. Ben Dunne declined to co-operate with Price Waterhouse, they were unable to find out full details with regard to these matters&rdquo;.  Most <Col N="895" /> importantly, the interim report goes on to conclude that: &ldquo;The details of these transactions are within the knowledge of Mr. Ben Dunne&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The work which Judge Buchanan has done, based on a formal agreement into which I entered, on behalf of the Government, with Dunnes Holding Company on 9 December last has established the facts as they relate to politicians and political parties mentioned in the Price Waterhouse report.  I am confident that Judge Buchanan will shortly be in a position to provide a similar report in respect of public servants as defined in the agreement with Dunnes Holding Company.  The definition is very broad and includes, for example, local authority employees, employees of semi-State companies and employees of any organisation which is publicly funded.</P>
    <P>The Buchanan process is proving to be a highly cost effective means of clearing the ground, and isolating from a mass of irrelevant material, the matters that are relevant and deserve the more serious treatment that only a judicial inquiry can provide.  This has been done by Judge Buchanan on an inexpensive, voluntary basis &mdash; without getting involved in expensive adversarial procedures associated with compulsory disclosure.</P>
    <P>As we move now to the next phase of removing the tarnish from politicians and from the public process, namely, the setting up of a tribunal, I am very conscious of the recent experience of tribunals. The length and expense of the beef tribunal was occasioned principally by the absence of specificity and selectivity in its terms of reference. The beef tribunal was asked to investigate all allegations made in Dáil Éireann over an unspecified period relating to irregularities in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>The tribunal had to start by conducting an extended search of the Official Report to ensure that every allegation, large or small, was first identified and then investigated.  The tribunal had no choice but to investigate a whole range of small issues, deserving an investigative process that is potentially adversarial and notably expensive, as well as very serious matters that did indeed warrant such serious investigation.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference, proposed last December by the Progressive Democrats for a tribunal, would have fallen into precisely this trap &mdash; because they included all allegations made in the media over a ten day period.  This was an invitation to a virtually limitless fishing expedition.</P>
    <P>This formula would involve, just to begin with, the tribunal combing every newspaper, national and local, published in those ten days, about 100 newspapers, as well as obtaining transcripts of every programme on every radio station, national and local, for those ten days, to ensure that every allegation is noted.  Without going through such a process, the tribunal could not be satisfied that it had fully complied with its terms of reference.  To follow that formula would have led us to repeat <Col N="896" /> the mistakes which ensured the longevity and enormous expense of the beef tribunal.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the success of the current hepatitis C tribunal is in no small part due to the fact that the issues and documents had been identified and isolated, in advance, and over a number of years, by the report of the expert group and by the pleadings and discovery in the litigation involving the late Mrs. Bridget McCole.</P>
    <P>No such sifting and refinement had taken place in the matter of the payments allegations in respect of Dunnes Stores last December: that gap is in the process of being filled, at least, in part, by the useful work of Judge Buchanan.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question as to why the work is being entrusted to a judicial tribunal, and could not have been dealt with by a committee of this House.</P>
    <P>The privilege and compellability legislation currently in progress before the Oireachtas will, it is hoped, provide new and strengthened powers for Dáil committees.  They will be new powers and will not have been tried or tested.</P>
    <P>The advantage of a tribunal under the 1921 Act is that its powers are well established, and have withstood a number of tests in the courts, not least arising from litigation in connection with the beef tribunal.  The process does not involve novelty: it is both tried and tested.</P>
    <P>The possibility of legal challenge to any procedure of inquiry cannot be ruled out, but the prospects of successfully resisting any such challenge, are much greater with a tried and tested procedure of inquiry, than with one which is novel, however welcome.  Furthermore, it is preferable that where one of the categories or persons being inquired into is a politician, the investigator should come from outside the political sphere.</P>

      <P>As mentioned earlier, information relating to payments made by Dunnes Stores or Mr. Ben Dunne to politicians, political parties and possibly public servants is not confined to the Price Waterhouse report.</P>
      <P>We also know of the repeated media allegations involving a very large payment to a political figure.  On 3 December last, <i>The Irish Times</i> contained a report on its front page that a &ldquo;prominent Fianna Fail figure is believed to have received more than £1 million from Dunnes Stores in the early 1990s.  The money was paid by several cheques with different bank accounts in London on a number of dates&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On 12 December <i>The Irish Times</i> further reported that details of these payments were understood to be contained in an affidavit drawn up by Mr. Ben Dunne as part of a legal battle. The newspaper story said that this document &ldquo;provides his version of where payments from the company were routed.  It is understood that he alleges that the ultimate beneficiary of the money was a Fianna Fail politician&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> I know that, as I said here before, the main Opposition party feels, because of an allegation about an unnamed Fianna Fáil figure, that it has been unfairly put in a position where it is considered suspect.  This is not satisfactory or fair, either to the party concerned or to the individual or individuals whose names have been bandied about.  It is not right.  It is important that the matter is brought into the open and that all those to whom no guilt can be attached are allowed to clear their names.</P>
    <P>There was an allegation in another newspaper that up to a dozen politicians received more than £5 million.  The newspaper went on to state that members of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Labour had all received payments and that, additionally, a current Senator and a top-ranking party official were among the beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference proposed by the tribunal are designed to establish the amount of payments made to politicians, political parties and, depending on Judge Buchanan's continuing work and a subsequent resolution of this House, public servants.</P>
    <P>They are also intended, most importantly, to enable the tribunal to inquire, in respect of payments, into &ldquo;the considerations, motives and circumstances therefor&rdquo;.  As I said earlier, it is not the fact of the payments that is important, it is the suggestion that the payments may have been made improperly or corruptly to influence politicians and public servants in the conduct of their business.  That is what needs to be established.</P>
    <P>Ireland has enjoyed a good reputation, in international terms, for the probity of its political system. We have a proud tradition of integrity and honesty in the conduct of our political and public affairs, since the foundation of the State.  It is a tradition which has served the national interest well.  Each and every one of our citizens must be confident that he or she will be treated equally and fairly under the law.  Each and every enterprise involved in the success story which is the Irish economy must know they will never be disadvantaged because of someone else's corrupt behaviour.  There must be a level playing field.</P>
    <P>There are well established legislative and procedural measures, principally contained in the Prevention of Corruption Acts, for dealing with allegations of impropriety on the part of any person paid out of public funds.  These are enforceable, as part of the normal criminal law, with all the requirements of due process inherent in the law.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the terms of reference of the tribunal will cut across or interfere with the activities of the legal authorities.  These authorities, particularly the tax or revenue authorities, are well equipped with the skill, powers, resources and independence to investigate any matter that needs to be investigated.  They are obliged to conduct such investigations in a competent and fair way under the law.  The Revenue Commissioners are the appropriate authorities for dealing with <Col N="898" /> tax matters and with alleged infringements of the tax laws.  They do not need any prompting from me or anyone else in Government or elsewhere to carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference proposed for the tribunal have been carefully crafted and are, on the basis of the information currently available, the appropriate ones.  I would particularly like to highlight the request to the persons selected to conduct the inquiry to note the desire of the House that the inquiry be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it.</P>
    <P>I also hope &mdash; I believe this hope is shared by the main Opposition parties &mdash; the tribunal will, as far as practicable, respect the confidentiality of personal and commercial information which is not relevant to the purposes of the inquiry.  No one can guarantee that the inquiry, on which we are now embarking, will provide the perfect solution or will necessarily provide conclusive answers to every question.  It is an expensive process and it can be time consuming, but it is the most effective one available.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with fundamental matters of great public importance.  To meet them, we initiated a sensible, independent, sifting process directed by Mr. Justice Buchanan.  We are now moving to the next phase by bringing into play the most powerful, well tested weapon in the investigative armoury of the State, namely the independent judicial sworn inquiry, to ensure that these matters of importance and of public concern are given the fullest and fairest possible consideration.</P>

      <P>Ever since the large payments to the former Fine Gael Minister, Deputy Michael Lowry, became public at the end of November and suggestions were made that there might be similar payments to others, I have made it clear that only a tribunal of inquiry would be in a position to get to the bottom of these matters and that the quicker we established one the better in order to ensure full trust is restored in the political system.</P>
      <P>I am glad we have at last got what we asked for two months ago but I am concerned that the Taoiseach is prepared to waste further months. His intervention this morning led me to conclude that he has no great sense of urgency about the matter.  As Leader of the House his duty is to lift the cloud of suspicion which hangs over us all but I fear he is happy to let it linger.</P>

      <P>If we are moving into an election it is vital that the public is assured we are not all tainted by the admissions of one Member of the House and that elections are not fought on the basis of unsubstantiated rumour and innuendo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is being naive in stating we should not try to influence the tribunal which is <Col N="899" /> being established to serve the needs of the House and the public.  As Members we may, of course, direct the tribunal in a very open and transparent way by drafting its terms of reference.  We should ask it to focus on certain issues as a matter of urgency, to report as quickly as possible and, where necessary, to provide interim reports as soon as particular issues are resolved or clarified. This is the reason I argued with the Taoiseach this morning about the ten day period and how it will be operated.  I will say no more about that matter now but the Taoiseach should take into account my points, which I know he understands.</P>
    <P>It is with this in mind and in a spirit of co-operation and helpfulness that I suggest the following changes to the terms of reference which will give the tribunal more focus and enable it to concentrate immediately on the priorities.  I propose, therefore, that we include in the terms of reference the need for the tribunal to proceed urgently to oral hearings on issues already in the public domain as follows: (i) the relationship between Deputy Michael Lowry and Ben Dunne, the financial and political implications of this relationship and how or whether this relationship may have affected his decisions as a Minister of the Government; (ii) the existence and substance, if any, of an alleged affidavit in which it is alleged that a former Fianna Fáil Minister received £1.1 million; (iii) payments to other parties who are not included in the Buchanan report but who may have publicly acknowledged receiving sums from Ben Dunne.  This would make the terms of reference very clear to the chairman and the tribunal members who would know the matters on which they must quickly report to the House.  It is beyond me why this cannot be done.</P>
    <P>The Government must give the tribunal a focus rather than encourage it to start engaging in a potentially endless trawl.  The tribunal should report back to the Ceann Comhairle, not the Taoiseach.  I accept the amendment worked out this morning under which it will report back to the Clerk of the Dáil.  When it is established the tribunal should not be conducted or influenced in any partisan manner, as a Minister of State seemed to allege in the corridors of the House last night.</P>

      <P>I welcome the somewhat tardy establishment of a tribunal and the appointment of the chairman, Mr. Justice McCracken, who has an expertise in commercial law and in unravelling complex accounts and a reputation for getting to the bottom of these in a short space of time.  I have every confidence that the tribunal will be conducted in an impartial and expeditious way in so far as it is allowed to do so and receives the full co-operation of all who are called before it.</P>
      <P>No one wants a long drawn out repetition of the beef tribunal.  I appeal, therefore, to Dunnes Stores, Mr. Ben Dunne and any politician or representative of a political party called to give evidence to co-operate fully with the tribunal. Dunnes Stores have made a large fortune from citizens of this State in return for the real service and quality they have provided.  I am sure they will want to approach this matter in a civic spirit and will not hold back relevant information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was obvious from the beginning that a committee <Col N="902" /> of the House would be inadequate for the purpose and would be given neither the necessary powers nor protections.  The compellability of witnesses Bill, which was necessary to enable the committee to function, is bristling with exemptions and let-out clauses for all concerned.  The draft Bill, which vastly extends the scope of Cabinet confidentiality, muzzles public servants and suppresses documents with a hint of criticism in them, is outrageous and scandalous legislation from a Government that pretends to stand for openness, transparency and accountability.  We are dealing with a Government with a closed, authoritarian cast of mind that wants to let in the light as little as possible.  Aspects of the Refugee Bill is another case in point and, not surprisingly, that Bill has gone back to the drawing board.  It was evident that if the Government was serious about getting quickly to the bottom of the Dunnes Stores affair it would have no alternative but to establish a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>We appreciate the work done by Judge Buchanan, operating under considerable handicaps. His first report has thrown up little we did not know already and in many respects we know, thanks to various voluntary statements by people, a good deal not covered in his report.  There are no new startling revelations and on the evidence so far the Lowry affair appears to be in a class of its own.  Perhaps the second report of Judge Buchanan will contain more information not in the public domain about public officials, which is potentially a serious matter.  We do not know whether there is any substance in suggestions that some public officials were in receipt of payments from Dunnes, but with limited investigative powers it is not clear if he will be able to get to the bottom of all or indeed any payments in this class. The less comprehensive information in his first report that is publicly available means that either report will not be regarded as conclusive or comprehensive. We need, therefore, an absolute assurance that the tribunal will not be limited to what Judge Buchanan has been in a position to find.</P>
    <P>The Lowry affair is, to date, potentially the biggest political scandal of a financial kind in the history of the State.  There are no precedents for a private company alleging that nearly £400,000 was paid, largely under the counter, to a leading politician who is a close confidant of the Taoiseach, a Fine Gael chief fund-raiser and a Government Minister in charge of a large part of the multi-billion pounds semi-State sector.  The former Minister's statement showed a level of personal financial dependency and obligation which is entirely inappropriate in a Cabinet Minister, regardless of whether any abuse occurred.</P>
    <P>We must be satisfied that no improper influence was exercised on any decisions taken by Deputy Lowry while a Minister.  There are persistent doubts relating to the award of the East contract which will not be allayed by the information in a Sunday newspaper that Deputy Lowry is holding a mobile phone registered in the <Col N="903" /> name of a beneficiary of the Esat contract.  Following our experience with the former Minister's accusation of cosy cartels, when he was involved in the cosiest cartel of all, nothing he says can be taken at face value.</P>
    <P>We further have an instance of a Minister who informed the Taoiseach some time after his appointment that he availed of the tax amnesty which had been castigated in the most abusive terms by his party leader when the Bill passed through the Dáil.  We have a Minister whose tax affairs, despite availing of the amnesty, were not in order.  Since Deputy Lowry personally spread allegations about offshore accounts held by others, is it not legitimate for us to ask whether in availing of the amnesty Deputy Lowry brought back large sums of money held in offshore accounts for his own benefit and that of others? It is a matter for Fine Gael whether it chooses to select and endorse as a Dáil candidate someone who appears on the face of it to have defrauded the tax system on a grand scale.  It says something about the genuineness of Fine Gael's supposed commitment to high political standards, the party that used to pride itself on being the party of honesty and integrity, that it is even prepared to contemplate such a move.</P>
    <P>Any political party may contain at any time a member, perhaps a very prominent member, who had engaged in unethical behaviour either before or during his or her period as an office holder. While it may be embarrassing for the political party concerned, what matters most is how it reacts to the knowledge when it becomes available. While every facility in natural justice must be afforded such a person in a sphere where wild and totally unfounded allegations can be thrown around, and none of us wants to see lynch law, equally no protection should be given to wrongdoing when no adequate defence or explanation is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I note from an article by Mr. Sam Smyth, who first recorded the Lowry affair, in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 29 December 1996 the source of his other stories which this tribunal will have to investigate.  I quote from the article: &ldquo;Again, it was Michael Lowry, on 29 November, who first told reporters of the £1.1m allegedly given by Dunnes Stores to a former senior Fianna Fáil Minister and `sources close to Mr. Lowry' were spreading the word before newspaper reports linked a deceased accountant to the former FF Minister to the £1.1m via a bank account in the Cayman Islands&rdquo;.  Variations, some involving bank accounts in Britain, were also mentioned.  I believe some investigative reporters followed the trails of this issue, which can be taken into account in the inquiry.</P>
    <P>It will be for the tribunal to establish whether there is a foundation to these serious allegations or if they were, from start to finish, black counter-propaganda against a respected former Member of this House to deflect some of the heat from <Col N="904" /> Deputy Lowry, the type of operation for which the national handlers were infamous in the past.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of Dunnes payments went to Deputy Lowry and members of the Fine Gael Party.  Between the two the total figure is almost £600,000 which far exceeds anything that either the Labour Party received for its presidential campaign or individual members of Fianna Fáil for election purposes.</P>
    <P>I have made clear my attitude from the beginning. I want the tribunal established without fear or favour to any past or present Member of this House or any former member of this or any previous Governments.  I repeat with one addition what I said here on 3 December because I consider it vitally important.  Politics and participation in public life is a career of public service. It is not an avenue of enrichment or lifestyle enhancement from private donors, even where they only want to help people perform in a particular manner.  My party and my Front Bench are determined that financial scrupulousness will be strictly observed by all our elected members without fear or favour.  Anyone who abuses their position or knowingly flouts the rules will go and will face the law of the land.  The political fabric of our democracy is precious.  The public are entitled to have an absolute guarantee of the financial probity and integrity of their elected representatives, their officials and, above all, their Ministers. They need to know that they are not under financial obligations to anybody other than public lending institutions, except to the extent that they are publicly declared.  New strict standards must apply.  We must draw a line under bad habits that may have developed over the past 30 years and return to the ethos and public spirit that prevailed in this House under the founders of the State, Eamon de Valera and W.T. Cosgrave.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that it would be unfair if commercial matters that might not be relevant to this tribunal were investigated in a substantial way.  Dunnes Stores is a successful commercial company requiring protection against the problems it may face in the commercial domain.  That must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I hope the tribunal avails of the work completed by Judge Buchanan, and other work in the public domain, to move quickly on this issue.  It will be obvious from the Dáil Official Report that that is the intention of this House.  If the chairman moves quickly, the tribunal will be successful, whatever the results.  If the tribunal experiences the problems faced by Judge Buchanan this matter could go on for months.  I wish the chairman success in his work which I hope he will carry out as speedily as is possible and practical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that.  Notwithstanding my unhappiness with the terms of reference, which I expressed this morning, it is not the intention of the Progressive Democrats to oppose the establishment of the tribunal because we have been calling for one for more than two months and the Taoiseach is determined to proceed solely with the Government's terms of reference. It is regrettable the concerns of the Opposition were not taken into account.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to engage in the politics of &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; because it would not get us very far. However, it is difficult not to be cynical because this morning the Taoiseach tried to convince us the abandonment of the political tribunal in favour of a judicial one was part of a process.  Denis Coughlan summed it up well in <i>The Irish Times</i> when he stated that the new buoyancy in the Government as a result of last weekend's opinion poll prompted the establishment of the tribunal. Given the Government's record, I do not begrudge it some buoyancy and celebration, but if a 15 per cent gap between the three Government parties and the Opposition parties gives it cause for celebration, it does not realise the type of lame duck it is.</P>
      <P>Since this issue came into the public domain on 29 November last, 70 days ago today, the Government's handling of the matter has been dismal.  A number of hours after the newspaper headlines hit the street the Taoiseach told us he had only had a cursory glance at the article.  He did not even know if an explanation was warranted &mdash; he was sure the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, would provide an explanation.  He sought to distinguish between a person's responsibilities while a Minister and before becoming a Minister.  Of course, more is expected from office holders, but as the Taoiseach knew Deputy Lowry availed of the tax amnesty, that was a strange comment for him to make.  Alarm bells must have been ringing in his head.  While the Taoiseach may have felt let down &mdash; as all of us would in similar circumstances &mdash; there are times when political leaders must make cruel decisions to prove their leadership and in the interests of honesty, openness and transparency.  We must demand the standards we talk about from those we ask to serve with us and we must be uncompromising in that regard.  We all know of people who stood by their friends during difficult times only to have those friends bring them and everybody else down with them and damage the name of politics and public life in the process.  Lessons should be learned from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the Government's decision to establish the tribunal.  It is regrettable, however, that it has taken 70 days for it to arrive at that decision.  While the Taoiseach was open-minded when he spoke in the debate in December and did not dismiss the option of a tribunal, some of his colleagues were not open-minded.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, spoke about the Progressive Democrats being opportunistic and hypocritical.  He said the tribunal <Col N="906" /> would be cumbersome and lead to prolonged hearings with large legal bills and the prospect of journalists ending up in jail, but no guarantee of satisfaction or complete answers.</P>

As he is not in the House today, he must be suffering from indigestion as a result of what he said.  He made a strong case on 11 December about why the tribunal was unnecessary and would not work.  He claimed the process on which the Government was embarking would work in a matter of days.  The Government Chief Whip also said the tribunal would be expensive, was unnecessary and would not get us anywhere. He claimed the Government was pursuing the only option that would get at the truth.</P>

      <P>I am sure he also has a little tummy rumble today.  What was hypocrisy and opportunism two months is now Government policy.  We are witnessing crisis management again.  The courts service was promised &mdash; it has not yet been established &mdash; only after a crisis in the Department of Justice.  We were told it would be established in a week.  We were seeking a tribunal into the hepatitis C scandal for almost two years.  Information that had been withheld for 20 years was published in a matter of weeks.  Great credit is due, in particular, to the former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay, for the manner in which he conducted hearings in that tribunal.  He has gone about his work in a speedy and efficient manner.  I hope this tribunal is modelled on it.</P>
      <P>I told the Taoiseach this morning that keeping the Buchanan process in place is crazy and unnecessary.  It is akin to having the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien committee inquire while the tribunal of inquiry into the hepatitis C scandal is taking place.  While Judge Buchanan has worked hard, he does not have the necessary investigative powers to talk to bank managers about the beneficial owners of bank accounts.  The letter sent to Deputy Michael Smith indicates the inadequacy of his powers in that regard.  He stated in the report that, in respect of some names in the Price Waterhouse report, there are up to 700 similar names in the telephone directory.  He did not have the wherewithal to even begin to establish if the persons concerned were in public life. The Government is trying to save face by not standing down the Buchanan procedure.</P>

Every party and politician receives corporate donations or donations from friends at election time and nobody questions the right of people to seek or receive them.  I have not been critical of <Col N="907" /> such contributions.  In my experience bluechip companies tend to donate money to all parties on a pro-rata basis.  It is unusual that since its foundation this party has not received a corporate donation from Dunnes Stores because all companies tend to give money to every party on a pro-rata basis.  Notwithstanding the fact that it is unusual, there is nothing wrong with the amounts of money donated.  They were given for legitimate reasons and I would not question the integrity of the Taoiseach or others who have been named as having received election contributions.</P>
    <P>The tribunal must establish if Members or former Members of this House or people in public office received irregular or illicit payments.  We must get at the truth because all of us who serve in public life have been tainted by this matter.  We are all at the starting blocks together because the tribunal will inquire into everyone on the same basis.  It will not single out Deputy Lowry, the genesis of the inquiry and we will have to wait until the tribunal has reported before getting an ethical go-ahead to continue to serve in public life.  That is unfair to the majority of Members who enjoy the contribution they can make to public life and are proud to serve the people.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable a time limit has not been set for the tribunal to make its findings, but that would probably be unrealistic.  I hope it has reported before the next general election and that it will not sit when the election takes place.  There is glee on the Government benches because it believes its story was told when Deputy Lowry revealed his story on 19 December and that others might be embarrassed during the tribunal.  However, the Deputy Lowry story is not over.  His speech on 19 December made matters much worse.  I hope they will all be resolved and that the report of the tribunal will be presented and debated in the House well in advance of the general election.  It is the least we owe to those who are prepared to stand for public office.</P>
    <P>Will the State seek representation before the tribunal?  Will the public interest be separately served before it, as it was usefully served before the hepatitis C tribunal?  It was not separately served before the beef tribunal.</P>
    <P>During 1996, Dunnes Stores sought changes in the tax laws which would have benefited the company by between £50 million and £100 million. The company did not get its way, but it had a member of the Cabinet in its pocket.  Deputy Lowry told the House on 19 December that he did not run a separate business.  It would appear that he was a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.  Was any declaration to this effect made at the time?</P>
    <P>I recently asked the Taoiseach about the position taken by office holders on the tax amnesty. It was a responsible question because some of those who serve in office today were members of the Cabinet that made a decision on the amnesty. We are entitled to know if they bestowed a benefit <Col N="908" /> on themselves or their families.  If members of local authorities have holdings in functional areas of the authorities, or if they hold property which becomes the subject of a planning or rezoning application, they are required by law to disclose their interest.  Equally, if somebody participates in the decision on an amnesty which will bestow a benefit on themselves or their families it should be disclosed.  The public has the right to know, yet I was told I was not entitled to ask such questions because they were purely a matter for the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I do not question the Taoiseach's integrity, but he came to office promising that a hallmark of his Government would be openness, transparency and accountability.  That is how he considered we should judge him.  It is not unreasonable in such circumstances to seek information of the kind to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>We judge the Government by the standards it sets for itself.  With regard to expressions such as the &ldquo;high moral ground&rdquo;, no party in this House is perfect and none is composed of persons who are perfect.  We seek the application of the standards that ordinary people expect for themselves and for those who serve them.  We want the truth to come out and nothing to be concealed.</P>
    <P>I asked the Taoiseach this morning if the tribunal would be entitled to inquire into Revenue matters that affect Deputy Lowry and I was led to believe it would.  However, he now tells the House that these are entirely a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, who will act without the prompting of the Government.  The Revenue Commissioners are obliged by law to conduct their investigations in private.  Whatever they discover must be kept a secret.  It is unfair that, in the context of what is known as the Lowry affair, this should be the case.  It is the job of the tribunal to deal with this matter and it is why I raised the issue this morning.  Deputy Lowry is the only serving Member of the Oireachtas mentioned in the Buchanan report, in which the Taoiseach appeared to have such great faith.  He is the person who caused this inquiry to be established.  If it were not for the story of 29 November last we would not have this inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that if an inquiry was established along the lines suggested by my party it would lead to a fishing expedition because we wanted allegations in the newspapers to be investigated. However, there were only two or three allegations, not hundreds.  The Government has engaged in a U-turn.  Instead of admitting this, it is trying to pretend this is part of the process. However, given it has embarked on a route which I have believed for some time is the only way for the truth to emerge, I welcome its decision and I hope the tribunal will go about its work in the same way as the hepatitis C tribunal.  If so, it will do a great service to everybody who serves and has served in public life in Ireland.  I wish Mr. Justice McCracken, who is an excellent choice, the best of luck with the tribunal.  I look forward <Col N="909" /> to receiving his interim and final reports very soon.</P>

      <P>The main difference between the budget and previous budgets is in presentation. It was well packaged and received a good profile from the media.  In previous years Ministers for Finance attempted to soften the public in advance by frightening it with the bad news to ensure that people were pleased with the budget because they expected to be worse off.  However, on this occasion a positive spin was put on matters. Nevertheless people are not easily taken in and attempts to convince them that they will be better off from April will not succeed.  People are not that easily conned or bought.</P>
      <P>There are no obvious banana skins in the budget.  However, it is disappointing.  We all like to think that there is much we could do if we were in a position of power and had the resources at our disposal that were available this year.  We are all aware of matters that are not properly attended to.  However, when the opportunity presented itself to the Minister and the Government this year they were afraid to take any action.  They were afraid of making an error and afraid to give more to one group over another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may be described as fair, the budget was boring and it lacked ideas and imagination. The governing concept appears to be not to rock the boat and to keep all interests on board. Consequently, benefits were spread evenly to ensure all received their fair share.  However, what is the point in being in power if one wishes to spread it in an even way?  The budget does not grapple with reform or with the problems we all know exist.  A monkey or computer could be programmed to divide the largesse and give an equal share to all.  It was boring, probably because we knew it all in advance.  However, many of the leaks were incorrect.  For example, the <i>Irish Independent</i> ran a story based on a leak that all social welfare payments would be brought forward by two months.  That did not happen but they got their spin for the day from it.  The date was brought forward by two weeks, which was a good move, but there is a big difference between two months and two weeks.  The budget was full of <Col N="910" /> rhetoric, wonderful words and gloss in a nice package, but it had little content.</P>
    <P>One of the main tacks of many speakers was to attack Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and try to drive a wedge between the parties.  The Democratic Left Ministers of State, Deputy McManus and Deputy Rabbitte, and Deputy Eric Byrne obviously all read from the same script. However, it is nonsense.  All political parties have their own views and Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have different policies on several issues.  However, that does not mean two parties are not capable of sitting down and working out a reasonable coalition.  The important aspect of any deal between political parties is that it is kept and that they trust each other.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the Progressive Democrats or any other party.  It is reasonable for a party to argue its case, set out its policies and push as hard as possible to have them implemented.  The important point when a deal is made and hands are shook is that the agreement is kept.  Fianna Fáil had a very bad experience with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, as leader of the Labour Party.  Twice in 1994 the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and the current leader, Deputy Ahern, shook hands with the Tánaiste but the deal was off by the following morning.  There is no advantage in parties having similar policies if their relationship is not built on trust.  It is much more acceptable if parties of differing views come together, make a deal and keep it.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that Democratic Left Deputies made so much play about the stability of the Government.  Every Government is stable until it comes apart.  I do not understand how they could make such a big play about that aspect because the history of their party does not show much stability.  It appears to have a type of Chinese purge every few years and it must have had four or five different name changes in the last 20 years. Every time the going gets tough or there is another point of view in the party, they have a purge, move next door, come up with a new name and start all over again.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday in the debate on the Employment Equality Bill, there were signs that this great, stable and cohesive Government is coming apart.  While they may put a spin on it and try to pretend the Government is stable, deep differences came to light yesterday and on Committee Stage of the Bill.  I hope the election is held soon because the Government has made efforts recently to head off every problem at the pass. The Government can do that for a short time but it cannot do it forever because the country would be broke.  One cannot buy oneself out of problems all the time.</P>
    <P>The budget was disappointing.  There was much talk and packaging but there is something wrong when society has up to £600 million to spend, its economy is growing and it has the resources but it refuses to give priority to tackling the major problems of poverty, social exclusion and unemployment. <Col N="911" /> The Government had the resources, and more resources are coming on stream as a result of economic growth, but they were badly allocated.  They were not aimed at attacking or solving any of the real problems.</P>
    <P>The increases in payments to the elderly look better than last year but £3 is not a big deal.  A speaker this morning said the increases in social welfare are ahead of the rate of inflation.  What does that mean in the context of the last couple of years?  We are told that the salaries and standards of living of people in employment have greatly increased.  How can people be told that if they are in employment they can expect 5 per cent of 10 per cent increases every year but if they are elderly they can only expect rate of inflation increases?  The social welfare increases, particularly to the elderly, have been very poor and that is a judgment on society in terms of how it deals with its elderly.  It is essential that the fruits of economic growth are distributed fairly but that has not been the case in respect of the elderly over the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister slightly increased the age allowance.  Many elderly and retired people have a small private pension and they are bitterly disappointed that, having worked all their lives, they are still in the tax net.  The age allowance was introduced over ten years ago as an inducement to people to declare that they had a pension rather than to solve equity problems.  The Minister increased the allowance but only nominally. A substantial increase should be provided for those people.  It is wrong that people who worked all their lives are still in the tax net just because they have a small pension.</P>
    <P>Another social welfare issue concerns me. Members who deem themselves left wing talk about their concern that the social insurance fund will be damaged, but Members on the economic right wing are constantly pushing for the reduction of PRSI.  The extreme left and right on economic issues appear to be coming together on this matter and I am concerned that the social welfare fund may fall between the combined attack of the left and right.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, provided a good analysis of this point.  He outlined a table which broke down the tax and social insurance demands on salaries in other EU countries.  This showed that social insurance is relatively low in Ireland but the income tax take is one of the highest.  The Minister of State laid out his store which appeared impressive but his party leader, the Minister for Social Welfare, did the opposite.  The PRSI reduction obviously was not a Democratic Left part of the budget.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the increases for people on contributory pensions.  For example, a couple on a contributory old age pension will receive £4.50 from the budget but a couple on a non-contributory old age pension, provided they have no other means, will receive £6.  There appears to be a dilution of people paying into the <Col N="912" /> fund.  I support people who contribute to the social welfare fund.  There should be a greater difference between contributory and non-contributory benefit, but we seem to be closing the gap and diluting the strength of the social welfare fund.  That has long-term consequences and, if it continues, in ten years' time every social welfare benefit will be means-tested.  The Minister for Social Welfare, who projects himself as concerned about the social welfare fund, is working from two ideologies which are very different.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about social exclusion but, regrettably, little has been done about it in this budget.  Those in need must be looked after, but much money is handed to people for doing nothing.  Socialist ideologists would say that we feed people so that they may contribute.  Rather than giving unemployed people £5, £10 or £20 more, we should encourage them into employment. We should certainly give them more money but we should ask something of them in return, as is done in socialist countries.</P>
    <P>As with the land set-aside scheme, in recent years the unemployed have been set aside.  We give them a certain payment and hope it will keep them quiet, that they will not demand more, but we are doing nothing for them.  While new jobs are being created and the economy is growing, we are not reaching the poorer areas of the inner city or the suburbs that were built in the past 20 years where many people have been housed and are expected to survive.  In previous budgets the opportunity to solve the problems of those people was not available but this year, even though there was an opportunity to help them, the Government did not grasp the nettle.</P>
    <P>While the Minister quotes attractive figures for the number of new jobs created &mdash; 45,000 last year and hopefully the same number this year &mdash; on average the unemployment figure was reduced by only about 1,000 last year, with the long-term unemployment figure reduced by only about 300. Our efforts have not been directed at those most in need.  As in all budgets, choices were made in this budget.  While resources were allocated, poverty and unemployment were not a priority.  Is it too much to ask that every person has sufficient resources to live life with dignity, has meaningful work and adequate shelter and is able to participate in a real way in society?  Resources exist, but because of the choices made in this budget many people will miss out on them.  Something should be done about the people who have been excluded by society in recent years.</P>
    <P>The back to work scheme, introduced by Deputy Woods when he was Minister for Social Welfare, seems to be a central part of social welfare policy.  Some scheme must be devised, particularly geared at people who are socially excluded, whether it be the back to work scheme, workfare scheme, a scheme such as that proposed by the Conference of Religious of Ireland, a beefed up community employment scheme or area allowance scheme.  Something must be done to find jobs for people on the dole, whether in private <Col N="913" /> firms or working for the local partnership or environment group, local authority or whatever. Many areas are run down and there is no end to the amount of work available.  That work could be carried out by the unemployed, even on the basis of three or four days a week.</P>
    <P>A school teacher in my constituency told me that some children come to school at 10.30 a.m. or 10.45 a.m. and when asked why they are late they say that their mother did not wake them in time.  Those parents need a reason to get up in the morning.  They need a discipline that encourages them to go to bed at a reasonable hour so that they will get up in time to send their children to school.  Those people have been set aside from the community and nothing is being done for them.  Many of them, while accommodated in reasonable housing, live in dreadful conditions in terms of their general surroundings.  They should be given employment, be it tidying their community, creating play facilities for their children and so on.  Much could be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is a multitude of schemes but not enough people are involved.  A few years ago the favourite scheme was the community employment scheme, yet the numbers on that scheme have been frozen for the past two years.  People on unemployment assistance should be given a job for at least a couple of days a week.  It would give people a reason to try.  When going to bed at night, a person wants to feel that he has earned money, dignity and respect for his family and community.  We must direct our efforts at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of contentious parades has for many years been the source of tension and conflict in Northern Ireland.  At first sight the issue appears to be a simple one concerning the need for agreement on parade routes between those who wish to march and those who regard parades as unwelcome.  The parades issue has become a repository for a whole range of complex and deeply held feelings on the part of both the Unionist and Nationalist communities.  The outcome of a contentious parade is now measured by both sides in terms of their political hopes, fears and <Col N="914" /> aspirations.  That the parades issue should be so considered has made its resolution a profoundly more difficult and complex task.</P>
      <P>Dr. Peter North and his colleagues, the Rev. John Dunlop and Fr. Oliver Crilly, clearly went about their task in a thorough and considered way, on the basis of widespread consultation and sounding of public opinion.  Their report deserves to be taken very seriously as a means of coming to terms with the problem of contentious marches, whose capacity to damage the whole society is now so amply demonstrated.</P>
      <P>The Government does not underestimate the difficulty of this task.  The review has endorsed the widely held notion that the parades issue is a microcosm of the political problems of Northern Ireland.  Identity, tradition, rights and responsibilities are deeply interwoven into the parades issue.  It will require political courage, openness and a degree of generosity from both sides to avoid the bleak consequences of another summer of discontent.  Urgent action is required by all those most directly concerned if this prospect is to be avoided.</P>
      <P>The Government has also made clear its belief that the impact of what transpired at Drumcree and the Lower Ormeau Road last July went far beyond the question of parades.  It precipitated a collapse in Nationalist confidence in the rule of law, in the willingness of central authority to enforce it, and in the RUC.</P>
      <P>The Government has approached the recommendations of the Independent Review of Parades and Marches with these considerations very much in mind.  We support the broad thrust of the report as moving essentially in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The core recommendation of the North review is the establishment of an Independent Parades Commission to facilitate local agreement and, where that has not proven possible, to issue a determination in regard to the conditions to be imposed, if any, on a contentious parade.  The issues surrounding contentious parades can vary depending on the nature of the parade itself and the locality through which it seeks to pass.  Bringing independent arbitration to the particularities of each contentious parade is a practical and sensible suggestion.  In facilitating dialogue and offering the possibility of independent judgment, this recommendation, if acted upon, will create an opportunity to begin to defuse the fears, misconceptions and mistrust which often underlie the parades issue.</P>
      <P>The Government is considering the details of the report, whose main text runs to more than two hundred pages.  In the near future I will meet representatives of the communities and residents groups most directly concerned with the parades issue and will have the opportunity of further assessing the prospects for this year's marching season.  Three important factors are, however, immediately apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is that the North review was at pains not only to present what it believed to be the best approach but also to establish what was the most <Col N="915" /> favoured approach among the people in Northern Ireland.  It has also published the findings of the public attitude surveys which it commissioned and 88 per cent of those surveyed supported negotiated accommodation.  Failing that, 79 per cent overall supported a binding decision by a third party.  The most popular choice for what that third party should be was an independent body.</P>
    <P>Second, the review's recommendations are presented as a package.  The commission's formal role in promoting mediation is presented as the first step in an integral sequence.  If mediation fails to establish local agreement, the review's authors have recommended that the commission, having consulted widely, will determine whether and what conditions might be imposed.  While the Government notes the concerns expressed about the manner in which the commission's determinations may be reversed and will pursue these through the appropriate channels, this does not detract from the inherent value of the core recommendation that contentious parade routes be subject to formal mediation, consultation and determination, backed up by the force of law and the necessary political will to enforce it.</P>
    <P>The third point is that the ability of the proposed Parades Commission to resolve the parades issue depends on the degree of support it enjoys from the authorities.  Profound questions were raised by the reversal of the original decision that the Orange Order was not to march down the Garvaghy Road.  Many within the Nationalist community began to doubt whether the RUC was either willing or able to withstand the pressures exerted by the community from which most of its officers come.  Until Northern Ireland has a police force which reflects in its composition and ethos the society it seeks to police, these doubts will remain.</P>
    <P>If the determinations of the Parades Commission were to be defied as effectively as the rule of law was in July 1996, then its authority would be seriously, possibly fatally, undermined. Its ability to act effectively as a mediator depends in large part on the credibility and substainability of its eventual determinations.  Should its determinations be overturned regularly through appeal, reconsideration or through the decisions of a senior police officer on the day, then its authority will be correspondingly diminished.  If these determinations are not implemented, then the deeply troubling question arises as to the alternative.</P>
    <P>In short, the Government believes the recommendations of the North review should be implemented now.  The people of Northern Ireland want a change in the manner in which parades are handled and the North review has made sensible and workable recommendations arrived at after extensive consultation and consideration.</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and I have urged the British Government to act on the North review.  We <Col N="916" /> have not been encouraged by the British Government's indication that it will begin only a partial implementation of the review's recommendations despite the widespread support for them at Westminster.</P>
    <P>I will raise our concerns in this regard with Sir Patrick Mayhew when I meet him later today.  I assure the Deputy we will leave no avenue unexplored in our efforts to ensure that the bleak expectations so widely shared about this coming marching season are not realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the nub of the problem is addressed in the Tánaiste's last points.  The report is welcome and I thank Dr. North and his colleagues. In the main it has some good recommendations but the problem is that the British Government will sit on it, despite our Government pressing for urgent action.  This island cannot withstand another rerun of Drumcree and all that was involved with that.  What argument is the Tánaiste putting to the British Government in trying to get the urgency of the situation across? Taking the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Anglo-Irish Conference and other issues into consideration, this matter must override any electoral concerns the British Government has in the dying days of its administration, propped up as it is by the Ulster Unionist Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Any action possible must be taken to avoid what we saw last summer.  Trust was being built, as were new relationships between parties in Northern Ireland, and that was undermined substantially last year by the incidents at Drumcree.  We have conveyed our view to the British Government and I will discuss this with the Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew, this evening.  We will press the British Government to do everything possible to defuse the tensions that exist now in relation to the marching season, which is two months away.  The parades issue must be given the political priority it deserves and we will give it priority in discussions that start this evening.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke will remember from his time in the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference that the parades issue is a priority item on the agenda on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is an item on the conference agenda on an ongoing basis and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the report in the main, though there are some defects.  In his meetings with the Secretary of State will the Tánaiste address the lack of attention to minority rights evident in the report and the commission?  I welcome the idea of a third party intermediary making decisions on the parades and marches.  Does the Tánaiste agree that the RUC and the British Government should retain a veto in the light of last year's events?  The RUC made a decision that the march on the Garvaghy Road should not take place but <Col N="917" /> that decision was changed.  What is the benefit of the commission if there is such a power of veto?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We have welcomed the general thrust of the North report.  However, concerns have been expressed, which I share, that the determinations of the commission may be overturned by the Secretary of State or after reconsideration by the commission.  The Chief Constable of the RUC may appeal a determination before a parade takes place and the senior officer on the ground may make operational decisions which run contrary to the determinations.  This is a weakness in the arrangements and we will discuss these matters with the British Government. It is the most substantial concern we have about the report, although its general thrust is good. However, serious difficulties might arise at operational level.  We wish to avoid any recurrence of the way decisions were taken in Drumcree last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Drumcree, the Garvaghy Road and the Ormeau Road the Taoiseach has made it clear that he will not interfere in the issue of the parade routes.  No Irish Government has done so despite the fact that the issue arises regularly.  Will the Tánaiste make it clear that the Oireachtas is of the view that there should not be a repeat of the demonstration of supremacy along the Garvaghy Road, given that alternative routes are available and that there are already up to 50 other commemorative parades in Portadown?  The parade on the Garvaghy Road is nothing but a demonstration of supremacy and its residents are entitled to their human rights.</P>
      <P>A parade on the Ormeau Road does not give the authorities an entitlement to lock people into their own homes.  The first of the parades will be on Easter Monday which is only a few weeks away.  Residents of these areas have a basic right of movement to and from their own homes.  If the Taoiseach is not prepared to make this point, will the Tánaiste do so?  We recognise the right of the majority to march.  Out of the 3,000 or so parades only 20 or 30 are contentious.  Will the Tánaiste make a statement on behalf of the Nationalist people of Northern Ireland to the effect that their rights cannot be downtrodden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the fears that exist in Northern Ireland, it is vital that a process is undertaken whereby, through mutual respect for rights on both sides of the community, solutions are reached, just as Mr. John Hume brought about a resolution in Derry last year.  Where there is a willingness to do so and where there is trust and confidence we can find solutions.  The respect for mutual rights is central to the issue. We have made our views known in this regard and, as I said, I will discuss this matter with the Secretary of State.</P>

    <P>It behoves us and the political leadership in Northern Ireland to be helpful in this matter and not to exacerbate already difficult situations.  I <Col N="918" /> hope such leadership will be shown.  The parades will start in less than two months and time is of the essence.  I hope that on the basis of the North report, which is sound and sensible, we may avoid the problems which arose last summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on Foreign Policy announced the establishment of a human rights unit in my Department and the allocation of additional resources for that purpose.  The establishment of the unit was a further indication of the importance the Government attached, and continues to attach, to the role of human rights in the formulation of Ireland's foreign policy and in terms of the domestic implementation of international human rights standards.</P>
      <P>The human rights unit, which was established in advance of our Presidency of the European Union last year, is currently staffed by a counsellor, first secretary, third secretary, human rights intern and clerical assistant.  Three of the positions are dedicated exclusively to the unit.  During the Troika period, two of the officers serving in the unit carried out some additional duties but their human rights responsibilities represented the major focus of their overall work.  This staffing level compares with a situation prior to the establishment of the unit when there was no position in the Department devoted exclusively to human rights issues.</P>
      <P>Two further points arise in regard to staffing levels.  First, the increased level of resources I have assigned to human rights issues is against the background of very considerable other demands on the Foreign Affairs Vote as Ireland's overall international responsibilities and role continue to grow.  Second, in respect of the work of several other sections of the Department, I have attached increasing priority to the human rights aspects of their responsibilities.  The role of the human rights unit is additional and complementary to that played by those sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to outline the broad scope of the duties undertaken by the unit in fulfilling the mandate assigned it under the terms of chapter 8 of the White Paper.  In the second half of last year, the unit serviced a very active Presidency of the EU during which important human rights issues were addressed by the EU.  In the context of the Presidency, the unit also played an intensive co-ordinating role on human rights issues at the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.  The unit coordinated Ireland's election to the UN Commission on Human Rights, a prestigious position which we assumed on 1 January 1997.  Membership of the commission will afford Ireland an <Col N="919" /> enhanced role on human rights issues in the multilateral framework.  The unit is currently preparing for the next session of the commission which will take place in Geneva from 10 March to 18 April next.</P>
    <P>In accordance with a further commitment in the White Paper, Ireland assumed responsibility, at the Commission on Human Rights in 1996, for the drafting of a resolution on the human rights of disabled persons and the unit was actively involved in that process.  The resolution was adopted by consensus.  The unit was also responsible for the co-ordination of Ireland's role at the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children held in Stockholm last August and the resulting declaration on the appropriate follow-up.</P>
    <P>The unit has completed two major reports to United Nations treaty bodies &mdash; Ireland's first report under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and Ireland's first report under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Work is currently under way in the unit on the completion of Ireland's second round of reports to the UN Human Rights Committee under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
    <P>Such reports are an important element of the commitments Ireland undertakes in ratifying UN human rights instruments and involve intensive consultation and co-ordination with other Government Departments.  The White Paper indicated that an improvement in such co-ordination was needed.  Against that background, the White Paper announced it had been decided that the head of the human rights unit should chair a new standing interdepartmental committee to consider all aspects of Ireland's human rights obligations.  Following the completion of the Presidency of the EU, I am keen that priority be given to the ongoing implementation of the commitments in the White Paper and, in that context, to the establishment of this committee.  Work has been proceeding to this end and invitations to the first meeting are being issued this week.</P>
    <P>We are also proceeding with the implementation of a further commitment in the White Paper &mdash; the establishment of a joint standing committee representing my Department, NGOs and experts in the human rights field.  The establishment of this committee reflects recognition by the Government of the increasing importance of the role played by NGOs in the formulation of Irish foreign policy.  Preparations for the formation of the committee are at an advanced stage and it is hoped that the first meeting will be held within the coming weeks.  The servicing of both these committees will represent an important element of the work of the human rights unit.</P>
    <P>As will be clear from my reply to the Deputy's question, a significant body of work has already been undertaken by the human rights unit and a major programme of activity is currently under <Col N="920" /> way.  I will keep the House informed in this regard.  I will also continue to keep the question of increasing the scope and resources of the unit under close review.</P>

      <P>The key issue is that of resources, as referred to by the Tánaiste.  He outlined what appears to be a comprehensive body of work carried out by a very limited staff.  The extent to which the unit is under-resourced is indicated by its failure to fulfil its primary function of reporting to the UN on all measures being taken to give effect to the UN human rights treaties.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste mentioned that there is to be some level of liaison with the NGOs.  Will he accept that the NGOs view the human rights unit as a smokescreen to deflect attention from the Government's inactivity on the human rights issue, particularly during the EU Presidency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>During what was a busy EU Presidency, Dóchas, the co-ordinating group, met on a monthly basis.  I absolutely refute the assertion made by the Deputy.  The working relationship with the NGOs is good and we work closely with them.  I regard them as a valuable resource for my Department.  We set up the human rights unit because of the importance of this issue in international politics.  Our relationship with the NGOs is probably as good as, or better than, any other European state.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right and proper that the NGOs have ongoing contacts with the <Col N="921" /> Government in view of the great work they do on behalf of the Irish people around the world.  Will the Tánaiste outline his ideas with regard to the working group which involves the NGOs?  Does he accept that, in order to ensure a coherent approach to human rights issues in Ireland, it is necessary to establish a permanent mechanism for human rights consultation between Government Departments and the Irish aid community? Will he outline the circumstances in which the Government has failed to establish such a mechanism, despite promises made to the contrary in the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making progress with regard to standing committees.  I detect an enthusiasm from the NGOs about my proposals. The Deputy will understand the obligations we had during the EU Presidency.  The unit has been established.  I have not heard of any proposals from the Opposition on setting up this unit.  I assume that when the Deputy was Minister for Justice he had regular consultations with the NGOs.</P>

      <P>In light of the high priority which the Government claims to have afforded the area of human rights under the EU Presidency, will the Tánaiste outline the circumstances in which the Government has failed to ratify the international convention on all forms of racial discrimination and the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said previously, these conventions are a priority for the Government. Ratification will take place after the necessary implementing legislation is completed.  I understand the Department of Justice has done considerable work to prepare for the ratification of the convention against torture and the equality legislation being introduced by the Department of Equality and Law Reform will enable ratification of the treaty on racial discrimination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the current beef crisis I have been in regular contact directly and through my Department with the responsible authorities in the countries which import beef from Ireland.  In the matter of meat and cattle <Col N="922" /> exports, I work in close co-operation with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>Most recently, I have been speaking to my Egyptian counterpart, who has been helpful in ensuring that the Egyptian veterinary authorities reviewed the recent suspension of live cattle imports.  Following my contacts with him, the veterinary delegation to which the Deputy refers visited Ireland at short notice to investigate and report on animal health here.  I spoke to the Egyptian Minister again this week and I understand that the veterinary report will now be submitted to the Egyptian government for consideration.  Meanwhile, discussions are continuing between the veterinary experts about the regulations for the import of frozen beef from Ireland.  I hope this matter will be resolved shortly.</P>
      <P>Despite the limitations which have been placed on the sourcing of supplies, exports of beef to Russia have continued at a high level.  I understand that under the agreement concluded in January between the veterinary service of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and its Russian counterpart, the list of counties from which beef for the Russian market may be sourced will be reviewed again in May.  The Taoiseach had discussions with the Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin, in Shannon.</P>
      <P>My Department, particularly in the embassies abroad, continues to give the highest priority to the protection and development of the beef and cattle trade.  I assure the Deputy that I will not hesitate to take any appropriate steps which may be found useful in this regard.</P>

      <P>Normally questions on the beef trade are refused on the basis that the Tánaiste does not have direct responsibility but I welcome the fact that he has taken this one.</P>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree, in view of the enormous problems facing the agricultural sector and the need for the greatest possible reassurance to consumers at home and abroad, that the greatest level of co-operation is required from all Government Departments to ease the problem created by BSE?  Will he ensure there is the greatest level of co-ordination and co-operation?  When does he expect the Egyptian market to be reopened for live cattle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in regard to the necessity for co-operation and the co-ordination in this industry.  It exists at present.  It is a very important industry and has been in difficulty. Last Saturday I had detailed discussions with the leadership of the IFA and the ICMSA on all aspects of the cattle trade.  I have had at least five telephone conversations with the Egyptian Foreign Minister in regard to the Egyptian market.  The technical commission came here at short notice.  It has completed its work and will be reporting to the Government authorities in Egypt.  I hope that will happen soon.  I would like to think that shortly after that, on the basis of <Col N="923" /> what they saw in Ireland in terms of safety and procedure in the industry, the market will reopen.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste inform the House of the circumstances in which the Government, and in particular his own Department, has failed to secure a meeting of the Ireland-Iran joint commission which is the key to the opening of the important Iranian market for Irish beef? This is a vital market and there has not been a meeting of the Ireland-Iran joint commission.  It is important that one is held.  Has he any plans to visit Iran in the context of reopening this market for Irish beef?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand from exchanges we have had in the House on this subject previously that the Iranian restrictions are public health motivated and their resolution is largely a technical matter for the veterinary experts.  There have been two visits to Ireland by delegations from the Iranian veterinary organisation, in July and October 1996, and technical discussions are ongoing.  The question of a ministerial visit to Iran is being kept under review.  At present, it is important to concentrate on making progress at the technical level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Similar problems as regards technical information have arisen with Egypt and Russia but in those cases the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other Ministers have taken it upon themselves to make political contact.  Does the Tánaiste accept that political contacts are vital if we are to reopen the Iranian market and that a meeting of the joint commission would be a first step; and will he specify if and when there is to be such a meeting?  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, he rather than any other Minister is the appropriate person to make political contact in Iran to open the doors for Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I met the Iranian Foreign Minister in New York last September and I had extensive discussions with the Deputy Speaker of the Iranian Parliament when he was here in October.  The public health worries which the Iranians have made known to us must be overcome at a technical level.  There are no plans for a joint commission meeting but we can review that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A meeting of the joint commission is vital because we must send the right signals about the importance of the Iranian market for our beef.  Holding such a meeting is the minimum which should be done.  The Tánaiste met the Iranian Foreign Minister in New York but representatives of other countries have not been reluctant to visit Iran and there is no reason we should be either.  The French showed no compunction about going there.  It is vitally important that we be seen to press our national interest in <Col N="924" /> the income of our farmers, who have taken such a pounding over the last 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Deputy says.  He is also aware that I offered dates for a joint commission meeting but they were not suitable to the Iranian side.  From my contact with the farming community and living as I do in a rural constituency, I am aware of the importance of the beef sector.  I will work closely with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the farm organisations so that everything which can be done to ensure good markets for Irish beef will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the debt problem of the poorest and least developed countries and the serious constraint it imposes on their economic and social development.  We have consistently used the relevant international fora to emphasise the need to find ways to address the debt problems of the least developed countries and to indicate our openness to innovative solutions.  In his address to the World Social Summit in Copenhagen in March 1995 the Taoiseach called for a fresh approach to debt issues and the consideration of all options, including debt cancellation.  In addition, the Minister for Finance, as Ireland's representative on the board of governors of the World Bank and the IMF, has consistently highlighted the situation of the most severely indebted countries and has pressed the case for significant alleviation of the debt burden of developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now a growing sensitivity at the international level to the debt problems of the developing countries and a general recognition and acceptance that it is essential to make serious inroads into the problem of excessive debt burdens. The debt initiative for highly indebted poor countries, the so-called HIPC Initiative which was <Col N="925" /> agreed at the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank last October, represents a significant step forward in the international community's response to the debt problem of the most indebted countries.  This initiative is designed to relieve the debts of as many as 20 poor countries, most of them in Africa.  It is intended to help reduce their debts to sustainable levels in the interests of their economic and social development. It is comprehensive in nature in that all creditors, including multilateral financial institutions as well as bilateral and commercial creditors, are expected to meet their share of the necessary debt reduction of eligible countries' debt.  As part of the HIPC Initiative, the Paris Club of bilateral creditor countries has agreed on its part to write off up to 80 per cent of eligible debt owed by lowincome countries on a case by case basis, compared to the 67 per cent currently available under the so-called Naples terms.  The initiative can produce significant debt relief for severely indebted countries and should be given an opportunity to work.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that Ireland is a non-creditor country.  All Irish aid is given by way of grant and does not add to the debt burden of any developing country.  We are therefore not directly party to the debt problem and are not in a position to give a lead in the area of debt cancellation, as we do not hold any Third World debt.  However, we will continue to use our influence to press for a just and comprehensive longterm solution to the debt problem in the developing world and would be prepared to give positive consideration to any proposals aimed at achieving that, including those put forward by various NGOs in the context of millennium celebrations. On &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; a couple of mornings ago there was a discussion about the millennium and my view is that finding a way to cancel the debt would be an appropriate way to celebrate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be a new use for the lottery.  Will the Minister of State outline the Government's reaction to the proposal on Third World debt made by the Debt and Development Coalition?  Does she agree the £5.6 billion being provided in EU debt relief against a total debt of £226 billion is grossly inadequate?  Will she inform the House of any progress made towards addressing this issue under the EU Presidency and our current membership of the Troika?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the Debt and Development Coalition on a number of occasions.  Its relationship with the Irish Government is unique compared to the position in most EU countries.  Its proposals were reasonable.  During the course of the Presidency I was one of 25 people invited by the Danish Government to take part in a follow-up conference to the Copenhagen summit, which included an in-depth discussion by people from around the world on how the problem might be <Col N="926" /> resolved.  An agreement should be reached on debt cancellation, the basis of which should be a <i>quid pro quo</i> from the developing world that the money thus saved would go into the social investment areas of health, education, water and sanitation; and that developing countries should also strive for fiscal reform.  Some such countries have wealthy élites and sectors of the economy where taxation revenue is produced but not collected and thus does not go into their budgets.  Countries such as Tanzania pay 30 per cent of their budget in debt relief.  I have been critical of this in the past and have had discussions with the IMF and the World Bank on the subject.  Those countries need some relief in order to put more money into health and education.  The proposals put forward by the NGOs merit the most serious attention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the proposal provided the conference is not another collection of the great and good from around the world who talk and go home without anything happening.  At the follow-up to the Copenhagen conference, during our Presidency, there was a serious discussion of the mechanisms used, particularly the impact the reduction of the debt would have on the poorest countries.  We should ask ourselves why we want to reduce the debt burden &mdash; surely it is to allow those countries spend more on health, education, water and sanitation but not on armaments.  It is necessary that there should be a structured dialogue which promotes investment in those areas as well as promoting fiscal reform in some of the countries where there is a capacity for tax collection, particularly from the very well off.  I support the conference, but I would like to have the agenda pretty well determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be important that the Minister of State and the Government, as a member of the Troika, should try to influence the agenda rather than sitting back passively while it is set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister of State give her reaction to a statement made by Dr. Joseph Hanlon at a seminar on the role of the IMF and the World Bank in Third World debt in which he claims that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are doing so much damage to African economies that Irish aid amounts to no more than a sticking plaster applied afterwards?  Does it not say something about the problems of Africa or the problems of the Third World, and should we <Col N="927" /> not try to do something about lifting the burden of debt?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was honoured to be the Minister asked by Dr. Joseph Hanlon to launch his book on the subject because of Ireland's position and because, as reported prominently in the papers today, we are the only country in the European Union that is significantly increasing its development aid.  Dr. Joseph Hanlon chose that occasion to compliment the Government on its aid programme. In particular, he complimented the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste on the fact that Ireland is holding its position on joining ESAF, the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Fund mechanism of the IMF until such time as we get assurances from the IMF that structural adjustment packages will take into account the needs of the poorest in the countries concerned. Dr. Hanlon spoke at some length about how this was the only action by a government anywhere in the world in this respect.  In that context the Deputy might agree that we have taken an extremely strong lead in that area and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that the lead taken by my party leader on Monday of last week at a conference on human rights attended by representatives of 60 non-governmental organisations and other interested groups, when he committed the incoming Fianna Fáil administration to increasing Irish aid to between 0.4 per cent and 0.5 per cent during the lifetime of the next Government as a minimum, with the hope of increasing it towards 0.7 per cent, depending on the growth pattern, is a very important commitment?  It is also an important recognition by all sides of the House of the need to provide aid to the less well off in the world.</P>

      <P>I welcome the commitment given by Deputy Ahern.  I hope it finds favour among his would-be partners in the Progressive Democrats because they have had some rather hard words to say about Government expenditure.  I am happy the Deputy has brought up this question. I was concerned that the level of the financial commitment was not on a par with the commitment that Fianna Fáil, during the period in office of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, delivered on and have continued to deliver on. The newspaper report was rather short.  Perhaps the Deputy can supply me with detailed figures. In general I welcome the commitment.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, being taken by the EU, and particularly by the Government as a member of the EU Troika, to put pressure on both the Angolan Government and UNITA to implement fully the Lusaka Protocol.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">

      <P>The Government and our EU partners continue to support strongly the peace process being conducted between the Government and UNITA parties in Angola under the terms of the Lusaka Protocol of 20 November, 1994.  We fully support the mediation efforts of the UN Secretary General's Special Representative, the negotiating parties and the Troika of Observer Countries which consists of Portugal, the Russian Federation and the United States.</P>
      <P>During the Irish Presidency, the Tánaiste cochaired the important ministerial conference between the EU and the countries of the Southern African Development Community in Windhoek, Namibia, on 14-15 October, at which Angola was represented.  The resulting Windhoek Communiqué reaffirmed the conference's commitment and support for the peace process in Angola and also took an important initiative in regard to anti-personnel landmines &mdash; an extraordinarily serious problem for Angola and its people.</P>
      <P>Last Monday, Ireland joined EU partners in issuing a declaration in support of the Angolan peace process and the ongoing efforts of the UN Secretary General's Special Representative and the Troika of Observers.  While welcoming recent progress towards the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, in particular the incorporation of senior UNITA officers into the Angolan armed forces, the declaration expressed regret over a number of recent negotiating difficulties which have delayed the process.  Specifically, the Union regretted that over the past few weeks it was not possible to secure either the swearing-in of UNITA's deputies or the establishment of a Government of Unity and National Reconciliation as had been agreed for 17 and 25 January, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its declaration, the Union has also stressed particularly to the UNITA leadership the importance of deputies, future ministers and vice-ministers, travelling to the capital, Luanda, by 12 February as recently determined by the Joint Commission which is overseeing the Lusaka peace process.  It has also stressed that this should be done, in accordance with Resolution 1087 adopted by the UN Security Council on 11 <Col N="929" /> December, without being linked to other issues. The Government of Angola has agreed to set a date for the inauguration of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation immediately following the arrival of the UNITA deputies in Luanda.  The Union has called on both the Government and UNITA to resolve the remaining obstacles so that a lasting peace can be achieved and programmes of economic and social rehabilitation fully implemented.</P>
    <P>As made clear in a statement by the UN Security Council on 30 January, responsibility for restoring peace rests with the Angolans themselves. The international community can provide assistance only if progress is achieved in the peace process.  The Security Council has also pointed out that failure to implement the agreed formation of a new government could jeopardise the peace process and lead the Security Council to consider appropriate measures against those responsible for the delays as provided for in its relevant resolutions.</P>
    <P>Bilaterally, Irish aid has contributed over £1 million to ongoing projects in Angola since 1994, particularly for Concern and Christian Aid, while the European Commission has recently approved a humanitarian aid package of over $17 million which will focus on medical, nutritional and resettlement needs.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work closely with EU partners in supporting the concerted efforts of the United Nations and other members of the international community to advance the peace process, which offers a unique and historic opportunity for Angola to set about building a new future and for the country to reach its full potential both in its own right and as a member of the community of nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is everybody's hope that the various factions in Angola will work together to bring about peace and prosperity in their land for their own people.  However, the international community has a role to play.  Will the Minister of State outline to the House her view and the position of the EU Troika on the UN mandate when it expires on 28 February?  Is it her intention or the intention of the Troika to press for an extension, which I believe should be done?  What progress is being made on that?  Is it the intention of the EU General Affairs Council to press for an extension?  Is this also the position being taken at the United Nations?  It is very important that work should continue, to restore peace and democracy in that area and, while it obviously depends on the local input, the international community also has a role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The UN Secretary General made clear in his most recent report to the UN Security Council on the UN verification mission for Angola, UNIVEM, on 2 December 1996 that considerable progress has been made in some areas of the Lusaka peace accords.  He also, however, expressed concerns about the delays.  As the <Col N="930" /> Deputy knows, the real problem has been that, a superstructure or framework having been broadly agreed, various problems arise on each occasion to prevent the parties to the marriage from meeting in Angola.  On that occasion the Secretary General stressed there would be no question of a complete or precipitate withdrawal by the UN from Angola at any time.</P>
      <P>When the Tánaiste met the Angolan foreign minister in Namibia, I also had the opportunity to meet him and to discuss the issue with the South Africans.  All of southern Africa is united in seeking to support this peace process.  It is almost there but it needs a great deal of continuing support from the international community, particularly from the European Union.  We are determined, as members of the troika, to continue to do that.  However, UNITA, in particular, and the deputies and vice-ministers should be given every encouragement to go to Luanda and start the process of the national government.</P>
      <P>Already moves have been made to integrate senior generals of the UNITA forces into the Angolan forces.  That first element has gone well. The next element, as with many African peace processes, is to try to demobilise the very large number of soldiers on both sides and to get the country back to peace.  We will certainly lend every help to that process.</P>

      <P>In the process of creating and developing peace and stability within Angola after the years of conflict, it is vitally important to eliminate the landmines.  The Minister of State will recall various debates when this side of the House tabled initiatives, which were eventually supported by the Government, on the banning of the manufacture and export of landmines as a lead for the world.  Landmines are the curse of countries such as Angola where people cannot feed themselves because the landmines remain in the ground after the conflict is over.</P>
      <P>What action is being taken at EU or UN level to provide assistance to Angola in the reconstruction phase to remove the legacy of landmines? Will the Minister of State elaborate on the progress which has been made on a ban within the EU on the manufacture and export of landmines? Some prominent people of various positions and titles are now supporting what we have been doing in this House for some considerable time.</P>

      <P>In that sense, I must say well done to her and I hope she will do even more.  As President of the EU Council of Development Ministers, I made the issue of landmines, particularly the clearing of areas of landmines, one of the priorities of our Presidency.  I am happy to say that considerable progress has been made in that area.  At the meeting of Development Ministers further joint actions and joint programmes were agreed.  As the Deputy is possibly aware, there will be a major conference in Brussels in June which will bring together all the countries, including Ireland, which have agreed to a total ban.</P>
      <P>I was particularly pleased when chairing that Council that the French representatives came forward with a substantially advanced position on earlier points which they had put forward on landmines.  In my two years on the Development Council the situation has gone from one where there were objections when I first raised the question of landmines to the present situation where there is almost universal agreement that this must be done.  However, some countries still need to be persuaded of the urgency of the issue.</P>
      <P>The European Union, through ECO, has agreed funding of $17 million for landmine clearance. If the peace accords are implemented further funding will be made available.  Most of Ireland's assistance to Angola is in the area of landmine clearance, working with a number of NGOs such as Concern and Christian Aid which have programmes in the area.  There are some proposals, for example, from a number of our Army doctors to work with a British organisation called Merlin on rebuilding some hospitals in Angola in order to provide prosthetic and other care for people who have suffered as a result of landmines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is not currently aware of any proposal to create an ombudsman within the EU, as outlined by the Deputy in this question.  I would stress, however, that Ireland has a long tradition of promoting and protecting human rights and we have made human rights a central part of our foreign policy by giving the fullest possible expression to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in our contribution to international affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Ireland has pressed for greater EU action <Col N="932" /> in many human rights issues and has worked consistently to improve the standing of human rights worldwide.  In particular, we have sought to promote the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights of the United Nations as the principal focal point for all international human rights issues.  The European Union makes every effort to ensure coherence between its development aid policy and foreign policy objectives and a human rights clause is now included in all agreements with third countries.</P>
    <P>Against this background, it is clear that Ireland will examine carefully and sympathetically any concrete proposals which may emerge in the future which seek to promote and protect human rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that our record on the protection of human rights is second to none. That has been a central plank of our foreign policy for many years, with a greater or lesser emphasis from time to time on the direction of that policy.  However, does the Tánaiste agree there is a need for an ombudsman to deal with the issues which I outlined in my question?  Has he raised it, or does he intend to raise it, at the Council of Foreign Ministers with a view to taking a leadership role on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied to the question which sought my views on any proposal to establish an ombudsman.  I replied to the Deputy in a forthright manner that there are no proposals at present in relation to an ombudsman at EU level.</P>
      <P>The Union's development co-operation policies are based upon a process of dialogue involving the host recipient governments and member states.  The Deputy is aware of the Lomé Convention which provides for ongoing dialogue at ministerial and official level between EU and recipient countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific to ensure the quality of aid delivered is maintained.  Similar arrangements govern Union co-operation with other areas.</P>
      <P>The Dutch Presidency has prioritised coherence as one of its objectives and this will be discussed at the informal meeting of development ministers in February.  That might be an opportunity to see what the reaction of other countries would be to the suggestion by Deputy Andrews of an ombudsman at EU level.</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews has tabled a relevant question.  There should be no need for an ombudsman as the Council of Europe is a body which has responsibility for the protection of <Col N="933" /> human rights, not just within the European Union but within Europe as an entity.  Is the Minister aware, despite the fact that delegations from the three main parties in this House have visited republican prisoners in British prisons and have reported that the conditions are disgraceful and contrary to basic human rights, that the British authorities steadfastly refuse to allow a delegation from the Council of Europe's Committee on Human Rights to visit republican prisoners in British prisons?  Will he raise the matter with his counterpart in the Foreign Office in Britain and with the Home Secretary who is responsible for prisons in Britain to ensure such visits are allowed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the Council of Europe has an important role to play and does very important work on behalf of all the citizens of Europe.  I have read the reports by members of the all-party and individual party delegations on prisoners in the UK.  We have raised the matter of prisoners' conditions in the UK on many occasions and will continue to do so in view of the statement from Deputy Deasy and his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a specific written statement to the Council of Europe by the British Permanent Representative in Strasbourg when he said the European Council Committee on Human Rights had no standing in international law to visit prisons in Britain, in other words the British can do whatever they wish within their own country and they do not have to answer to any international body. The spirit of the question which seeks the Minister's views on any proposal to establish an ombudsman for human rights is correct.  Nobody should be allowed do what they like in a civilised society.  This attitude by the British authorities has had a significant effect on the breakdown of the ceasefire in Northern Ireland and on the peace process.  People will not accept having their brothers and friends treated in such an abominable manner.  The Irish Government should protest at the highest level.  While the people in question may be guilty of the most atrocious crimes they should at least be treated as human beings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deasy is well aware of the active involvement of the embassy in London in relation to prisoners' conditions and trials in Britain and we will continue to voice our concern about prison conditions.

      <P>I strongly support the point made by Deputy Deasy.  This has been a matter of deep concern to my party and my colleague, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, has paid a number of visits <Col N="934" /> to prisoners in British jails as have representatives from all parties.  Deputy Deasy has raised a very important point in relation to the Council of Europe.  Will the Minister inform the House if the Government recognises that the current allocation of the European Union's budget to human rights assistance, namely, the European initiative for democracy and human rights, which has a budget allocation of £64 million, is grossly inadequate and reflects the comparative neglect of human rights issues in preference to financial aid to strategically important areas?  I have in mind the Mediterranean and the Middle East which get £412 million and the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe which get £1.38 billion.  Will he inform the House of the steps taken by the Government to address this imbalance both at the EU Presidency and as a member of the EU Troika?  The problem is human rights issues within Europe are very far down the agenda.  Allocations of aid are made on strictly political grounds.  That the Mediterranean and Middle East get £412 million while sub-Saharan African is losing out on aid is a disgrace so far as the EU is concerned.  What measures is the Minister taking as a member of the Troika to redress the imbalance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is strong co-ordination of the European Union's human rights policy which is going through a process of development.  It involves regular human rights working group meetings in Brussels as well as meetings by resident EU human rights experts in New York and Geneva.  I would prefer if more money was allocated to sub-Saharan Africa.  Negotiations are taking place in regard to a new Lomé Convention involving Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The issue of human rights is and will remain a major policy priority for the European Union. Deputy Burke will be aware from my answer to the previous question of the emphasis we in Ireland put on human rights.</P>

Ireland has supported the idea of the EU making representations on behalf of Mr. Choephel to the Chinese authorities.</P>

Despite the size and importance of the Chinese market to America, Europe and the world generally, a stand has to be taken by Europe and the UN in relation to the human rights record of the Chinese in the treatment of their own people but, in a special way, in the treatment of Tibetan people.</P>

      <P>Representations will be made to seek the release of Mr. Ngawang Choephel on humanitarian grounds given that according to all the information available to us he was on a cultural rather than a political mission.  The Government's concern with human rights issues in China was raised at every appropriate opportunity with the Chinese authorities during the Irish Presidency. I led the EU ministerial Troika at a meeting in New York and used the opportunity to pursue again the question of human rights which I had raised consistently at previous meetings with the Vice Premier.  The European Union has continually urged China to implement legislation and other positive measures in the human rights field, particularly the early accession to and ratification of international covenants on civil and political rights and on economic and cultural rights.  We will do everything we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of human rights in Tibet has consistently been raised by the European Union in its traditional draft resolution on human rights in China.  A &ldquo;no action&rdquo; resolution tabled by China has prevented the commission from having any <Col N="936" /> discussion on the matter, with the exception of 1995 when the resolution reached the floor of the commission where it was defeated by one vote. At all other times China has succeeded in having the &ldquo;no action&rdquo; resolution adopted.  The EU is currently deciding its approach to this issue and if a resolution on China is tabled Ireland will seek to have elements relating to the issue of human rights in Tibet highlighted also which would be timely on this occasion.</P>

      <P>The holding of the referendum, through which the Saharawi people would determine the future of the Western Sahara, has been blocked by the failure of Morocco and POLISARIO to agree on voter eligibility criteria.  During the past year, and particularly during its Presidency of the European Union, Ireland has been actively involved in efforts to resolve this impasse.</P>
      <P>Ireland has also contributed military observers to the United Nations Mission on the Referendum in the Western Sahara, MINURSO, which is responsible for supervising the preparation of the referendum and for monitoring the ceasefire between the two sides.  There are eight Irish military observers serving at present with MINURSO.</P>
      <P>In the context of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, two meetings were held with representatives of the Saharawi people.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton, had a meeting with the European representative of POLISARIO on 26 July 1996.  She underlined Ireland's commitment to a resolution of the question of the Western Sahara through the holding of a free and fair referendum by the people of the region.  The POLISARIO representative expressed gratitude for Ireland's contribution to the resolution of the Western Sahara question, notably as a troop contributor to MINURSO.  He underlined the view of POLISARIO that the referendum proposed by the UN Secretary General was the only route to a lasting solution of the Western Sahara question.</P>

The negotiations have been going on for 14 or 15 years and while agreements were reached on the terms of a referendum Morocco changed the rules at the last minute.  The difficulty is that Morocco is a major trader and is seen as a source of trade for EU countries, while the 500,000 Saharawi people have no economic influence in the world and are losing out in the international debate on this issue.  Until the EU adopts a stronger line with Morocco and it is told it is wrong and that its presence in the Western Sahara and most of that territory is a colonial one there will be no progress on this issue.</P>

      <P>As I stated, Ireland fully supports the plan drawn up by the Secretary General of the United Nations, while the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, had discussions on this matter with the Under-Secretary to the Secretary General last September.  The EU will continue to provide every assistance possible to ensure we overcome the difficulties in regard to voter registration.  Approximately 40,000 voters were identified before the voter registration process was suspended in May 1996.  The Security Council voted to suspend voter registration because of continuing disagreement between Morocco and POLISARIO over who is eligible to vote.  The slow and painstaking nature of the voter registration process was the main cause of the frequent revisions of the referendum date.  It also prevented setting in motion other features of the UN settlement plan.  It is important that we complete that process and bring about the referendum which is the key to resolving this old dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>As I explained in the House on many occasions, the Government is strongly committed to the full implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina, an integral part of which is compliance by the parties involved with the orders of the international criminal tribunal, including handing over indicted suspects.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Malley points out, only a very small number of indictees have so far appeared before the tribunal in The Hague.  The vast majority of suspects remain at large, including some of those charged with the most serious and heinous crimes against humanity in recent times &mdash; people such as Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic who are accused of responsibility for massacring thousands of innocent civilians during the conflict in Bosnia.  All those who have been indicted must appear before the tribunal if true peace and justice is to be established in the region.  First and foremost, the responsibility for handing over suspects lies with the authorities of the territories where these people are residing. The majority, though not all of these, are in the Republica Srpska.  Political and diplomatic pressure must be maintained on the Serbs to comply, both directly and through Belgrade.  The Government fully supports all such efforts.</P>
      <P>The Government fully and actively supports the work of the tribunal.  This support is not only demonstrated in political and diplomatic terms but also in very practical ways.  In this regard, in addition to previous voluntary contributions and payment of our annual assessed UN contribution for the running costs of the tribunal, the Government had, towards the end of last year, contributed a further $100,000 to assist the work of the tribunal.  In international fora, including within the EU and at the London Peace Implementation Conference in December 1996, we have supported measures aimed at making greater resources available to the tribunal to enhance its investigative powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland also fully supports the decision taken at the London conference to make the granting of economic reconstruction assistance conditional upon, <i>inter alia</i>, compliance with the orders of the international criminal tribunal.  The meeting in Brussels on 9 and 10 January to which Deputy Molloy refers was a technical level meeting on reconstruction priorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was not a decision-making meeting.  There was no question of any aid package for Serbia being discussed.  In the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Commission has, in broad terms, outlined the priority sectors identified for <Col N="939" /> reconstruction funding in 1997 and subsequent years.  Funds are not being specifically earmarked for the Republica Srpska entity.  Although projects have been identified and costed, the disbursement of funding is subject to political conditionality, and this has been made clear to the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including in the Republica Srpska.  The European Union has fully endorsed the conclusions of the London conference which state that economic assistance will be conditional upon implementation of the peace agreement, including co-operation with the international criminal tribunal.  This policy will determine how the European Commission disburses its funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, UN forces are deployed in Bosnia to ensure the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Will he agree it sends out a wrong message when these two very well known war criminals have not been arrested by the UN forces operating in the areas in which they reside?  It is an example of international hypocrisy at its worst when people responsible for the massacre of thousands are allowed to remain free when troops acting on behalf of the UN Security Council could arrest them at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Until people are brought before the tribunal and made to pay for their crimes it is difficult to see how we can resolve the ongoing conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.  Our position on the matters raised by the Deputy is clear and unambiguous.  We believe all indicted war suspects should appear before the international criminal tribunal in The Hague to face the charges against them.  The tribunal's work has not achieved anything near what we would like to see achieved.  To date it has indicted 74 persons, of whom seven are in custody and one has been sentenced to ten years in prison for war crimes relating to the mass execution of Muslim men in Srebenica.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work must continue and we have been supportive in financial terms and otherwise in relation to its efforts.  With our international partners we will continue to pressure the governments of the region to honour their commitments, in particular the Serbian President, Mr. Milosevic, who signed the Dayton agreement on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs.  It has been made clear, particularly in the conclusions of the Paris meeting of the steering board and the London meeting, that the provision of international and economic reconstruction assistance to the parties is closely linked to their co-operation in this area.  I hope the new Secretary General will give a fresh impetus to the work of the tribunal, not just in The Hague but in regard to other problems in central Africa also.  I do not see this problem <Col N="940" /> being resolved or ended until people are brought before the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste referred to the co-operation of Mr. Milosevic and others in the area. Surely it is time for the UN forces, operating under the UN Security Council mandate, to implement the indictments of the war crimes tribunal and detain these people.  It is appeasement at its worst to allow these people reside in areas where UN forces are working on the ground. There is little point in appealing for co-operation from the likes of Milosevic when he has war criminals working in his administration in the Kosovo area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that Ireland is not participating in SFOR, the continuation force to IFOR.  We do not have any input into operational matters for that force or the force that will be deployed to follow it, the stabilisation force.  The priority of the mandate of the stabilisation force is to ensure compliance with the military aspects of the peace agreements and, therefore, to ensure peace and stability in the region. Beyond that priority, the terms under which IFOR and now SFOR were established allow assistance for international organisations, including the criminal tribunal, in pursuing their objectives. Agreements have been made between the commander of IFOR and the chief prosecutor to the tribunal, within the limits of its mandate and resources, to provide assistance to the tribunal by protecting sites of interest to investigators.  IFOR has stated that in the event of troops encountering suspects they will detain them and hand them over to The Hague tribunal.  These commitments remain valid for SFOR, the successor force.  It is ultimately the responsibility of the authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to ensure indicted persons are handed over to the tribunal. We will raise that matter at every opportunity with the authorities in the hope that the tribunal can get on with the work it has to do.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment I spoke about the need for something to be done for the long-term unemployed.  The budget did not address that problem and the unemployment figure has decreased by only 300 in the past year. The long-term unemployed, particularly those living in socially excluded areas of our larger suburbs, have been ignored.  I am disappointed there were no measures in the budget to help these people get back to work and thereby make a contribution to their families, communities and society.  A new scheme must be devised, or existing ones such as the back to work scheme and others extended, to give the long-term unemployed a reason to get up in the morning.  We seem to have forgotten about them.  We cannot expect these people to be good citizens if they do not have dignity and the opportunity to share some of the wealth the rest of us enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the changes made in the carer's allowance.  Since the scheme was introduced less than ten years ago it has been extended almost every year but there is still room for improvement. The measure introduced this year whereby a person caring for more than one person can get a top-up payment is to be welcomed.  I know of a <Col N="942" /> case, however, where a person caring for two or perhaps three people was turned down for this top-up payment because the medical guideline level was not reached.  I hope that aspect will be examined.  Despite the income disregard figure many people do not qualify for the carer's allowance. I would like to see a payment being made, even a nominal £25 per week, to people caring for an elderly relative.  That would be an indication that the Government recognises the contribution these people make.</P>
    <P>Many private nursing homes increased their prices recently.  Letters I received from my constituents refer to increases of £40.  I do not know how the nursing homes can justify such an increase when inflation is only 2 per cent.  Many people who previously could afford private nursing care are being driven out of the net and this is creating problems.</P>
    <P>The whole area of housing for the elderly must be examined.  We make provision for the care of the elderly but we do not appear to give much thought to the housing aspect.  I hope that will be addressed in the future, perhaps by appointing a Minister or Minister of State with responsibility for the environment and health.  Local authorities are responsible for housing and health boards are responsible for health issues, but never the twain shall meet.  Those two strands should work together in an effort to provide services for the elderly.  Many people would not have to be in nursing homes if proper care was provided in the community.</P>
    <P>While there has been much talk about job creation, Dublin North-West is not benefiting. Even though we have a Minister in the constituency, it has been passed over for several big enterprises in the past couple of years.  An international report commissioned by the EU stated that Abbotstown was the best location in Dublin for a science park.  When this Government took up office and appointed a Minister from Dublin North-West, the people of the area were sure it would be located there.  However, it was swept from under his nose at the Cabinet table and given to his colleague in Dublin South-West.  We also lost out in respect of a site for a regional technical college on the northside.  It appears the lobbying of two Ministers of State in Dublin West is more powerful than the lobbying of a Minister in Dublin North-West.</P>
    <P>We are bounded by two constituencies in which there have been large scale developments.  The Clonshaugh Industrial Estate, where a number of multinationals have located, is situated in Dublin North-Central and the new shopping centre in Blanchardstown is situated in Dublin West, but Dublin North-West has been ignored.  A campaign has been launched for an industrial estate in Finglas, but the application for designated status is being held up by the general review of the urban renewal scheme.  The Government has designated a special enterprise zone in Grand Canal Street, yuppie land.  While I am aware that is in the Minister for Finance's constituency, how <Col N="943" /> can it qualify for an enterprise zone when Finglas, with largescale unemployment, has to wait until the review of the urban renewal scheme has taken place?  The issue is simply being fudged.</P>
    <P>While everybody may have received a little in the budget, no effort was made to target deprived groups.  A few bob in tax reforms has been spread here and there, but members of the public will be disappointed when they get their cheques in April.  The people will cop on to this Government sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>The annual budget provides an opportunity to reflect on what has been achieved and, more importantly, on what needs to be achieved.  In recent times the details of budgets are known weeks in advance of their being introduced.  A good political economist can usually make a good prediction about the details of a budget.  From a political point of view, recent budgets have been no more than a social event. At one time we would look forward to the budget in the hope that we would not suffer too badly. The last two budgets have enhanced people's positions.  Rather than living in dread of budgets we now live in hope of what we will receive in them.</P>
      <P>The budget presented last month was the third in a package of three presented by this Government. Changes were deliberately targeted at those on low incomes, whether on social welfare or in low paid employment.  The benefits of this budget have been outlined to the House at some length, not only by the Minister for Finance but by the Minister for Social Welfare and other Ministers, Ministers of State and backbenchers.</P>
      <P>The budget is over, but the Finance Bill has yet to be presented.  This is an ideal opportunity to tidy up loose ends left over from the budget.  In other words, what we did not get in the budget we hope to get in the Finance Bill.  One of those loose ends concerns the tax status of corporate donations to charities.  This is not a new issue.  I am not the first person to speak about it and I am sure I will not be the last.</P>
      <P>As demands on charities increase, pressure on their resources also increases.  Charitable organisations carry out work that Governments cannot do.  Irrespective of the buoyancy in an economy or the work of a Government, there are certain areas of society it will not touch through the allocation of finances.  We all know people who live in persistent poverty.  Many factors give rise to poverty, it is not simply caused by a lack of money where charities fill the gap left by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have addressed this House four times on this matter, yet we appear to be no nearer a solution. At a time of buoyant tax receipts, the Minister should make a gesture in the direction of charitable <Col N="944" /> organisations, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which frequently picks up the pieces on behalf of the Government.  A cogent argument has been made by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group for relief on corporate donations from £100 to £10,000.  If the Minister for Finance believes £10,000 is too high, it is willing to discuss the matter.  According to that group's calculations such an initiative, which could be introduced on a pilot basis initially, would increase corporate donations to charities by between £7 million and £11 million, while costing the Exchequer approximately £3 million.  The amount of money donated by individuals far outweighs corporate or Government donations.  We should make it worthwhile for corporations to donate more money to charities.  If they can get tax relief for donating money to certain organisations, surely the same should apply to charitable organisations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that charities benefit from Revenue exemptions and corporations obtain tax relief on a variety of headings, I see no practical obstacle to introducing such a measure, with a built in review after, say, three or four years.  The group making this argument takes a flexible approach.  It researched matters because there were no figures to illustrate how much would be lost to the Revenue or how much it was possible to receive in donations.  The Finance Bill provides the Minister with the opportunity to address this issue.</P>
      <P>The budget provides an opportunity to reflect on what still needs to be done, as well as what has been achieved.  Deputy Noel Ahern said nothing was done for the long-term unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent a constituency similar to the Deputy's in that there is generational unemployment, lack of opportunity and a lack of perception that education provides a way out.  I have always maintained that the only way to tackle the huge problems within these areas is to target resources, yet I am consistently told this is not possible because other sections of society have competing demands.  Given the generations of neglect that have afflicted my constituency, I fail to understand how members of the party that has governed this country for most of the past 75 years can talk about this problem without embarrassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incentives are no longer the issue for the long-term unemployed.  The jobstart scheme is available to those who have been unemployed for more than three years.  FÁS will not only advertise jobs and obtain CVs but will ascertain if those qualifying for the scheme are also qualified for the job on offer.  In addition, the enterprise allowance allows those who are long-term unemployed to retain their social welfare benefits and work with, for example, small community industries. This, and the back to work allowance are further <Col N="945" /> examples of schemes and incentives specifically geared towards the long-term unemployed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy considered the problem in detail he would realise solutions are more concerned with getting people ready for work rather than providing incentives.  This is a long-term problem that will not be resolved by this or the next Government.  It is a matter of providing people with the necessary skills to ensure they are ready to work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  A skills based area has been placed in every constituency, whether it comprises of Leader, FÁS, enterprise partnerships, co-operatives or whatever, but there has been no consideration of the skills requirement in each constituency and how they may be delivered. However, while we may be able to take action and do something worthwhile for the long-term unemployed if we work together, nobody is interested in pursuing this because it is a long-term solution and there are no votes in it.  Nevertheless, it would ultimately ensure we do not continue for another two generations to have persisting unemployment.</P>
      <P>The budget is different to the kind Deputy Michael McDowell would present, even after his latest transformation from Rottweiler to Labrador. The Progressive Democrats and the Deputy McCreevy wing of Fianna Fáil have a clear vision. In fairness, they would probably grant tax relief on charitable donations to corporations.  Indeed this would be necessary, because private charities would have to plug increasing gaps in the brave new Ireland envisaged by Deputies Harney, Michael McDowell and McCreevy.</P>
      <P>Those who wonder what the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil would offer need only cast their minds back to the 1989-92 Administration. That &ldquo;temporary little arrangement&rdquo; had long lasting consequences, including the infamous social welfare cuts introduced by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy. The Administration was also plagued by instability, with Deputy Michael McDowell prowling outside the gates of Government Buildings to ensure his colleagues inside did the right thing.  It is little wonder that Deputy Dermot Ahern and other members of Fianna Fáil display signs of nervousness at the impending betrothal between themselves and the Progressive Democrats. Given that the 1989-92 experience was not a happy one for the party, some Fianna Fáil Deputies would have to be dragged into any new arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was an even less happy experience for this country.  Some 50,000 people were added to the live register.  Mortgage rates spiralled to approximately <Col N="946" /> 15 per cent, forcing hard pressed PAYE workers to find, on average, £80 extra per month, while their average tax bill increased by 17 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

      <P>New housing grants fell to their lowest level in decades, as did local authority dwelling completions.  Cork Corporation built one house in 1990, despite a housing list of over 2,000.  By contrast, under this Government, 100,000 new jobs have been created.  Interest rates are at their lowest ever, child benefit has almost doubled, social welfare payments are finally approaching the minimum recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and there has been a general climate of economic and investor confidence.</P>
      <P>Despite this, and a looming general election, I was astonished to hear Deputy Harney outline her vision of Ireland.  Referring to the Asian economies she recently said that workers &ldquo;are not rich, but they're happy&rdquo;.  I remember as a child hearing the saying that money does not make one happy and the poor always seem to be happier than the rich.  I thought we had moved on from sentiments of that kind.  They are similar to the lines in the hymn &ldquo;All Creatures Great and Small&rdquo;: &ldquo;the rich man in his castle; the poor man at his gate&rdquo;.  This is the Progressive Democrats vision of Ireland.  I hope it always remains a vision without substance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been the most progressive budget in a long time.  I do not say this merely as a Fine Gael Party backbencher. Despite the rhetoric of the Opposition, the public can see that most people will have gained something from a budget produced by the Minister for Finance and overseen by the Taoiseach.  The Government could easily have used the budget for election purposes but it did not.  It made sure to treat the different sections as equally as possible with the available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern, who intends to be the next Taoiseach, said that he would have produced the same Book of Estimates this year as he did when he was Minister for Finance in 1994.  What would this mean for my constituency and others? There would be no work on roads because he would have provided grants of approximately £2.3 million less than the sums provided by the Government for County Monaghan this year.  The budget cannot be taken on its own because it is part of the annual process of letting people know what is happening.  The level of grants for the roads in counties Cavan, Monaghan and other areas has vastly improved over the past two years as a result of the realistic approach of the Government.  The roads were ignored for ten years but Opposition Deputies are attending road meetings and claiming the potholes are our fault. People will not be satisfied until their roads are <Col N="947" /> upgraded but their best chance of having the work done is the current Government.</P>
    <P>Water charges have been a major issue over the years and I am delighted they have been abolished for urban dwellers and users of council run group water schemes.  However, there are many privately run group water schemes in my constituency and this issue will not go away.  It must be treated seriously.  Many groups were established at enormous personal cost to the members of the committees involved.  For example, the Stranoodan group water scheme, in which I was involved in saving from collapse, had to provide an extra £100,000 in personal contributions from its members.</P>
    <P>It received a major grant from European funds for upgrading but such schemes cannot be ignored.  They must be dealt with in a realistic manner.  The county councils in counties Monaghan and Cavan cannot take over the groups and bring them up to European standards.  The Ministers for Finance and the Environment must find a way to deal with this issue.  A simple shortterm solution would be to give a contribution to each household in such groups until finance becomes available to upgrade them and allow the councils to take them over indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The BSE issue, which has cost the Government much money recently, must be addressed.  Provision for extra intervention payments has been expensive but this is perhaps the one area in which the budget failed.  The Minister for Finance and his colleagues must ensure that extra money is made available for increased compensation for those who have been so badly hit by this disease which is outside their control.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's commitment to education.  Many schools, particularly in the northern part of County Monaghan, have been ignored for many years.  I thank the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, for providing money from the £6.5 million she was allocated in the budget for Urbleshanny national school. However, there are at least four more schools on the Minister's list which need major repairs or complete restructuring, including schools in the Scotshouse, Corcaghan, Carrickroe and Ballyocean areas.  I thank the Minister for providing funds for the vocational education committee and the other secondary school in Castleblayney this week but there is still a long way to go.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to read a report today which stated that more money must be spent in the education area on restructuring schools and providing facilities.  The Fianna Fáil Party, according to its literature, plans to hand a computer to each school.  It is unfortunate that the party did not find money when it was in Government to provide toilets and other basic necessities.  The Government will continue in office and ensure schools which were overlooked in the past are properly restored.</P>
    <P>One of the main issues in the budget is the improvement in take home pay.  The 1 per cent <Col N="948" /> reductions in the standard tax rate and employers' contributions are a move in the right direction.  It may not have been done as quickly as the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil claim they would have done it, but they were in office previously and we know what happened.  Most importantly, they could not agree among themselves so it is unlikely they will be able to do so in their new marriage which, apparently, will take place soon.</P>
    <P>The important issue for many people is tax rates.  The increased allowances and the other measures in the budget will mean that a married couple could have up to £1,000 extra in their pockets at the end of the year.  This is a major achievement in addition to the fact that for the first time the children of such couples will receive free college education this year.  However, there are still anomalies in the maintenance grant system for students living away from home.  This is particularly relevant for students who are not from Dublin or the area in which the college is situated.  All the children from counties Cavan and Monaghan must have residential places in Dublin, Sligo, Galway and elsewhere.  Those counties have the third lowest ratio of students at third level and it is wrong that such issues are not taken into account in the Estimates.  This matter must be examined and I have been in contact with the Minister about it.</P>
    <P>Enterprise is most important and constituencies such as mine depend on self help rather than the IDA or inward investment.  Corporation tax for small businesses with profits up to £50,000 has been reduced from 40 per cent two years ago to 28 per cent this year.  Special relief regarding capital acquisitions tax is also important and the reduction in the rate of capital gains tax payable on the disposal of shares in small and medium-sized business from 27 per cent to 26 per cent is a step forward.  I welcome these and the social welfare changes.  The gap between the lower level of income and social welfare is too narrow.  Those on social welfare automatically get a medical card and can avail of the free bus service, free health service and so on.  A justifiable income structure should be introduced for people on low income. In that regard I welcome the change in FIS, which must be highlighted if people are to utilise it in full.  Unfortunately, many people still do not know about it and many employers do not encourage people to avail of it.</P>
    <P>There have been generous improvements in social welfare.  On the one hand Deputy Bertie Ahern and Deputy McCreevy said that we must reduce pay-outs while on the other they said that an increase of £3 in social welfare is of little use. We all accept that more should be done, but some of the benefits available to the elderly are not available in many other countries.</P>
    <P>The improvement in carer's allowance is very welcome, but again in rural Ireland there is an anomaly.  I have raised this matter with the Minister for Social Welfare and I understand the costs involved in applying the allowance on a national <Col N="949" /> basis.  In rural areas where a son or daughter of an elderly person builds a house near a parent to look after him or her in old age, they should be entitled to carer's allowance even though they do not live with the parent.  The argument may be made that that should also apply to elderly people living in a town or village, but it is easier for those people to get assistance since there are other houses close by.  That matter must be seriously considered.  I know cases in my county where one spouse has to stay at home to look after an elderly parent.  In one case a person living in an extension of the elderly person's house receives carer's allowance whereas another person who lives ten yards from the house of the elderly parent does not receive it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the health initiatives taken in this budget.  The provision of £10 million towards mental handicap services in addition to the £2 million made available in the Book of Estimates is a major step forward.  We all welcome help for those who are less well off than ourselves, physically and mentally.  There is also provision for an extra £6 million for the cancer strategy, £5 million for child care and £4 million to reduce waiting lists.</P>
    <P>This is a progressive budget.  In the past two years the number of jobs increased by 100,000, unemployment fell by more than 30,000, or 14 per cent, GNP increased in real terms by more than 14 per cent and investment increased by about 20 per cent.  I am, however, disappointed a greater effort was not made to encourage investment in areas outside Dublin.  The Government must generate a policy to ensure incentives are given to business people to set up in rural areas.  Otherwise there will be further decline in those areas.</P>
    <P>In the past three years child benefit has been increased by a massive amount, exports have increased, interest rates are low, and the inflation rate is 2 per cent.  This budget will allow the country to progress and will allow the Government to return to office after the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a bheith labhairt ar an gcáinaisnéis.  From the Green Party's point of view I have a number of things to say. The general media response to this budget was informed by some of the most articulate Government spokespersons, spin doctors and lobbyists, and credit is due to them for succeeding in presenting a tantalising package which makes people believe they will be better off.  They were persuaded that the budget had something to offer most people.  There is need to reveal the propaganda and to seriously consider what the Conference of Religious of Ireland has referred to as a budget which did nothing to narrow the gap between rich and poor &mdash; it succeeded in widening it further.  That was the biggest challenge facing the Government, but it failed in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not for a malicious reason that I feel angry at this budget.  Immense opportunities were missed. Even though the Minister boasted about a net gain of 45,000 jobs last year, the number <Col N="950" /> unemployed in 1996 was 14,000 greater than in 1990.  Under the current system of economics we would need a net gain of 400,000 jobs over the present number in order to eliminate unemployment by 2002.  I do not know if that is the Government's target, but economists would agree that is not possible based on current economics.</P>
    <P>There is a certain psychology underlying current economics in that all the parties seem to regard people as a drug trafficker regards an addict.  Both are told to stay loyal, not to cause trouble and they will be looked after if they bear with it.  The opportunity was there at the time of the budget for a radical shift in economic thinking and the Government squandered it.  It claims to be riding the &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo; and that everything will be fine if we bear with it.  The money was there to replace the social welfare system with a radical and appropriate post-industrial guaranteed basic income scheme.  That was spoken of by parties now in Government as being a progressive and logical step forward but it was ignored.</P>
    <P>That guaranteed basic income payment largely replaces social welfare payments and the tax-free allowance payments so it relates both to the employed and unemployed.  The costings have been done by various independent bodies. Although we would have differences with the Conference of Religious of Ireland in relation to the way it proposes to introduce guaranteed basic income, it proved one can go a long way towards bringing that system in and not disrupt the economy. The Economic and Social Research Institute has also done a study that shows this is a very realistic and timely option that could be worked on if the Government had the courage to do so.</P>
    <P>The room to manoeuvre in removing the burden of tax from human labour was also squandered. It should be put on finite resources such as land &mdash; land speculation has been at the root of many of our rezoning scandals &mdash; and energy, which we have to import in large measure and pay for dearly.  The ESRI has reported that such a shift in taxation would enhance Ireland's competitiveness internationally.  What is annoying is that the last budget mooted such a radical change in tax but the Government, which should deliver on its ideas, failed to grasp the nettle and build a sustainable and equitable society around these changes.</P>
    <P>When I made these points in the budget debate it was shocking to hear the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications say a shift in taxation away from human labour and on to carbon, energy and other finite resources was not on and would ruin us.  I ask the Minister to read carefully the research from the European Commission and the ESRI and to realise they are saying that Ireland, above all others in the EU, has the ability and structures to bring in an &ldquo;ecotax&rdquo; or carbon tax and shift tax away from human labour, where it is a disincentive to employment.</P>
    <P>That ability is there because our development as an economy is not primarily dominated by <Col N="951" /> heavy industry.  Ours is a country with light industry and a vast surplus of human labour.  Research has proven it to be possible for Ireland to radically reform its taxation system but the Government has failed to do so.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Nurses' Dispute.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision by the Labour Court to issue a recommendation tomorrow night in the nurses' dispute and I hope a satisfactory resolution can be reached.  The Labour Court is working under immense pressure and I wish it well.</P>
      <P>However, it is a matter of great concern that the limited deal on cover which the Government claimed to have done with the nursing unions last week is already unwinding.  Today we heard a specialist from a cardiac unit speak of the potential problems.  Those difficulties will be replicated across the entire health services.</P>
      <P>Even though the dispute has been looming for six months, it is only now that the Department of Health and the management of the health services are developing a contingency plan.  A major mistake was made by the Minister for Health in leaving the development of cover procedures until the last minute.  Trying to put these in place just days before potentially the most serious strike in the history of the State is very bad management. Efforts were made by the nursing unions some time ago to develop contingency plans for the health service but these did not receive a response from the Department of Health.  Likewise, even though there is a provision for a code of practice in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, for disputes in essential services, the Department of Health also did not act on this.</P>
      <P>The Government's handling of the entire dispute is in doubt.  Not one concrete proposal has been put forward since the Taoiseach announced three weeks ago, at the launch of Partnership 2000 that the dispute would have to be resolved. There is no apparent Government strategy to avoid the potentially most serious strike in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil wants to see justice done to the caring profession.  Nurses play a vital role in the health services.  They are integral to its functioning and their work is of immense value.  In the past, when Fianna Fáil has been in Government, there have been disputes where more rigid national agreements and more difficult fiscal conditions applied in the economy.  Amongst these were disputes involving the ESB, radiographers, dental assistants, fire brigade staff and hospital doctors.  In each instance the disputes were resolved with political will and imagination despite the limitations of the Programme for <Col N="952" /> National Recovery and the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that the aspirations of nurses in relation to pay and conditions can be met over a reasonable timeframe.  The party believes this would yield tangible improvements in health service delivery.</P>
    <P>If a national nursing strike goes ahead, the entire health service will grind to a halt, probably within hours of the strike starting.  The chaos that will result is unthinkable.  The Minister for Health and the health service managers at the Labour Court must be conscious of this.</P>
    <P>It is very unfair to leave the Labour Court in the unenviable position of trying to resolve this dispute at the 59th minute of the 11th hour.  The Minister was wrong to remain at arm's length from the dispute for so long.  After two rejections of the pay offer, he should have got directly involved and tried one last effort.  He should have responded to the request from the unions to hold a direct meeting with them and he certainly should have taken up the offer from the General Secretary of SIPTU for a commission on nurses' pay and conditions.  This could and probably will form part of the ultimate solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance's intervention in the dispute on 10 November, when he told nurses they had made 'a gross error of judgment' was also a serious mistake.  His comments were very insulting to nurses who work under immense pressure and have hardened attitudes in the dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now on the verge of the first national nurses' strike.  This situation is most grave and it is fitting that the Dáil should be informed at this late hour of the status of negotiations and the progress towards avoiding a strike.</P>
      <P>Nobody doubts the catastrophic impact the strike will have.  Today one of the country's leading heart surgeons voiced his concern at non-acute cardiac operations being postponed and said that he and his colleagues would face difficulties in deciding which patients deserved priority once the dispute begins.</P>
      <P>On a human basis, most people accept that nurses have some genuine grievances and that there is legitimacy in some aspects of their claim. Spending on the health services has doubled over the past five years to £2.5 billion.  It costs £25 million a week more to run the health services now than it did five years ago.  Will the Minister explain how spending has increased to this extent without taking into account the nurses' grievances over that period?  The nurses have been pressing for a revision of their terms and conditions since the early 1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party has met individual nurses and their union representatives.  Traditionally, nurses have not been and are still not militant.  They have proved this by their genuine concern to ensure contingency measures are put in place during the strike to protect those who are most ill.  Their <Col N="953" /> plight is not unrelated to gender.  If the INO represented 26,000 men providing an essential service there would not have been such slow progress in addressing their grievances.  In all walks of life, in and outside the home, women's work is undervalued.  This lies at the root of the nurses' problems.  The nursing profession has been taken for granted.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister provide a detailed estimate of the £100 million gap which he claims exists between the nurses' claim and the offer the Government has made?  Will he explain whether consideration has been given to the establishment of a commission to examine the nursing profession, with particular reference to the current claims?  Will the Minister explain which particular aspects of the nurses' claim, apart from the pay aspect, are causing difficulties for the Government? Some aspects of the claim must surely not involve an extra cash outlay for the Government.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that much of the pressure for higher pay in the public service stems from the Government's failure to address seriously the issue of personal taxation?  If my party's tax proposals were fully implemented the net increase in take home pay for a staff nurse would be about 15 per cent, even before a nominal increase in salary.  At this late stage I hope the Minister can hold out some hope that the dispute will be resolved before the strike takes effect next Monday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): As Deputies may be aware, I met representatives of the Alliance of Nursing Unions on 21 January last.  Both sides availed of the opportunity to take stock of the current situation.  The meeting also involved discussion of the contingency planning arrangements being made by hospitals and other health services providers.</P>
      <P>Deputies will also be aware that an invitation from the Labour Court to talks on the dispute and the threatened strike has been accepted by both sides.  Talks commenced on Tuesday evening and continued yesterday.  The powers of the Labour Court under section 26 of the Industrial Relations Act have been invoked to make a formal intervention and both sides have made their submission to the court.  Deputies may already be aware that the court announced this afternoon that it will make its recommendation to the parties not later than midnight on Friday, 7 February. The court is issuing this statement to allow the parties to the dispute to make arrangements to consider the recommendation prior to expiration of strike notice on Monday, 10 February.</P>
      <P>On the issue of contingency planning, I have taken steps to ensure that the impact for patients should the threatened strike proceed be contained to the maximum extent possible.  I am obliged to the Deputies for affording me this opportunity to set out the current position in relation to contingency planning arrangements for the nurses' threatened strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health service managers held two meetings &mdash;<Col N="954" /> on 14 and 31 January &mdash; with the Alliance of Nursing Unions to discuss the broad approach to ensuring that emergency and essential services will be maintained for the duration of the threatened strike.  In tandem management in all health agencies have drawn up detailed contingency plans for their own organisations.  These continue to be refined on the basis of ongoing discussions held with local strike committees.  The principles on which an emergency service will be provided have been agreed with the union leadership in the discussions at national level and these have, to my understanding, been communicated to strike committees.</P>
    <P>However, I have been informed that in some areas local strike committees are not honouring commitments given at national level by the nursing alliance in relation to contingency arrangements. This could put patient care at risk, particularly as some agencies consider that the level of service on offer is not sufficient to provide safe essential services.  It is imperative that the outstanding issues in relation to these plans be resolved as a matter of urgency.  Steps are being taken at national and local level to achieve this.</P>
    <P>My Department is in direct contact with all the affected agencies and has identified all the high risk areas within the service.  Eight regional centres have been provided to provide an ongoing flow of information on a daily basis to the Department in relation to service disruption, preparation of resources centrally and regionally and to deal with communications with patients, impending patients and their families.  A co-ordinated media information campaign in relation to the impact of the strike is already under way.</P>
    <P>In common with other Deputies, I do not want to see a nurses' strike.  However, I am sure Deputy Cowen, whose party was one of the architects of the PCW, and Deputy O'Donnell, whose colleagues continually stress the need to control and reduce public expenditure, will agree that there must be a limit to the resources which can be committed to resolving the dispute.  Every possible effort will continue to the made to avert the strike.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Water Fluoridation.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to rattle the cage of complacency in relation to the fluoridation of water which is a national scandal. We should bring our legislation into line with the rest of Europe and stop the compulsory mass medication of our people with the notorious poison fluoride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Water fluoridation came into effect in Ireland following the failure of an appeal to the Supreme Court against the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.  This is probably the only democracy in the world that forces fluoride on its citizens by law.  Irish people are probably ingesting more artificial fluoride than any other people on earth.  Fluoride is extremely toxic; it is more toxic than lead.  It is suspected of causing <Col N="955" /> thyroid problems, stomach problems, drowsiness and listlessness.  It is also suspected of causing infertility and birth defects in farm animals.  To remove fluoride from water the water must be distilled.</P>
    <P>It is time to stop this crazy experiment with our health.  It cannot be lawful for a state to poison its own people.  We have ample evidence that fluoridation is damaging our health.  Fluorosis &mdash; the discolouring of teeth &mdash; is the first manifestation of fluoride poisoning.  There has been evidence for several years that Irish children have a high rate of fluorosis.  The only argument in favour of fluoridation is that it may reduce the amount of tooth decay in children.  There is evidence for and against this.  Continental European children's teeth are not significantly worse than our children's teeth.  No continental EU country fluoridates its water, except for a few districts in Spain. Do the people of Germany, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Finland, Austria, Greece and Norway know something we do not?</P>
    <P>Fewer than 2 per cent of EU citizens have to drink fluoridated water.  However, 73 per cent of our drinking water is fluoridated.  In the UK approximately 10 per cent of water supplies are fluoridated and there is strong public resistance to it.  In Northern Ireland only the Maze Prison and the small districts of Holywood and Tandragee have fluoridated water.  The British Government wants to impose fluoridation throughout Northern Ireland, although 25 of the 26 district councils and most of the leading politicians are against it.</P>
    <P>Nobody has proved that low level dosing with fluoride is safe.  The one part per million level enshrined in our law was never scientifically established.  In any case, nobody knows with how much fluoride Irish people are being dosed.  It is deliberately added to our water, toothpaste, mouthwashes, some food products and many other products. Since water fluoridation started in the 1960s, several thousand tonnes of fluoride have been dispersed throughout the public water supplies alone.  The fluoride molecule is so small that it passes through all ordinary water filters.  Unfortunately, it does not pass through the body &mdash; 40 per cent of the fluoride swallowed is retained. More than one tonne of fluoride is dispersed in our public water supplies every day.  Approximately 99.5 per cent of it does not go for its intended purpose &mdash; down our throats.  Nearly all that fluoride is effectively dumped into our environment, without any environmental audit or research into the effects.  The latest Environmental Protection Agency report on Irish drinking water said &ldquo;Fluoride is still frequently in excess.&rdquo; Three point three per cent of samples exceeded the maximum permissible dose.  The fluoride added to our water is toxic waste from the super-phosphate fertiliser industry.  It is collected from the scrubber of the factory chimneys.  Instead of <Col N="956" /> being safely disposed of, it is dispersed in our drinking water.</P>
    <P>If I want fluoride, I can find it in toothpaste and many other sources.  In Ireland, fluoride is forced down our throats.  Most of us, except those able to afford natural mineral water, have to drink this poison morning, noon and night.  Is it unlawful for the health authorities and local authorities to have water fluoridation for the sake of public safety?  German MEP Hiltrud Breyer said recently &ldquo;Fluoridation should be stopped.  The practice of fluoridation is mass medication.  We would never allow it in Germany.  It may be possible to take it to the European Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The civil liberties aspect of this issue needs to be addressed.  Do I not have the right to avoid drinking this?  Clearly, the risk of water fluoridation outweighs the benefit.  I am asking for our legislation to be brought into line with the rest of Europe and have a stop put to the compulsory mass medication of our people with what is effectively a poison called fluoride.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabhail don Teachta Trevor Sargent as ucht an cheist seo a chur orm.</P>
      <P>Fluoride is supplemented to the public piped water supplies as a positive public health measure for the reduction and control of dental caries to the optimal level of one part of fluoride per million parts of water, under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.  There is no evidence to suggest the fluoridation of public water supplies has a deleterious health effect.  The majority of Irish people have been consuming water fluoridated at about the optimal level for more than 30 years.  This has proved not to pose any threat to their health, well being, and safety. Ireland is not unique in this.  The experience is exactly similar in all other places which provide fluoridated public water supplies to their people.</P>
      <P>Fluoride occurs widely in nature.  I am not aware of any evidence to suggest the fluoridation of the public water supplies has any damaging environmental consequences.  The effectiveness and safety of water fluoridation in reducing dental caries in Ireland has been factually shown by the results of the many scientific studies carried out here at national, regional and local levels.  Not only is it effective it is also most efficient in reducing the levels of decay significantly at a very modest cost.  It has been shown repeatedly that water fluoridation is the most effective and cost effective safe method of reducing dental caries in the individual and in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has some of the lowest levels of dental caries for developed countries and these low rates are due to our national scheme of water fluoridation. It would be expected that the termination of the national water fluoridation programme would result in levels of dental caries rising to those levels pertaining in Northern Ireland where there is no such comparable scheme.  Dental caries in Northern Ireland are generally about 40 to 50 per cent higher than in the Republic.  The <Col N="957" /> national water fluoridation scheme is the envy of many other countries which seek to learn from our experience in this area of health protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to raise with the Minister a matter which is of grave concern and worry to parents in Loughshinny. St. Catherine's estate and the village of Rush in my constituency.  The matter relates to the obnoxious smells which have emanated from the gas shore terminal since the pipeline came into operation.  However, three weeks ago the smell got so bad that children living in the area complained of headaches and stomach pains. Adults in the area also complained that their children were more prone to chest ailments.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Emmet Stagg, Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, for the interest he has taken in this issue since I first brought it to his attention.  However, given the gravity of the situation, it is imperative that the Minister puts on record what action his Department and Bord Gais Éireann have taken or propose to take to resolve this problem.  The people of Loughshinny are not prepared to accept promises; they demand action.</P>
      <P>A considerable number of the children living in the area developed headaches and stomach complaints.  In other cases, children were kept away from school and some of those who went to school were forced to remain indoors during their lunch break because of the effects of the smell. Teachers and parents became extremely concerned about the situation and in desperation a parents' action committee was formed.  Given the promises that have been made by Bord Gais Éireann on previous occasions and its repeated statements that there are no health risks associated with the odourisation process, the committee was not reassured.</P>
      <P>In an effort to highlight their concerns the parents contacted the media and a number of local public representatives.  I visited the gas station two weeks ago and spoke to a number of constituents about this problem.  They were very angry.  In the national interest the people of Loughshinny and Rush have fully co-operated with Bord Gais Éireann in the construction of the new pipeline and gas shore terminal in Loughshinny, particularly given its proximity to local housing developments.  They were not informed they would have to put up with such an obnoxious smell and potential danger for the rest of their lives and are not prepared to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of my constituents I request that the odourant top-up facility at Loughshinny be relocated and in this regard, I ask the Minister of State to consider the possibility of transferring this facility to Scotland.  Mr. Tim O'Leary of Bord Gais Éireann has contacted me and local residents to explain the position.  However, the Minister should reassure the people of north County <Col N="958" /> Dublin that the necessary action will be taken to ensure there will not be a recurrence of this appalling situation.  Furthermore, the health and welfare of local people is paramount.  Accordingly, it is of the utmost importance that the concerns of local people are addressed and answered.</P>
    <P>I compliment the parents' action committee and the Loughshinny and district community association for highlighting this important issue and for stating clearly that enough is enough.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</P>

I have made inquiries from Bord Gáis, which receives supplies of natural gas from Scotland via the interconnector sub-sea pipeline.  The gas comes ashore at Loughshinny in County Dublin from where it is subsequently fed into the Bord Gáis national transmission system which supplies domestic and industrial markets throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In accordance with international practice, gas for sale must be odorised to a level which will ensure a distinctive smell &mdash; in its natural state the gas has no smell.  This is an essential safety measure.  The chemicals involved are not a health hazard, though they do have a very strong odour. Interconnector gas supplies, while fully odorised at point of purchase in Scotland, are currently losing some of their smell en route to Ireland due to the relative newness of the interconnector pipeline. There is, therefore, a need to top up odorant levels at Loughshinny.</P>
      <P>Recent essential maintenance activities on the facility have given rise to release of unacceptable quantities of odorant vapour which have caused problems in the local area.  Throughout all these activities Bord Gáis has maintained close contact with local community associations, including direct contact with Deputy Ryan, as he stated. Since the initial reports of odour nuisance in the Rush and Loughshinny areas, the Department's chief technical adviser has been working closely with Bord Gáis to eliminate the problem.</P>
      <P>A schedule of works has been agreed between the Department and Bord Gáis.  This involves, among other things, replacing the old odorant injection facilities at the Loughshinny gas terminal with superior equipment.  It also involves the installation of odorisation facilities at the Bord Gáis compressor station in Scotland, designed to provide fully odorised gas at Loughshinny in the shortest possible time.  As soon as fully odorised gas is received at Loughshinny odorant injection at Loughshinny will be discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a number of site visits to Loughshinny since 20 January, my Department's chief technical adviser has reported to me that the new injection equipment was finally installed and made fully operational by 7 p.m. on 31 January. The old injection facility, which had been the <Col N="959" /> cause of the odour problem, was then disconnected prior to removal.  On behalf of Bord Gáis, I apologise to the local population for any nuisance caused to them.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform Deputy Ryan that all <Col N="960" /> possible action has been taken to safeguard against a repetition of the problem.  I thank him for pursuing the matter so vigorously and for bringing it to my attention.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 11 February 1997.</P>

      <P>It has not been necessary to have discussions with the US authorities about the operation of the DV-98 programme, that is diversity immigrant visas to be issued from 1 October 1997 to 30 September 1998.  Entries for the lottery to determine who may apply must be received in the period 3 February to 5 March 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only change compared to previous years of which I am aware is that the 1996 US Immigration Act authorised the charging of a fee to applicants, that is those who proceed with visa <Col N="962" /> applications after being successful in the lottery. The amount of this fee has yet to be determined.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any restriction additional to those which applied in previous years.</P>
    <P>Ireland's share of the total of 55,000 visas available worldwide is expected to be between 1,000 and 1,100.  According to the US Department of State 1,118 Irish entrants &mdash; including 128 from Northern Ireland &mdash; were successful in the DV-97 lottery.</P>
    <P>People born in Ireland, North and South, who have, by their interview date, a high school education or equivalent &mdash; e.g. a pass leaving certificate &mdash; or two years experience in an occupation requiring two years training, that experience having been gained in the previous five years, are eligible to enter the lottery.  Only one entry per person is accepted.</P>
    <P>Detailed information about the procedures is available from the US Embassy in leaflet form or by telephoning 6672707 or 6688049 in Dublin. Such information is also available from the Consular Section of my Department, from our Embassy in Washington or from our Consulates-General in Boston, Chicago, New York or San Francisco.</P>
    <P>The diversity visa programme is the only general programme which enables Irish citizens to reside permanently in the United States.  On my visits to Washington I have frequently raised the issue of the future of diversity visas with key members of Congress in order to ensure that this important programme is maintained.  The Embassy in Washington also carefully monitors developments in US immigration and other legislation affecting Irish people and frequently makes our concerns known to our many friends in Congress. I am pleased that, partly as a result of our efforts, last year's serious threat to the future of the diversity programme was overcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15, 24, 25 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference which is examining possible amendments to the Treaties establishing the European Union opened in March 1996.  The European Council meeting in Florence in June 1996 reaffirmed the principal aims of the conference and requested the Irish Presidency to bring forward for the European Council meeting in Dublin in December &ldquo;a general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties&rdquo;. As Deputies know, the Irish Presidency organised the work of the Intergovernmental Conference to that end and presented the outline draft treaty requested on 5 December.  This was considered by a conclave of Foreign Ministers on 6 December and by the European Council meeting in Dublin on 13 and 14 December.  The European Council accepted the document as a good basis for the work of the conference as the negotiations move into their final phase.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference has, of course, not yet reached the stage of definitive agreement on the issues under consideration. Negotiations are continuing under the Dutch Presidency and the conference remains set to conclude in Amsterdam in June.  It is important to recall that all Treaty amendments must be approved unanimously by the member states at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>I am confident that, notwithstanding the differences of approach between the member states, agreement will be reached on an outcome which preserves the coherence and cohesion of the Union.  That was a primary aim of the Irish Presidency and remains central to the concerns of the Irish delegation.  The further development of flexibility in the Union must ensure that the cohesion and coherence of the Union are maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outline draft treaty addresses the broad aims set for the Intergovernmental Conference, namely, to address the most direct concerns of citizens including in relation to employment and the fight against international crime, to develop an effective and coherent external policy, and to ensure the efficient and effective functioning of the institutions, notably in the context of further enlargement.  The document aims to explain <Col N="964" /> clearly and precisely, not just to the participants at the conference but to the public more generally, the challenges which are being addressed and the solutions proposed.  A copy of the document has been sent to the Oireachtas Library and to every Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As regards people with a disability, the outline draft treaty proposes the inclusion of a new Treaty provision which would allow the Council to take appropriate action to prohibit discrimination on various grounds including disability. The document also recalls for further consideration the proposal, initially brought forward by the Irish delegation, that provision might additionally be made in the Treaty to take special account of persons with a disability.  Ireland will continue during the final phase of the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations to support a strengthening of the Treaty provisions in relation to disability.  Any anti-discrimination provisions which are agreed should include nondiscrimination on the grounds of disability.</P>
    <P>Membership of the Commission is one of a number of very sensitive institutional issues being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference. The final outcome on these sensitive institutional questions is not likely to become clear until the final stage of the negotiations.  The Irish Presidency's outline draft treaty includes an analysis of these issues and touches on the main options under consideration.  We accepted the general view of our partners that it would not have been appropriate to put forward specific Treaty texts on these issues at this stage.</P>
    <P>Ireland has repeatedly made clear at the Intergovernmental Conference its view that the further enlargement of the Union should not have any implications for the right of every member state to nominate a full member of the European Commission.  We and several other member states believe that it is central to the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Commission that each member state should continue to be entitled to nominate a full member of the Commission. Members of the Commission, of course, do not act as national representatives.  It is, however, important that the Commission in reaching its decisions should be fully aware of the sensitivities in all member states and be seen to be aware of those sensitivities.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of support emerging for a strengthening of the powers of the President of the Commission and for examining the internal organisation and structures of the Commission with a view to possible improvements.</P>
    <P>With regard to the review of the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, the outline draft treaty recognised that the Union must enhance its capacity to ensure that its external action is effective in all its aspects if it is to play an international role commensurate with its responsibilities and its economic capacity.  The document put forward proposals for streamlining procedures in respect of the three inter-connected phases of the foreign policy process &mdash; preparation, <Col N="965" /> adoption and implementation of decisions.  It suggested that existing decision-making procedures might be improved by extending the use of qualified majority voting except for Joint Actions and decisions with security and defence implications, subject to the proviso that if a member state opposed the adoption of a decision by qualified majority, no vote would be taken.  A provision was made for referral of such matters to the European Council for decision by unanimity.  We also provided in the draft outline treaty for the introduction of a &ldquo;constructive abstention&rdquo; clause, whereby a member state opposed to a decision requiring unanimity could abstain where there was a qualified majority in favour.</P>
    <P>In preparing the draft texts on decision-making, we sought to reconcile the need for more effective decision-making with that of maintaining widespread support in member states for the Union's foreign policy.  The involvement of all member states in decision-making in CFSP is essential if the Union's foreign policy is to be credible, sustainable and have the necessary international impact.</P>
    <P>No proposal has been tabled at the conference by the Commission or by any other delegation to the effect that smaller EU member states should give up their foreign policy veto in exchange for a commitment by the large countries to conduct their foreign policy through the EU.  Such a proposal if it were tabled, would of course not be acceptable to the Irish delegation.</P>

      <P>I support appropriate proposals for a limitation on the use of the veto accorded to the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council under Article 27 of the United Nations Charter.  At a time when there is an increasing and positive trend for issues to be decided by consensus within the Security Council, it would seem both desirable and appropriate that consideration be given to reducing the scope and use or threat of use of the veto in decision-making by the Security Council</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current negotiations taking place between the member states of the United Nations on the issue of reform of the Security Council, Ireland has made clear that it favours a much more restricted use of the veto power and has proposed several areas where the veto should not apply in council decision making.  These include preventative diplomacy measures, the dispatch of UN observers to observe and report to the Security Council, humanitarian measures, including resolutions calling on parties to a conflict to agree <Col N="966" /> a ceasefire and abide by Geneva conventions, and for the referral of issues to the International Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>As well as favouring changes to limit the present practice in the use of the veto, I also believe that in the event of any future increase in the number of the permanent members of the Security Council, the power of veto should not be extended to any such new members.  It is clear in current negotiations on this issue that a majority of the UN membership wish to see a more restricted use of the veto and Ireland will continue to support efforts to agree on how this might be done.</P>
    <P>It is also evident that an immediate and total abolition of the existing veto powers of the permanent members of the Security Council is not likely, not least since under the Charter provisions this would require the agreement of the permanent members themselves.  The provision in the UN Charter regarding the veto was based on the understanding that for the Security Council to act effectively to maintain international peace and security, it would be necessary that its decisions in this regard had the agreement and support of all the permanent members.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless this consideration need not be affected by measures of reform, such as those proposed by Ireland, which would restrict the potential use of the veto on issues for decision by the Security Council.  Such reforms could serve to make the decision-making of the Security Council more representative of the views of the member states of the organisation, on whose behalf the Security Council acts, under Article 24 of the Charter, in taking measures to ensure international peace and security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the debt problem of the poorest and least developed countries and the serious constraint it imposes on their economic and social development. We have consistently used the relevant international fora to emphasise the need to find ways to address the debt problems of the least developed countries and to indicate our openness to innovative solutions.  In his address to the World Social Summit in Copenhagen in March 1995, the Taoiseach called for a fresh approach to debt issues and the consideration of all options, including debt cancellation.  In addition the Minister for Finance, as Ireland's representative on the board of governors of the World Bank and the IMF, has consistently highlighted the situation <Col N="967" /> of the most severely indebted countries and has pressed the case for significant alleviation of the debt burden of the developing countries.</P>
      <P>There is now a growing sensitivity at the international level to the debt in the developing countries and a general recognition and acceptance that it is essential to make serious in roads into the problem of excessive debt burdens.  The debt initiative for highly indebted poor countries, the so-called HIPC Initiative which was agreed at the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank last October, represents a significant step forward in the international community's response to the debt problem of the most indebted countries.  The HIPC Initiative is designed to relieve the debts of as many as 20 poor countries, most of them in Africa.  It is intended to help reduce their debts down to sustainable levels in the interests of their economic and social development.  It is comprehensive in nature in that all creditors, including multilateral financial institutions as well as bilateral and commercial creditors, are expected to meet their share of the necessary debt reduction of eligible countries' debt.  As part of the HIPC Initiative, the Paris Club of bilateral creditor countries has agreed on its part to write off up to 80 per cent of eligible debt owed by lowincome countries on a case-by-case basis, compared to 67 per cent currently available under the so-called Naples terms.  The initiative can produce significant debt relief for severely indebted countries and should be given an opportunity to work.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that Ireland, as a non-creditor country, is not directly party to the debt problem and is not in a position itself to give a lead in the area of debt cancellation.  However, we will continue to use our influence to press for a just and comprehensive long-term solution to the debt problem in the developing world and would be prepared to give positive consideration to any proposals aimed at achieving that, including proposals involving debt cancellation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland and her partners in the European Union have been actively seeking to promote an early and peaceful solution to the current crisis in Serbia.  I have availed of all appropriate opportunities, including contacts with the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to press the authorities in Belgrade to observe democratic norms, especially with regard to the <Col N="968" /> electoral process, show full respect for human and minority rights, and refrain from the use of force.</P>
      <P>The European Union has fully endorsed the conclusions and recommendations of the report prepared by the OSCE mission led by Mr. Felipé Gonzalez, which visited Serbia on 20 and 21 December 1996.  We have consistently stated it is essential that the FRY authorities accept those conclusions and recommendations in their entirety.  We have called on the FRY to pursue reform directed towards full democratisation and liberalisation of the political and economic system, in dialogue with the opposition.  I was particularly appalled by the further violence in recent days when the authorities once again attempted to deny the people's rights of peaceful protest and which resulted in a number of civilians being injured.  The Government condemns such brutal police action in the strongest possible terms.</P>
      <P>Our action has not, however, been limited to statements of condemnation and disapproval. Under the Irish Presidency, in December, the European Union decided to defer the extension of trade preferences to the FRY, in the light of the recent events in Serbia.  The Dublin European Council reaffirmed that respect for democratic norms, human and minority rights, including the granting of a large degree of autonomy to Kosovo, will be key factors in determining the European Union's future relationship with the FRY and its further integration in the international community.  The Union is continuing to withhold its agreement to the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the EU and the FRY.</P>
      <P>Finally, we have seen reports from Belgrade on 4 February that President Milosevic has given in to the intense international pressure and issued instructions that the results of the 17 November elections should be reinstated.  I welcome this, but with some caution.  It appears that special legislation will need to be passed by parliament to implement the decision, so the process may take days if not weeks.  Furthermore, we have no indications as yet that these measures will address the fundamental flaws in the electoral process which led to the original fraud.  We will continue to insist that wide-ranging democratic reforms must be carried out.  The economic and social, as well as the political system of Serbia are in urgent need of change.  There must be safeguards for independent media and a guaranted right of unhindered, peaceful opposition protest.  There are also other unresolved issues which must be addressed, including the question of the status of Kosovo and human and minority rights throughout the FRY, including also in Vojvodina and Sandzak.  The situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the means which the EU has at its disposal to respond to it, will remain under active and ongoing consideration within the Fifteen, and Ireland will continue to advocate a strong and unequivocal stance in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the future, the question of imposing sanctions remains an option.  However, a number of <Col N="969" /> factors need to be considered in this context.  The opposition in Belgrade is not advocating new sanctions and indeed argues that they could prove counter-productive, as the brunt of their impact would undoubtedly fall on the ordinary population. Also, it must be borne in mind that for economic sanctions to be effective, they must have the authority of the UN Security Council, and support for sanctions against Belgrade is unlikely to be forthcoming from Russia, or indeed China.  However, the situation must be kept under continuous review and options assessed in light of developments.  A deterioration in the situation would call for a review of potential political, diplomatic and economic measures against Belgrade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 28 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Governments have considered the findings of the Widgery tribunal in relation to Bloody Sunday to be profoundly unsatisfactory and the matter has been raised by them with the British Government.  Central to our concern over the years has been the failure of the British authorities to adequately respond to the demand of the relatives of the 14 people who died that their innocence be unequivocally recognised.  When I met the relatives in 1994 I was impressed by their <Col N="970" /> focus on the need to remove once and for all the slur that the Widgery report left on the memory of their loved ones.  There was no desire to relieve the anger of the past and indeed relatives of those who died have made clear that they do not wish their loss to be used in any way which might delay the advent of wider peace and reconciliation on these islands.</P>
    <P>The re-evaluation of the evidence which coincides with the 25th anniversary of this atrocity has prompted a number of additional concerns regarding the Widgery tribunal's proceedings and conclusions.  It has also, as Bishop Edward Daly among others has pointed out, caused people to relieve the events of that day and perhaps recall in a newly heightened way serious concerns which they had at the time about the treatment of the evidence.  Accounts of firing from Derry's walls onto the marchers below raise the most serious questions about the British Army's activity on Bloody Sunday.  So do the discrepancies which have apparently emerged between what British soldiers involved in the shootings first told investigators and what they later told the Widgery tribunal. The fact that the tribunal heard only a very small amount of the evidence which was available is also a cause of serious concern.</P>
    <P>That the Irish people as a whole continue to feel strongly about the events of Bloody Sunday is evident in the strong media and other interest in the anniversary.  The people of Derry showed their feelings in the biggest ever anniversary march last Sunday.  However, perhaps even more significant is the support which has emerged for a fresh look at the events of Bloody Sunday from Unionist and British sources.  The cross-party support for a new inquiry at Westminister demonstrated in an early-day motion tabled for the anniversary and the comments of Mr. Ken Maginnis, MP, and others from the Unionist tradition offer welcome support for the efforts to achieve full justice to the memory of those who died and bring some solace to their relatives after all these years.  As the <i>Belfast News Letter</i> put it in an editorial on 3 February 1996: &ldquo;An apology is long overdue and there would be no better time for it. Perhaps then the ghosts of Bloody Sunday will finally be allowed to rest in peace&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In 1974 the British Government made payments on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis to the relatives of those who died on Bloody Sunday.  In 1992 the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, MP, expanded on an earlier British Government statement by stating that those who were killed on Bloody Sunday should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot while handling firearms or explosives.  This went some small way towards redressing the wrong done by the Widgery tribunal.  However, the British Government needs to go much further in confirming the complete innocence of the deceased.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the immediate reaction of the British Government to the re-evaluation surrounding the anniversary has been to deny the need either for a fresh look at the events of <Col N="971" /> Bloody Sunday or for an apology to the relatives of the victims.  The British Prime Minister did indicate in the House of Commons on 30 January 1997 that new evidence would be examined but offered little encouragement, in response to Mr. John Hume's question, that his Government would take a proactive role in this regard.  I regret this because I believe that the British Government which finally acknowledges in an unreserved way the wrong done on Bloody Sunday will make a significant contribution to the cause of peace in Northern Ireland and reconciliation throughout these islands.</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and I have urged the British Government to take an initiative in this regard in recent days.  The Taoiseach spoke about the matter to the British Prime Minister in a telephone conversation.  I will be discussing the re-evaluation of the Bloody Sunday evidence with the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, when I meet him later today.  I will suggest to him that it is open to the British Government to address the concerns of the relatives by taking a fresh look at the evidence in a variety of ways.  A full new inquiry may not be essential to set aside the discredited findings of the Widgery tribunal.  It might suffice to appoint an eminent person to review the evidence and recommend action by the British Government but whatever is required to bring peace to the relatives and honour the memory of the dead of Bloody Sunday should be done without further delay.  I assure the Deputies that I will pursue this matter within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Foreign Policy makes clear that the Government will ensure that vigilance is exercised in preventing the export from Ireland of arms or dual-use goods which would give rise to proliferation concerns.  I am aware of the contents of the AFRI LINKS report and it will be recalled that this report has already been the subject of a debate on the Adjournment on 3 December 1996 (vol. 472, cols. 551-554).  In that debate the Minister for Tourism and Trade outlined the current criteria and procedures for the granting of licences for the export of military goods and he made clear that the EU common criteria on arms exports are important factors in the input of my Department to the decisions <Col N="972" /> made by the Department of Tourism and Trade. I refer the Deputy to the record of the House.</P>
      <P>As part of the licensing procedure, my Department is consulted by the Department of Tourism and Trade on each individual application for a licence to export military goods.  I am fully satisfied that this effective consultation procedure ensures complete adherence to Government policy on disarmament and non-proliferation in the operation of Ireland's export control system.</P>

      <P>I understand at present there are more than 90,000 refugees or asylum seekers from Bhutan registered in eight camps in south-east Nepal. Ireland has supported international efforts through the European Union and the United Nations to improve the situation in the camps and has also supplied some direct assistance.  The International Federation of the Red Cross has recently submitted an appeal to the Department of Foreign Affairs seeking funding for a support programme for Bhutanese refugees and this appeal will be sympathetically considered.</P>
      <P>Since 1993 seven rounds of negotiations between Bhutan and Nepal have taken place regarding these refugees and a mechanism has been agreed whereby a joint verification mission will identify certain categories of the refugees in the camps with a view to their eventual repatriation. However, I understand that negotiations are currently deadlocked.  Ireland is concerned that this situation may lead to further unrest among the refugees and thereby endanger the stability achieved through development assistance programmes in the area.</P>
      <P>I understand also that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has offered to act as a broker for negotiations between Nepal and Bhutan on this issue, but that neither side has taken up this offer.  The Government, along with our partners in the European Union, will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>

      <P>The political and security situation in Algeria has been of grave concern to the Government and to our partners in the European Union <Col N="973" /> since the outbreak of the cycle of violence in 1992.  It has already left more than 50,000 people dead.  Ireland condemns all acts of violence against a civilian population.</P>
      <P>The Union has repeatedly called on all sides to the conflict to cease all acts of violence in order to allow for peaceful dialogue and reconciliation. The European Union and Ireland have given their support to initiatives aimed at encouraging dialogue between those who reject terrorism and violence, while acknowledging that it is for the people of Algeria themselves to resolve the current conflict on the basis of reconciliation.</P>
      <P>The Union is actively encouraging all parties to assist in developing the democratic process in Algeria.  It is working with Algeria in the framework of the Barcelona Euro Mediterranean process in which Algeria is a participant.  This process commits all members to develop the rule of law and democracy in their political systems and respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. In the context of the Barcelona Process, the European Union recently decided to begin negotiations on an association agreement between the Union and Algeria.  Respect for human rights and democratic principles would form an essential part of any agreement with Algeria and help to stabilise the situation in that country.</P>

      <P>Over recent years, the European Union has progressively expanded the scope of provisions relating to respect for human rights in agreements with third countries.  This development compares with the situation previously where human rights were either not mentioned in such agreements, or only as a preamble.</P>

      <P>These agreements, which are regularly updated, now provide for suspension clauses where there are serious and persistent human rights violations and serious interruptions of the democratic process which would constitute material breaches of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Recently these clauses have become more elaborate and provide for a conciliation procedure that seeks to keep the agreement operational as long as possible before suspension and thus provide necessary leverage whereby it may be possible to persuade a Government to respect and protect human rights and to cease the violations in question.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs enjoys a close and constructive relationship with Irish non-governmental organisations, NGOs, involved in areas of Irish foreign policy such as human rights and overseas aid.  The role of NGOs in these areas was significant during the consultative process undertaken by my Department prior to the publication of the White Paper on Foreign Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This consultative role can also be seen through <Col N="975" /> the participation of NGOs in committees such as the Irish Aid Advisory Committee, the National Forum on Development Aid and in the planned Joint Standing Committee on Human Rights.  The Government has also funded the attendance of NGO representatives at major international meetings and conferences, including the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing and the World Food Summit in Rome last year. The involvement of NGOs in these formal contacts is considerably enhanced by the many informal meetings with Ministers and officials which take place on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Priority Question No. 1.  I would reiterate that the Government believes that the recommendations of the Independent Review of Parades and Marches are a serious attempt to create a viable mechanism for resolving the issue of contentious parades.  Though there may be reservations on points of detail, the Government supports the broad thrust of its recommendations, particularly in so far as they seek to encourage greater mutual understanding, local agreement and a fair hearing of the merits of individual parades through wide consultation.  In particular, the Government supports the core recommendation that an independent parades commission be established and that it determine, if necessary, the conditions which might be imposed on contentious parades and that this be backed up by the force of law.</P>
      <P>The Government conveyed its views on the parades issue to the independent review.  I assume that, having published its report, the task of the review has now been completed.  Should it be engaged in further work on this issue, the Government will make known its views as and when appropriate.</P>
      <P>In my statement on the publication of the North review I said that there are already ominous signs that the confrontational attitudes and the refusal of dialogue which caused the crisis last year are again coming to the fore.  The response to the review's recommendations from some of those most directly involved reinforces my concern in this regard.  Given the imminence of the marching season and the hardening of attitudes already evident, it is vital that the review's key recommendations, including a parades commission with a formal role in mediation and with the authority to determine whether and what conditions might apply to contentious parades, be implemented without delay.</P>
      <P>I have already made clear my hope that the British Government and the parties at Westminster will give the issue of parades the political priority it deserves, and I will be discussing this issue with the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, when I meet him later today.</P>

      <P>The Government's overriding objective in the field of arms exports is the promotion of restraint and responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and technologies for military use. During the recent Presidency, Ireland succeeded in securing internal agreement, within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Union, on initial elements of interpretation and some practical measures for application of the EU's common criteria on arms exports, known as the Luxembourg and Lisbon criteria. This was the first advance in this regard since the criteria themselves were adopted by the Luxembourg and Lisbon European Councils in 1991 and 1992 respectively.  In reply to a related priority question on 11 December, I made clear that this was a start only.  I can assure the House that Ireland will continue to pursue incremental advances in this difficult area wherever these are achievable.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the current policies of the major arms exporting member states, I have to say that there appears to be little, if any, prospect in the short-term of achieving a common interpretation of the arms export criteria at the high level of restraint which Ireland would favour. However, Ireland will continue to take every opportunity to advance its policy objectives in this important area.</P>

      <Quest>whether the Government recognises that the European Union-Israel Association Agreement is in direct conflict with the principle that human rights should be a central consideration in agreements between the EU and third countries due to the legalisation of torture in Israel under the Supreme Court ruling of 14 November 1996; and if the Government recognises that the agreement is itself internally inconsistent in so far as Article 2 provides that relation between parties, as well as the provisions of the agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy, whereas Article 76 allows that nothing in this agreement shall prevent a party from taking any measures which it considers essential to its own security in the event of serious disturbances affecting the maintenance of law and order which under Israeli law includes the use of various forms of torture.</Quest>

      <P>The European Union insists on the fundamental nature of human rights obligations in all of its new generation association agreements, including those within the framework of the Euro Mediterranean process, such as the EU-Israel <Col N="978" /> Agreement.  Both the human rights clause and the other clause to which the Deputy refers, Article 76, are now standard in all of these agreements. However, the overwhelming importance of the human rights clause, and the extent to which it underlies all subsequent commitments, is shown by the fact that it is placed in Article 2, at the very beginning of the association agreement.</P>
      <P>Nothing in Article 76 in the agreement with Israel, or the comparable clauses in other agreements, releases the signatory state from its obligation to comply with the fundamental norms of international law.  Israel is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which stipulates that parties can in no circumstances derogate from a number of rights, such as freedom from torture.  Israel is also a signatory of the Geneva Conventions of 1949.</P>
      <P>It is our intention, and that of the EU as a whole, that these human rights clauses should be regularly monitored and strictly enforced.  The Government has expressed its concern at decisions taken by the Israeli Supreme Court in recent months that Israeli secret service investigators can use physical pressure in the questioning of Palestinian detainees.  We expect Israel to engage in discussions with the Union on human rights issues in the context of the Euromediterranean Partnership Agreement which was signed on 20 November 1995.  In these contacts, the Union will underline to the Israeli Government the importance of respect for human rights, both in Israel itself and in areas under Israeli occupation.</P>
      <P>It is clear that Israel enshrines respect for human rights in its legislation.  It has ratified a number of relevant UN instruments including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  We expect Israel to live up fully to its commitments in these international instruments and in the association agreement and to the standards, which it has freely set itself, of a normal democratic society.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 89 of Tuesday 28 January.  The Government continues to closely monitor the humanitarian situation of the remaining Rwandan refugees in Zaire.  International aid agencies, including UNICEF, World Food Programme, International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are providing emergency relief supplies to refugees in eastern Kivu.  The Government is committed to continuing to play its part in supporting these efforts.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy for the period 12 January 1990 &mdash; 3 February 1997 is set out in the following tabular statement. The majority of naval visits were at the request of the authorities of the visiting vessel for the purposes of routine or courtesy visits and for crew rest and recreation.  Those visits that arose as a result of invitations by the Irish authorities are indicated by an asterisk and footnote in the statement.</P>
      <P>Statistics requested by the Deputy in respect of the period January 1987 &mdash; December 1989 are contained in a reply by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of 3 July 1990 to a question by Deputy Tony Gregory.  The information is available in the Official Report Vol. 400, col. 1880, 1990.</P>
      <P>A list containing details of requests received so far for visits by foreign naval vessels to Ireland during the remaining part of 1997 is also set out in the following tabular statement.  At present there are no plans to officially invite foreign naval vessels to Ireland during 1997.</P>

      <P>The basic rate of pension has not been changed, but the frequency of payment has been changed from monthly to fortnightly.</P>
      <P>Civil Service pensions were paid monthly until September 1996.  From 1 October 1996, payment was changed to a fortnightly basis, with the first such payment being made on 17 October 1996. This was agreed following representations made by the Retired Civil and Public Servants Association. Notification of the changeover was included with all pensions issued on the 17 October, 1996.</P>
      <P>Payment is now made on alternate Thursdays, as is the case for similar salary payments throughout the Civil Service.  For precise calculation of the fortnightly pension the annual amount is divided by 26.09.  On this basis this person's current pension rate is correct.</P>
      <P>It is not feasible to have optional arrangements for individuals in relation to the frequency of payment of pensions.  The payroll system operates on a group basis and all pensioners in a particular group are tied to a common frequency of payment. There are seven groups within the system, covering 15,000 pensioners.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The information on waiting lists requested by the Deputy, as at 31 December 1996, the latest date for which figures are available, is contained in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 104 of Tuesday, 28 January 1997.</P>
      <P>I am happy to assure the Deputy that special measures to reduce waiting lists will continue in 1997.  The provision of special funding to reduce waiting times continues to be a priority for the Government and £4 million has been provided in the budget to continue progress in this area.  This provision will bring to £8 million the total funding available in 1997 to address the problem of long waiting times for elective surgery.  The funding provided in 1997 brings to £58 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiaitive commenced in 1993.  My Department will be holding detailed discussions with health agencies in the coming weeks on the allocation of this funding.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> It has been agreed in principle that the Children's Hospital, Temple Street will be relocated on the campus of the Mater Hospital.  It has also been accepted that future developments at the Mater Hospital would take into account the relocation of the Children's Hospital.</P>
      <P>It is too early to cost the relocation proposal other than to indicate that substantial capital funds would be required.  Because of the planning and financial implications involved for the two hospitals, it is not possible to say, at this time when the move will take place.</P>
      <P>Pending relocation to the Mater Hospital site, a programme of improvements is ongoing at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street.  In the interim, it is intended that the hospital will be provided with adequate facilities to enable it to perform its important functions in the delivery of paediatric hospital care.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have had inquiries made of the Midland Health Board on behalf of the person concerned and have been informed that the charges in question are being levied under the Health (Charges for In-Patients Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987.  These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for 30 days or for periods totalling 30 days within the previous 12 months.</P>
      <P>The over-riding consideration in applying longstay charges is that persons with means who are in receipt of long-term care should make a contribution towards the cost of their maintenance.  In deciding the amount to be contributed health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs.</P>
      <P>I understand from the health board that the charge being raised at present is a provisional charge based on the person's income with about 25 per cent being allowed for personal needs pending completion of a full financial assessment. The health board has stated that the expenditure incurred in making alterations to the home will be considered in carrying out this assessment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>There is no process whereby any particular body, statutory or voluntary, is recognised as being the sole advisers or representatives on behalf of any group of people with disabilities.  In the statutory area, bodies such as the health boards and the National Rehabilitation Board have ongoing contact with my Department on various matters affecting the interests of people with disabilities, including the deaf.  In the voluntary area, there are numerous voluntary bodies representing people with disabilities.  It is open to any of these bodies to make submissions to my Department on any matter affecting the interests of its members and Department officials regularly meet such bodies.</P>
      <P>Voluntary bodies representing and-or providing services for the deaf are:&mdash; The National Association for the Deaf, The Irish Deaf Society, St. Joseph's House for Adult Deaf and Deaf-Blind, St. Mary's School for Deaf Girls, St. Joseph's School for Deaf Boys, Mary Immaculate School for the Hearing Impaired, The National Chaplaincy for the Deaf, The Deaf-Blind Foundation and The Dublin Deaf Association.</P>
      <P>The provision of funding to voluntary organisations is a matter for the health boards which make grants in respect of services provided by the organisation in the functional area of the particular board.  I understand that the Irish Deaf Society is not receiving a grant from the Eastern Health Board.  If the society considers that there is a case to be made for such a grant it should discuss the matter with the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Health Research Board, which was established in 1986 under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, is the statutory agency charged with the commissioning and conduct of medical and health research in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The health care package which I agreed in December 1995 with the four groups representing those infected with hepatitis C through the receipt within the State of blood and blood products included a commitment to establish a special research programme on hepatitis C.  I have approved funding over £1 million to be made available to the Health Research Board over the next five years for such research.</P>
      <P>In March 1996, the Health Research Board invited proposals from interested research groups for project studies into some of the key areas relating to hepatitis C infection, particularly as it relates to persons infected through the use of anti-D.  In all, a total of eight projects were approved.  The most significant project concerns the establishment of a special hepatitis C research unit which will involve St. Vincent's Elm Park, St. James's Hospital/Trinity College, University College, Dublin and St. Patrick's College, Maynooth. The unit will undertake a range of collaborative research activities, using an inter-disciplinary team of research investigators, which, it is hoped, will lead to the development of improved approaches to the control of the hepatitis C infection.</P>
      <P>In addition to the new research unit, the Health Research Board has also approved projects which will be undertaken by research teams at University College, Cork, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Cork University Hospital, the Mater Hospital, a joint project between the BTSB and St. James's Hospital, and a joint project between the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Mater Hospital.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that these research studies will provide new insights into hepatitis C infection and lead to improvements in the care and treatment of patients.</P>
      <P>One of the functions of the Consultative Council on Hepatitis C, which I established in November 1996, will be to advise and make recommendations to me, as Minister for Health, on developments arising from such research into hepatitis C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> The undertaking of clinical trials in Ireland is governed by the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 and 1990.  The Irish Medicines Board is legally obliged to examine each application and to grant or withhold approval for such trials.  In order to facilitate applicants who are seeking approval to carry out clinical trials, guidelines have been drawn up by the Irish Medicines Board which outline the information required before clinical trial approval can be considered.  I understand that the person referred to in this question contacted the Irish Medicines Board last year and was given full details of the documentation which would be required for any application for approval to carry out clinical trials.  The board has had no further communication from the person concerned.  It is the board's understanding that the drug referred to in the question has no licence anywhere in the world, and that it is not currently approved for the understanding of clinical trails either by the FDA or by any European member state.</P>

In the case of the person concerned, the priority of her case is currently being re-examined.</P>
      <P>The special health care package for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion includes both secondary health care and primary health care services. Among the secondary care elements of the health care package is a provision for referral to a consultant for conditions related to hepatitis C. A patient who is referred by a liver consultant to another consultant for the purpose of testing, investigation or treatment of any known or suspected condition related to hepatitis C, or any condition which, while not related to hepatitis C, requires special treatment or care as a result of the person's infection with hepatitis C is given a priority first appointment within two weeks.  Follow up appointments are arranged on the basis of medical needs.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to the primary sector. Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need and subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  However, as Minister, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to <Col N="1008" /> determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the school in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to 8 November 1996.  An investigation of his circumstances indicated that he was working while in receipt of assistance and he signed off the live register on <Col N="1009" /> 11 November 1996.  He has not claimed unemployment assistance since then.  A revised decision was subsequently made to the effect that he was not unemployed during the period from 15 April 1996 to 5 November 1996 resulting in an overpayment of £4,251.44.</P>
      <P>An appeal against the decision was received in the social welfare appeals office from the person concerned on 8 January 1996.  In accordance with the statutory requirements, the comments of the deciding officer on the matters raised in the appeal have been sought and on receipt of the response, the case will be referred to an appeals officer for consideration.  If appropriate, the appeals office will arrange an early oral hearing of the case.</P>

    <P>The information the Deputy requested on an annual basis from the year 2000 is not readily available in that format.  However, it is estimated that during that ten year period approximately 30,000 self-employed people will reach the age of 66 and qualify for an old age contributory pension. The cost of 30,000 pensioners with ADA on an annual basis would be £180 million.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report, &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo;, recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that an actuarial review of the projected long-term costs of social welfare pensions be carried out every five years.  In this regard consultants have been engaged to carry out the first review and it is expected that it will be completed by mid-year.  An analysis of the situation pertaining specifically to the self-employed will be carried out in the context of this review.</P>

    <P>In replies to parliamentary questions on Tuesday last, I indicated that I have recently reinforced Government policy with the industrial development agencies on the regional distribution of employment opportunities.

    <P>A total of 1,317 companies were approved assistance by Forbairt during 1996.  These companies are expected to create 5,020 jobs over the period of their business plans.  Of these, a total of 131 companies were approved assistance in the south-west region, with potential job creation of 544.  Equivalent figures for the west Cork area were not available.</P>

      <P>All parts of the Abattoirs Act, 1988, have been implemented.  Three ministerial orders and three sets of regulations have been made under the Act as follows:</P>
      <P>Abattoirs Act, 1988 (Commencement) Order, 1989 (S.I. No. 150 of 1989)</P>
      <P>Abattoirs Act (Section 62 (2)) (Repeal of Bye-Laws) Order, 1989 (S.I. No. 151 of 1989)</P>

      <P>Abattoirs (Health Mark) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 90 of 1992).</P>
      <P>In addition, the European Communities (Knackery) Regulations, 1996 (S.I. No. 396 of 1996) are regarded as implementing Part III of the Abattoirs Act, 1988, which made provision for the control and licensing of knackeries.</P>
      <P>All local authorities apart from Longford and Roscommon county councils have appointed full time veterinary officers, part time veterinary inspectors or both.  I understand that Longford and Roscommon county councils are currently engaged in the recruitment of the necessary staff to undertake inspection work in abattoirs.  I am confident that all local authorities will be providing full meat inspection services shortly.</P>

      <P>The recently established inter-departmental working group which reports to the ministerial group on Sellafield will examine all available evidence, with a view to supporting effective action against the risks posed to the population of Ireland by the installations and operations at Sellafield.  The implications of the report relating to Cap La Hague will form part of the work of this group.</P>
      <P>I would, however, draw the Deputy's attention to the recently published report by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland entitled &ldquo;Radioactivity Monitoring of the Irish Marine Environment 1993 to 1995&rdquo;.  The report states that the levels of radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea do not justify misgivings on health grounds about swimming or engaging in any other activity in or near the sea along the east coast of Ireland.  Such findings, however, do not in any way affect the Irish Government's continued opposition to any radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea caused by Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government is being active and purposeful in dealing with all Sellafield matters.  I would refer the Deputy to my response in the House on the Adjournment yesterday concerning UK Nirex, in the course of which I indicated that I had sought a meeting with the British Ambassador concerning the UK nuclear industry.</P>

      <P>Four bodies are recognised as representing members of the Defence Forces &mdash; the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association for members of the Permanent Defence Force; the Irish Nurses' Organisation for Army Nursing Service personnel and the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association which represents members of the FCA and Slua Muirí. In addition to these bodies there are a number of associations and organisations which represent retired personnel such as the Association of <Col N="1018" /> Retired Commissioned Officers, the Defence Forces Pensioners' Association and the Organistion of National Ex-Servicemen and Women.</P>
      <P>As regards subventions, £54,000 per annum is paid to PDFORRA in respect of postage, telephone and accommodation costs.  Accommodation in the Department's offices in Park House is provided to RACO and the association has access to the Department's internal postage and telecommunication facilities, RDFRA receives £30,000 per annum by way of subvention and office accommodation has been provided for the association in Clancy Barracks, Dublin.</P>
      <P>Meetings with the associations take place on many levels, both formal and informal.  Approximately 70 meetings with the four Defence Forces representative bodies took place in each of the years 1995 and 1996, the majority of which were with RACO and PDFORRA.  I had 11 meetings with representatives of RACO, PDFORRA and RDFRA between my appointment as Minister for Defence and the end of 1996.  I addressed the annual delegate conferences of both RACO and PDFORRA in 1995, the annual delegate conference of PDFORRA in 1996 and a RACO special delegate conference in January of this year.  I have also attended a number of functions where I met representatives of the association informally.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, pension benefits were granted on an exceptional basis in the period February 1986 to December 1987 to five widows whose husbands did not exercise an option to join the revised contributory pension scheme for the spouses and children of deceased enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force.  Medical evidence was provided to indicate that each of the <Col N="1020" /> five personnel concerned was incapable of managing his own affairs during the option period in 1985.  Any similar cases which are brought to my Department's attention will be considered on their merits in the light of the medical evidence provided.</P>
