      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach report to the House on the progress made in dealing with the increasing traffic problem in Dublin and the implementation of the freeflow operation between now and Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is not relevant now.  However, there can be a wide-ranging discussion during the debate on the Estimates.  I am sure the Deputy will find an opportunity of raising the matter during that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and will not prolong the issue as long as one's journeys to the House have been prolonged by traffic.  Will the Taoiseach report on this matter to the House at an appropriate time given the necessity for him to take a hand in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm the reports in today's newspapers to the effect that the Government has accepted the Bill dealing with the tribunals' inquiries proposed by me on behalf of the Labour Party?  When will the legislation be taken in the House?  Will he also confirm that on enactment it will apply to the two inquiries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me two weeks ago to look at his Bill and, apart from minor amendments, the Government has accepted it in full.  It was cleared by Cabinet yesterday and if it can be taken before Christmas it will be useful.  My intention is that it will apply to the tribunals.  Mr. Justice Moriarty has made it clear that he will begin public hearings early in the new year.  The Bill will close the clear loopholes which exist so that if the State wishes to recover costs it will be within its ambit to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach.  Will he confirm that it is the Government's intention to have <Col N="803" /> the Bill passed by this and the other House before Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my intention, with the co-operation of the Whips.  The Bill deals with an anomaly and it should not be subject to too much debate.  I am not sure of the date Mr. Justice Moriarty intends to begin public hearings but it would be safer to have the Bill passed by both Houses before the Christmas recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste give an undertaking to meet Waterford Deputies this morning to discuss developments in the Avonmore-Waterford Group?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not appropriate to the Order of Business, but it may be raised in the debate today on employment policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been requesting a meeting with the Tánaiste since last week and she has not even come back to me on the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Tánaiste to sit down and discuss the matter with us.  She is being hoodwinked by Avonmore-Waterford Group management.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he is prepared to take on board the Bill presented by Deputy Quinn in respect of the tribunal of inquiry, which is an important matter, but is it of relative insignificance by comparison with the exclusion from inquiry of the Ansbacher accounts?  When legislation is brought forward, will that matter be dealt with also?  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government will vote against the Bill originally introduced by Deputy Kitt and reintroduced by Deputy Broughan?  If so, it will be the only case in the history of the <Col N="804" /> House where a Bill committed suicide in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked a question which is in order on the Order of Business.  Both matters relate to promised legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Will the Taoiseach say at what stage is the Refugee Bill?  What is the problem with amendments?  Even if there is a problem with the courts, has the Government sought an early hearing in respect of existing difficulties?  I do not believe there are difficulties.  The Bill should go ahead.  Does the Taoiseach appreciate the urgency of it, particularly in light of the highly racist comments in today's newspapers attributed to Deputy Callely, which are an incitement to hatred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That question is not in order on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: People are queuing up outside the Department seeking basic human rights.  Will the Taoiseach confirm the Bill will be amended in its final stage before Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That Bill is already enacted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a High Court case pending, which I would like to see dealt with, but I cannot decide those cases.  As soon as that case is dispensed with, the various sections of the Bill may be enacted, but until then they are frozen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the extraordinary chaos and incompetence revealed yesterday by the Minister for Justice, for which he accepts no responsibility, when is it proposed to introduce the court services Bill which I presume would ensure that one part of the Government would communicate with the other and that gardaí and District Justices would be informed of their obligations under legislation enacted in the House? The Minister for Justice refuses to do anything about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the order for Second Stage of that Bill is being made and it has to go to the Seanad.</P>

    <Col N="805" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it was impossible to get clear replies to questions posed here yesterday afternoon, will the Taoiseach provide for the taking of necessary amendments during the passage of the Bill to ensure District Justices are informed of their powers under the legislation in a manner in which everybody is aware of their rights and responsibilities, including the Minister for Justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the school attendance Bill be published?  This Bill, promised some time ago, is all the more urgent now because of the findings of the Clondalkin survey.  If the Taoiseach cannot promise its publication in the near future, will he introduce interim measures, which could be subsequently underpinned by legislation, to deal with school attendance in areas where the gardaí are inappropriately trying to enforce it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will be published early next year, but this is a more complex issue.  It is not merely a matter of dealing with school attendance. The Minister for Education has expressed his views on a number of aspects in the excellent report published by the Clondalkin partnership group.  It is a question of publishing a Bill and dealing with the other aspects that have been highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>When will legislation be published as a result of the Cabinet decision yesterday to overhaul of the Garda force.  Unfortunately, we have to read about such plans in the newspapers.  The House was not informed of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach publish the plans and indicate to the House the legislation that will flow from the decision to overhaul the Garda force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legislation promised in that area.  The Deputy will recall that on Question Time two weeks ago I was asked to publish the comprehensive SMI report on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda force. That will be published today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, in light of the dreadful truancy figures for north Clondalkin, will the Taoiseach confirm that before we left office a school attendance Bill to update the 1926 legislation was ready?  What is holding up this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, the Taoiseach mentioned that the delay in the school attendance Bill was dependent on other matters. Does he intend to introduce measures alongside that Bill to deal with the poverty, unemployment, alcohol and drug addiction and marital breakdown that is seen to be the root cause of the problem? <Col N="807" /> Is that what is causing the delay and, if not, will he bring the Bill forward quickly?</P>
      <P>Because the Ombudsman has called for a human rights commission and because of the meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, will the Government bring forward that commission?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: On promised legislation, there seems to be some confusion on the Refugee Act.  The Taoiseach is talking about the implementation of that Act but is he aware that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is on record as promising a new Bill to amend that Act?  On 2 October he said as much to Amnesty International and he told the public press the following day but he does not seem to have told the Taoiseach. What is the state of play?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a useful opportunity to review the 1998 pre-budget Estimates which were published on 12 November. I especially welcome it because it provides the Government with the opportunity to set the record straight.  Since the publication of the Estimates, there has been criticism of the Government's public expenditure policies, as reflected in the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criticism centres on the charge that the Government has massaged the figures.  The charge is that unusual spending adjustments have been made this year to ensure the increase in 1998 is within the limit set in the Government's programme. The implication is that without these adjustments, the Estimates would be significantly over that limit.  I reject this criticism.  It is important that the Dáil and the public are given <Col N="812" /> a clear account of the position.  I will set out clearly the Government's approach to public expenditure and how it is reflected in the 1998 Estimates.</P>
    <P>The commitment we gave to limit expenditure growth was made after much thought.  It is taken seriously by the Government.  Controlling public expenditure is a crucial element in our budgetary policies.  We know only too well from past experience that if public expenditure is not handled properly, budgetary policy can go seriously wrong.  If the growth of public spending is not controlled, taxation must be raised or Exchequer borrowing and the Government deficit will increase.</P>
    <P>This Government is determined this will not happen.  The prudent budgetary policies which have done so much for the success of the economy will be maintained.  The commitments the Government made on spending will be met.</P>
    <P>I will explain the 1997 expenditure position and then deal with the Government's 1998 spending plans.  I will also comment on how the growth of current and capital spending in the 1998 Estimates and Public Capital Programme compares with the limits to expenditure growth set out in the Government's programme.  However, before doing so, I will review the general economic position since it provides the context within which budgetary and expenditure policy must be seen.</P>
    <P>Ireland is currently enjoying unprecedented economic progress.  Growth in 1997 is expected to be around 7 per cent, the fourth successive year of strong growth.  Increased prosperity has been accompanied by stable prices and a level of employment growth which is the envy of many larger countries.</P>
    <P>The most significant result of our recent success is to be found in the labour market.  It is estimated that employment will increase by about 52,000 in 1997, or by close to 4 per cent, with this rise being broadly based across non-agricultural sectors.  The increase in employment is being facilitated by a significant increase in the labour force.  Projections indicate that the labour force will increase by 37,000, or 2.4 per cent in 1997.</P>
    <P>The increase in employment is having an impact on unemployment.  The 1997 Labour Force Survey shows there has been a fall of 20,000 in unemployment in the 12 months to April 1997.  It is expected that the standardised unemployment rate will fall from 11.5 per cent in 1996 to about 10.25 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging that long-term unemployment is falling faster than short-term unemployment. On a labour force survey basis, the number of long-term unemployed fell by 17,000 in the year to April 1997.  Since 1993, there has been a drop of 39,000 in the number of long-term unemployed people.  This means that just under two-thirds of the fall in unemployment since 1993 has been due to a fall in long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Consumption and investment grew strongly in 1997, reflecting the favourable economic climate. Supported by excellent labour market conditions, <Col N="813" /> higher disposable incomes and relatively lower interest rates, personal consumption grew by around 6 per cent during 1997.  Retail sales remain buoyant, while car sales have reached record levels.</P>
    <P>Strong domestic demand, a recovery in external demand, low interest rates and low inflation have resulted in strong investment growth in 1997.  This is particularly encouraging because increased investment expands the capacity of the economy and its ability to sustain strong non-inflationary growth.  Despite strong growth and demand, the balance of payments has remained in comfortable surplus in recent years.  This is expected to continue in 1997, primarily due to strong merchandise export growth and net inward transfers.</P>
    <P>Prices rose by just 1.4 per cent on average during the first ten months of the year.  The strength of the pound during the second half of last year, greater competition in retailing, and the subdued international inflationary environment are some of the reasons for the moderate inflation so far this year.  My Department is forecasting an inflation rate of 1.5 per cent for the full year.  This strong economic performance has led to a further surge in revenue receipts.  Revenue growth has comfortably exceeded budget-day targets.  As a result, the Exchequer's overall position is better than expected.  I do not wish to discuss the 1998 budgetary position today.  On budget day I will outline the economic and budgetary prospects for next year and up to the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The economic achievements I have summarised are largely due to prudent budgetary policy and the consensus between the Government and the other social partners.  National programmes have underpinned our competitiveness.  In turn, sound fiscal policies have allowed the Government to reduce taxation and to increase spending on key social programmes.  It is essential that budgetary policy remains on track, that the consensus remains strong and that a significant investment is made to support Ireland's future development.  If the Government's expenditure plans do not strike the right balance between the requirements of budgetary policy and the need to meet social and economic priorities, it will be all the more difficult to sustain the progress of recent years.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Government' expenditure policy.  Although I will go into the issue fully later on, I stress now that the 1998 Estimates reflect a rate of growth in current spending, pre-budget, which is significantly below the Government programme limit.  Our programme commitment is to limit the growth in net current expenditure to 4 per cent.  In deciding the Estimates allocations, the Government was determined that this limit will be respected.  The 1998 Estimates show net current expenditure, as defined in our programme, rising by 1.8 per cent in 1998 over the likely 1997 outturn.  Budget day spending measures will increase expenditure, but I am confident that the post-budget figure will remain <Col N="814" /> below the 4 per cent limit.  I am also determined that the 1998 expenditure outturn will still show net current spending growth below the 4 per cent limit.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme also set a limit of 5 per cent to the growth in capital spending on average up to 1999.  The figure reflected in Exchequer-funded capital for 1998 is 17.5 per cent.  One of the main reasons for this high figure is the provision of £100 million in 1998 for the education technology investment fund, which has been announced by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Education and Science. There are justifiable increases in other capital spending programmes which I will outline later.</P>
    <P>I now want to review the 1997 and 1998 spending position.  Deputies will understand that my remarks on both 1997 and 1998 are based on the figures published in the Abridged Estimates Volume on 12 November and do not take account of any budget day spending changes.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Estimates will not change, apart from measures announced on budget day.  The 1997 figures shown in the 1998 Estimates Volume published on 12 November are provisional assessments of this year's spending outturn for each Vote and its subheads.  This is an innovation.  In previous years, Estimates Volumes published before the end of the year generally repeated the year's original Estimate, adjusted where Supplementary Estimates had been approved by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As the 1998 budget will be announced on 3 December it is appropriate that the Dáil and the public are given in the Abridged Estimates Volume the best possible information about the emerging 1997 position.  The outturn figures given in the volume include spending which will require Supplementary Estimates for which the Government will be seeking Dáil approval before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The decision to introduce the budget before the end of the previous year taken by the last Administration is a move the Government has fully endorsed.  The change in the budget timetable brings Ireland into line with our partners in Europe and will help to make our budgetary procedures and expenditure control more effective. Departments and agencies will know earlier what their allocations are for the coming year and will be able to plan in advance and monitor expenditure to ensure it stays within those allocations.</P>
    <P>Total net current spending of £10,148 million was provided for in this year's Revised Estimates published by the previous Government.  This was an increase of 6.5 per cent on the 1996 outturn. It is estimated that net current expenditure in 1997 will be £10,385 million, £237 million higher than the budget figure and 9 per cent higher than 1996.</P>
    <P>This year the Government has had to meet a number of significant costs on some important economic and social programmes.  The main reasons for the increase over the budget day figure <Col N="815" /> are as follows: the pay bill is £126 million higher than originally expected.  The main reasons for the increase are Garda and prison officer overtime which will cost an extra £31 million and an increase of £27 million in the cost of local bargaining settlements in the case of paramedics, prison officers and clerical grades in the Civil Service. The Exchequer pay and pensions bill for 1997 will be 10.5 per cent greater than the previous year.  I will mention later another significant pay issue.</P>
    <P>Additional spending of £59 million will arise this year on health, £42 million of which is in respect of hepatitis C compensation while a further £17 million relates to extra costs mainly on the various drugs refund schemes.  Extra spending of £33 million will arise on agriculture, of which £25 million relates to the green pound devaluation.  Some £22 million more than budgeted may be needed for Defence, mainly for Army hearing loss awards.</P>
    <P>These and other additional costs have been offset to some extent by savings elsewhere and by extra revenue accruing to Departments, the main element of which is buoyant PRSI revenue.  This contributed to a reduction of £120 million in the Exchequer subvention required this year for the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>The 1997 expenditure totals include payments which were expected to be made in 1998 but which the Government has decided should be made this year.  As this year's outturn for the key budget aggregates, particularly that for the general government deficit, will be substantially less than foreseen in the budget and as the spending commitments involved will have to be met, it is wise to make provision now reducing the burden facing the Exchequer in later years.</P>
    <P>A sum of £103 million will be paid this year in the education area to meet liabilities which had been expected originally to arise in 1998.  Secondary teachers are paid on the fifth day of the following month.  With effect from this December, they will be paid on the last working day of every month.  This is a permanent change, not a once-off adjustment.  It is justifiable.  There is no reason teachers should wait five days to be paid and accordingly, £35 million will be issued in 1997 to allow payment of salaries on this new basis.</P>
    <P>Up to now recoupment by the Exchequer of higher education grants paid by local authorities has been made in arrears in the following year.  It is proposed to change the system so that recoupment will be made within the relevant financial year.  In 1997 £68 million will be spent for the purpose. This is a permanent change which it is right to make.  Local authorities act as agents of central Government in this matter.  The move will rectify a long-standing cash-flow problem for the local authorities and will put them in funds to meet their current liabilities.</P>
    <P>The 1997 budget estimate for capital expenditure was £1,576 million.  The outturn is expected to be £1,618 million, some £42 million higher.  The <Col N="816" /> main reasons for the increase are: £23 million more education capital was allocated to allow further improvement of facilities in the primary and third level sectors; £22 million more was allocated in the area of health towards the programme of improving and expanding hospital facilities, while in agriculture the on-farm investment programme cost the Exchequer an additional £15 million.  Net savings in other areas reduce the total addition to £42 million.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the 1998 current supply service expenditure Estimates.  The Abridged Estimates Volume shows that total net current supply services spending will increase from £10,385 million this year to £10,811 million in 1998, an increase of £426 million.  Of this increase £298 million or 70 per cent is to cover additional Exchequer pay and pensions costs next year.  The balance, £128 million, is for additional non-pay costs.</P>
    <P>In 1998 the Exchequer pay and pensions bill will amount to £5,607 million, an increase of £298 million or 5.5 per cent over the projected outturn for 1997.  This includes the provision of £146 million for general round increases under the terms of the Partnership 2000 pay agreement and a further £128 million to cover the remaining PCW local bargaining cases.  The forecast outturn for 1997 is £5,309 million, an increase of 10.5 per cent over the 1996 figure.  Of this increase 7 per cent is due to increases in pay rates, both general round increases and local bargaining increases.</P>
    <P>These figures demonstrate in stark terms the pressing need to contain the growth of the public service pay costs.  They show also that, despite the acknowledged need for pay moderation, successive Governments have failed to translate this into an acceptable level of growth in the public service pay and pensions bill.</P>
    <P>Much of the public service pay cost of the PCW is being concentrated in 1997 because of the deliberate back-loading of the general pay increases under the PCW and the slow pace of local bargaining negotiations throughout the public service.  A significant part of the increase in the pay bill is attributable to the level of local bargaining increases secured earlier this year by a number of major groups, particularly in the health sector.  The nurses' settlement, for example, is adding £49 million over and above what had been provided for originally in 1997 and this, in itself, is adding 1 per cent to the bill.</P>
    <P>Although the PCW expired in the public service on 30 June 1997, a number of local bargaining cases remain to be resolved.  I would like to see all these being finalised as early as possible in 1998 but they will have to be resolved within the limit of the PCW cost norm as originally established.  I stress this point because there seems to be an impression in some quarters that there is now open season on that limit.  This is not the case.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the threatened industrial action by craft workers in the local authority and health services in support of their claim for <Col N="817" /> an increase of £27 a week, which would work out at an increase of approximately 10 per cent. People should be aware that when direct discussions on the craft unions' claim failed to reach agreement it was the craft unions which refused to abide by normal industrial relations procedures and decided instead to ballot their members on industrial action.  Threats of industrial action in pursuance of claims under the local bargaining provisions of either the PCW or Partnership 2000 fly in the face of the industrial peace clauses of those agreements and the agreed procedures for dealing with disputes.  They are contrary to the spirit of social partnership which has been at the heart of the consensus approach of the national programmes.  There is no basis for any group to resort to industrial action in pursuit of its claim.</P>
    <P>The Partnership 2000 pay agreement, which came into operation in the public service on 1 July 1997 and is to continue to 30 September 2000, provides for general round increases totalling 7.25 per cent plus a locally-negotiated increase of 2 per cent.  In the public service, this 2 per cent increase is not payable before 1 July 1999, payment being conditional on the achievement of verified progress to a satisfactory level on implementation of the public service modernisation programme in each sector of the public service.  This is the only provision in Partnership 2000 for locally-negotiated pay increases, clause 6 of which debars the submission and processing of claims other than those permitted under its terms.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the terms of Partnership 2000, including the explicit limit on the cost of local bargaining increases, be adhered to within the public service if we are to continue to manage our economy in a balanced and responsible way to the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>In the Abridged Estimates the Government allocated an additional £128 million for the improvement of the non-pay element of expenditure programmes in 1998.  This will be spent as follows.  An additional £122 million is being provided for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to meet the carry-over costs of the 1997 budget measures and for demographic factors such as increases in the number of recipients on certain schemes; budget day social welfare changes will add to the £122 million; an extra £98 million is being provided for the Department of Health and Children, £58 million of which is required for hepatitis C compensation payments; in the Defence Estimate, non-pay spending is being increased by £50 million, necessitated mainly as a prudent provision for the possible cost of hearing loss compensation; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is being allocated an extra £31 million in 1998, mainly to support improvements in the standard of training being offered on FÁS schemes in addition to some increase in the number of trainee places and, finally, the Justice Vote is being increased by £13 million mainly for the continuation <Col N="818" /> of the development of the courts service.</P>
    <P>The significant increase in capital expenditure next year reflects the Government's determination to provide the social and economic infrastructure essential to underpin Ireland's continued development.  In 1997 capital expenditure is forecast to be £1,618 million.  In 1998, with the Government providing £1,926 million, there will be an increase of £308 million.  This additional sum is being allocated to a number of key development programmes: the Department of the Environment and Local Government will be spending an additional £123 million; expenditure on national and non-national roads will increase by £57 million, in addition to a provision of £20 million, the first step in an eight-year redevelopment programme of Ballymun; the capital allocations for the Department of Education and Science will include £100 million for the Education Investment Technology Fund while capital spending within the Health and Children Vote will increase by £18 million to further improve our hospitals and a major investment in the information technology facilities of health agencies; more funds are being allocated to information technology in other programmes throughout the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, with the continued implementation of the anti-crime package, an additional £20 million will be spent on the prisons building programme in 1998.</P>
    <P>These are important economic and social programmes. I am sure all Members will accept that fast economic growth requires investment in infrastructure and that some of the resources generated by growth should be allocated to the improvement of social facilities.</P>
    <P>The Education Technology Fund is a particularly important case, the Government having decided that the need to meet the merging skill shortages in our economy and give a boost to research and development activity necessitated its establishment.  Without skilled workers and access to the latest available technology, it would be very difficult to sustain economic growth.  It was becoming evident that bottlenecks were arising which could choke off growth unless we acted quickly and on a scale that matched the seriousness of the emerging problem.</P>
    <P>I want to explain fully how the 1997 outturn figures and the 1998 expenditure plans fit into the Government's capital and current spending targets. The Government is committed to limiting the growth in net current expenditure to an average annual 4 per cent over its lifetime.  The base to which the 4 per cent net current spending limit applies &mdash; as was made clear in our election manifesto and repeated in the programme for Government &mdash; is spending on the Central Fund, comprised mainly of debt-servicing in addition to expenditure on net current supply services.  This is an appropriate measure since the difference between spending defined in this way and current <Col N="819" /> revenue equals the current budget surplus or deficit.</P>
    <P>Central Fund expenditure is not included in the Abridged Estimates nor in the Summary Public Capital Programme Expenditure since Dáil approval thereof is not required each year.  Therefore, we have to add the figures in the Estimates volume to those for the Central Fund.  I must emphasise that the figures for the Central Fund for 1997 and 1998 are provisional.  On the basis of the 1998 Estimates volume and the provisional figures for the Central Fund, total current spending will rise by 1.8 per cent over the likely 1997 outturn.  While budget day spending will add somewhat to that 1.8 per cent figure, I can assure the House that post-budget spending will remain below the 4 per cent limit.  It is my clear intention that the 1998 outturn will also be within the 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>In commenting on the end-September Exchequer returns, I announced that the Government had discharged certain matured liabilities. Similar payments were made in previous years. These payments were made from the Central Fund in relation to An Post and Telecom Éireann pension funds and the Small Savings Reserve Fund, £150 million having been paid to the pension funds and £100 million to the Small Savings Reserve Fund.  The allocation to the Small Savings Reserve Fund will be increased by a further £158 million before the end of the year, as I made clear on the publication of the Estimates.  The provision being made under this heading this year covers the total unpaid interest accruing on small savings schemes this year.  From 1999 onwards the Exchequer will follow a change in European Union accounting rules which provides for full accrual of interest under these schemes.</P>
    <P>Much of the criticism directed against the Government is based on those adjustments.  The charge appears to be that the Government deliberately made these payments to increase this year's base in order to reduce the 1998 percentage increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That criticism is completely misplaced.  I make no apology for the decision to effect these payments in 1997.  I do not think anyone would argue that the Government should ignore large debts such as that for the Small Savings Reserve Fund or An Post and Telecom Éireann pension funds until they have to be met. The Government considered it prudent to avail itself of the opportunity created by the exceptionally strong Exchequer position this year to meet inescapable liabilities.  The pension funds' liability is inescapable and the Small Savings Reserve Fund exists to deal with an equally unavoidable liability.  There is nothing secret about these payments. In commenting on the end-September Exchequer returns and on presentation of the <Col N="820" /> 1998 Abridged Estimates, I spelled out the position in full.</P>

      <P>If these Central Fund payments were not effected and if the changes in the payment arrangements for teachers' salaries and the recoupment of higher education grants were delayed, the expenditure position would be different and total net current expenditure would rise by 6.3 per cent in 1997 over last year and by 5.2 per cent in 1998.</P>
      <P>The base to which the Government's capital spending limit applies is Exchequer-funded capital, which includes expenditure on what are known as &ldquo;non-programme outlays&rdquo;.  These comprise mainly capital expenditure on the financial restructuring of the semi-State bodies.  Capital spending this year is increasing by 10 per cent over that in 1996.  In 1998 capital spending will rise by 17 per cent and, as I mentioned earlier, the 1998 figure includes £100 million for the Educational Technology Investment Fund.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the figures in the Abridged Estimates, the total increase in current and capital spending in 1998 over 1997 is 3.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>There are a number of different aspects to public expenditure policy.  While the general policy stance has to be right, it is also important that efficient administrative arrangements for monitoring and controlling spending be put in place.</P>
      <P>As part of the implementation of the strategic management initiative, in the 1996 budget my predecessor announced the introduction of a multi-annual budgetary planning process, designed to assist Governments in settling their annual budget by taking account of the medium-term budgetary effects of policy changes.  I shall continue to implement and develop that new system. The main aim of this new approach is to allow Government to examine its budgetary policy within a general framework, thus allowing consideration of the effect of decisions on the allocation of resources between taxation and expenditure over the medium term.  This will have a major impact on the manner in which public expenditure is managed at all levels.</P>
      <P>In parallel with the other changes being introduced under SMI, designed to afford greater devolution of responsibility, the new system aims to encourage Departments to improve the financial management of their spending programmes, to focus on the results achieved and move resources from areas of lower to those of higher priority.  In particular, Departments will be encouraged to put in place management systems designed to ensure maximum value for money.</P>
      <P>A system of expenditure reviews will also reinforce this approach.  Earlier this year the Taoiseach announced the first programme of spending reviews.  The Government is determined to develop the multi-annual approach further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy is expanding.  We are in the fourth year of strong growth.  Ireland's success has <Col N="821" /> been built on the prudent budgetary policies adopted in the past decade and on the consensus between the Government and the social partners. The Government's expenditure policy as shown in the 1998 Abridged Estimates Volume maintains that sound approach.  I assure Deputies the same policy will be firmly implemented throughout the Government's term of office and will secure Ireland's continued economic progress in the years to come.</P>

      <P>The management of the economy touches every aspect of society.  It impacts on industrial policy and on our ability to create and sustain jobs.  The way we manage the economy determines how much we can invest in education and provide for essentials like health care.  This is a serious business which deserves serious and considered debate, especially in this House, and because it is a serious business it is also complex. It is unfortunate, therefore, that public debate is often reduced to discussing who benefited from which tax cuts, which Department achieved a better spending deal or the services which did not secure sufficient funding.</P>
      <P>The Government has two principal annual events when it sets out the key elements of its economic management.  The publication of the Estimates, which we are debating today, and the Budget Statement which the Minister will deliver next week.  The rainbow Government recognised the need for serious and informed debate on the management of the economy.  The last Government made the decision that the Budget Statement would be presented before the end of the previous year, and I am glad the Minister has reaffirmed his commitment to this strategy.  The rainbow Government also introduced the publication of three year multi-annual budgets showing the impact of policies on the economy and announced, on the publication of the Estimates, the proposed budget spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now debating this Minister's first crucial economic document, the Estimates, and already he has withdrawn one of the initiatives of the rainbow Government, inhibited debate in the House and inhibited our task as parliamentarians to make the Government accountable for the taxpayers' money it spends.  We are debating the 1998 spending programme and we do not know the post-budget position.  All the Minister had to say on that issue last week was to the effect that just because he had not announced it did not mean it has not been agreed.  That is unfair to the House and to those of us who have to contribute to this debate, because we are not looking at the full picture.  I do not know whether we are now debating 80 per cent, 90 per cent or 95 per cent <Col N="822" /> of the Estimates but I know we are not debating the complete Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>We know that social welfare increases are announced on budget day and we can speculate on the extent of those increases, but we know from statements by line Ministers that there will be increased expenditure also in Agriculture, Health and possibly in a variety of other Departments. We do not have the full picture and that is not good enough.  The Minister is deliberately preventing us from doing our job, We are unable to discuss the full Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The serious business we are discussing concerns the spending of £16 billion of taxpayers' money and taxpayers and parliamentarians have the right to know the full picture when debating the Estimates for next year.  We cannot have a serious debate when the figures the Minister has presented are effectively an illusion and a betrayal.  The Minister has perpetrated an illusion in the publication of the Book of Estimates.  He explained again today the reason he put money into the An Post and Telecom pension funds and why the small savings reserve fund was boosted. He made a case for bringing forward the pay day for certain teachers' salaries.  He made a case for compensating the local authorities for higher education grants this year in a manner which has not been done before.</P>
    <P>In the illusion the Minister has presented, he claims that expenditure, before the budget day increases, will increase by only 1.8 per cent but he said in his previous statement that if we compare like with like, this is really an increase of 5.2 per cent.  The Minister should not come into the House on the day we are debating the Estimates and repeat the illusion.  The public has a right to know by how much, comparing like with like, expenditure will increase next year.  On the Minister's own figure, current expenditure will increase by 5.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The betrayal by the Minister is greater than the illusion.  He has betrayed those who voted for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on an understanding that he would control public expenditure, and he has betrayed a general electorate who believed his programmes would be prudent and that spending would be curtailed.  He has betrayed himself also because for two and a half years, the only economic comment he issued from this side of the House was that in Government he would control public expenditure.  That was the only arrow in his quiver and now, at his first opportunity and before we have the budget day increases, he is increasing current expenditure by 5.2 per cent and capital expenditure by 17.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also betrayed the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  He was a very good Minister but because of the illusion this Minister has perpetrated on the Book of Estimates the historic record will show that current expenditure in the last year Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance increased by 9.2 per cent.  It did not happen that way.  On the Minister's own <Col N="823" /> admission it was his con trick that has made the historic record appear the way it does.  The actual increase was 6.2 per cent and the Minister's pre-budget position is 5.2 per cent.  On the basis of commitments already made by other Departments and the commitments he will have to make on budget day to social welfare increases, the Minister's post-budget position for 1998 in terms of current expenditure will exceed the end of year position of the rainbow Government for 1997. The increase will be much higher in percentage terms than the outturn for 1997.  It is extremely unfair to one of the best Ministers for Finance we have had for the Minister to make prudent economic management appear as if the previous Minister was profligate with public expenditure by fiddling the record to give the impression that public expenditure in 1997 increased by 9.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>More than anything else the Minister has betrayed the people because he failed totally in his economic statement today to demonstrate any medium-term planning or awareness in the construction of the plans for spending the £16 billion of taxpayers' money.  It was a short-term, confined statement outlining the usual brick by brick approach where every programme receives an additional amount of money.  There is no indication of any personal economic management or a political input which will result in a different approach being taken to that taken in the past.</P>
    <P>It is worth examining the Government's promise in the programme for Government.  In the programme, the Minister and his colleagues are committed to &ldquo;limit net current spending growth to 4 %, which is broadly equivalent to the 2 % growth in real terms agreed in Partnership 2000, and capital spending growth to 5 % on average up to 1999, ...&rdquo;. On the Minister's own admission, the 4 per cent is already 5.2 per cent even before he starts spending on budget day.  The 5 per cent on capital spending is now 17.5 per cent; I presume the Minister does not intend to announce further increases on budget day.</P>
    <P>Net current spending is not defined in the commitment in the programme for Government, but we all know what 2 per cent real growth in Partnership 2000 means and we get a better picture of what the Minister is up to if we examine the amounts of money rather the percentages.  The Department of Finance estimates that current spending in 1997 will be £13,310 million.  This includes the £101 million of expenditure the Minister confirmed is being brought forward to 1998. It also includes £100 million for rate support grants to local authorities which did not arise in the year to which they are ascribed.  The real base for assessing the Partnership 2000 programme is an outturn of just over £13 billion.  A 2 per cent increase on that amount, having allowed for 2 per cent inflation which the Minister informed me by way of written question is the inflater which underpins the Book of Estimates, results in a spending increase of £520 million post-budget for <Col N="824" /> 1998.  When the illusion is removed the Minister is committed in the programme for Government, on which he was elected, to increase spending by not more than £520 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement accompanying the Estimates outlined various percentage increases, but the position is more revealing when account is taken of the numbers.  The reality is that current spending has increased on a pre-budget basis by £903 million to £13,912 million. The Minister has exceeded his current expenditure target by almost £400 million before a penny has been provided for social welfare increases on budget day.  The Estimates he presented are an illusion.  Notwithstanding, that he has already overshot his target by 74 per cent, he has further fudged the position.  In his rush to confuse people with an array of percentages he maintains he can spend a further 2.2 per cent to bring that figure up to 4 per cent, or another £305 million on budget day, and still remain on target.  How can we have a sensible and serious debate when the Estimates he presented are such a hall of mirrors and were deliberately drawn up to confuse people so that the House cannot make him and his colleagues accountable unless we plough through the figures?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that current spending can increase by £1.2 billion for 1998, at the same time he is being prudent and approximating to the 2 per cent increase agreed in Partnership 2000.  He gave a commitment to increase spending by not more than £520 million, but he has already given a commitment to increase spending by £903 million and said he will spend another £305 million on budget day.  The Minister talked about a post-budget position of plus £1.2 billion in hard cash when his commitment was to increase expenditure by not more than £520 million.  He should explain to the people what he is doing.  I have set out what he is doing and what he plans to do on budget day.  We may allow some latitude in this House for political promises, but an increase in expenditure of £1.2 billion does not approximate to £529 million in anyone's language.  This is a betrayal of the highest order and of everything for which the Minister stood and to which he was committed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a number of Estimates. As an agricultural debate is scheduled for tomorrow, I will not go into the difficulties faced by the agricultural sector.  My colleague, Deputy Coveney will deal with that.  Last year the rainbow Government provided £10 million to support a programme to tackle the demand for drugs. Deputy Rabbitte chaired a committee which organised and focused that programme in communities and made sure there would be a real response to the drugs problems in the most affected areas of our cities, particularly in Dublin. Despite the massive increase in spending and the £1.2 billion by which the Minister intends to increase spending, he was unable to increase the allocation to that programme for 1998.  However, that is in line with the Government's priorities. <Col N="825" /> We saw the cavalier attitude of the Minister for Justice to the release of certain prisoners by the courts.  We saw him posing among the potted plants explaining how great the Government's anti-drugs programme would be.  Despite all the excesses in expenditure not an extra penny has been allocated to that programme, one of the most effective programmes introduced in this House, principally by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the IT initiative for schools, but the allocation for equipment in third level colleges has been reduced in the Book of Estimates. How can we address the skills shortage without equipping third level colleges?  I do not understand the way the Government makes decisions. It seems the Minister takes up a principled position and is then forced to change it by line Departments.  Elements of expenditure are lobbed in like stones into a pool and they do not seem to relate to the rest of the spending programme. In this case it seems the Minister was hijacked by the Minister for Education who was supported by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. There is a programme for information technology in the schools and propaganda states it will address the skills shortage, but the allocation is being cut to the institutions at the cutting edge of supplying skilled people, the universities and third level colleges from which IT experts came in the past.  That does not make sense.  However, that approach is similar to the Minister's approach to the management of the economy to date.  It seems the Minister has stood back from events, allowed himself to be persuaded by the decisions of others.  He seems to accept those decisions and does not equate them with an overall policy or pattern.</P>
    <P>We debated the appalling difficulties evident in Iarnród Éireann's track network.  I understand that matter that will be raised in the House shortly as one of my colleagues has tabled a Private Members' motion on it.  However, there is no provision for improvement to that area for 1998 because the grant-in-aid will be increased by only 2 per cent.  In circumstances where the capital budget is increased by 17.5 per cent it should strike somebody that investment is needed on a permanent basis in our railway network.  The allocation to it of only 2 per cent hardly allows for inflation.</P>
    <P>There is general welcome for the Minister's abandonment of his target of 5 per cent growth in capital and for the 17.5 per cent increase.  The £100 million investment in the IT initiative accounts for approximately one third of that increase, but he provided an extra £195 million for normal ongoing capital expenditure.  That is important, but we should assess it as a preparation for the certain reduction in Structural Funds in a year's time.  Where is the impetus to maintain the level of infrastructural development which will be necessary after the current round of Structural Funds expire?  It is not to be found in the increased provision of only £22 million for water and sewerage schemes or the increase of <Col N="826" /> £1.4 million for Dublin transportation.  An amount has been allocated for the Luas project. Economic growth could be choked by the emerging traffic problem.  We see the difficulties facing the Asian tiger economies.  The first signal of things going wrong in South East Asia was when cities like Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Taipei became choked by traffic and it took two hours to travel in a car the distance one could walk in ten minutes.  They became less attractive bases for foreign investment.  Given the traffic problems in Dublin I cannot understand how the Government has allocated a figure of only £1.4 million for Dublin transportation.  With the exception of the Luas project which has been deferred, that is the allocation for all the improvements necessary to alleviate traffic in Dublin.  I cite those examples as representative of the Government's lack of planning, prioritisation and economic management.</P>
    <P>The Estimates campaign was fought on the traditional package.  There were winners and losers, but effectively it does not provide for renewal programmes.  The existing programmes will be maintained and a brick by brick approach has been adopted.  Existing programmes are deemed to be worthy and they will be allocated small or large increases depending on the strength of the cases made by Ministers.  With the exception of the IT initiative, no attempt has been made to move money in a strategic way to address the priorities which are changing all the time.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give us some information on how he intends to spend the Central Bank's reserves which will no longer be needed after 1 January 1999 when we join EMU?  I understand approximately £1 billion will become available. Will that be used to reduce the national debt, for the capital programme or to replace the Structural Funds which will be reduced at that point? The fact that those reserves are in the Central Bank does not mean they should not be accounted for in this House.  The capital budget is being increased, Structural Funds are being decreased and that tranche of money will be available when the current level of the Central Bank's reserves will no longer be required when the European Central Bank takes over management of the euro currency.  It is important, therefore, that the Minister should outline his intentions regarding that fund in his reply to this debate or on budget day.  We also need to know how the Government intends to find the resources to allow the continued vital improvement of infrastructure.  Are we to conclude from the Book of Estimates that work will be scaled down in 1999 and that this is a once off increase?</P>
    <P>Every Deputy on this and the Government side wants extra spending in various areas.  That is the norm in politics.  However, the Minister is uniquely charged under the Constitution with the management of public finances and the economy. He is the guardian of prudence.  When he was in Opposition, the Minister committed himself to <Col N="827" /> being a prudent guardian but he has abjectly failed to go anywhere near meeting his targets. More importantly, he has failed to set out a programme of his priorities in terms of how the thrust forward can be maintained and the bottlenecks which threaten our progress can be relieved.</P>
    <P>There are no references to this aspect in the Minister's speech or in any of his statements.  He is the quietest Minister for Finance to occupy the office.  I searched for statements made by him since he was appointed but it would be as easy to find geraniums in the desert.  He has issued approximately three statements since he became Minister for Finance.  I do not understand why he is not laying out a programme and indicating his priorities.  Does he feel the Government is insecure and it is pointless planning for the medium term?  It is most disturbing.</P>
    <P>There cannot be a Government deficit of more than 3 per cent of GDP, even in bad times, once Ireland joins EMU.  Consequently there must be a surplus in good times.  In Ireland's case that surplus must allow us to continue investing in our physical infrastructure, training young people, improving the health services, etc.  However, the 3 per cent deficit is intended to be used only in times of economic difficulty.  In normal times the Government is expected to balance the budget and in good times, such as the current position, it should budget for a surplus.</P>
    <P>The Minister should address the concept of the 3 per cent deficit and outline his views.  There is a misconception among the public about how it operates.  I understand the 3 per cent deficit would not be the norm.  It is not the parameter within which the Minister operates or the definition of the ball park in which he plays.  It is a mechanism for times when the economy gets into difficulty.  In normal times, once Ireland is a member of EMU and the euro is in circulation, the books must be balanced.  In good times, such as these, the Government is expected to budget for a surplus.  In effect, the 3 per cent is a loaded fiscal gun which will be fired only if the economy suffers a serious shock.  If the Government over-spends and there is a small swing down in the economy, it will find itself running deficits up against the 3 per cent limit.</P>
    <P>If there is a shock in the economy, as happened previously, there will be no bullet in the fiscal gun if the Government is up against the 3 per cent limit.  The Minister must lay out his strategy for the future and state if he will run surpluses or deficits overall or concentrate on the current budget surplus.  The Minister is expected on budget day to do much more than he has done to date.  He will be expected to outline his targets and give a vision of how he thinks the country will develop in the future.</P>
    <P>Once currency management and the level of interest rates is transferred to a European central bank, the running of the deficit on occasions up to 3 per cent will be in effect the only instrument <Col N="828" /> of fiscal management the Minister has in his control. It is most important that he sets out his position at the earliest possible date on this matter. He will not have a bullet in his fiscal gun if he continues to increase public expenditure by £1.2 billion when his commitment was to increase it by £500 million.  I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Deenihan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for sharing his time.  He was making a good contribution and I am sorry to stop him.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance should consider himself lucky.  He took over a buoyant economy and a position where, irrespective of who is in power, the Government must be influenced by the Maastricht guidelines and Partnership 2000.  There is almost all-party consensus on the national budgetary strategy.  The Minister is in office at a very good time.  As a sporting man it is similar to taking over management of the All Blacks rugby team, the Manchester United football team or even the Kerry football team.  The economic framework was established for him by the previous Government over three years but he will be on trial after the budget.  Up to now he has run on the record of the rainbow coalition and the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  He should accept that they did an exceptional job in controlling public expenditure while at the same time ensuring buoyancy in the economy.</P>
      <P>The ESRI medium term review sets out a positive outlook for the economy towards 2010 and beyond.  There is now a unique opportunity to develop the economy into a highly competitive and robust engine of growth which will support higher standards of living and employment. However, the opportunity presented is unlikely to be permanent and it demands a strategic outlook towards the development of the economy. Deputy Noonan dealt with this aspect in detail and I agree with him that the Minister should outline his strategy for the next three years.</P>
      <P>The use of budgets merely to adjust and shift the edges of economic policy is no longer sufficient. They must fulfil a strategic function.  The move towards multi-annual budgets announced in the January 1997 budget is a first step towards a more radical strategic approach and away from short-term considerations.  Moreover, the establishment of a competitiveness council acknowledges the fact that competitiveness is at the centre of our capacity to produce and sell on domestic and world markets.  Our ability to compete will in turn determine living standards and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and other economic bodies must be under no illusion regarding the position in which we will find ourselves if, as expected, the UK remains outside EMU for some time.  Tax and public spending strategies in addition to other elements of competitiveness must be appropriate to this new scenario.  Soft options via currency accommodations will not be open to us at that time.  It is most important for the Minister in <Col N="829" /> planning his budgetary strategy to consider what will happen in the next two to three years.  Two imminent changes in the country's macro-economic environment must be addressed &mdash; the advent of EMU and the expected reduction in EU support in the form of Structural Funds and funding under CAP.  Ireland's only hope of prospering in EMU is to achieve and maintain a more sharply competitive economy.  If that is not the case, we will fail to maximise the potential of the markets open to us.</P>
    <P>The gradual reduction in EU Structural Funds support will require the public finances to be sufficiently robust to accommodate the loss.  For example, net transfers from the EU in 1997 are expected to amount to approximately 3.8 per cent of GDP, equivalent to £1.7 billion or almost 10 per cent of total Government expenditure.  These changes in the macro-economic environment require the firm control of current expenditure as the single most vital element of the strategy to develop a competitive economy.</P>
    <P>I refer briefly to the national debt which has amounted to over £30 billion since 1994 while in 1996 it was over eight times that in 1976.  Debt repayments in 1997 are estimated to be £2.5 billion, the equivalent of one sixth of tax revenue.  A reduction in debt service costs would have had, as IBEC described, a ratchet effect permitting greater tax reform, higher capital expenditure and stronger growth.  Growth would ensure revenue buoyancy to facilitate additional debt reduction.  It is time the absolute level of the national debt should begin to be reduced.  The first step to achieve this is an EBR surplus and I hope the Minister will adopt such a policy in his budget.</P>
    <P>Free fees in higher education have been extended to all, but higher education grants are inadequate, especially for low income families. People cannot attend college because grants are not sufficient and this issue will have to be seriously considered.  I am delighted there is a commitment of £1 million in the Office of Public Works Estimate to improving access for disabled people, including those with physical and sensory disabilities.  That is a welcome start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for my first opportunity to contribute to the Estimates debate as Labour Party spokesperson on finance.  I will take an opportunity later to make comments of a general nature, although they are related to the subject matter of the debate, namely Government expenditure and Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us have had the experience from time to time of accounting for moneys we have spent, of presenting accounts.  One sets out the various items of expenditure, adds them up, produces a total and makes whatever comparisons one wishes with last year or next.  The business of Government is more complex but the principles are still the same.  The Minister for Finance is unique as he presides over unprecedented economic <Col N="830" /> growth where the economy has grown by almost 40 per cent since 1992.  My party is proud to have contributed in some small measure to the economic policy which underpinned that success. Over 200,000 new jobs were created in that period, almost one quarter of them in the 12 months to last April, and inflation has virtually ceased, at least for the moment.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, introduced a budget in January 1997 which projected a current budget surplus for the first time in several decades.  As a result the Exchequer is awash with money.  Tax buoyancy is running at a rate which is little short of astonishing and consumer spending is rising at a rate which would have been considered alarming not too long ago.  The Minister could certainly bring in a budget surplus should he choose and he may do so despite himself.</P>
    <P>However, he has a problem with public spending which he told us time and time again when he was in Opposition and has repeated since he took up office.  He wants to bring in a large budget surplus and may even end up borrowing to fund an unnecessary deficit.  This arises from targets the Minister set inspired by a senseless ideological approach.  Last year's budget debate was interesting.  The Minister, then Opposition spokesperson for finance, berated the Government for selling out the future.  The claim was arrant nonsense at the time and still is.  He believed what he said and sought to do something about it.  The result was three spending commitments in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, each of which translated into the Government's programme for the new millennium.</P>
    <P>The first and most important commitment was that Government spending will fall as a percentage of national output.  The second was that spending on current supply services will not grow by more than a gross 4 per cent year on year during the Government's term of office and the third was that spending on capital items will not increase year on year by more than 5 per cent. These commitments are daft, irresponsible, artificial and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister is entitled to be judged by his criteria.  The suggestion in his statement a few weeks ago that the year on year increase in net supply services will be just 1.8 per cent next year is outrageous and offensive as he has deliberately doctored the figures to suit his ends.  The previous Government set up a fund in December 1995 to compensate hepatitis C victims and set aside £60 million for it.  At the time Fianna Fáil berated the Government in language and tones that were little short of hysterical, yet the Minister has brought forward almost £500 million in expenditure.  If the Progressive Democrats Party stands for anything, it is for control in cutting public expenditure.  Is the Tánaiste willing to stand over this extraordinarily fancy footwork executed by the Minister?  How can he expect us to take his Estimates seriously if he goes to such strenuous efforts to fix the figures in a way which <Col N="831" /> is intended to give entirely the wrong impression? If the Minister does not take himself or his targets seriously how can he ask the House to do so?</P>
    <P>He has been hoist with his own petard.  He dreamt up these targets, set them out with the Taoiseach and asked the electorate to vote for his party.  He also asked the public and the Dáil to judge him on these targets.  His reputation will stand or fall on his capacity or willingness to meet them and on that basis he has already failed.  He has not even attempted to meet the 5 per cent target on capital spending, but that is good.  If the smoothing carried out in October and just recently to the current target is eliminated, he is perilously close to his 7.4 per cent limit.  Even if he makes minimal changes on budget day, he will exceed it by a considerable amount.  In fairness to him, he selected a target which he had some chance of meeting but he deliberately included central fund spending, no doubt in the reasonable anticipation that debt service costs would fall.  He also correctly calculated that the Exchequer subsidy to the social insurance fund could be reduced in light of continuing buoyancy in PRSI receipts. He had a great deal going for him, but nonetheless failed at the first hurdle.  He will not meet the 4 per cent target or even come close by any objective standards.</P>
    <P>The gross spending figure is probably a fairer reflection of current Government spending and it already shows an increase of 4.5 per cent over the 1997 outturn, even if the smoothing which was carried out is taken into account.  If it is discounted the gross figure pre-budget will be in excess of 6 per cent and it will be higher still following it.  The Minister's credibility and that of his self-imposed targets is at nought within five months of taking up office.  However, this is not bad because the targets do not make sense and, despite improvements in recent years, many public services are underdeveloped and underfunded.</P>
    <P>I refer to the educational sector where not too many years ago one could send a teacher into a classroom with 40 or 50 students and reasonably expect that those students would emerge with a decent education at the end of the process.  This happily is no longer the case.  We are now obliged to provide laboratories for children who want to study languages and science.  Even subjects like history and geography which were based on book learning now require back-ups and equipment of a kind which we did not consider necessary ten or 15 years ago.  In addition, the need for access to information technology at every level of education is now universally acknowledged.  Add to this the fact that our pupil-teacher ratio is one of the highest in Europe, and we have a very significant demand for additional money.</P>
    <P>The position is similar in regard to health. Technology and skills are improving all the time. Life expectancy is increasing year on year. People's expectations are rightly increasing &mdash; the Minister knows this better than most.  The demand for specialised facilities in areas such as <Col N="832" /> mental handicap has never been greater.  At the end of the 1990s people are not prepared to accept conditions and treatment which would have been regarded as acceptable only 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>This is all to the good.  It is to be welcomed and not feared.  There is nothing wrong with a spending target in itself.  However, spending targets have to be real, and they have to be justified. The Minister has simply plucked a figure out of the air.  It relates to nothing in particular, and it does not make sense.  Surely to goodness we should relate any spending target to our capacity to pay.  What household would attempt to budget its spending without having regard to its income. What company would decide on its spending without first having regard to the money it took in.  This is exactly what the Minister wants to do. Tax revenues this year will rise by perhaps more than 10 per cent, and our capacity to pay for improved services will rise in proportion to that but, for his own reasons, the Minister has chosen to peg spending at a figure somewhat between 4 and 6 per cent over last year's outturn.  He is looking to go a good deal further.  He is committed to reducing spending as a percentage of national output.  I have yet to hear any sensible debate on this issue.  I have yet to hear the Minister set out a cogent reason we should do this. Ireland's public spending as a percentage of national income is less than the OECD and EU averages.  Our public services are worse and less developed than the EU and OECD averages and there is a cogent case, in some instances, for spending more.  In a sense this is a classic bind.  In times of economic difficulty, we are told we cannot afford to spend money on improved services. In times of economic boom, such as we are currently experiencing, the Minister would have us believe we should set aside money for a rainy day. Either way public services suffer, and those who depend on them suffer.</P>
    <P>The Minister's commitment, his target to reduce spending as a percentage of national output is, at best, out of date, at worst, irresponsible. It is a throwback to the Thatcherism of the 1980s. It is a philosophy that has already failed.  It is a philosophy which, directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally, slowly but surely, creates a two-tier society, a society divided between those who send their children to private schools and those who use public schools, a society divided between those who use private medicine and those who use public hospitals, a society divided between those who depend on the Department of Social Welfare for their old age pensions and those who provide for their own. All of these divisions are unnecessary and artificial, but they are the inevitable medium to long-term result of the policy on which the Minister is embarking.  The ESRI put it succinctly in its report of a few weeks ago.  We can use the fruits of economic growth to give those of us who have good jobs better cars, or we can use them to increase social solidarity, to build a society in <Col N="833" /> which all of us will be better off, safer and mutually dependent.</P>
    <P>We all know what the people want.  We want to preserve our traditional sense of community. We want to believe that if the child next door has an accident or needs an operation, he or she will get what is needed, irrespective of whether his or her parents are working or the income they may be earning.  Most Irish people really do care that all our people are given a decent chance.  I genuinely believe that most Irish people believe in equality of opportunity, and that &ldquo;mé féinism&rdquo; has not yet reached the corrosive and dangerous levels which it appears to have attained in other countries not very far away.</P>
    <P>As a society we have a choice to make over the next five or ten years, a choice which we were denied for most of the 70 years since the establishment of this State.  We can choose to invest in ourselves as a society, or to disproportionately benefit those who are already well off.  Whether he intends to do so or otherwise, it is clear this Minister is headed in a particular direction.  This party will be one of the first to loudly and clearly say &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>None of this is to say that public spending is always good.  Nor does it mean the State is uniquely gifted in spending people's money. There is undoubtedly waste in the public services. There is undoubtedly waste within the Civil Service. Management and budgeting techniques in the Civil Service are archaic and in need of urgent reform.  We need to get away from a position where budgets are increased incrementally in accordance with inflation without any serious evaluation of that budget in the first place.  There is understandable pressure on local Civil Service managers to, as it is put, maintain their budget. This in turn leads to pressure to spend money in a given year so that an increase can be justified in following years.  It is time for a serious evaluation. It is time to look in a fundamental way at what Government does.  Obviously we need to ask ourselves if we are getting value for money, but we also need to go further.  In many cases we need to ask ourselves whether we should do a particular programme, or deliver a service in the way in which is being currently delivered.</P>
    <P>Many of us on the left have something of a problem with the issue of public spending.  We have given the impression for too long to too many people that we believe public spending is good in itself.  We have given the impression, intentionally or otherwise, that taxpayers' money can or should be used to get ourselves out of just about any problem, or to provide just about any service.  That view is facile and inadequate.  Public spending is not always good.  Private spending is not always bad.  Too often in the past public spending has been a waste of money.  I will argue long and hard for more public spending where I believe it is needed, but each and every project must be seriously evaluated both before and after the money is committed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> In his budget speech earlier this year Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Finance, announced &ldquo;a rolling programme of expenditure reviews under which the objectives and the rationale for the continuation of all major departmental spending programmes would be subjected to systematic evaluation over a period of three years or so&rdquo;. The Minister announced this process would begin earlier this year in 1997.  In the second report to Government of the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries, entitled A Programme of Change for the Irish Civil Service, the Secretaries set out a detailed framework for change in the way the public services are delivered and the way in which the Civil Service operates.  In particular, the report argues for customer orientation and a focus on results.  It argues for consultation with and participation by customers on a structured basis, the provision of quality information and advice to customers, reasonable choice for customers and a complaints and redress mechanism. All of this is important, and all of it impacts directly and indirectly on the quality of service provided to the people.  This approach will or should apply to all public bodies, not just to the Civil Service.  Public statutory bodies, such as local authorities and health boards, are in regular contact with huge numbers of people, and it is vital that these services are delivered in a customer friendly way.</P>
    <P>All of these proposals are part of the SMI initiative.  This initiative was driven with some force by the last Government.  Perhaps I do the Minister and his colleagues an injustice, but I see no sense of urgency in the Taoiseach or the Minister in relation to pushing the process on.  This will take time, consultation and commitment.  We need to see some evidence from the Minister and the Taoiseach that they are fully behind this very important project.</P>
    <P>An equally important part of SMI are the proposals for greater accountability.  It is not enough that services and the delivery of services should be evaluated in-house or by consultants.  Governments and individual service managers must be held to account in public.  This whole estimates process is perhaps a good case in point.  We borrowed the process from the British.  It is now utterly inadequate and out of date.  Civil Servants acting on behalf of Ministers sit down in private for weeks if not longer as part of what is laughably called the Estimates campaign.  No Minister or civil servant will ever be asked in public to justify a demand for more money.  The public will not know what is going on unless some Minister considers it judicious to organise a suitably discreet leak to the press.  Billions of pounds of taxpayers' money are spent or committed and the public is not told what is going on.  Eventually a deal will be done and the ultimate compromise will be disclosed to the public at a press conference, not in the Dáil, in terms which are barely capable of being understood by anyone other than those whose full-time job is to understand these matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> I will take an example from this year's Abridged Estimates.  Under Vote 33, Department of Health spending of £2.1 billion is accounted for under just two headings.  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, probably understands this but the rest of us do not.  A sum of £1.442 billion will be spent on &ldquo;grants to health boards in respect of net expenditure&rdquo;, while the remaining £707 million will be spent in respect of &ldquo;grants on behalf of health boards to certain other health boards&rdquo;. No other details are given.  No ordinary member of the public could possibly be expected to understand what this means.</P>
    <P>As part of this entire process, we then have perfunctory statements in the Dáil.  While this gives Ministers the opportunity to give the public some information about how its money is to be spent, it is only an information session.  It is not a debate and is certainly not an exercise in public accountability.  It cannot even be regarded as a half decent debate on budget strategy since the Government will not tell us until Friday the revenue it took in during the past year and what it expects to take in next year.  We are required to debate Government spending plans, with all the targets etc., that go with them, without any reference to its capacity to pay.</P>
    <P>In a few months departmental Estimates will be brought before committees where Ministers will answer detailed questions in so far as they are asked.  However, detailed questions are rarely asked, partly because the decisions have already been taken and much of the money spent.  We need not have such a system.  In most mainland European countries those who want more, or even less money, are required to argue the case before a committee.  They do this before the decision is made, not after.  This gives parliament a real say in how money is spent and gives the public real information before its money is spent. It also encourages more rigorous preparation and pre-evaluation by those who propose to spend the money.</P>
    <P>We have some experience of this sort of process. We have become adept at making the case for spending European Structural and Cohesion Funds.  We have completed a lengthy process of evaluation which should be brought before the committees of the House at the earliest opportunity. We need to look at the overall mid-term review carried out by the ESRI and the evaluation of each operational programme.</P>
    <P>Not too long ago what I am saying would have been regarded as naive and idealistic.  However, during the last years of the 1990s it is the minimum required.  The policy document &ldquo;Delivering Better Government&rdquo; produced by the Secretaries states:</P>
    <P>An open culture with a free flow of information between Government and citizen is essential if confidence is to be maintained in the institutions of State.  The electorate of the next century will be the most highly educated in history and, owing to advances in information <Col N="836" /> technology, will have access to and the use of a bewildering amount of information. For the institutions of State to remain relevant they must recognise this trend and be much more open about their activities.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that a radical change in the culture of the Civil Service is required to bring this about.  It will also require a change in political culture and a rapid infusion of political will.  I see little evidence of either from the Government but I hope I will be proven wrong.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the education investment fund.  There is a clear need to give people access to training, reskilling and upskilling to enable them to take advantage of the many hi-tech jobs being located here.  There is a particular need to take advantage of information technology and to ensure that students of all ages have access to it.  The previous Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, was much exercised by this issue.  While I have some concerns about how the fund will be operated, I congratulate the Minister on bringing it to fruition.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased funding for social and voluntary housing.  Despite the progress made over the past four years, we still have some way to go to make up for the drastic cutbacks in social housing introduced on the last occasion Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in power.  I also welcome the further increase in bilateral aid to developing countries.  While it is not as much as we would like, nonetheless it is an increase.</P>
    <P>Before the general election Fianna Fáil engaged in a commendable process of consultation with interest groups and put together an admirable set of policy documents.  It asked the electorate to vote for it and many of them did. Many of these policy documents found their way into the manifesto and An Action Programme for the New Millennium.  However, since the election the Government has shown a remarkable and almost unprecedented unwillingness to tear up its programme.  Ministers have engaged in a series of U-turns and seem to be blithely unconcerned about the effects of their actions on a public which is already very cynical about politicians and the political process.  Sadly, there is evidence in the Estimates that this process is continuing.</P>
    <P>I will give an example.  In Opposition the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, was very strong on rhetoric.  He made specific promises in relation to the Garda and prison places. However, there is no evidence in the Estimates that the number of prison places will be any higher than that promised by the former Minister, Deputy Owen, earlier this year.  The amount allocated for Garda pay is lower than it was last year, while there will be only a slight increase in the number of gardaí from 10,810 to 10,980.  The overall budget for the Garda is up by only 1 per cent.  There is little evidence in the Estimates of the massive drive against crime promised by the Minister for Justice in Opposition.  The Minister's actions do not match up to his rhetoric.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> The Government's health programme is full of commitments in regard to mental handicap, disability, waiting lists etc.  Yet, when the fluff is stripped away and we look at the 10 per cent increase in spending we see that the amount allocated for the improvement of services is only £30 million.  The Government is committed to the Partnership 2000 agreement which includes a commitment to spend £500 million on programmes designed to target the problem of social exclusion.  I see no indication in the Estimates that money will be spent on these programmes.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and his party had not created expectations in the run up to the general election neither they nor their partners would be in Government.  We will measure the Minister's performance next week against these expectations and the targets he has set for himself.  We will also measure his performance against the principles of equity and fairness and its effect on employment and people with fixed incomes, not least old age pensioners.  The Minister and the Government have a choice in terms of how money is spent and the sort of society we want to create.  The way they exercise that choice will be assessed well beyond the bounds of the House.  The Minister set a test for himself in the Estimates.  However, by his own targets, he has failed this test and fallen at the first hurdle.  It remains to be seen whether he can rise again.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the 1998 Estimates. Overall the funding being provided for the areas under my responsibility is being increased by more than 17 per cent.  These increases are in line with the Government's key commitments as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium. I will refer to a few specific areas in the time available to me.</P>
      <P>The arts plan was prepared by An Chomhairle Ealaíon &mdash; the Arts Council &mdash; in 1994 and launched in early 1995.  The plan was the first formal published statement of forward planning by the Arts Council, and with it the council had set itself, and the arts community, on a course of development-led strategic planning which would transform the contemporary arts in Ireland.  The launch of the plan engendered great hope in the arts community that, after many years of underfunding, we had reached a stage were the arts were to receive the level of funding they rightly deserved.  While great strides were made in this regard, the decision of the previous Government to extend the life of the plan from three to five years stifled the efforts of the Arts Council to deliver on the targets and measures set out in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> While in Opposition, I strenuously objected to extending the life of the plan and committed myself and the Fianna Fáil Party to implementing the funding targets set out in the plan at the first possible opportunity.  I made a commitment to this effect both in my party's election manifesto and in the programme for Government.  I was pleased, therefore, to secure the major increase of 25 per cent in the Arts Council allocation for 1998, bringing the council's funding level to £26 million as promised in the manifesto and the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>In providing this finding I have met in full the commitment in the programme for Government to provide a budget of £26 million in 1998 for An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  This increase of £5.166 million is a clear demonstration of the commitment of the Government to the development of the arts in Ireland.  The Arts Council is now in a position to complete its five year arts plan next year, a full year ahead of the timetable by which the previous Government had intended it would be implemented.  The Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, makes specific reference to the position of artists in all disciplines who choose artistic creation in and through Irish, to the need for support of artists with disabilities and for more regional emphasis for the arts.  I note An Chomhairle Ealaíon's commitments as stated in the arts plan and, in the context of its formal review of the achievements of the plan, look forward in particular to An Chomhairle's assessment of the position at the end of 1998 as compared with the position previously.</P>
    <P>The cultural development incentives scheme &mdash; CDIS &mdash; is a part of the Operation Programme for Tourism 1995-1999 and is the responsibility of my Department.  The CDIS is primarily designed to assist the four main categories of the visual and performing arts, art centres, theatres, galleries and museums.  The total amount of funding available under the scheme is £18.467 million.  This amount, together with matching finance from successful project promoters, will enable a total capital infrastructure of at least £24 million to be put in place in the period up to the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>Another area worthy of notice is the provision of a total of £37.378 million in 1998 for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht, together with an allocation of £10.83 million to Teilifís na Gaeilge. Included in the former figure is an allocation of £24.25 million, which is being provided for Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Some £21.1 million of the £24.25 million is capital to enable An t-Údarás to pay grants to industries locating or expanding in the Gaeltacht and to build and refurbish industrial buildings.  An t-Údarás has been achieving worthwhile results in recent years in the area of job creation and the substantial funding being provided for in 1998 will enable the organisation to press ahead with its programme of work.  An allocation of £2.96 million is provided for Bord na Gaeilge, an increase of 15 per cent on the 1997 figure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> There are increased allocations for Gaeltacht improvement schemes, Gaeltacht cultural and social schemes and Ciste na Gaeilge, from which the voluntary Irish language organisations and miscellaneous Irish language projects are funded. An allocation for Gaeltacht roads will be provided in the 1998 Estimates as part of the provision for improvement schemes in the Gaeltacht. Work will continue on the major marine works scheme on Tory Island.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to note there is an increase in the Estimates provision for Gaeltacht housing grants under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, from £1.3 million in 1997 to £1.5 million in 1998.  This extra provision is included due to the fact that grants are available once again for new exterior windows and doors etc. in Gaeltacht houses. Because of the great commitment and interest of the Minister of State we have been able to ensure those improvements have been made in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>For the first time, provision of £2.6 million is made available in the Estimates of this Department for the islands, both those within and without the Gaeltacht.  This money will be directed mainly at primary services, for example, infrastructure, ferry services and problems which are encountered on the islands.  This function was transferred to my Department this year from the Department of the Taoiseach.  While the peripheral location of islands makes it difficult for islanders to participate fully in the life of the nation, island communities have a very special heritage, and this unique cultural enrichment and inheritance should be protected and nourished to the benefit of the island communities in the first instance and of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is my intention and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, who has specific responsibility for off-shore islands to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the access requirements of populated off-shore islands and to draw up a five year plan to ensure every island has suitable ferry access.  The provision of adequate piers will also be a major part of this five year plan, as well as a detailed coastal erosion survey on each island so that a preventative programme can be drawn up and implemented on a phased basis.  The policy prepared by the Minister of State before the last general election also deals with basic services on islands such as education, transport to education, health services and cost of living, and it is our intention to implement this policy in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>There is a major increase of more than £15 million in the provision for national parks and wildlife.  This increase is primarily to cover the expected costs in 1998 of compensation to farmers-landowners whose lands are being designated as special areas of conservation.  Under this designation land will be required to be farmed in accordance with an approved agricultural environmental plan which will specify the conditions <Col N="840" /> necessary for the protection of the natural habitats and species in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Government has accepted in the context of Partnership 2000 that fair compensation will be paid for losses incurred as a result of compulsory restrictions designed to protect these areas.  The affected farmers will have two options: they can join the rural environment protection scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food or they can opt for direct compensation from my Department.  In the 1998 Estimates, £14 million non-capital and £5 million capital is earmarked for the special areas of conservation project.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Council's allocation of £4 million for 1998 represents a 34 per cent increase on its allocation of £2.992 million for 1997.  While the council believes the increase should be even higher, it can be assured I will continue to do all I can to support its tremendous efforts and work. I am aware of its value, concern for and commitment to our general heritage.  Likewise, the National Gallery will have a 7 per cent increase on its 1997 allocation of Exchequer funding to enable it to continue with its excellent work.  I express my satisfaction with securing a total of £174.6 million for the three Votes in my responsibility.</P>

    <P>For the first time, a special provision of £2.6 million has been made available in the Department's Estimate for the islands.  This must be put in context with expenditure, part of which was carried over from the previous Departments of the Taoiseach and Transport and Communications for the Aran Islands ferry.  When that expenditure is subtracted from the total, we are left with approximately £2 million.  In 1996 and 1997 expenditure amounted to £2 million, £1 million per annum, and there was a carry-over to 1997 of money not spent in 1996.  We have increased dramatically funding for the islands.</P>
    <P>It will not be difficult to spend this funding on infrastructural projects that have been neglected for many years.  In conjunction with a five year plan, it will enable us to deal with urgently needed infrastructure, piers and other basic services on the islands.  The requirement of islanders to live in a modern society like the rest of us is at last being recognised.  I am pleased this additional funding is being provided in the Estimate and congratulate the Minister on her strenuous efforts to ensure it was put in place.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil áthas orm go bhfuil deireadh curtha leis na ciollaithe ar fad a <Col N="842" /> cuireadh i bhfeidhm ar na scéimeanna Gaeltachta faoin Rialtas deiridh agus gur féidir linn tosú as an nua ag tógáil ar na scéimeanna seo seachas a bheith dá ngearradh siar de shíor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Yates.</P>
      <P>No Minister in the history of the State has inherited such propitious economic circumstances as those that form the background to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy's preparation of the Book of Estimates for 1998, nor has any Minister for Finance ever engaged in such a scale of manipulative accounting.  The Minister, who in Opposition criticised the spending targets of the rainbow Government, has deliberately contrived to add hugely to the spending outturn by dragging spending proper to 1998 into the 1997 outturn. From the Minister's point of view, this serves the dual purpose of grossly exaggerating spending for 1997, which no doubt in time will be attributed to the rainbow Government, and allowing him to engage in the make-believe of staying within his spending ceiling of 4 per cent for 1998.</P>
      <P>I am puzzled as to how this scale of manipulation conforms to the standard of accounting procedures required by the Department of Finance. The House deserves answers to that.  I am also somewhat puzzled as to why it is permissible in November to add more than £400 million to this year's outturn without interfering with Maastricht parameters, when the previous Government was advised that such risks could not and should not be taken.  I suppose we can enlist the help of our friend &ldquo;buoyancy&rdquo; which, irrespective of economic portents, is never anticipated by the Department of Finance.  Whatever the explanation, the Minister for Finance has an embarrassment of riches.  In Opposition days, he would have carefully guarded this crock of gold inherited from the rainbow Government and designated some of it to paying off the national debt and the remainder towards PD style tax cuts with which he, as an Opposition Deputy, was greatly enamoured.  There is none of that now.  Anyone the Minister, Deputy McCreevy &mdash; the Scrooge of Opposition &mdash; can find to invoice him in 1997 for bills that would more properly fall due in 1998 will get a cheque in the post before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this clears the way for a feast on budget day which is politically designed to stabilise this rickety Government.  It may or may not achieve that objective but as the minder of the nation's finances the Minister is fooling no one.  He has doctored the figures to make his profligacy appear to conform to his 4 per cent ceiling.  Public criticism has forced him to concede in his contribution that, comparing like with like, expenditure has already increased by 5.2 per cent.  If these central fund payments were not made and the changes to payment arrangements referred to earlier &mdash; for teachers' salaries and the recoupment of higher education grants &mdash; were delayed, the expenditure position would be different: total net current expenditure would rise by 6.3 per cent <Col N="843" /> in 1997 over last year and by 5.2 per cent in 1998. That is out of the Minister's mouth.  His manipulation has converted an estimated outturn of 6.3 per cent for 1997 to a current figure of 9.2 per cent.  In a couple of years' time, no one will recall that it was Deputy McCreevy as Minister rather than Deputy Quinn who brought home this spending result.  Incidentally, this is the closest we have come to the 10 per cent increase realised in 1992, the last time Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in Government.</P>
    <P>We do not know the level of budget day spending and, therefore, we do not know the total expenditure figure.  However, in the £1,200 million we do know about, there is grossly inadequate allocation to the areas of greatest need.  An underclass is struggling for existence in this tiger economy.  The biggest barrier to re-entry to the workforce is the absence of skills among the long-term unemployed.  The geographic areas where the long-term unemployed are clustered are the same ones suffering multiple deprivation and being ravaged by the drugs menace.  Only a significant allocation of resources to address this multiple deprivation will improve the life chances of thousands of our people but there is no evidence that this consideration has featured in the Minister's manipulation.  Deputy Noonan has already pointed to the absence of any increase in the £10 million drugs package, confined to certain urban areas, which I introduced last year.  Yet we are supposed to have consensus in this House that we will continue to have a serious recurring drugs problem unless the causes of multiple deprivation are addressed.  Will the Minister spell out his plans for the £20 million youth services development fund set up under the second ministerial report, for which I obtained the approval of this House?  The provision for the technology fund is welcome but the allocation to address the skills shortage is designed either for young people or for updating the skills of those already in the workforce.  It is not designed to address the low &mdash; or no &mdash; skills status of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The most serious casualty of the Minister's fiddling is the rainbow Government's plan to introduce a detailed, medium-term financial strategy for the next three years, which has gone out the window.  There is a formal statement of commitment to this objective but no MTFS is outlined. Among other things, it is not possible to address in a planned way an assault on poverty if the emphasis is on manipulating the figures for reasons of political expediency.  The Minister presented the decline in long-term unemployment as follows:</P>
    <P>This means that just over two-thirds of the fall in unemployment since 1993 has been due to a fall in long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>He also mentioned a decline of 39,000 in the numbers of long-term unemployed in that time. That is fair enough &mdash; one can do anything with <Col N="844" /> statistics &mdash; but it does not acknowledge the scale of the difficulty.  The problem for the long-term unemployed is the barriers for re-entry to the workforce.  The number of long-term unemployed is in the region of 150,000 people.  To present this two-thirds figure as if we were making serious inroads into that number is less than a fair presentation. That emerging and existing underclass is the real problem for our tiger economy.  It is a huge burden, not just in terms of the misery imposed on the people caught in these areas but also in terms of the health requirements, the Justice Vote, policing, coping with the drugs menace, etc.  This is multiple deprivation and we have reached a stage when many people feel we can ignore these areas because they do not contribute much to the election or non-election of any Government.  However, this is a real factor in the tiger economy and if we do not address it the rest of society will pay the price.  Despite the spending figures and the manipulation, there is no serious evidence in the Book of Estimates that this featured in the Government's considerations.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to comment on the Estimates until we see the budget day figures.  However, if the Book of Estimates is anything to go by, I cannot look forward with the same glee as Government backbenchers to the way Deputy McCreevy will spend the fruits of the careful management of the last Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan and other Opposition speakers dealt with the gross manipulation of the figures across the range of Departments.  I will focus on Vote 32, for the Department of Public Enterprise, and highlight my immediate concerns. Part C of that Vote relates to the railways. In the short lifetime of this Government there have been serious rail accidents, the most notable at Knockcroghery, County Roscommon.  It is now well established that unless continuous welded rail is used to replace the old-fashioned jointed track originally built in the mid-1800s, other accidents will happen.  Given that the railways are a vital part of regional policy and radial links are crucial to the economic and social life of many provincial towns, this matter cannot be delayed further.  A substantial sum, perhaps £85 million, is necessary to bring the railway tracks from Mullingar to Sligo, from Athlone to Ballina and Westport, and from Dublin to Rosslare up to the same standard as the radial routes in the rest of the country.  Automatic signalling and adequate rolling stock are vital.  I am disappointed that the mid-term review of the Structural Funds did not allow for the possibility of this being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be tabling a Private Members' motion on this issue as it will be too late to do something after an accident.  If the number of people travelling at weekend peak times had been on the train at the time of the Knockcroghery derailment, there would have been fatalities; they were avoided by the grace of God.  We do not need a serious accident to be told how critical the position <Col N="845" /> is, because many of these lines were last updated in the 1930s.</P>
    <P>The second issue is Sellafield.  There was a recent Private Members' motion on the subject and the matter was raised on the Order of Business.  The terms of a motion accepted by the Government specifically referred to the provision of legal costs for the case taken by the Louth residents' group.  I understand a memorandum went to Government this week which indicated that £350,000 will be made available for health, engineering and radiological research but not one penny will be forthcoming for legal costs.  If the Government were to make that available it would be in clear breach of the spirit and terms of the Dáil motion and would be a very serious abrogation of the Fianna Fáil promise to &ldquo;fully fund&rdquo; the Louth residents' case in the High Court and subsequent courts. The Minister of State has a vital responsibility to honour the Government's pledges.  Given that BNFL has now taken legal action to have the case struck out in the High Court, this matter is of the utmost urgency.</P>
    <P>In regard to CIE, I call on the Minister to ensure public service contracts are put in place as soon as possible.  That is the only way we will know the subsidy on each route of Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, whether it is from Lucan to the city centre, from Sligo to Mullingar by train, or from Galway to Dublin on the Bus Éireann service.  We need to know that to have a basis of transparency.  The subvention, which is in the region of £103 million or £105 million, must be transparently expended.  I want a commitment from the Minister on when those public service contracts in lieu of the money will be put in place.</P>
    <P>My constituency colleague, Deputy Browne, has probably received representations on another matter about which I am concerned, although it is more in the area of the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne.  In the south and south-west of my county there is a very real threat that many people who currently enjoy multi-channel television will be disconnected because of the exclusive monopoly licensing system for MMDS operators.  I am very unhappy with this because many people who are disconnected cannot get an MMDS service because of the topography of the land.  The beam benders cannot physically go around corners which means such people can only receive RTÉ 1, Network 2 and Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Notwithstanding the outstanding talents of those broadcasters, that is not enough for people who wish to retain the service to which they have become used.  Many people are being deprived of multi-channel TV because of civil actions taken by MMDS operators.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has looked the other way on this issue and has hidden behind the regulator and court cases.  She should take steps to introduce a dual licensing system for MMDS and deflector UHF-VHF systems which would allow both to coexist.  Given the many <Col N="846" /> issues in the melting pot, such as the obligation on the Government to sell the Telecom Éireann stake in Cablelink, there are many opportunities for a negotiated settlement of this issue.  The Minister should take an interest in it.  If people in Dublin were left without multi-channel television the problem would be sorted out within days, but people who are scattered around the country are ignored.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the situation of Luas in Dublin.  The Government has commissioned a study on whether Luas should be under or over ground.  The outcome is predictable. We know that putting it underground is cost prohibitive, yet we are jeopardising the EU funding of this £220 million project, which will link Dundrum and Tallaght to the city centre, by this delay which will take the project beyond the lifetime of the present tranche of funding.  This study is unnecessary and the further delay will add to the traffic congestion problems which affect many people in Dublin and, as it is our capital city, the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>This Estimate should provide a consultancy budget, at least, for a second gas interconnector. There is no doubt the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields will be exhausted by the turn of the century and that we need more than one gas interconnector.  Under the EU directive we can buy gas from Algeria, Norway and Russia on the existing European grid.  The existing interconnector does not have sufficient capacity and we should work to ensure a second is constructed. Given the lead time required, we should invest money in that project now.</P>
    <P>A Europeat midlands station is critical to the whole future of Bord na Móna.  This 130 megawatt facility, costing £120 million, is dependent on £21 million of EU funding.  I greatly regret the Minister has not fast-tracked this project because we could lose the funding under the 1994-9 tranche of Structural Funds as we still have to select the tender and engage in an EIS, the planning process, an An Bord Pleanála appeal and perhaps a High Court review.  I am very concerned, given that Bord na Móna's sales of one million tonnes of milled peat a year depends on this, that it has not been done.</P>
    <P>I am very unimpressed by the Taoiseach's comments on the ending of duty free sales, which will undermine both Aer Lingus's profits and Aer Rianta's survival.  I am also very disappointed by the Minister's delay in implementing the EU directive on electricity power generation competition.</P>
    <P>I do not detect from the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, any overall policy or approach to the ten commercial semi-State companies under her aegis, which have a turnover of more than £4 billion and employ 60,000 people.  As a stakeholder she has no clear view of their competitiveness in the economy.  I will be extremely vigilant in pursuing the Minister to ensure the taxpayer and this House get better from her.</P>

      <P>(<i>Wexford</i>): From listening to Deputies Yates and Rabbitte, one would think they had not been in Government for a few years. They are now screaming about matters such as the long-term unemployed and rail links which they should have addressed when they were in Government up to three months ago.</P>
      <P>However, I fully support Deputy Yates on one issue, which is the development of the railway line from Dublin to Rosslare, which is a major port and the gateway to Europe.  The rail line and the train facilities on that route are not of the same standard as those on the Dublin-Belfast, Dublin-Cork and Dublin-Galway lines.  The benefits of an economic boom should be shared equally across the country.  I expect the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, to deal with this problem as soon as possible.  It is important that the many passengers on that route would have first class facilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, outlined a number of proposals and improvements in the Book of Estimates.  Ireland is enjoying unprecedented economic growth and it is only fair this prosperity should be shared among all sections of our community.  He described the significant number of jobs created in 1997 and the dramatic fall in the number on the unemployed register over the last three years.  Credit is due to the different Governments in power over that period.</P>
      <P>However, it is important to reflect on the number of long-term unemployed, particularly in urban areas.  There are many large urban centres in my county with high levels of long-term unemployment. The problems related to long-term unemployment, such as social problems and youth crime, cost the State a significant amount of money.</P>
      <P>The Government should target those areas which have high levels of long-term unemployment. Schemes such as Leader, area partnerships, county enterprise schemes and those operated by FÁS work reasonably well but communities are baffled by their numbers.  They appear to be top heavy with staff.  People question whether those in need benefit from them.  The Minister responsible should seriously consider amalgamating some of them and providing one stop shops in urban centres to enable people return to work or make their own job creation proposals.  At present people are sent from one scheme to the next and become frustrated.  Some of them prefer to remain long-term unemployed rather than deal with these quangos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance should commission a feasibility study of these schemes.  I do not understand why, for example, counties should have four of them, each with an office, a chief executive <Col N="848" /> and a staff of 20 to 30 providing the same kind of service.  It needs to be seriously looked at.</P>
    <P>FÁS also needs to be seriously looked at.  Its purpose is to help the short and long-term unemployed return to work.  However, some of its programmes are not in their best interest.  It must be made more relevant and available to those who need its help.</P>
    <P>Significant increases in spending on education, health and the environment are provided for in the Estimates.  There should be an even spread of allocated moneys by Ministers.  For example, St. Peter's College and St. Aidan's primary school in Enniscorthy are two major centres of education which need to be upgraded.  Will the Minister for Education and Science seriously consider making funding available to both schools in 1998?</P>
    <P>There is much talk about the Celtic tiger, but it must benefit all sections of society if it is to be relevant.  Those on social welfare, including people on disability benefit and invalidity and old age pensions, should share in the country's prosperity. It would not be costly to make small changes.  For most of the time since I first entered the Dáil in 1982, the free fuel allowance has been £5 per week per person for the six winter months. Deputies on all sides of the House have called for an increase in the allowance.  The Minister for Social, Family and Community Affairs should seriously consider increasing it for pensioners and those on disability benefit and sick pay.  An increase from £5 to £6 or £7 per week may appear to be small but it would mean much to those on minimum social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I hope the speculation about major changes to the tax system in the budget is correct.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s the PAYE sector had to bear the burden of spending cutbacks.  Given the economic boom, it is now payback time and the Minister for Finance should reduce the tax rates, widen the tax bands and remove as many as possible on low income from the tax net.  These measures would give an incentive to people to work, look after their families and earn a decent standard of living.  It is time to give a break to the PAYE sector, which has paid vast amounts in tax over the years.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, is present.  There are approximately 360,000 people with disabilities in Ireland.  Many of them have been living below the poverty line for some time.  I am glad she has taken a direct interest in improving their quality of life.</P>
    <P>Only a few people with disability are lucky enough to find jobs.  Now is the time for the Government to seriously consider a generous allocation to these people in the budget.  They have been forgotten for too long.  I support any endeavour by the Minister of State to make improvements in this area and I appeal to the Minister for Finance to be extra generous in the budget, especially to the centres for independent living and to those who find it difficult to maintain <Col N="849" /> their places on FÁS and other temporary schemes.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister for Finance recognises the need to improve the quality of life of the less well off, those on social welfare, the aged and the sick.  I hope he will be as compassionate as possible.  The various partnership programmes have made life easier for Governments. However, I am not sure that they have made life easier for those on low pay who are just above the poverty line.  Are the unions concerned about this area?  Their agreements with Governments have ensured that those on middle or higher incomes have always done well while the lower paid have not.  This area must be looked at seriously for the future.  The Government, in conjunction with the union partners, must ensure a decent and equitable standard of living for the less well off in society.  I welcome the statement made by the Minister for Finance in regard to the proposed increases.  On budget day I hope he will ensure an even spread of moneys for all sections of the community, particularly the less well off.</P>

      <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996, requires that local authorities apply to the Environmental Protection Agency for licences to operate waste disposal sites.  The former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, by regulations known as the waste management licensing regulations, l997, dated 27 March l997, fixed dates by which applications should be made for existing sites depending on their capacity.  The regulations fixed 1 October l998 for two sites, Killarney and Milltown, County Kerry, to either apply for a licence or close down.  It further fixed 1 March l999 for sites in Kenmare and Caherciveen.  In the absence of a licence application these two sites in south Kerry must close.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a licence strict criteria must be met.  In County Kerry there is one modern up-to-date facility in Muingnaminnane, Tralee, which is supposed to last for 15-16 years given the amount of material going into it.  Will an expert from the Department of the Environment and Local Government or Brussels tell me how long this facility can last when waste from all over Kerry is dumped at this site?  Essentially small waste disposal sites receiving less than 15,000 tonnes a year play a major role in the economic well-being of rural areas.  Given that the areas served need time to adjust to the new requirements in County Kerry, a derogation from the licensing regulations should be given to these small sites for at least ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can large trucks travelling from Caherciveen and Waterville, through the Ring of Kerry, and Killorglin pass bus traffic from Killarney going in the opposite direction?  This will cause major problems in County Kerry.  For some reason there was a new development in this House last evening.  For the first time, for some unknown and major reason, the people in the constituency of Kerry north are calling on me to repair the roads.  My colleague, Deputy Spring, <Col N="850" /> declared a massive invasion through Farranfore and Kenmare, south Kerry, to see what could be done there about a few major roads in l998.  I welcome his intervention as will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and others on behalf of south Kerry. Given the pressures on him, perhaps he has decided to move to south Kerry for the next election.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to defer the closure of the disposal sites referred to for the reasons given.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few points concerning the area for which I am responsible as an Opposition spokesperson.  During my period as Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, I made a proposal to the Government and the Gas Company that the gas trunk network be extended beyond its present limited capacity from north Dublin-Cork to the west.  Detailed studies were carried out of what was required.  The object of the exercise was to provide an infrastructure for the midlands and the west equivalent to that available on the east coast and in the south.  This means people would have a choice regarding the energy source they decide to use.  We were aware from our experience that people who wanted to establish an industry were favourably disposed to areas that had the natural gas network available to it.  The detailed proposal drawn up would require State funding &mdash; for the trunk main &mdash; of about £5 million per year for a ten year period.  The gasification of the towns in the midlands, Galway city and other areas would be put out to tender to the best bidder, whether Bord Gáis or a private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case has been lodged with the EU Commission for State aid of £5 million per year for the provision of the trunk line.  We were advised at the time there would be no principled objection to it.  I am disappointed no provision has been made in the Estimates for that gas trunkline to the midlands and the west.  This demonstrates the Government is paying lip-service to the areas outside Dublin which need this type of service if they are to compete on a level playing field with the east coast.  There is also the demographic nonsense that a large portion of the population lives within a 25 mile radius of here and yet we are not providing the infrastructure to the rest of this relatively small island where people could make a living outside that.  We need to address that issue urgently.  The Leader of the Opposition referred this morning to the situation in Dublin city where one is sitting in a car looking at the back window of another car for perhaps an hour to travel a mile.  The matter has become so <Col N="851" /> serious that he raised it here, yet we are not putting in the infrastructure to allow the development to proceed in the midlands and the west.  I register my disappointment that the Minister for Public Enterprise has not prevailed on her senior colleague to provide this money in the Estimates. I ask her to pursue a positive decision from the EU Commission on this issue so that she can go back at a later stage to the Minister for Finance and the Government better armed to get a positive decision.</P>
    <P>The further inquiry into the Luas project is deliberately designed to prevent it going ahead. From the information available to me it is the Government's intention to divert the money available to Luas from the EU Commission to two projects, the Kinnegad and Dundrum bypasses, which the Department has been asked to look at.  I ask the Minister to look at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Information Society Commission was established by the previous Government in May following the report of the Information Society Ireland Steering Committee.  Its function is to oversee the implementation of a strategic framework for the development of the information society in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The principal reason for the 48 per cent increase in funding for the commission in 1998 over 1997 is that the 1997 allocation is in respect of only six months' operations.  The 1998 allocation makes provision for full year costs.</P>
      <P>The funding allocation of £338,000 for 1997 reflects the set up costs for the commission and its secretariat.  It takes account of salaries, wages and allowances; travel and subsistence; incidental expenses such as staff training and development; postal and telecommunications services; the purchase and installation of office machinery and other office supplies and consultancy services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1997 the commission has been developing its work programme which will be implemented in 1998 and subsequent years.  The allocation of £500,000 in 1998 will cover the same items of expenditure as in 1997, although expenditure on items such as office machinery will not be as substantial as in the current year.  A greater <Col N="852" /> proportion of commission expenditure in 1998 will be devoted to the development and implementation of campaigns to raise awareness of the information society among key target groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not particularly &mdash; the laws of libel in this area are fairly clearly stated &mdash; and certainly not in the course of discussion of one of the issues with which it is primarily concerned.

      <P>If people are systematically libelled on the Internet they have no redress because of the form of communication used whereas, if the same information was communicated by means of the print media or the normal conventional electronic medium, they would have such redress.  Will the Taoiseach agree that at the very least there should be a level playing field between methods of communication and that people are entitled to protect their reputations from any form of dissemination of injurious information, including any on the Internet?  Furthermore, does he agree that, as the Minister responsible for the information society, the Taoiseach might give the subcommittees a direction on the necessity of examining this area of law?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should make the position somewhat clearer.  I was replying to Deputy Upton's question when I enunciated the subcommittees and their involvement.  In regard to the broad aspect of the Internet, of course, Deputy John Bruton is correct.

I am not trying to score any advantage over the Taoiseach on this matter which is somewhat extraneous to the main question.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. David Trimble, in London on Thursday, 20 November.  We had a very good meeting which went over the primary issues in the negotiations and gave us a better understanding of the positions on both sides.  I hope that, following our detailed discussions, we have laid the basis for further contacts and constructive dialogue.  The intensive nature of the multi-party negotiations affords the essential context for such dialogue.  It is important that all parties to the talks would engage in bilateral contacts with each other on an inclusive basis.</P>
      <P>I met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, at the EU Employment Summit in Luxembourg on Friday, 21 November.  In the course of a very useful discussion, we reviewed progress on the talks and related issues, including prisoners and security issues.  We also agreed on the need to generate further momentum in the talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated in my speech to the STOP &mdash; Solidarity To Organise Peace &mdash; Group on 24 July that I would regularly consult all shades of Northern political opinion to consolidate democratic consensus around a peaceful way forward and that I would meet those Northern parties wishing to participate, to regularly review means of achieving progress.  I have held separate meetings with a number of the parties.  Participation at the meeting on Friday next, which is a further step in this process, was open to all the parties at the talks and this was made clear.  The meeting will take place over lunch.  The SDLP, the Alliance Party, the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, <Col N="857" /> the Northern Ireland Labour Party and Sinn Féin have already indicated they will attend.</P>
    <P>I will meet the British Prime Minister again at the European Council meeting on 12 and 13 December and I will meet President Clinton on 15 December to review progress.</P>
    <P>All of my meetings and the bilateral meetings the Minister for Foreign Affairs has had at the talks, including the meeting he had recently with the Ulster Unionist Party; the meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation scheduled for 5 December and the review plenary of the talks at the beginning of December, are geared toward generating momentum in the talks, which continues to be the primary arena and focus. There is widespread recognition that such an injection of momentum is necessary at this time.</P>
    <P>I met the Ireland-US Parliamentary Group jointly led by Congressman Jim Walsh, chairman of the Friends of Ireland Group in Congress and Congressman Ben Gilman, chairman of the House International Relations Committee and co-chairman of the Ad-Hoc Committee on Irish Affairs on Wednesday, 19 November.  I updated the group on the situation regarding the talks and welcomed its continuing interest and involvement in Ireland.  I also expressed my own and the Government's appreciation of the positive role being played by the US Administration and the continuing engagement of President Clinton, as evidenced by his invitation to me to meet him in Washington next month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there has been a considerable degree of movement in the talks held in Belfast over the past two weeks, that the strategy of having bilateral and multilateral meetings is working reasonably well?  Does he further agree there is a need for the Ulster Unionists to address the issues within strand II of the talks in a substantive way; that equally there is a need for Séin Fein to address strand I in a serious way and that, if both of those objectives can be achieved, they will form a good basis on which the talks can progress?  Does he agree the matter is very urgent given that we really must be able to show substantial progress before the February plenary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton. On the first point, substantial progress has been made but the longer, more detailed discussions proved extremely difficult with such large numbers. They were useful in so far as detailed papers were put forward by all parties across the three strands, but the engagement was not so intensive. The bilateral meetings are allowing people to get to the core of the central issues under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what Deputy Bruton said about the importance of strand II and the Unionists appreciating the value of those talks, in particular the reason Northern Nationalists are so committed to the North-South body and the reason for much of the conflict over so many decades, it is important that they move forward their own <Col N="858" /> thinking in that regard.  Equally, I share Deputy Bruton's view that Sinn Féin should appreciate the useful progress made on various issues.  The British Government has responded positively to a number of issues I raised last week as well as to issues raised by the SDLP, Sinn Féin and others, and that should be clearly acknowledged.  I note that Gerry Adams, as leader of Sinn Féin, made some acknowledgement of that and I understand the British Government will make further progress on the prisoner's issue before the end of this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is important from the point of view of the Nationalist community that time be devoted to dealing with equality issues in strand I concerning policing and the treatment of Irish culture in the entire society of Northern Ireland?  Will he agree that these issues are, in some cases, as important as the North-South issues?  In regard to strand II, the North-South issues, which are obviously important also, will the Taoiseach indicate if it is envisaged that the North-South body to be established would have a separate budget of its own or would it draw on the budgets of line Departments here and in Belfast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All of the issues in strand I, including the importance of building trust and harmonious relationships within Northern Ireland, are absolutely paramount because whatever arrangement is finally concluded will have to be one on which people can build trust and confidence in each other.  In regard to the equality and cultural agendas, there are bodies and groups which were of the view over many decades that nobody was listening to them, yet they managed to continue their work in a peaceful way.  I emphasise in particular elements of the Irish language movement, cultural movements in general and some of the bodies involved in the women's movement which tried to pursue these issues over the years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the North-South dimension, I recently stated that a number of aspects of that dimension are crucial.  One of those is that people must understand we are not talking about a separate body.  The North-South dimension will involve the removal of powers and functions from Departments and agencies here which will result in those powers being devolved into a new arrangement.  I have not given much thought to the financing of this but it would be more desirable for such a body to have its own core administration, otherwise endless arguments could arise about the transferring of those bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply to a number of questions.  With regard to the reconvening of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation on 5 December, I want to put two questions to the Taoiseach.  In order to advance the momentum referred to in a previous question, does the Taoiseach want to see any <Col N="859" /> strategy or desired objective emerge from the forum which will run from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Friday, 5 December?  Has he communicated to the co-ordinating group, in effect the Whips, on the precise format of the meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his question.  I may have slightly misled Deputies on the last occasion this matter was raised.  I did not realise at that stage that the section in my Department dealing with this matter already had been in touch with the members of the steering group; I believe I stated that they would get in touch but they already had been in touch with the Whips, as we call them.  They have since taken some of their views on board as well as those of our colleagues in the North to try to make the session as meaningful as possible.  What we would like to do &mdash; this is not my view but views from a number of quarters &mdash; is allow parties to make a statement. It is hoped they would not be too lengthy as this is the first meeting.  I am anxious that the parties participating in the talks would be allowed make a statement on the talks and that the parties from this House would engage in a question and answer session with the Northern parties.  The parties from the North are anxious to engage with the parties here on the margins of the meeting, perhaps over and after lunch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to what Deputy Bruton said, with which the Taoiseach did not disagree, and in the context of strand I and the necessity for Sinn Féin to move forward more rapidly than it is currently doing, what, if anything, does the Taoiseach believe the forum meeting on 5 December can do to advance that momentum and achieve the successful outcome to which all of us aspire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the party leaders will make their own points clear.  In relation to strand I, I detect &mdash; and this is no secret &mdash; that many of the parties are fairly clear on where they are going and what the parameters are but they have &ldquo;parked&rdquo; those issues until they see the progress that is made in strands II and III.  That will not deter the participants in the forum from giving their views.  I hope those of us in the forum not engaged in the talks on a daily basis can put forward their positions this side of Christmas because it is crucial that we do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply and from reports of the various meetings he has had, I want to ask a number of supplementaries.  The Taoiseach made an important point with regard to the North-South body and the fact that this House will devolve some powers to that body.  Bearing in mind that the negotiations taking place are, by and large, private, does the Taoiseach foresee circumstances in which this House can be engaged in discussing the nature of the devolution of powers to such a <Col N="860" /> body?  In terms of the outcome of these negotiations, it is important that those of us in the Republic have full consent in relation to what we are doing.  The same applies to the question of Articles 2 and 3.  I have long been an advocate of the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 to delete the territorial claim in relation to Northern Ireland. The definition of the national territory needs to be altered if we are to achieve a sustainable accommodation between North and South.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate what, if any, mechanisms he foresees to enable the House to engage in discussing these issues?  On strand III, does the Taoiseach foresee an east-west body operating parallel to the idea of a North-South body and, if so, does he perceive such a body would have executive powers?  Will he indicate what way such a body would operate because negotiations would be necessary?  An intergovernmental east-west body is needed at the very least to enable a greater degree of co-operation and co-ordination between Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am disturbed by a report that the Minister for Foreign Affairs intervened with the German Chancellor to seek to have the proposed extradition of Ms McAliskey from Britain to Germany stopped.  If that report is true, his actions constitute a gross interference in the judicial process and that is not something I would like to see continued or initiated in relation to anyone else.  This country engages in various ways in the extradition process with other European countries.  If there is political interference in the process at any level it will render it useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked four questions. On the North-South body, I am anxious this House should be included in all the progress we make and that the bipartisanship arrangement we have had for many years should continue.  That is essential in the context of devolving powers.  The process of a North-South dimension in whatever will be its final configuration will be meaningful only if our agencies delegate powers, Northern agencies engage in a similar process and those powers are subsumed into an executive structure. We have been making that case for many years and that must happen.  In so far as this will be debated at the appropriate time the answer to the Deputy's question on that matter is yes.</P>
      <P>On Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, I had discussions and there has been no change in that regard.  I replied to Deputy Bruton on this matter last week.  We are talking about constitutional change in the context of a balanced agreement as part of an overall settlement in line with Articles 14 to 21 of the Framework Document set down in February 1995.  There may be some changes to what we signed up to on that occasion, but the changes will be within the ballpark of those articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been work on an east-west body. The structure set up by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, included an agenda on education <Col N="861" /> and other aspects that were set down.  Further meetings were held on that recently.  I am happy to tell Deputy Bruton in particular that we have progressed matters to the stage where I hope a report will be published setting out where we are at and then others will be able to put forward their views on this.</P>
    <P>Ms Roisín McAliskey's case is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He met her legal representatives, her family and some of those who have been engaged in the campaign for her release.  He conveyed some of the views given to him by her legal representatives to his counterpart in England.  That is all he has been engaged in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his long answer to a number of questions to which I wish to ask a number of supplementaries.  His meeting with Mr. David Trimble was an important development.  Will he tell us what was learned at that meeting and if there are plans to have further meetings?  The Green Party had discussions with parties involved in the talks and a number of questions arise from them.  Will the Taoiseach give consideration to the most opportune day for holding the forum in Dublin to ensure it does not interfere with the Stormont talks?  The parties involved in the talks suggested a Thursday or a Saturday as preferable days.  Will the Taoiseach outline to the House or the parties the changes envisaged in strand II which the Irish Government may be contemplating or may need to consider? He should bear in mind that one of the main questions that arose in discussions my party had with parties involved in the talks was the willingness of the Irish Government and perhaps the Irish Civil Service to move towards the formation of structures within strand II.</P>
      <P>Regarding the forum, will he agree that overcoming the obstacles to the task of the subcommittee on peace is one of the most important jobs remaining to be done to enable it to finalise its report?  Regarding his meeting with the British Prime Minister, were the British Government's obligations in regard to its involvement in strand III discussed?  Questions in that regard that relate to the Irish Civil Service would also relate to the British Civil Service.</P>
      <P>I tabled a question on Sellafield to the Taoiseach prior to his meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair.  Has he noted that since I tabled that question there has been, as BNFL put it, &ldquo;an unplanned release of radioactive material from Sellafield&rdquo; and a dental survey in Britain and Ireland of 3,000 children found traces of plutonium in their teeth?  Was the matter of Sellafield raised at that meeting and, if not, will it be raised at a future meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the EU Employment Summit, are guidelines in preparation to cover the quality of employment, which is fast becoming an issue for many people?  A recent advertisement for a mechanic's job offered £73 for a 39 hour week? Will he agree that the Employment Summit <Col N="862" /> should consider quality of employment as well as job statistics?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost all the questions were about one meeting but I will not argue the point. The meeting with Mr. Trimble provided an opportunity to review the current state of the talks and to discuss our priorities and those of the Ulster Unionist Party.  We dealt in detail with the various issues it considers central to the format of <Col N="863" /> the talks, the type of progress it wants to make and the obstacles it envisages.  The meeting was useful.  Over the years I have found the Ulster Unionist Party straight and direct in meetings. That applies to both sides in this instance.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Northern parties and the forum generally, I do not have a difficulty about the date or time.  The problem is that there are 11 parties which do not only have difficulties relating to the strands of talks.  We must try to fit in with the time which appears to suit the House and most of the parties.  They may wish to change the times. A specific difficulty is that some of the parties are engaged in the forum.  However, the Government did not fix the date to make it difficult for them. I would be happy to consider an alternative date if the Opposition suggests one.</P>
      <P>Strand II of the talks is the North-South dimension. This covers all aspects, Departments and agencies which the Government considers have a role.  We are considering how best they can be developed by delegating powers.  We are developing this area and have outlined in detail how we want it to proceed.  It will continue to develop as time goes on.</P>
      <P>Another separate aspect is the east-west arrangements, which may be integrated in the future.  We have set down what is important in terms of the positions of the British and Irish Governments.  The Deputy will be aware from statements by Unionists, other Northern Ireland parties and the British Government that the concept of the east-west arrangements might be wider than originally envisaged.  This is described as the &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; and would cover more areas than the original proposals envisaged.  This matter is being discussed by the two Governments and the working groups.</P>
      <P>Regarding EU regulations, I assure the Deputy the purpose of the criteria set down, which I dealt with yesterday, is to ensure that training, retraining, skills shortages, disadvantage and social exclusion are comprehensively addressed.  All EU member states realise the real difficulty in the future will be the unemployment figure of 18 million. If we are to make a serious dent in that total, such as the target of five million jobs mentioned in the summit discussions, skills shortages and inadequacy of education standards must be addressed.</P>
      <P>At this meeting with the British Prime Minister I did not raise the issue of Sellafield.  However, I have done so in the past and the matter will remain on the agenda for future meetings.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is unwise to give those who do not want to attend the forum in Northern Ireland the excuse that the forum in the Republic will meet on the same day? The clash in dates provides an out from the <Col N="864" /> beginning and pre-empts the attendance of Unionists in the future.  How often does the Taoiseach envisage the forum meeting?</P>
      <P>Regarding strand III, the east-west arrangements, the Taoiseach said the entire range of important issues was under consideration.  Has the Taoiseach discussed with the British Prime Minister the issue of security arrangements within the islands and specifically Partnership for Peace?</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach state that the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the margins of the Luxembourg summit did not request the Chancellor to drop the German extradition proceedings involving Róisín McAliskey?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach envisage a specific east-west body parallel to the North-South institution or body which is under negotiation in strand II? Regarding the transfer of prisoners under the 1995 Act, I understand the Taoiseach indicated to the British Prime Minister that the heads of a Bill were ready for an amendment to the 1995 Act to cover certain conditions of prisoners transferring from Britain to Ireland.  As there is not much time before the Christmas recess and it is intended to pass the legislation before then, will the Taoiseach make the heads of the Bill available to the House to ensure the issues can be discussed by the parties in advance of the introduction of the Bill?</P>

      <P>The first issue raised by the Deputy is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs but I understand he raised it with his counterpart.  The Minister communicated his deliberations following a meeting he had with Gareth Pierce.  The Minister also had a meeting with Ms Pierce, Bernadette McAliskey, other members of the family and some of the people involved in pursuing the case over the last 12 months.  The Deputy should table a parliamentary <Col N="865" /> question to find out more information on that matter.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the east-west body is to progress matters.  The Government is not involved directly in strand I, although we are aware of what is going on.  We are trying to develop strand II in terms of what should be covered by it, how it should progress and what the Government is prepared to devolve.  This is being dealt with at one level while the east-west arrangements are being discussed elsewhere with different people. I am trying to progress all these matters so people can see the full picture.</P>
      <P>Regarding the transfer of prisoners, I will check the position regarding the heads of a Bill.  I have asked that the legislation be cleared quickly and published soon.  I will check with the relevant Minister if a briefing can be arranged in advance. The purpose of the Bill is to clarify the position whereby Ireland has a 20 year rule and Britain has a 35 year rule for life sentences.  However, I am glad, following other meetings which we have held to try to clear this issue, that there will be repatriation of prisoners in some cases which have been dealt with over the past number of weeks.  I expect three prisoners to be repatriated in the next few days.</P>

      <P>While welcoming the announcement that the British Army will not be patrolling the streets of west Belfast during daylight hours and hoping that will be extended to other areas of Northern Ireland and also welcoming statements made by Mo Mowlam on the policing issue but recognising this is only a start, does the Taoiseach agree that a solution to the policing issue is central and without it there will be no solution to the Northern Ireland problem and in that context the use of the phrase &ldquo;police service&rdquo; rather than the plural might be suggested?</P>
      <P>Does he agree that confidence building is a two way process?  In that context &mdash; I am sorry the Sinn Féin Deputy is not present &mdash; will he bring to the attention of the Sinn Féin leadership when he meets it that the return of the bodies of the disappeared would be a very important confidence building move and that even in the most primitive societies when a cessation occurred the bodies were returned so that burials could take place, which would be Christian ones in this context?</P>
      <P>I recently read an obituary notice for a man who disappeared over 20 years ago which brought the issue very forcefully to my attention.  It contained a statement of hope still but people have a right to know where their relatives are buried. Will the Taoiseach bear this in mind?</P>

      <P>The total expenditure figures in respect of supplementary welfare allowance are in a tabular statement which I propose <Col N="868" /> to circulate in the Official Report.  A breakdown of payments for each of the health boards in respect of each year is not available as the scheme is not yet fully computerised.  Computerisation of the SWA scheme commenced in May 1996 and is meant to be completed in all health board areas by mid-1998.</P>
      <P>The approach to controls does not involve specialised staff.  Instead, all community welfare officers and superintendent community welfare officers are involved in the control of SWA payments on a daily basis, making control work an integral part of service delivery.  Control starts when a member of the public makes a claim and is maintained during the life of the claim through reviews, re-certification of entitlement, random checks and cross checking of claims to ensure the client continues to be entitled to the payment. The computerisation of the SWA scheme has enhanced control procedures.  Community welfare officers now have access to my Department's main payments database.  Computerisation has improved administration, reduced the potential for fraud or abuse and provides greater control of payments through, for example, automated reviews.</P>
      <P>In addition, targeted control work is carried out periodically in each board.  This includes reviewing rent supplements to ensure the recipient still resides at the address and that there are no changes which would affect entitlement.</P>

I am concerned to ensure that the money in question will reach those who really need it.  That is why I am interested in control measures.  Is the Minister aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out in his report on means testing that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs means test for new claims was more rigorous than the equivalent test by the health board?

      <P>I do not accept that I am complacent. I have inherited an extremely complicated scheme.  Some time ago the Department, with the health boards, set up a process to initiate an integrated computerisation scheme.  I formally launched the first such scheme in the North-Eastern Health Board area a number of weeks ago. The health boards are now privy to all the database of my Department.  Everybody involved in disbursing taxpayers' money has an obligation to ensure that it goes to the people who most deserve it.  That applies not only to the staff in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs but to staff in the health boards.</P>

An internal audit report in relation to area 3 of the Eastern Health Board dated 8 August this year, apparently not brought to the Minister's attention, highlights a number of control weaknesses which require immediate attention and which corroborate the case I make for adequate control measures in the health board areas.

      <Quest>the plans, if any, in his Department to ensure that means testing of social welfare payments poses as little disincentive as possible; if so, if these plans include the co-ordination of means testing with the Department of Health and Children and health boards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need to ensure that the social welfare system is capable of meeting the twin aims of providing critical income support while also encouraging and facilitating <Col N="870" /> people who wish to gain access to education, training and employment.</P>
      <P>The development of means testing across the range of social welfare schemes has, therefore, taken account of the need to ensure that disincentives are minimised.  Recent developments in this area include, for example, the means test associated with the one parent family payment scheme which was introduced earlier this year.  The structure of the means test is such that it acts to encourage and facilitate lone parents to enter the active labour force by enabling claimants to earn up to £6,000 a year without affecting their entitlement to the payment.  This measure recognises that unemployed lone parent families are particularly at risk of poverty and is designed specifically to encourage such people to gain a foothold in the labour market, thereby reducing their dependence on social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the means test associated with the unemployment assistance scheme has been restructured to make it easier for claimants to avail of casual and part-time work opportunities and to ensure that they are always better off as a result of doing so.  Under the improved arrangements, which came into effect in November 1996, where a person works for up to three days a week, earnings are now assessed at 60 per cent. In addition, persons without children are allowed a £10 disregard for each day worked, while the balance of earnings are assessed at 60 per cent. These changes simplify the system of assessment of earnings from employment and thereby improve the incentive for unemployed people to take up casual and part-time work opportunities. The improved measures are designed to ensure that claimants have an incentive to work at all levels of earnings, even where the level of pay is less than the rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>In general terms, the principle of consistency across all social welfare means tests is desirable, but this must also be balanced with the need to ensure that the social welfare system retains enough flexibility to be able to respond to the specific needs of differing categories of customers.</P>
      <P>Regarding co-ordination of means testing generally, the lack of integration between the various social services administered by Government Departments and State agencies has been a matter of concern for some time.</P>
      <P>The report of the interdepartmental committee on the development of an integrated social services system, published in 1996, sets out a framework for the development of an integrated approach to the administration, delivery, management and control of publicly funded income support services.  The basic objective is to introduce greater coherence to the provision of these services. One of the issues being addressed in this context is the question of sharing information within and between agencies involved in the delivery of social services.  These would include my Department, the health boards, local authorities and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> The Deputy will be aware of the requirements and obligations set out under the Data Protection Act to protect the privacy interests of individuals when information about them is processed.  My Department is currently in the process of examining proposals which will allow for the sharing of data, under specified circumstances and with the knowledge of the customer, between the various agencies and having regard to requirements of the Data Protection Act.</P>
    <P>The ultimate aim is to have a situation where the customer will be required to give the relevant means data to one agency only.  That agency can then make it available, where appropriate, to any other agency, where the customer has made a claim for an allowance, grant, etc.  This will lead to a more co-ordinated service to the customer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  I am glad he shares my concerns.  I do not see why somebody should have to undergo a means test for unemployment assistance and, if benefit is refused, undergo another means test by the Department of Health and Children.  Surely it should be possible to transfer the information already obtained by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to a health board or from a health board to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be preferable to have a standardised means test system.  That is one reason the Department and the health boards started the integrated social services scheme a number of years ago, whereby there would be sharing of information.  We have to work within the constraints of the Data Protection Act.  My Department is looking at ways of moving the matter forward.  However, at the end of the day we are subject to the decision of the data protection officer.  My Department and the data protection office have been in contact in an effort to progress the matter.  Everyone agrees there should be co-ordination in assessing means and, while we are working towards this, it is a slow process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stressing this matter because it was also raised by the Minister's party when it was in Opposition.  If the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs refuses an application for unemployment assistance, will the Minister ensure the information in the document is made available to the applicant so that he can present it to the community welfare officer in the Department of Health and Children?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a system is already in place in the North-Eastern Health Board area.  Applicants who are refused unemployment assistance no longer have to bring a note to the community welfare officer: the information is sent by computer. This computerisation system, which was put in place in the North-Eastern Health Board <Col N="872" /> area some months ago and mainly paid for by my Department, will be extended to all other health board areas.</P>

      <P>It is crucial that social welfare services are made more responsive to the needs of the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed.  While it is necessary to provide vital income support to unemployed people and their families, it is equally important that we accelerate the provision of opportunities to assist people break out of the cycle of unemployment.</P>
      <P>In this context, I am convinced there is a need for much greater emphasis on education and training and I am considering improvements in the range of back to education programmes which will build on the existing second level and third level allowances and enable a greater number of unemployed people to gain the educational qualifications and job skills now in demand in the jobs market.  These improvements will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>Another crucial area is the effect of the so-called secondary benefits on the incentive to take up and remain in employment and training.  This is a highly complex area, particularly as it embraces a range of schemes, including, for example, the medical card scheme and the differential rents schemes, as well as schemes operated by my Department.  Given its complexity and that it comes within the responsibility of a number of Departments, a consultancy study of this area has been commissioned.  The study is being overseen by an interdepartmental group.  It is intended that the consultants will complete their work by the end of the year and I look forward to receiving their final report shortly thereafter.  I am confident this work will highlight some of the anomalies which have developed over the years and will provide my Department as well as the other Departments involved with valuable guidance on the future development of policy in this area.</P>
      <P>On a more general level, my Department constantly monitors the operation of its schemes with a view to ensuring that poverty traps and disincentives are removed.  Further measures in this area are being considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>We all agree it is necessary to iron out anomalies.  There will always be anomalies <Col N="873" /> in a complex system and we should endeavour at all times to eliminate them.  Does the Minister see merit in establishing a public forum where the public could highlight anomalies as they apply to their situation?  For example, at the forum they could be given advice by experts such as Colm Rapple who last week in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> highlighted a case raised by Deputy McGrath.  Such a forum would give people an opportunity to expose anomalies and discuss how best to resolve them.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputy O'Keeffe, I would not demean the ability of Oireachtas Members to expose anomalies in the social welfare system.  They have done this for many years. As has been the practice in recent years in the run-up to the budget, I held a forum where 26 lobby groups put forward their views on the budget and anomalies in the system.  There is scope within the existing system to deal with such anomalies.  A committee of the House which will deal with this entire area will shortly be established. Members of the public have the ability through the media, particularly by way of letter to the editor, to point out anomalies.</P>

      <P>I would not attempt to demean the efforts of my colleagues, some of whom have highlighted anomalies in the House and to me.  There are two sides to this matter, one is the need to highlight the anomalies and the other is the efforts to find a solution.  This is the context in which I referred to a forum where suggestions could be put forward on how to iron out anomalies in a cost-effective way.  The case highlighted by Deputy McGrath is a typical example.  As he said, a married person with three children in receipt of a family income supplement and a wage of £230 per week will lose money if he gets an increase.  This person would need to receive an extra £2,000 per year if he was to increase his take home pay.  We need a forum where such issues can be teased out and cost-effective solutions devised.  Otherwise these poverty traps and disincentives to employment will continue.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing family income supplement have been the source of much discussion by no less a forum than Partnership 2000 which put forward suggestions which are part of the agreement which must be implemented over the next two years and which is under consideration by my Department.  My Department is keenly aware of the anomalies <Col N="874" /> which crop up in the system from time to time. New schemes can also create anomalies in their own way.  This week I signed regulations on tapering withdrawal for the qualified adult allowance under a number of schemes.  This means people will be able to earn more than £60 on a tapered basis.  Up to 10,000 families will benefit by an average of £19 per week as a result of this initiative.  I hope in the coming budget and future budgets to address a number of the anomalies which have been highlighted by Deputies, the social partners in the context of Partnership 2000 and the public.</P>

      <P>Subhead B of my Department's Estimates provides for the Exchequer subvention to the social insurance fund.  The subvention is the amount by which expenditure from the fund is greater than its income.  The fund expenditure and income estimates underlying the 1998 Estimate &mdash; Abridged Version &mdash; and the forecast outturn for 1997 are contained in a tabular statement which I will circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The reduction of £5.7m in the subvention in 1998 is due to the expectation that fund income will increase by slightly more than fund liabilities, on a pre-budget basis.  Income, which is made up almost entirely of PRSI contributions, is expected to increase by £94.9 million, due mainly to increased employment and higher earnings.  The liabilities of the fund are expected to increase by £89.2 million, due mainly to the full year costs of the 1997 budget improvements and to a projected increase in numbers of recipients on some schemes, mainly contributory pensions.</P>

The issue of how this matter will be addressed will be subject to negotiations between the Minister for Finance and myself.  No services are being cut.

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to ease and simplify the means test for smallholders and fishermen.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16490/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my previous reply to Question No. 47 on Wednesday, 15 October 1997.  The means tests which apply in the case of the various social assistance schemes are designed to ensure available resources are targeted at those in most need and that people in similar financial situations are, as far as possible, treated in the same manner.</P>
      <P>Self-employed people, such as farmers and fishermen, are nevertheless treated more favourably than other unemployed people in terms of qualifying for unemployment assistance.  For instance, claimants in general must be fully unemployed for each day they claim unemployment assistance. However, self-employed persons, such as farmers and fishermen, whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim it.</P>
      <P>In assessing means for social assistance purposes in the case of farmers and fishermen, account is taken of the value of the net income derived from either fishing or farming, less the expenses actually and necessarily incurred in producing that income.  For example, in the case of a smallholder, sales of milk, livestock, crops and subsidy payments, such as headage payments, will account for gross income, while expenses may include such items as the cost of fertilisers, veterinary expenses, interest on borrowing for farm purposes, hired labour, repairs to farm buildings and machinery etc.  The balance of gross income over allowed expenses represents means and this is set against the scheduled rate of the particular payment they have claimed.  In the case of unemployment assistance, for instance, the scheduled rate is then reduced by £1 for each £1 of means.</P>
      <P>In effect, therefore, unemployment assistance for smallholders and other self-employed persons, for example, boat owners, acts as a form of income supplement, similar to family income supplement which applies in the case of employees with families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fishermen who are employed under a contract of service are insurable for class A PRSI contributions and are, accordingly, covered for all social insurance benefits, including unemployment benefit during periods of unemployment. Fishermen who do not have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for unemployment benefit may claim unemployment assistance instead.  In such cases, where a fisherman is unemployed for at least three days in any period of six consecutive <Col N="878" /> days, they continue to receive their weekly rate of unemployment assistance, less 60 per cent of their net income from employment.  In addition, persons without children are allowed a £10 disregard for each day worked, with the balance of earnings assessed at 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>A significant improvement in the means test for smallholders was provided for in 1996 with the introduction of a substantial disregard of up to £2,000 in moneys received by way of the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  In addition, costs incurred by farmers in implementing the agri-environmental plan, as provided for under REPS, are offset against income from other farming activities for the purposes of assessing means.  Therefore, the combination of these two measures represents a significant incentive for farmers who are receiving social assistance payments, such as unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance or old age non-contributory pension, to participate in REPS.  The operation of this exemption limit means that farmers receiving unemployment assistance who are also in receipt of REPS payments in excess of £2,000 are at least £2,000 better off in terms of their overall income position.</P>
    <P>Any proposal to ease the means tests in the case of farmers and fishermen would have cost implications and would, therefore, have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources and existing priorities.</P>
    <P>I apologise for the length of the reply, but it is necessary to put on record the full issue raised in the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the reply there was a significant improvement, particularly for small farmers, in 1996.  My interest arises from an infamous document circulated earlier this year with the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  In that document there is a clear, specific and unequivocal commitment to ease and simplify the means tests for smallholders and fishermen.

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now widely recognised that child benefit is a very effective mechanism for tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes and because it is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits, such as differential rents, medical cards, and so on, it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that, while I share her views on the importance of child benefit, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any possible further enhancement of the scheme in advance of the budget.</P>

      <P>We are not asking the Minister to indicate the level of increase.  We are asking him to indicate his policy on child benefit? Does he intend to increase child benefit substantially, as happened in the previous three budgets, and freeze child dependant allowances payable with certain social welfare payments as a means of eliminating poverty and unemployment traps? Is it Government policy to make payments for children and families through child benefit as distinct from child dependant allowances or other forms of support?  As the Minister stated in his reply, it is now recognised as the most effective way to support disadvantaged families.</P>

Will the Minister give a clear commitment to honour the promise in the Fianna Fáil manifesto to provide at least a 50 per cent increase in child benefit for twins?

An additional grant of £500 is made payable in respect of twins on reaching four years of age and 12 years of age.  On the Deputy's question, as with the other issues mentioned earlier including the commitment in our programme, it is being examined in the context of next week's budget.

      <P>It is always difficult to think differently when one moves to the other side of the House but I caution against introducing too much complexity into the child benefit system.  In that regard, I ask the Minister to give an undertaking that he will resist any proposals from whatever quarter, well-meaning or otherwise, to tax child benefit.  That would be a retrograde step and would undermine the effectiveness of the current benefit, which goes primarily to the mothers of children and in many cases is the only income they have, regardless of the income to the household.  The household may have a substantial income but the child benefit goes directly to the mother.  The Combat Poverty Agency has suggested it ought to be taxed.  Does the Minister agree that is a mistaken view?</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme is an educational opportunities scheme for unemployed people and lone parents which is administered by the Department of Education and Science.  In order to qualify for participation, applicants must be aged 21 or over and be signing on the live register or in receipt of a one parent family payment for at least six months.</P>
      <P>In general, participants on the scheme retain entitlement to those secondary benefits, such as fuel allowance, Christmas bonus and rent allowance, to which they have an entitlement on commencement of their course of study.  Where a VTOS course ceases and the person returns to the live register, he or she resumes entitlement to unemployment payment, including secondary benefits where appropriate, at the point where he or she left off.  I am not aware of particular difficulties in relation to the retention of secondary benefits but there is a range of such benefits, some of which are not within my Department's direct responsibility.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I would be glad to have it examined.</P>
      <P>Discussions are currently under way with the Department of Education and Science about the further development of VTOS in the context of the expansion of my Department's back to education programmes.  The question of secondary benefits is among the issues under discussion in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">

      <P>This also relates to secondary benefits.  Why is the Department obliged to take account of notification by FÁS where a person is <Col N="884" /> converting from class JO to class A, in order to refuse secondary entitlements?  This is a disincentive to participation in community employment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The last question is not strictly related to VTOS but that issue is now coming to the fore, particularly with the Christmas bonus due to be paid in the next few weeks.  It first arose some years ago when a number of pressure groups sought to have class A contributions paid by CE employees.  That has the advantage of allowing people to claim unemployment benefit when they come off the scheme but the downside is that they do not receive secondary benefits such as the Christmas bonus.  I accept that is causing some difficulty.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Naughten, the administration of VTOS is not within my Department. As to the spaces available, discussions are ongoing between my ministerial colleague, Deputy Martin, and me about an enhancement of the schemes concerned with bringing people back into education in order to give them the skills to avail of the ever increasing job vacancies.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1997. - Vote 29: Third Level and Further Education.</Title>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £107,150,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment in the year ending 31 December, 1997 for the payment of sundry grants and grants-in-aid in respect of third level and further education.</P>
    <P>These Supplementary Estimates arise because of a number of different factors.  First, major technical adjustments are required to deal with two long-standing issues.  These involve placing the higher education grants on a current year basis to ensure these grants are paid to students on time every term, and changing the pay date for secondary teachers from 5 January 1998 to 31 December 1997 as a precursor to placing their payments on a fortnightly basis in line with other teachers.</P>
    <P>Second, the cost of various commitments, mainly capital, made by the previous Government, provision for which was not included in the 1997 Revised Estimates.  Third, underestimation of the provision for a number of subheads principally in the pay, superannuation and student support areas.  Fourth, costs arising from the Government's decision immediately after taking office to put in place a programme to tackle skill shortages. Fifth, shortfalls in ESF receipts due to Irish pound-ECU exchange rate variation and delays in ESF receipts due at end 1997 but now likely to arrive in January 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> For the information of the House, I intend to go through Votes and subheads giving details of the supplementary provision being sought.</P>
    <P>Vote 26 comprises the Office of the Minister for Education and Science.  A Supplementary Estimate totalling £4.650 million is required on this Vote which includes all of the basic operations of the Department and various general programmes.  The Supplementary Estimate is comprised of the following elements.</P>
    <P>Subhead A1 covers salaries, wages and allowances. The extra £600,000 sought is mainly due to overtime by Department staff in connection with the State examinations system and in working on the implementation of a major salary package for teachers negotiated under the PCW.</P>
    <P>Subhead A.4 covers postal and telecommunications services.  An additional £150,000 is sought for this subhead: £100,000 relates to increased postal charges and a further £50,000 is required for telecommunication equipment which is required in connection with the redevelopment of the Department's offices in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Subhead A.5 deals with office machinery and other office supplies.  The additional amount of £400,000 requested is due to an unprecedented and continuing demand for printing, including photocopying work and greater than anticipated computer and IT costs.  Many reforms have taken place in recent years and new initiatives have resulted in increased demands for printed material to be made available to schools and various interest groups.  Also, some computer and photocopying equipment is in urgent need of replacement.</P>
    <P>Subhead A.6. covers office premises expenses. An additional amount of £700,000 is required. This mainly arises from a major redevelopment of the Department's Marlborough Street complex, involving the total refurbishment of all the listed buildings on site and the erection of new purpose built office blocks.  The capital element of this work is, in the main, funded by the Office of Public Works but considerable elements of expenditure, principally furniture and fittings, fall to be met by my Department.</P>
    <P>Subhead B.2 covers transport services.  The main reason for requesting a supplementary increase in this subhead has been the demands made on my Department for improvements in transport services, in particular, for disabled pupils attending special schools and special classes.  These improvements for special needs pupils will account for an additional £300,000 in 1997.</P>
    <P>Improvements include increased provision of specially adapted bus services for wheelchair pupils, better transport services and more grant-aid for special needs pupils.  There have been some other minor refinements in the school transport services in 1997 at primary and post-primary level, which will increase expenditure by £200,000.  This brings the total sought under this subhead to £500,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> Subhead B.6 covers in-career development.  An additional £2 million is being sought for the in-career development of teachers at first, second and further education levels.  This would bring the total provision for the year to £8.634 million.  This is an exceptional figure which arises from underestimation of the carryover of increased activity in 1996 into 1997, and provision of new in-service programmes and the increased number of schools taking part in existing programmes Subhead B.16 covers the Royal Irish Academy of Music.  The funds in this subhead are allocated to the Royal Irish Academy of Music to meet the costs of the estimated deficit between the academy's income and expenditure on current account.  A sum of £50,000 is being sought by way of Supplementary Estimate to cover costs which have arisen during 1997 and which cannot be met from the original provision.  These costs relate to unavoidable expenditure associated with the replacement and upgrading of defective and aged musical instruments and general maintenance of the facilities.</P>
    <P>Subhead B.20 covers miscellaneous measures. I will very shortly launch the full details of the Schools IT 2000 initiative.  As an initial step I have established the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, which is based at Dublin City University.  The NCTE will manage the overall implementation of Schools IT 2000.  It is essential that the centre be in place as early as possible to plan for the start of the implementation of Schools IT 2000 as early in 1998 as possible. This supplementary sum of £250,000 is required to fund the national centre and the start-up of its activities in 1997.</P>
    <P>In Vote 27, first level education, a Supplementary Estimate totalling £18.850 million is required. Under Subhead A, salaries, etc. for primary teachers, a supplementary amount of £4.750 million is sought.  These additional moneys are required to meet the costs of retaining approximately 300 teacher posts most of which were due to be suppressed at the end of the 1996-7 school year because of declining enrolments, for which provision had not been made in the original Estimates, and to meet a shortfall due to underestimation in respect of substitution and employers' PRSI costs.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead C, capitation grants towards the operating costs of national schools, a supplementary amount of £300,000 is being sought to fund the cost of improvements in the scheme of additional capitation grants for clerical and caretaking services in primary schools.  The additional sum sought will enable a reduction in the qualifying enrolment from 250 to 195 pupils for ordinary national schools, and a reduction in the qualifying criteria for special schools to six or more teachers. An additional supplementary amount of £300,000 is required to fund the cost of capitation grants to primary schools, which was greater than anticipated.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead F.1, other grants and services, I am seeking £100,000 for additional equipment <Col N="889" /> for children with disabilities and an additional £400,000 for grants towards the rental of temporary school premises.  A Supplementary Estimate of £100,000 is sought to assist in addressing the level of applications received in my Department for equipment, such as computers, braillers and radio aids for children with special needs.  This significant move will result in the clearing of the current waiting list for all such appliances.  This allocation is being made possible by a transfer of resources from the Vote of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and I thank the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for his co-operation in that matter.  In certain circumstances, ordinary national schools and special schools may have to rent accommodation for short periods.  The number of schools, mainly Gaelscoileanna, requiring temporary premises is £400,000 greater than originally estimated.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead J, superannuation, etc. of teachers, an additional £6.5 million is required for the pension costs of primary teachers.  The shortfall in the pensions provision arises because the numbers retiring are much greater than anticipated. A major factor seems to be that many teachers postponed their retirement until they were satisfied that the PCW was secure.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead K.1, building equipment and furnishing of national schools, an additional £6.5 million is sought for the capital funding of primary schools.  The extra provision is required because additional major primary schools and projects have been released to tender and contract compared to the original number of projects when the 1997 Estimates were decided.</P>
    <P>In Vote 28, second level and further education, a Supplementary Estimate totalling £45.3 million is required.  Under Subhead A.1, secondary teachers &mdash; incremental salary grant, an additional £26 million is being sought to enable secondary teachers to be paid their monthly salaries at the end of each month, beginning in December 1997, instead of on the fifth day of the following month at present.  This will also facilitate the introduction of fortnightly pay in the latter part of 1998.  This major technical adjustment will finally address the long standing grievance of most second level teachers that they are the only teachers who do not receive their pay on a fortnightly basis.  I am pleased to be in a position to address this issue so quickly in my term of office.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead D, superannuation of secondary, comprehensive and community school teachers, an additional £2 million is requested for pensions of secondary, comprehensive and community school teachers.  The number of retirees in 1997 was much greater than anticipated.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead E, running costs for comprehensive and community schools, a sum of £7.5 million is required for the same reason as I outlined for subhead A.1. It is to facilitate the change of date of the payment of the monthly salaries of community and comprehensive school teachers. The further £1.5 million sought arises from underestimation in the subhead in respect of the community <Col N="890" /> schools sector as a result of rationalisation.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.2 million is being sought under Subhead J, examination, because extra costs were incurred in the examinations branch of my Department due to the introduction of a range of enhancements to the security system, such as a track and trace system bar codes, new secure collection system.</P>
    <P>An additional £4.6 million is sought under Subhead L, building grants and capital costs for second level schools, to meet building grants and capital costs in respect of secondary, vocational, comprehensive and community schools.  An additional number of major projects were approved and added to the capital programme during the course of the year.  Many have now proceeded to construction and are incurring expenditure.</P>
    <P>A Supplementary Estimate of £2.5 million is being sought under Subhead M.5, receipts from the European Social Fund, due to reduced receipts in 1997 mainly arising from losses incurred as a result of unfavourable exchange rates between the ECU and the Irish pound.</P>
    <P>In Vote 29, third level and further education, a Supplementary Estimate of £107.150 million is required.  Under Subhead A.1 higher education grants, the additional requirement is £70 million. I am proposing to bring the recoupment of local authorities to a current year basis for which I am seeking a Supplementary Estimate of approximately £56 million.  I am also proposing to put local authorities in funds to enable them issue maintenance grant payments to students before the end of this year in respect of the second term. This will cost an additional £11.6 million.  A further £2.4 million is required under this subhead due to a shortfall in the 1997 provision for the local authorities expenditure in 1996.  This shortfall arose because of a greater than expected increase in the number of grant holders than was forecast when the Estimate was agreed.</P>
    <P>This major provision of £70 million represents the largest element of the Supplementary Estimates being sought today.  It arises because of consistent difficulties arising from the current system of reimbursing local authorities.  The most significant of these is the habitual delay in distributing grants to students.  With this adjustment to payment procedures, cashflow difficulties faced by local authorities would be overcome.  Henceforth, I expect them to be better placed to pay the vast majority of students their grants at the start of each term.  The steps I am taking to bring recoupment to local authorities onto a current basis will ensure that the Exchequer is not carrying a significant liability to local authorities at the end of each financial year.</P>
    <P>An additional £4 million is sought under Subhead A.4, grants to vocational education committees in respect of scholarships to students, for grants paid by vocational education committees while an additional £1.8 million is required under Subhead A.5 in respect of grants in support of <Col N="891" /> trainees on ESF aided programmes.  An additional £4.4 million is required for the Vote for the higher education grant under Subhead B.2.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead C, a Supplementary Estimate of £2 million is required in respect of the regional technical colleges and the institutes of technology while £1 million is required to meet the cost of providing additional student places to meet the skills shortages.  Similarly, an additional £10 million is sought under Subhead L.1 to provide extra places to meet the continuing increase in the demand for third level education, to provide for the skills shortages.  An additional £5 million is indicated to provide for the steps I took in July and the additional places in computer software and technician programmes we started this autumn.</P>
    <P>Under subhead L.2, an additional £4.25 million is sought to deal with the underestimation of a number of matters and the replacement of a site sold by the University of Limerick for industrial development purposes.  The sale of the site facilitated the creation of 400 jobs.  It also covers the final element of a £5 million capital investment for skills which I announced last July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did much work when he was in Opposition and produced many ideas.  He promised to be a reforming Minister. In view of this, today's Supplementary Estimates and the Estimates for 1998 are a sad reflection on what appears to have happened to him.  He has either been overwhelmed by managing the system or his commitment to deep seated reform was not as serious as we thought.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that in 1998 the primary education system must once again wait its turn.  The allocation of public money to the system will be far below the commitment to the third level education system.  When the capital sums provided through the various funds and the doctoring of the moneys in second and third level are accounted for it becomes apparent that third level will gain a considerable 22 per cent increase in spending, including capital and current, while primary level will have to survive on a mere 9 per cent, similar to second level.  As a result in 1998 we will spend £1,800 per pupil at primary level and £6,800 per pupil at third level.</P>
      <P>There are reasons third level education is more expensive.  The basic issue is that the education system has failed 21 per cent of our children, the root cause being in the primary phase.  In the Estimates, the discretionary funds available in 1998, leaving aside teachers pay which is committed, for the three sectors of education will be an additional £34 million. A sum of £6 million will go to primary education, which works out at £13 extra per primary pupil; £10 million to second level, £27 extra per pupil and £18 million to third level, or £152 extra per pupil.  Clearly there will be no assault on the fundamental problems in the primary system on the basis of £13 extra per pupil in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> The INTO and others have expressed their bitter disappointment at the capitation increases which will amount to only £5 at a time when the Minister had given an indication that the gap with secondary education would be closed.  If there is to be an assault on disadvantage this year it will have to come from the demographic dividend. With 12,000 fewer primary pupils in the system we should have a dividend of about 500 teachers to be allocated for the academic year.  It is crucial that this be channelled into Breaking the Cycle initiative and the Early Start initiative, those highly targeted as disadvantage.  The Minister should immediately commence negotiation with the education partners to ensures he delivers on that commitment.  He will have to renege on his commitment in his manifesto to keep the teachers in the schools.  That commitment was nonsense if we are to confront disadvantage.</P>
    <P>We must look seriously at problems in second level education.  The fortnightly pay is welcome but it will not happen until 1 January 1999.  There was no need to bring forward this money in 1997. Teachers will not see any benefit from this decision, which is purely cooking the books.  The extra cost of fortnightly pay is £16 million which fell to be paid in 1998, not in 1997.  This is cooking the books and has nothing to do with a commitment which secondary teachers will welcome.</P>
    <P>There is no apparent provision to allow the development in in-school management structure in secondary schools.  For the second year running there is no provision for capitation.  The freezing of the capitation means that where voluntary schools previously raised 20 per cent of their moneys privately they will now have to raise 30 per cent privately.  That will create hardship for many parents.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing there is no evidence of any of the key reform initiatives the Minister advocated in Opposition.  No resources have been provided for the psychological service, caretakers and secretarial assistants, in-service training &mdash; instead there is a 14 per cent cut &mdash; pre-schools &mdash; a pledge in the programme for Government &mdash; or intensive anti-drugs initiatives, another commitment the Minister made with great flurry.  The provision for child care assistants and special services for children in care suggests they will not benefit from the extra money available to education.</P>
    <P>Having come from the industrial sphere I shall deal with in-service training.  We are providing £7.4 million, a drop of 14 per cent, and another £3 million for IT which I welcome.  The total, £10.5 million, represents 0.7 per cent of the payroll in the primary, secondary and further education. The Minister is on record as having advocated to industry that they should be spending at least 5 per cent of their payroll on training initiatives.  He is lecturing industry and business generally about the need to commit to lifelong learning.  In his own area of teacher-training, for the resourcing of teachers to adjust to the needs of the future, he is providing a derisory 0.5 per cent.  That is <Col N="893" /> ridiculous and the Minister will have to look seriously at it, given the new primary curriculum in the offing and a major reinvention of systems and procedures to be undertaken by teachers at primary level.</P>
    <P>The IT area is crucial and the Minister has rightly highlighted this.  However, he does not realise the yawning gap that exists.  The average in Ireland is one computer for every 73 pupils, 100 in primary level and 33 in second level.  The UK has a ratio of 9:1, Sweden 10:1 and Finland 16:1.  Those countries are investing heavily.  For example, the five year commitment of most of those countries is to achieve the Council of Europe ratio of ten pupils for every computer. The Minister's commitments will mean that at the end of a period we will probably have a ratio of 30:1 and be still at the bottom of the third division in terms of IT in schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister is hoping to train about 40 per cent of teachers over the next five years.  Contrast that with Japan which plans by the end of 1999 to have 100 per cent of its teachers trained in the use of IT in the classroom.  We will fall behind and the Minister's correct instinct to make us one of the leading countries in this area will be bitterly disappointed given that his Department has not seriously addressed the analysis in the steering committee on the information society which showed the extent of our problems and the need to address them.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the third level sector.  The whole area of regional technical college upgrades is a shambles.  Ministers on the Front Benches are trying to seek political kudos for announcing, ahead of the posse, that a particular institution will be an institute of technology and will have no truck with any national institute.  We have heard all of this from the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke.  The Minister joined in the unseemly scramble to buy political credit in his own backyard of Cork.  It makes a nonsense of setting up an independent system of evaluation in these colleges if Ministers treat the system with such derision.  We are trying to persuade the partners in education to take seriously the issue of excellence in education, to change the way they do things, to look at their performance and upgrade.  How can they take that seriously when Ministers are playing political football with standards in the education system at third level and in the regional technical college sector, in particular. Many people are scandalised by what is going on but may be too polite to say so.  There is a serious need for the Minister to wake up to the problem.</P>
    <P>The higher education grants is the cover up of the century.  The Minister made his most innovative commitments in this area.  We were to have third level grants for PLC students, increased maintenance levels, increases in the income thresholds, a better deal for large families, better postgraduate provision, a concession for dependent children and mature students and access to grants <Col N="894" /> for part time students but not a penny has been provided to honour these commitments.  Clearly, those most affected are the PLC students who are drawn predominately from middle of the road to low income backgrounds.  In stark contrast to their brethern who go to regional technical colleges or higher education they receive no maintenance support.  This commitment should have been honoured in the Estimates.  Equally there should have been progress on the other commitments. This is a bitter disappointment and many will rue the day the Minister was so enthusiastic about this.  On his first opportunity to do something about it he did nothing.</P>
    <P>I wish to address briefly the £250 million fund. The extra investment in this area is welcome. However, a number of matters make me uneasy about it.  It is a three year programme only.  The Minister sees no prospect of this fund being extended beyond three years and there is no provision for further development.  The Bill provides that the money to go into this fund from the Exchequer will not accumulate in the fund, rather the Minister for Finance will grab back the investment yield from the fund.  It is not a fund in any sense.  The Bill provides no procedure for consulting with industry on the use of this fund, which is a grave oversight.</P>
    <P>We need a more coherent framework to identify, analyse and prioritise future investment needs.  The reports produced for the Department indicate investment needs of £750 million, including £185 million for information technology almost £400 million for third level, £50 million for equipment and £60 million for research and development.</P>
    <P>In his first term test the Minister has scored E minus.  I look forward to the day when he pushes himself up the grades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £175,950,000 is required in these Supplementary Estimates.  That is a substantial sum in anybody's language.  While a large proportion arises out of the PCW, there are a number of elements on which I seek clarification. Under the heading of first level education an additional sum of £500,000 is required under subhead F1 &mdash; other grants and services &mdash; although the Minister mentioned a figure of £400,000.  That substantial sum is required for the rent of temporary school premises.  The original Estimate was £9.6 million.  The Minister indicated that Gaelscoileanna would have a large impact but against a background of declining enrolments in national schools is the taxpayer getting best value for money?  It appears that substantial amounts are being used to rent temporary accommodation at a time when there is considerable vacant classroom space available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional sum of £6.5 million is required under subhead K1 &mdash; building, equipment and furnishing of national schools.  Which schools will benefit from this allocation?  In the era of transparency and accountability we should be given <Col N="895" /> more detail of where money is spent, rather than round figures.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of second level and further education an additional sum of £4.6 million is required on the capital side which is broken down as follows: secondary schools, £1.7 million; vocational schools, £1.7 million, and comprehensive and community schools, £1.2 million.  Which projects will benefit from this allocation?  Again, we need more detail before we can agree to the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of third level and further education an additional sum of £70 million is required under subhead A1 &mdash; higher education grants &mdash; for recoupment to local authorities in respect of expenditure incurred by them in l996 and l997.  While I accept that the purpose is to make payments on a current year basis, how is it that moneys are still outstanding in respect of l996?  Are the local authorities not claiming moneys due?</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £2 million is required under subhead C &mdash; grants in respect of the running costs of regional technical colleges, the institutes of technology and certain vocational education committee colleges.  Which colleges will benefit from this allocation which is substantial and why?</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £4.25 million is required under subhead A2 &mdash; An tÚdarás um Ard Oideachas &mdash; for building grants and capital costs for universities and colleges and designated institutions of higher education &mdash; grant-in-aid.  The additional sums required for the various institutions are listed.  A larger sum, £10.7 million, is required under subhead L1 &mdash; building grants and capital costs of regional technical colleges, the institutes of technology and certain vocational education committee colleges &mdash; but the additional sums required for the various institutions are not listed.  For what purpose is this allocation required and which colleges will benefit?</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor abolished third level fees.  When in Opposition the Minister made many grandiose commitments which appear to have been forgotten and abandoned.  What is the position on maintenance grants?  Will improvements be made?  The income limits should be based on net rather than gross income.  Unless I am missing something no provision is made for improvements in the Estimates.  Children in university cities have an advantage when it comes to attending college.  There is a barrier in terms of equality of access.  The Minister indicated that he would address this issue and he should show us what he can do.</P>
    <P>On the primary school capitation grant, £5 is available per pupil.  This runs contrary to the commitments made by the Minister's party in the run-up to the general election.  I received correspondence today indicating the disappointment felt in my area at management, teacher and parent level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> I tabled parliamentary questions inquiring about ESF-funded CERT courses run by regional technical colleges and I was dumb-struck when I was told that the information was not available.  Having been informed that there is a high failure rate in relation to these courses, which disturbed me considerably, I decided to seek information on the position.  However, the information was not available. How does the Department order and conduct its business since very substantial funds are being committed to these courses, yet the Department, through the Minister, admits it does not know what is happening.  I ask the Minister to address that issue when replying.</P>

      <P>I take a slightly different view of the Minister's grading from that of Deputy Richard Bruton.  I would classify him as being A1 which, coming from Cork, I suppose is only to be expected.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment. He is a reforming Minister who, over the past five months, has brought great ideas into his Department and demonstrated great confidence in the performance of his task.</P>
      <P>One aspect of the Estimates for his Department on which I should like to comment is that of higher education grants.  Three members of my family attended college and, having listened to their stories, I am fully aware of what it is like to be attending college while awaiting payment of these grants.  Therefore, I am particularly delighted that their payment will be speeded up.</P>
      <P>There is also an allocation for school transport services within these Estimates.  Members will be familiar with the problems pertaining to these transport services, particularly in the provision of transport for those with mental or physical disabilities. This allocation is especially welcome since these students are the most vulnerable within our society.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the additional £26 million to enable secondary teachers have their monthly salaries paid at the end of each month and to facilitate the introduction of fortnightly pay in their case in the latter part of 1998.</P>
      <P>Education is one of the most important Government Departments.  Its teachers are charged with laying the foundations of young people's expectations and experiences.  Most young people are introduced to computer technology at a very young age, almost from infancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly recommend that the subject of civics be included ever more frequently in the schools curricula at primary and second level.  It is vital that all young people have a grasp of how their country is governed, economy managed and so on.  In the secondary school at Bothar Bruí in <Col N="897" /> County Cork, in the course of the presidential election, the principal and vice-principal decided to run a mock election campaign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They did, but it took almost two weeks of talking to those pupils to explain the workings of proportional representation. Many people were called on to explain the system as some pupils of 17 and 18 years did not understand its workings.  The subject of civics should be included in the schools curricula to ensure young people understand the workings of all arms of Government.</P>

      <P>Like other Members, I am one of those who spent the past 30 years at the chalk face, 12 of which were spent in the policy area. Consequently I have some interest in this debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been a breath of fresh air &mdash; one who listens and acts &mdash; since moving into his Department.  It is indeed gratifying that we teachers feel that the Department is headed by a Minister who understands our needs and yet does not lecture us on what our roles ought to be.</P>
      <P>I welcome the significant increases being allocated in these Votes across a range of subheads. I particularly welcome the Minister's decision this week to abolish fees for the junior and leaving certificates, a very significant step.  Many Members will be aware that we teachers attended many an IVEA conference at which this was called for.  Indeed Members opposite who talk about what has not been done should remember that they were in office for the past four and a half years and did precious little in that regard despite the many calls for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the provision for post-leaving certificate courses, may I remind those who criticise the perceived inaction of Government that the last occasion on which fees were removed from PLC courses was when Deputy Mary O'Rourke was Minister for Education and that an investment of approximately £20 million is being made in PLC courses this year.  I have no doubt that, over the lifetime of this Government, they will be given further support.  I should like to see further education placed on a more secure financial footing.  Many of the skills shortages the Minister has identified are being addressed by some excellent PLC courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the increased capitation grants provided for in the Supplementary Estimates. In my 30 years teaching in the primary sector &mdash; Deputy Brian O'Shea was one year ahead of me in college &mdash; it always struck me as odd that a sixth class student who merited a capitation grant of £45 while attending primary school on progressing to post-primary, qualified for a grant <Col N="898" /> of £177.  Some mechanism must be devised to ensure greater equity between the two.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased provision for caretakers and secretarial assistants.  I arrived at school at 8.15 a.m. over many years to open the gates, ensure a sufficiency of items like chalk, toilet rolls and so on.  While not menial tasks, they should not be the responsibility of fairly well paid professionals whose time should be devoted more properly to other core issues.</P>
    <P>I am delighted at the Minister's innovative, creative action in making information technology available in all schools.  I know of many a school with one computer it may have acquired through Superclub points which may be out of date.  I commend the many parents who have worked long and hard to raise funds for the purchase of computers for schools.  It is vital that, at first and second levels, there be adequate investment in information technology.</P>
    <P>On the matter of school buildings we must endeavour to veer away from temporary classrooms or renting accommodation.  That is counterproductive.  In Coláiste Ide in Finglas in my constituency there are prefabricated buildings now 30 years old long past the stage at which they should have been replaced.  I hope that issue will be addressed in the lifetime of this Government. I also welcome the provision for child care assistants to aid the integration of children with special needs into the mainstream education system.  I am not certain about the level of need throughout the country but almost every constituency makes a request on a weekly basis for a child care assistant to be provided for a child with special needs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the setting up of a planning group for the regional technical college in Blanchardstown which will significantly improve technology education in that area.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward an expansive Estimate.</P>

      <P>As everyone else has declared an interest in this matter I suppose I should declare mine.  I left the education system only two months ago, although I continue to dabble in it. I am disappointed with the Minister's Estimates which provide a mere 2 per cent increase in the provision for school transport.  As the Minister is aware, the report on school transport will be published before the end of the year and I am disappointed that he has provided for an increase that is only in line with inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard of school transport is very poor. Young people, particularly second level students, are being transported to and from school in deplorable conditions.  I cannot understand how some of these buses have passed the Department of the Environment's road worthiness test.  I do not understand how the Minister can expect <Col N="899" /> young people to spend three hours or more per day waiting on school transport.  Many of these students carry school bags weighing 17 lbs.  or more, over 20 per cent of their body weight.  I am aware the Minister is examining this issue but the long waiting times for school transport, the weight of school bags and the worry of examinations is putting extreme pressure on young people.</P>
    <P>The regulations covering this area date back to the 1960s.  Why has the Minister of State not published the report on school transport which has been lying on his desk for some months?  It is ridiculous to expect three second level students to share a seat suitable for two people.  One seat per pupil is the least that can be expected from the school transport system.  Some students are forced to sit in the aisles, carrying their heavy bags, and if an accident occurs they are in danger of being thrown through the windscreen.  Students sitting in the aisles are a distraction for the bus driver who must control the young people as well as concentrate on driving the vehicle.</P>
    <P>There is severe overcrowding on school buses and we should consider providing seat belts on buses used to carry primary level students.  The accident in Chapelizod earlier this month could have had serious consequences were it not for the exceptional skill of the driver.  There is an urgent need for a safety system on these buses.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is examining safety standards on school buses.  Has the Minister of State made any suggestions to his colleague regarding these measures?  Has he made any provision regarding school transport?  His senior colleague has not made any provision in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Some school buses have been in operation for more than 30 years and are in a bad condition. Fumes leak into the bus, roofs leak, windows are broken and some buses have unsafe headlights. There are serious problems also in regard to students with special needs.  They should be collected from home and should not be expected to travel ten or 15 miles to meet a school bus.  I know of a 16 year old girl who is driven 16 miles to and from school every day by her parents.  That should not happen.  The Minister is not making provision for these students.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on the decisions he has made involving a number of cases but it will be difficult for him to continue this process if he is not given adequate resources. School vehicles must be made wheelchair accessible.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will revise the catchment areas because serious questions arise in that regard.  I am aware of a case where because part of the catchment area was the wrong side of the Shannon students had to get a boat to meet the school bus.  That is ridiculous in this day and age. Some catchment areas must be redrawn because this issue is becoming a joke.  The catchment areas were redrawn in the early 1960s and they <Col N="900" /> must be revised.  It is unfortunate that the Minister has not made provision in the Estimates for the report which the Taoiseach told us will be published before Christmas.</P>
    <P>The regulations on school transport are supposed to ensure that our school transport system is safe and efficient but it is currently legal to expose students to high accident risk by not providing them with sufficient seating and proper buses on which to travel.</P>
    <P>On adult education, the Minister spoke of computer programmes which are to be welcomed, but if some people cannot read or write how can we train them to use computers?  Approximately 25 per cent of the adult population cannot read and that must be taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Education and Science on 7 November on the setting up of the education technology fund which may be regarded as an historic decision to reach out for a leadership role in the international educational scene, thus making Ireland the obvious place for inward investment in new technologies and positioning local companies for a leap forward. This is only the beginning.  Research and development will be crucial in the years ahead. The fund covers many worthwhile areas and should assist many sectors.  Additional funds will be needed, particularly from small companies with access to colleges.</P>
      <P>The regional technical colleges, particularly Sligo, need to be examined in a geographical and regional setting and in the context of the development of the west.  The first initiative should be to change the name to that of institute of technology. The House must realise that north of a line from Dublin to Galway there is no third level institute of technology and this is clearly an impediment to industrial expansion such as we have seen in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. The IDA, Forbairt and other agencies agree that the existence of a third level institute enhances the likelihood of a major development and new start-up projects.  It is imperative, therefore, that the decision to change the name is taken now.</P>
      <P>The skills shortages that have been identified are in the areas of third level computer software, engineering and technology graduates.  People are needed at both technician and graduate levels. The regional technical college in Sligo currently has plans for an engineering block on the drawing board awaiting funding.  A total of £1 million has been allocated to this project from INTERREG funding and we hope the Minister will sanction the balance required.  This project will strengthen the college's ability to provide additional graduates and technicians in mechanical, electrical and computing disciplines.  If technology status is given to the regional technical college in Sligo it will greatly enhance employment prospects in the west which is urgently needed.  I ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing time with me.  The Minister has been marked at both extremes of grades today, from an A to an E minus, but I will give him a D minus with the comment that he must do better.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that primary education is the foundation on which our education system is balanced.  We must have sound education at primary level for all pupils.  I welcome the aspects of the Estimates which recognise that principle but I ask the Minister to make available remedial facilities as a priority to every national school, either on a shared or group basis.  Where assessments have been carried out, it is important that we provide this facility.  Yesterday's report revealed the level of absenteeism in certain national schools in this urban area.  Students who miss out on education because they are forced to leave school at an early age tend to become involved in crime and cause problems in other areas in later years, which require more money to address.  If the Minister secured necessary resources from his Cabinet colleagues and invested them in education at the basic level, many of our problems would be resolved.  I implore the Minister to provide a resource and remedial service to all national schools.  We would make progress if such a service were provided.</P>
      <P>There is no recognition of the role of the inspectorate in education.  Have we abandoned inspectors or are we waiting for them to die off? There were plans to provide for a vibrant inspectorate in a previous plan in the context of the education boards, but although they appear to have been abolished I note £50,000 has been allocated for them in the Estimates.  The Minister might clarify the position.  There is a place for a vibrant inspectorate in the Department of Education. That area is not catered for.  It does not have sufficient personnel.  Subjects such as PE should be given greater recognition in the education system.  There is only one inspector in that area at national level.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to comment on the eligibility of private colleges for free fees.  Why should Aer Rianta have to run an institution like the hotel and management college in Shannon?  It is a fine operation and its courses are recognised worldwide.  Students at that institution as well as other private colleges should be recognised as eligible for free fees.</P>

The abridged volume is the first step in the Estimates process, the following step is the budget and the next is the Revised Estimates. Deputy Bruton was somewhat premature in his comments on the 1998 Estimates and what we intend to do. He has some political neck to lecture me on a number of initiatives we have undertaken. We are either for or against paying secondary school teachers on a fortnightly basis.  I took the initiative to do something about that now.</P>

      <P>It is important that local authorities should not be in arrears on the payment of third level grants as was the case in the past and that students should receive their grants on time.  That has been achieved under this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton attacked our position on primary education.  He has some nerve to do that because this Supplementary Estimate provides funding for the retention of 300 teachers as part of the demographic dividend, for which the former Government did not provide a penny in the 1997 Estimate.

      <P>The 1997 Estimate for capital funding of primary school buildings was £27 million. I provided £40 million for that in the 1998 Estimate, which represents a major increase on the 1997 allocation.  The former Government did not provide a penny for IT School 2000.  When I became Minister there was not a full-time official dealing with that agenda.  There was no co-ordination on policy and very little was happening. We changed that.  We set up the National Centre for Technology in Education, created the investment in technology fund which includes £25 million in capital alone and for the first time ever in the 1998 Estimates we provided a subhead for current costs relating to that programme of £3 million.  By any stretch of the imagination actions speak louder than words.  We have heard a good deal of rhetoric in the past two years about IT in schools, regional technical colleges and the technological sector, but that was not followed up by any action.  Since I became Minister in July the Government decided to act on these outstanding issues and it has acted very effectively.</P>

      <P>I will deal with one of the largest expenditure areas.  If the Minister for Education stays in the House he will be glad to note that I will focus legitimately on next year's expenditure and he might take note of the questions I will pose.  I note it is the habit of members of the Government not to provide answers to questions but to hector Opposition Deputies on the wonderful service they have provided to date. However, there is little evidence of that in any area.  In less than 48 hours two Ministers have told us how wonderful they are, but there is scant evidence of practical results.</P>
      <P>Time does not permit me to deal with all the aspects of an Estimate of more than £1 billion for the environment and local government.  We will have an opportunity to deal with the Estimates in detail in a special committee next year, but I want to address two areas in particular, local government funding and the funding of non-national roads, and one or two minor areas of which I hope the Minister will take note.  Local government funding has been one of the most difficult, talked about and essential political issues of recent decades.  All the parties in this House over a number of years have paid lip service to their commitment to reinvigorate local government and to give real power to local authorities to enable them shape their local areas and to provide them not only with the structures and mechanisms to do that but with an adequate funding base.  In my time in the Department of the Environment I worked hard to fulfil that objective.  We produced what is colloquially known as the purple book, a comprehensive review programme for local government.</P>
      <P>Thankfully and appropriately most of the contents of the book have been accepted by the new Administration.  However, there is still total confusion about local government funding.  I tabled specific questions to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government about this matter yesterday.  He blustered for months about the marvellous reform package he intended to introduce, which included a new local government fund and a percentage of national taxation devoted exclusively to the local government system. The Minister spoke disparagingly about the plans I introduced which were enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas to fund local government through a ringfenced system of motor taxation.</P>
      <P>The Minister told the House yesterday that his plans have run aground and the Bill which was promised before Christmas will not arrive before Santa Claus.  It will not arrive before Santa Claus next year either because the revised date for the enactment of the legislation is 1 January 1999. That will be a crowded year given the increasing number of reports and surveys which are being put on the long finger by the Government.  There is no sense of longevity about the Government. It obviously thinks it can clear the decks for next year and leave all the thorny issues for the new Administration in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> It is incumbent on the Minister to explain in detail how local government will be funded next year.  A ringfenced pool of money is available under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997.  However, local authorities have not yet been told how much they will receive.  Individual authorities do not know if the equalisation mechanism I established in that Act will be implemented because the Minister has promised to repeal the legislation.  Local government is expected to strike a rate and figure out its works programme for next year in complete darkness.  This is unacceptable.  If there is any respect for the local government system, a clear funding mechanism should be outlined.  This should be a fair system which will enable every local authority to know exactly where it stands for the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, to refer three basic questions to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  How much, specifically, will each local authority receive?  When will the dividend from the ringfenced motor taxation fund be distributed? What mechanisms will be put in place for equalisation?</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for the Environment I established a non-national roads restoration fund because the crisis in terms of rural dwellers and potholed roads has become a depressing cliché for anybody who must traverse them.  In the last two years the huge sum of approximately £220 million between State grants and local authority moneys was earmarked for this area.  Will the Minister for the Environment and Local Government assure the House that this fund will be retained and allocated in plenty of time to ensure repair work on flood damaged roads can begin? There are many such roads at present, particularly in the sunny south-east where routes have taken a battering since August.  The south-east is flooded again today and the damage caused by the water on national and non-national roads needs to be addressed by a special fund.  I ask the Minister for Science and Technology, Deputy Martin, to bring to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the need to set aside an emergency fund to repair the damage caused by flood waters and other natural disasters.</P>
    <P>I note with amusement that the allocation in the Book of Estimates under administration for consultancy services will increase by 54 per cent next year.  When the Minister for the Environment and Local Government was in Opposition he lambasted anybody who had an adviser or consultant of any description.  He thought the then Government was outlandish in its expenditure on consultants.  However, the Estimates show a proposed increase of 4 per cent for general administration and that consultancy fees for the Minister will increase by 54 per cent.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the other Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats office holders have <Col N="906" /> changed their attitudes remarkably since they went into Government.</P>
    <P>The issue of fire services is most important. Alarm bells rang at a recent conference of fire service chiefs regarding the decrepit state of some of the fire appliances.  The Estimates show a proposed increase next year of 8 per cent and I ask the Minister to reconsider the allocation to the fire services in the context of the budget.  A significant capital injection is required because although money has been spent on fire stations, appliances have not been brought up to standard. Local authorities are increasingly buying second-hand appliances, which are almost clapped out, from abroad.</P>

      <P>This matter needs to be addressed and I hope the Minister will take it on board.</P>
      <P>The Cinderella area of library services is most important.  The Minister for Education and Science has a specific regard for this sector which is funded entirely by the national lottery.  Only £3 million will be available next year in support of the capital works for library services in every county.  There are huge demands for refurbishment works on libraries throughout the country, not just in the Dublin hinterland where there is a crying need.  It is a priority area in which national lottery money could be spent.  I hope the Minister will bring my remarks to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with the Estimates relating to the Department of Health and Children which must be viewed in the context of a number of different factors.  First, the level of expenditure on health and childcare services in Ireland is low relative to the quality of services our European neighbours enjoy.  Much catching up needs to be done to bring our services up to a level comparable to that in other European countries. Second, there is a growing expectation on the public's part of a greater range of better quality services because of our economic prosperity. Whatever about other harder times, at this point the public does not accept there is any excuse for inadequacies in health services.</P>
      <P>Third, there is real growth in the demand for drug treatment, childcare and family support services and, most spectacularly, for services for the elderly because it is becoming the norm for people to live well into their eighties and even into their nineties.  A fourth important factor in relation to health expenditure is the significant level of inflation in healthcare.  This is probably about 3 percentage points ahead of general inflation levels.  The fifth factor is that the Estimates do not take account of the significant growth in population in some parts of the country, particularly the Eastern Health Board region.</P>

    <P>In this context the proposed expenditure is disappointing. While on the surface a 6 per cent <Col N="907" /> increase in the allocation to health boards may appear reasonable, there are already a number of different expenditure commitments, particularly the pay increases which are already agreed.  Such commitments will eat significantly into that increase.  For example, the impact of the full year cost of the Partnership 2000 agreement must be considered because it will account for at least 1 per cent of the 6 per cent increase.  In addition, other pay increases are expected to be awarded in the health services and these will eat further into the increase.  Health boards have not yet been informed of their full allocation for 1998.  I hope the increase will be based on the full year costs.  If that is not the case, it will involve a further reduction in the proposed increase.  All this means there will be little scope for the much needed expansion of many health services.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to what I believe are the priority areas for spending in the coming year. We are familiar with the searing service pressures in many acute hospitals and there is an urgent need to proceed with a major waiting list initiative in this area.  Sadly, this is a life and death issue for many people because waiting lists are growing and this has a negative impact on the quality of life for thousands of people.  The need to increase the number of downstream facilities for the elderly and young chronic disabled is related to this. In addition, there is an urgent and chronic need for extra places in the mental handicapped services and for the physically disabled.  The outstanding deficits in funding levels for voluntary agencies should be addressed.  Services for people who are currently inappropriately placed should be developed, in particular, the several hundred patients in St. Ita's, Portrane, whose plight was highlighted recently in the media and which is a cause for concern and embarrassment to all involved in policy and decision making.  The situation there is a disgrace and needs urgent attention so that appropriate facilities can be provided for patients.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for additional funding to meet the continuing demands for child care services which are growing in many health board areas.  A strong case can be made as the return on expenditure in this area is far greater than the huge expenditure in the proposed prison programme. There is an undoubted case for early intervention and prevention services in order to avoid problems later in life in terms of involvement in crime, drug abuse and so on.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity to significantly increase services for drug users to deal with addiction and special care problems associated with the misuse of drugs.  There must be a continued development of mental health services in the community and hospitals.  The change from institutional based care to the community requires beefing up in terms of providing the necessary community based services.  A great number of existing facilities are in urgent need of upgrading and new services and facilities are required in urban regions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> It is essential the need to upgrade and modernise existing services in hospitals and health care services is borne in mind.</P>

      <P>I will outline the principal features of our economic performance since 1977. Gross national product growth has averaged 5 per cent over that period and is twice the European Union average.  Employment increased by an average of 1.7 per cent per year compared to 0.3 per cent in the EU and 1 per cent in the OECD. Unemployment has fallen from 18 per cent in 1987 to a projected figure of 10.25 per cent for 1997 whereas it has increased in the EU and OECD.  Inflation has averaged 2.7 per cent compared with an average of 3.9 per cent in the EU and the OECD average of 4.8 per cent.  Our strong economic performance was underpinned by disciplined fiscal policies.</P>
      <P>Since 1987 the general Government deficit has been reduced from 8.6 per cent of GDP to 1.5 per cent this year and the general Government debt/GDP ratio was 116 per cent in 1987, 76 per cent in 1996 and is projected at 70 per cent in 1997.  During those years the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, PESP and PCW were negotiated by Fianna Fáil led Governments and a broad policy stance since 1987 is bearing fruit in spectacular fashion in an interdependent combination of moderate price and wage inflation, improvements in take home pay, budgetary credibility and maximum stability in currency.  It was always clear that the full benefits of this integrated policy to which social partnership has been crucial would take time to feed through.</P>
      <P>Our patience has now been rewarded and this is evident in our recent employment growth.  A crucial element in the fruits of growth has been significantly increased employment.  It is estimated it will increase by 52,000 in 1997 and this is having an impact on unemployment.  The 1997 Labour Force Survey shows there was a fall of 20,000 in unemployment in the 12 months to April 1997 and it is encouraging that long-term unemployment is falling faster than short-term unemployment.  Since 1993 there has been a drop of 39,000 in long-term unemployed, two thirds of the fall in unemployment over that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the national programmes there has been a significant benefit in regard to take home pay from 1987-88 to 1996-97.  The average tax rate for a single person in 1987-88 was 36 per cent and it was 26 per cent for a married couple with two children.  In 1996-97 the average tax rate for a single person is less than 29 per cent and is 22 per cent for a married couple with two children. The tax wedge for a single person in 1987-98 was 43 per cent and 34 per cent for a married couple with two children.  The equivalent in 1996-97 for a single person is 36 per cent and 30 per <Col N="909" /> cent for a married couple with two children.  The take home pay increase for those years for a single person was a nominal rate of 55 per cent and a real increase of 23 per cent and for a married couple with two children a nominal increase of 48 per cent and a real increase of 17 per cent.  These are the results of the policies, decisions and controls which were started in 1987.</P>
    <P>A further aim of the budgets since then has been to encourage the development of enterprise in order to generate employment.  Measures to this end have included a low rate of employer's PRSI which was introduced at 9 per cent for low wage employees and reduced further to 8.5 per cent which applied to people with an income threshold between £173 and £250.  The primary rate of employer's PRSI was also reduced from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent while the standard rate of corporation tax was reduced from 40 per cent to 38 per cent to 36 per cent and in regard to the first £50,000 profit from 30 per cent on 1 April 1996 to 28 per cent in 1997.  These reductions have been achieved while facilitating increases in social services expenditures which is every bit as important as straightening the economy. We must also ensure those dependent on social services get the benefit of growth and improvement in the economy.  Members of the Opposition criticised the Government's expenditure policies.  Prior to the election we said that we would control public expenditure and indicated how we would do so over the next five years, and the people voted us into Government.  In our programme for Government we stated that we would limit growth in net current expenditure to 4 per cent.  On the basis of the figures in the abridged Estimates, the total increase in current and capital expenditure in 1998 over 1997 is 3.5 per cent. We are keeping our promise made prior to the election, because it is essential that budgetary policy remain on track, that consensus remain strong and that significant investment be made to support future development.  We must continue in that vein to ensure continued growth, employment, reductions in taxation, jobs for our young people leaving universities, institutes and regional technical colleges and the possibility of a return to the workplace for those who are long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, when he said that if the Government's expenditure plans did not strike the right balance between the requirements of budgetary policy and the need to meet social and economic priorities, it would be all the more difficult to sustain and maintain the progress of recent years.  The policies being pursued by the Government are aimed at maintaining and sustaining the progress commenced when we were in Government in 1987 and brought the country out of the morass in which it then was.</P>
    <P>In May 1997 the Minister of State at the Department of Education at the time committed up to £9 million for sport from lottery funding, money he did not have and had no chance of getting <Col N="910" /> for the next couple of years.  That was political opportunism at its worst on the part of a Minister and a Government that long preached righteousness to the rest of us.  Because this money is not available, people looking for grant aid for various projects will not be able to avail of them in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased funding for rural environmental protection.  The REPS is a very important programme for environmental protection. It has been taken up substantially by farmers and will be more so in the years ahead.  It is an important aid to farmers in carrying out works to ensure that the environment is treated in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme has also been helpful in increasing local employment.  The Minister has seen fit to increase the allocation to the Leader programme and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister for Finance to look at the special resort tax scheme.  Some of the areas that stand to benefit will be in trouble if the scheme is abolished at the end of next year because they had problems with planning permission and getting their schemes off the ground. This scheme has enlivened many towns that are availing of it, but the full benefit cannot be obtained.  It is therefore important that the Minister examine it in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Housing is of great importance, and there has been progress in that area in recent years.  I am glad the Minister has increased the allocation by almost 14 per cent in the Estimates.  There is a great demand for housing in my constituency and it is important to provide suitable accommodation for all our people, for married couples, single parents and the elderly.  I welcome the Minister's decision to put significant funding into housing over the next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, faces a difficult challenge in putting together the Estimate for 1988 in that he must control public expenditure while simultaneously the public want to feel the benefits of the Celtic tiger.  Everybody wants to ensure a fair distribution of largesse and an attempt to help the less well off.  No system has been perfectly successful in that regard.  Perhaps none ever will be.  Nevertheless it is important that we continue to aspire to ensuring as much fair play as possible.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the country will manage about 7 per cent growth in 1997 against a backdrop of inflation of less than 2 per cent.  That would have seemed impossible ten years ago.  It proves that prudence in fiscal matters has had a payoff for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also encouraging figures on the labour force front, although they do not get much attention or praise from the media.  For example, the labour force will increase by 37,000.  Simultaneously jobs will increase by 52,000, which is 4 per cent.  The number of long-term unemployed will drop by 17,000 in 1997.  If that could be sustained over a number of years, it would be a <Col N="911" /> superb performance.  Since 1993 the number of long-term unemployed has dropped by 39,000, on average 10,000 a year.  That is not a bad performance. It is ironic that the success of the economy is driving up demands.  We all have our own pet projects for which we want funding, and the Minister has a difficult job trying to juggle them together.  In these circumstances proposals for such projects as the proposed new Oireachtas building which was announced recently get negative publicity and are set against the need for capital allocation, to health, education etc.</P>
    <P>The arts programme which has been given an increase to complete what is required in the programme is also getting negative media responses in the context of other needs.  That is patently unfair and unjustified, and we should be prepared to stand up and be counted when it comes to such necessary expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the new budget date has forced people to come up with these Estimates within an impossible timetable. Nevertheless, it has been achieved. This will make it easier for Departments and agencies to live within their budgets.  I am glad the Minister remains committed to multi-annual budgeting.  Although there is no reference to it, emphasis is placed on ensuring value for money within certain Departments.</P>
    <P>The estimated outturn for l997 and the capital expenditure figures are very encouraging, with an overrun of £42 million compared to an estimate of £1,576 million.  This is better than most people anticipated.  The level of expenditure on current supply services is not outrageous.</P>
    <P>I referred previously to the need to improve the accommodation available in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Members must recognise that the job we do in the Houses of Parliament costs money.  Deputies and Senators have been too apologetic about the finance required to provide the necessary accommodation which will enable them to do their job properly.  Many people do not know that some Members have to cross the road to get to their offices.  Apart from the traffic problems, it can be difficult for Members to pass the many groups who protest outside the Kildare Street gates.  There is no reason the national parliament in a democratic state should not make a reasonable attempt to accommodate its Members on campus.</P>
    <P>The nature and extent of the workload of Members has changed dramatically even during my five years as a Deputy.  The level of secretarial back-up available to most Members is totally inadequate.  As a result people have to work under stress.  I do not suppose the public will be too sympathetic about this.  The inadequacies also have a detrimental effect on the quality of work carried out by elected Members of Parliament on behalf of their constituents and the nation. Members cannot carry out their job properly in the present conditions.  This applies to equipment etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Mayo</i>): I welcome the opportunity to refer to the Estimate for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  One of the major blunders by the Government in setting up its ministries was to put the Department for Equality and Law Reform under the umbrella of the Department of Justice.  Of all the success stories of the previous Administration, the work carried out by Mervyn Taylor as Minister for Equality and Law Reform was unique.  He was a pioneer in his own right.  He had an agenda and he followed it.  All one has to do is look at the raft of reforming legislation introduced by him to see that he broke new ground and achieved a tremendous amount in areas where there had been no previous political involvement.  However, this was only the beginning.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that equality and law reform issues will become the Cinderella of the Department of Justice and that the issues pioneered by Mervyn Taylor will be lost.  I am also concerned that the reforming zeal left in the battered Minister for Justice will be thwarted by the almost natural constrictive and restrictive attitude of officials in the Department of Justice.  This is a totally unnatural marriage.  The Taoiseach should look at what happened to the dynamism of Mervyn Taylor and the various projects launched by him and rethink this amalgamation.  There is a clear differentiation between justice and equality and reform issues.  They are unnatural bed partners from the point of view of what should be the reforming zeal of the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is a difficult task to be Minister for Justice. One needs leadership, management skills, vision and determination.  Where is all the reforming zeal which characterised the Minister for Justice when he was in Opposition?  Unfortunately he has become bogged down in officialdom and seems to have lost sight of many of the issues he pioneered and championed in Opposition.</P>
      <P>This has been rightly so in the case of some issues.  For example, zero tolerance was undoubtedly a cliché.  If clichés could solve crime then the problem would have been solved long ago.  This was a handy cliché to use when trying to strike a chord with the electorate during the general election. From the time of his appointment to the end of the summer when he said he was devoting his time to the preparation of the toothless Criminal Justice Bill, nothing was heard from the Minister on zero tolerance.  When he finally emerged from hiding the concept of zero tolerance was watered down and related only to drugs.  However, there has never been any tolerance of drugs.  The Minister has not introduced any new legislation.  He inherited all his legislative measures from the previous Minister, Deputy Owen, for example, the Prisons Bill, the Courts Bill, the Juvenile Justice Bill and the Children Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome some initiatives, for example, the witness protection programme.  However, the Government should listen to the pleas by the Garda Síochána for more money for this programme. Those who watched &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last <Col N="913" /> night will have been struck by the dramatic increase in domestic violence.  Yet a mere £1,000 has been provided in the Estimates to deal with this problem.  There was no point in enacting the domestic violence Act if we do not provide the resources to implement it.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the allocation of £250,000 for research in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is not nearly enough.  When considered in the context of a budget of £1 billion it is negligible.  We must look at the causes of crime and try to ascertain what turns a ten year old child into a hardened criminal while he is still at primary school.  We should look at the worthwhile study commissioned by the Home Office in Britain following the death of Jamie Bulger.  This study, entitled &ldquo;The Effects of Video Violence on Young Offenders&rdquo;, examined aggressive behaviour and whether violent videos have an effect on people.  It examined the effects immediately after the film and after three months, six months and nine months.  It found that there was a link between violent videos and aggressive behaviour and that violent videos tend to make aggressive people more aggressive and violent people more violent.</P>
    <P>There was a reference earlier today to the Refugee Act.  The Minister should decide whether to implement the Act with the exclusion of the section before the courts or to face up to our international obligations and introduce a new Bill.  It is clear the Minister favours introducing a new Bill.  He told the United Nations, UNHCR, Amnesty International and <i>The Irish Times</i> that this was his intention.  Yet there was total confusion about the issue in the House today.  I wish to share my time with Deputies Frances Fitzgerald, Allen and Gormley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Our booming economy raises certain key questions which mainly centre on how we use the massive resources currently available to us.  There is no doubt there is a unique opportunity to tackle serious problems in society.  There are huge displays of wealth and the creation of new jobs, to be questioned on the one hand and welcomed on the other.  It is extraordinary that, while the depth of poverty is not as great as heretofore, there are more people living in poverty today than ever before.  That must cause us to reflect seriously on how we use the massive resources available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also extraordinary that, while we hear of the numbers of children playing truant in an area of Dublin, as we reach the end of the 1990s there is no basic school psychological service to detect problems at an early stage.  Breast and cervical cancer screening services are not routinely available to women, and that is a national disgrace.  A serious commitment is needed if we are to tackle long-term unemployment.  There are also emerging needs &mdash; for example, the refugee organisations must be funded if we are to meet our international obligations to refugees and asylum <Col N="914" /> seekers and offer them legal aid.  Those needs will not be met unless there is a critical examination of programmes already in place.  I regret the Minister for Finance has not critically examined such programmes, which would be of assistance in meeting the needs.</P>
    <P>Another issue that must be tackled is the drugs problem.  It is extraordinary there is no increased funding in this area.  There is only a 1 per cent increase in the health budget, most of which will go towards pay, while problems in screening and in casualty departments will not be tackled.  The need for new places for people with a mental handicap will not be met, nor will the problem of homelessness if the programmes already in place are not examined and new plans implemented. There is insufficient planning and innovation in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>One of the key issues in the Defence Vote is compensation for deafness.  Claims have increased from 1,000 a couple of years ago to more than 10,000 creating a huge demand on the Exchequer.  There are questions about how this matter should be dealt with.  Whether we should move from the present court adversarial system to a tribunal must be critically examined by the Government, and the Minister must report to the House as soon as possible.  The allocation of money and its impact on the Defence Vote will have to be examined.  If the issue is not addressed, the Minister may not be in a position to meet the demands of the forces.</P>
    <P>A sum of £48 million is provided in the Defence budget this year.  Apart from the compensation provision, there is an increase of only 2 per cent to deal with the many and varied demands that arise under this Vote.  This is a time of enormous change in the Defence area.  Army training must be considered.  The Army plays an increasing role in peacekeeping duties and that impacts on the development of democracy in other countries.  The Army must be resourced to do its job properly.  A decrease in the level of communications and information technology available to the Army is unacceptable.  A 2 per cent increase in the Defence Vote does not allow for the support needed by the Naval Service to deal with the problem of drugs imported by sea.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to deal with other matters I wished to raise, but I will have an opportunity to do so when the budget is presented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The expectations raised in terms of increased resources for sport by the appointment of a senior Minister with responsibility for sport were cruelly dashed with the provision of a 4 per cent increase for sports and recreation.  Despite the presence of the Minister, Deputy McDaid, at the Cabinet table, he failed to get the resources promised by Fianna Fáil in its pre-election programme. The Minister came to office when, for the first time ever, there was a national plan for sport and he could have used that plan to gain the necessary resources.  I ask him to ensure a major <Col N="915" /> financial package is provided in the forthcoming budget for sport and recreation.</P>
      <P>To take up the comments on crime, made by my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, on crime, sport and recreation are the greatest preventative elements in the fight against crime and drugs abuse.  Investment in sport and recreation would reduce the need for investment in prisons and in the health service.  I am disappointed there is no increase in the allocation for the programme established by the previous Administration in response to the ministerial task force on drugs. We heard nothing from the Minister about the need for a national drugs testing programme in sport.  He simply said he would extend proposals to take into account analysis of blood samples from athletes.  He did not refer to the promised statutory sports council.  The Minister has many questions to answer next week during Question Time.  I will wait and see what provision will be made in the budget in this regard.</P>
      <P>On RTE's plans to scrap the Saturday programme, &ldquo;Sports Stadium&rdquo;, the Minister and the Taoiseach should immediately inform RTE that it cannot surrender the sporting airwaves to Sky Sports and other channels.  Many sporting events will not be shown on television if &ldquo;Sports Stadium&rdquo; is discontinued.  There is a responsibility on RTE and the Government to ensure this popular programme is not scrapped in December, as is planned by RTE.</P>
      <P>On tourism, the Minister should consider the questions that will arise after 1999 when the moneys under the operational programme terminate.  Will he give details of the mid-term review of the operational programme?  I hope during Question Time next week he will make a statement on that review.  On tourism, there is need for quality control and control of commercial accommodation.  Our environment is one of our greatest assets in selling tourism abroad.  If we travel the waterways, country lanes and roadways we will see the negative impact of modern day living on our environment.  There has been a failure by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to deal with this issue.  Before long this country will be considered expensive and without a clean environment.</P>
      <P>The Minister must address the imbalance in the growth of tourism between the east coast and the rest of the country.  The withdrawal of the CorkRoscoff ferry in the past few days means thousands of tourists will have to find another route. Will the Minister take up this issue with Irish Ferries?</P>
      <P>The international marketing manager of Bord Fáilte resigned recently.  The Little report of 1994 recommended that Bord Fáilte should have an international marketing director to introduce new marketing measures abroad.  Will it ensure the man who resigned is replaced so that the emphasis on international marketing is not eroded?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for sharing time with me.  He correctly asked the Minister when the Refugee Act will be fully implemented. We are getting confusing signals from the Government in this regard.  The Taoiseach promised it will be fully implemented, but we also heard Deputy Callely's racist remarks.  His cheap publicity stunt is simply incitement to hatred.  Will the Government re-examine the Estimates in the context of Deputy Fitzgerald's point?  When does the Government intend to fund organisations dealing with asylum seekers?</P>
      <P>The Government kept its promise to introduce a Book of Estimates with an increase in current expenditure of not more than 4 per cent.  It did this by moving the goal posts and introducing a series of Supplementary Estimates, without which we would have had an increase in expenditure of 6.5 per cent.  Apparently the Progressive Democrats approve of this accountancy wizardry and have abandoned their core value of fiscal rectitude. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment produced an Estimate with an increase of 9 per cent, twice the average increase of all Government Departments.</P>
      <P>There is some good news in the Estimates, but that is a matter of interpretation.  One of the most misleading pieces of good news relates to spending on the environment which we are told will involve an additional £123 million.  When the figures are broken down, however, most of the increase will be allocated to spending on roads.  It is beyond me how one can equate spending on roads with the protection of the environment. There is a serious air pollution problem in Dublin, but nothing is being done to resolve it.  At least the previous Government spent £20,000 on an air quality management plan for Dublin.  This is probably the most ungreen Government we have ever had.  We are not addressing the problems of the highly carcinogenic PM 10s or PM 2.5s or the question of benzene or VOCs.  One in four children who live in Ringsend and Pearse Street suffer from asthma but the Government sits idly by.  If a proper approach to the environment were adopted there would be quality bus corridors, Luas would be introduced, cycle paths would be built and air pollution would be properly monitored.  If we are to increase tourist numbers we must also invest in litter control and prevention of water pollution.  None of those problems is being adequately addressed.  Agenda 21 proposes integrated ways of dealing with environmental problems, but this would mean spending money.  The Minister for the Environment is obviously beholden to the Department of Finance.  In reply to a recent question on eco taxes, the Minister stated he did not realise consultants who had been engaged to examine the reduction in CO 2 emissions were precluded from examining the question of eco taxes.  In another question I tabled he stated he had not discussed the question of eco taxes with the Minister for Finance, who seems to be bewildered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> A study on a guaranteed basic income is to be commissioned under Partnership 2000, but we have heard very little about this.  I believe the Department of Finance has intruded and said it does not want a guaranteed basic income and, therefore, it will not happen.</P>
    <P>The Green Party accepts that the control of public expenditure is necessary, but a limit of 4 per cent is unnecessarily conservative.  Exercising caution in areas where additional expenditure is badly needed will mean they will be under-resourced. We must address the social problems of the city.  The question of environmental protection has not been adequately addressed in the Estimates.</P>

      <P>In 1987 Ray MacSharry and Charles Haughey embarked on the implementation of prudent budget policies and this Government is maintaining them.  Growth is expected to reach about 7 per cent this year, the fourth successive year of strong growth.  It is projected the standardised employment rate will fall from 11.5 per cent in 1996 to 10.25 per cent in 1997.  Retail sales are buoyant and interest rates and inflation are low. As a result, there is strong investment growth. Inflation is expected to be 1.5 per cent this year. Revenue growth has exceeded budget day targets and the Exchequer's overall position is better than expected.</P>
      <P>Now is the time to devise a long-term social and economic plan to take account of this increased growth and prosperity.  I recently read John Horgan's excellent biography of Seán Lemass and marvelled at the far-reaching plans for economic expansion set out by Lemass in conjunction with Ken Whitaker and his staff.  We should devise a plan that all can share, the disadvantaged, the socially excluded, the disabled and the unheralded wife and mother in the home who makes do on family social assistance payments.</P>
      <P>It is claimed it is prudent to maintain expenditure at 4 per cent while the growth rate is 7 per cent because the national debt can be reduced. At the same time a small proportion of the population is better off while a large proportion is not benefiting to the same extent.  The 80:20 principle seems to apply here in that 20 per cent are doing very well but the other 80 per cent are not doing well enough.  The gap between those who have and those who have not is widening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a school of thought that if one reduces taxes people will work harder, more people will be employed and the rising tide will lift everybody. It does not work that way.  According to the latest labour force survey, there is an increasing <Col N="918" /> number of people employed, greater even than the usual monthly unemployment figures show. There are advertisements in every shop and factory seeking employees.  All the signs show we have almost reached a position of full employment, the stage where there are no people available, able, trained or willing to fill the vacancies that arise.</P>
    <P>We must draw up a medium and long-term economic and social plan based on our best projections. That plan should ensure we care for those who are disadvantaged and excluded and not continue to look in a focused and blinkered way at reducing the top tax rates and the national debt.  The right balance must be struck between the requirements of budgetary policy and the need to meet social and economic progress.  This balance should veer slightly to the left of the political and social spectrum.</P>
    <P>The 1998 estimates show net current expenditure rising by 1.8 per cent in 1998 over the likely 1997 outturn.  This leaves the Minister great latitude to try to redress the social imbalance while staying close to the 4 per cent spending limit.  If there are significant projected increases in tax revenue, I expect the Minister to revisit the hardness and fastness of the 4 per cent ceiling, taking into account the social inequalities which are particularly evident in certain areas of my constituency, Dublin South-Central.</P>
    <P>In the Education Estimate I welcome the 25 per cent increase in second level building grants and capital costs.  Rosary College in Crumlin needs a new heating system; the building requires rewiring, as the wires are frayed and it is a fire hazard; it also needs a new suspended ceiling and new windows.  Crumlin is in an area of disadvantage and as the school is not in a position to raise funds I am delighted with the 25 per cent increase.  A new PE hall for MacDara College in Templeogue has been long awaited.  It has gone through the planning process and I hope the Minister for Education will be in a position to turn the sod shortly.</P>
    <P>The 9 per cent increase for primary education is also welcome.  In Walkinstown, Our Lady of the Assumption junior primary school badly needs a remedial teacher.  It is in a disadvantaged area and requires a lower pupil-teacher ratio.  One hopes this extra funding will allow for better facilities in that school.  Loreto junior primary school requires a three year cycle.  It caters for children from Fatima Mansions and Dolphin House, some of whom have severe emotional and family problems.  The extra spending on primary education will be welcomed there.  It would also be nice if Our Lady of Good Counsel boys' national school in Drimnagh could move its toilets indoors.</P>
    <P>I hope funds will be provided in the Health Vote to dramatically increase the medical card income limit for old age pensioners.  When canvassing for the general election in June, I found this was of great concern.  The Minister should also consider giving medical cards to people without <Col N="919" /> means who have long-term chronic medical conditions.</P>
    <P>On the subject of poverty traps, the loss of a medical card for children is a major reason for not giving up social welfare payments.  I ask the Minister to consider extending the GMS to cover all children qualifying for child benefit, as recommended by the expert group report on the integration of the taxation and social welfare systems. This would bring in an additional 700,000 children, according to the report, and the cost at 1996 figures was £60 million.  This approach was seen to be equitable, administratively cost-efficient, non-divisive and simple for the public to understand.</P>
    <P>The disabled have been mentioned; more properly-equipped buses should be introduced for them, with hoists, harnesses and an attendant on board.  If disabled people had been on the bus involved in the recent accident on the motorway at Ballyfermot, they would have been particularly vulnerable.  More places are needed for those with disabilities.  There should be a visible progression path from pre-school to permanent, long-term care.  The anxiety of parents for their disabled children when the parents reach retirement age is palpable.</P>
    <P>Under the Social, Community and Family Affairs Vote, I ask the Minister to abolish the archaic question asked of women when they sign on, as to whether they have child minding facilities in place.  No man is asked this question and it precludes married women from entering community employment schemes, which are an excellent method of returning to the workforce.  The Minister should consider introducing free Cablelink for old age pensioners in receipt of a free television licence because it is not feasible to have one without the other.  The grant for security systems was an excellent scheme which should be made permanent.  The Minister should also examine the fuel allowance for old age pensioners, especially considering their vulnerability to hypothermia. It should be made year-round rather than confined to winter months.</P>
    <P>Married women should be treated the same as lone parents with regard to the amount they can earn without affecting the weekly family social welfare payment.  Currently a married woman may earn £60 per week whereas an unmarried mother can earn £115 per week and, on a sliding scale, up to £230 per week.  It is correct that this should be in place but married women should be treated equally in that regard.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister announce recently that old age pensioners aged over 75 will be eligible for free schemes even if someone is living with them.  At my clinic recently I met a lady living a lonely, depressing life solely because economic circumstances dictate she cannot have someone living with her, because she would lose her free schemes.  The 75 year age limit should be reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Under the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach, there is a need for an official residence for our Taoiseach.  Ireland has developed in status economically at a faster rate than any country in Europe.  There should be an official residence to which the Taoiseach can invite and entertain heads of state and persons important to Ireland who may wish to come here.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Vote, I hope the Minister will allow tax relief for donations to local charities, a subject which was debated recently in the House. On the Office of Public Works Vote, it is important that the Grand Canal from Ballyfermot via Bluebell to Davitt Road is cleaned and improved.  It is a much needed amenity as regards wildlife, waterways, fishing and canoeing, particularly for disadvantaged people living in the vicinity.</P>
    <P>Shannon has SFADCo and the Gaeltacht areas have Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should set up an enterprise and employment authority for disadvantaged areas.  While the partnerships work to a certain extent, they need a body with far more clout, involving trained business professions and with a grant-giving capacity.  In Dublin South-Central, apart from Guinness and Players there are no industries of major import and they are badly needed.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the national lottery's input to sport and recreation is increasing by 48 per cent, from £9.5 million to £13.9 million.  I look forward to seeing a 50 metre swimming pool in the vicinity of Dublin South-Central as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ardagh for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Estimates. We are living in a booming economy with growth of 7 per cent, inflation of 1.5 per cent and a huge increase in employment with 52,000 new jobs in 1997.  I do not envy the Minister for Finance his task over the next few weeks.  It is very difficult to please everybody.  While I am very anxious that he makes provision for the disadvantaged in our society, I recognise he must be very prudent in carrying out his work.</P>
      <P>The 1998 Estimates show an increase of 1.8 per cent in net current expenditure.  I realise that after budget day this will still be below the 4 per cent figure outlined in our programme for Government with the Progressive Democrats.  I welcome that fact because this prudent policy has brought us to our current position of one of the greatest economies in Europe.</P>
      <P>We campaigned very extensively in the area of Justice, Equality and Law Reform during the election on a policy of zero tolerance.  Many people are upset by the fact that some who obtain money from criminal activity can live without any threat from the law.  Therefore, I welcome the 30 per cent increase in the Estimate for the Criminal Assets Bureau, which society as a whole will welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> In Opposition one of our Members dealt with the area of disability in an innovative way and the figures in the Estimate show that was not just lip-service. The grant for the National Women's Council has been increased by 18 per cent.  As one of the 20 female Deputies, I welcome the fact that the many women's agencies around the country are being recognised for their valuable work.  The grant for the Council on the Status of People with Disabilities has been increased by 89 per cent since last year.  That shows the serious commitment of this Government to tackling the area of disability.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, who has taken on some of the thorny issues in education which were not dealt with over recent years.  The issue of one teacher schools particularly affects my constituency. There are 11 one teacher schools in Mayo. I appreciate it is difficult for Dublin Deputies to understand how that affects a community in the west.  Deputy Martin is the first Minister to seriously decide to do something about it and I know he will make great inroads in regard to them in the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>I also praise the technology programme for schools, Schools IT 2000, and the provision for an education technology investment fund.  It is important to recognise the current skills gap in our education system.  This investment could not come at a better time if we are to maintain the level of economic development we have enjoyed up to now.  There is a great awareness in the community as a whole of the need for technology skills.  This was particularly evident recently when Telecom Éireann ran a competition to pick the information age town for Ireland.  I am delighted my town of Castlebar was on the short list of the last four contenders.  Unfortunately, we did not win first prize but we got a commitment of £1 million from Telecom Éireann.  It is important to harness that enthusiasm for technology and there is no better place to start than in schools.  This is a very welcome investment.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister on getting a 25 per cent increase for building projects, particularly for second level schools.  St. Gerald's secondary school in Castlebar is looking for an extension and Davitt College in Castlebar is seeking a new sports facility.  I hope those projects will be successful after the budget.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the provision made for school transport.  The current system belongs in the dim and distant past.  There is no flexibility for rural areas.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider reviewing the school transport system.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the areas of health and children. I have a very short time to speak but I have selected the areas which are most important.  If we do not have our health we have nothing.  I wish to highlight some issues which I hope the Minister for Health and Children will consider. There is no cardiac unit in the west.  A major development was carried out in Mayo General Hospital, which serves the entire county, but it <Col N="922" /> was only the first phase.  I hope the second phase will be completed in the term of this Government. The first phase upgraded the male wing of the hospital.  The female wing has been untouched for 26 years.  The condition of the maternity wing would not be seen in a Third World country.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the lack of health services for women in the west.  It is outrageous a woman must wait six months for the result of a smear test, particularly given its possible serious consequences for her health.  I also ask the Minister to address the lack of facilities provided for autistic children, not just in the west but throughout the country.  I do not know whether this failure to provide adequate facilities results from a lack of knowledge, but it puts great stress on parents in my constituency and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have been involved over recent years in the provision of a helicopter emergency medical service. This service comprises a fully equipped helicopter which is like a flying hospital.  It is particularly important for the west where the road structure is totally inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to confine my remarks to the Estimate for the Environment and Local Government, more specifically to the way in which the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is handling it.  As far as I can see, the Minister has been far more interested up to now in kite flying than in protecting the environment or in local government.</P>
      <P>For example, we discovered yesterday at Question Time that the review of the electoral system, which was promised in the Government's programme, is only a kite flying exercise by the Minister. It appears he wants to improve his public image by speaking about his superficial understanding of the problems of our electoral system and retailing some of the half baked comments which have been made about the multi seat transferable vote system.  In fact, he has done no real work on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister what review he had carried out.  It appears from his reply that he has commissioned no studies by politicians or other informed or expert persons and has no instructions from the Cabinet on the matter, but has handed it over to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, one of whose jobs will be to examine the different options for how such a review might be approached.  If any Members feel <Col N="923" /> they might be endangered by a move from the multi seat transferable vote system to a single seat transferable vote system they can rest easy because there will be no change in our electoral system before the next general election, although the Minister might get overtaken in that regard sooner than he thinks.</P>
    <P>I thought very carefully about this and I believe I can predict the date on which we will receive the report of this review.  It will be what we call as Gaeilge, lá philleadh na gcléite, or, in the English vernacular, the day the cows come home.  The Minister is engaged in only kite flying on that issue.  Having said so much about what he is not going to do, that is, review the electoral system, the Minister is unaccountably coy about his intention to postpone the elections to county councils and county borough councils until 1999.  We have asked him and the Taoiseach to outline their plans in this connection because many voters and members of local authorities would like to know. They have provided different answers.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that, by law, these elections are due to be held in 1998 but he will not elaborate. The Taoiseach advises that no decision has yet been made, giving us to believe that another decision might be made.  The Minister tells Fianna Fáil councillors and activists in private that he wants to postpone the election until 1999 but that he is afraid I might disagree and, if so, he does not want to make such a proposal to the House. In the meantime the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government told &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; that the local elections would take place in 1999.  I invite them to decide on and announce their plans.</P>
    <P>There is merit in the idea of having the elections to county councils and county borough councils in 1999 on the same day as the elections for the urban authorities and to the European Parliament.  There is also merit in aligning these elections together on that date and definitively thereafter.  However, it is the Minister's job to propose that and I have no intention of doing his job for him.  In the meantime, it would be useful if the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, met and decided from which hymn sheet they are singing. Are they singing from the King James version of the gospel or from another modernised version?</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has been voluble regarding his intention to unpick the provisions of the Electoral Act, 1997, which relate to the public funding of general election candidates and to the limitation of expenditure by parties and candidates during the course of election campaigns.  However, he was coy in answering questions yesterday; he did not want to commit himself.</P>
    <P>I presume that some of his Fianna Fáil Cabinet colleagues have had second thoughts and now see the wisdom of what they opposed while in Opposition. <Col N="924" /> Given that the chief guru of the Progressive Democrats is allowing his membership of the party to wither on the vine, like the party itself, I am not aware of its position on the matter.  They are only numerical makeweights and ministerial and junior ministerial ornaments.  Their opinion does not count.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the Minister will make no proposals about the Electoral Act, 1997, and that the remainder of it will come into operation next year.  Eventually, he and other Deputies on his side of the House will praise the Act.  It is another straw in the wind and, given the rate at which the Minister is jettisoning them, most of the commitments on the environment in the programme for Government will not amount to anything more than a row of genetically modified beans by next summer.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by the Minister's handling of the ten year restoration programme for non-national roads, which was put in place by the previous Government.  Fianna Fáil failed or refused to see the need for a programme of that kind for the last seven years.  In the first two years of the programme, almost one sixth of the 87,000 miles of non-national roads were upgraded.  The programme needs further reinforcement if it is to reach the target set for the year 2005, but yesterday the Minister was unable to outline his plans for 1998, only five weeks before the beginning of the year.  That approach is not just lackadaisical, it is neglectful and irresponsible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been making encouraging noises regarding waste management policy.  He appears finally to have steered his Department &mdash; I applaud him for it &mdash; in the direction of including incineration as one of the options in our system for waste disposal.  However, there is nothing in the Estimate about pushing that any further.  I encourage him to proceed with it.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister yesterday about his proposals on new technology that will reduce vehicle emissions.  He knew nothing about it.  I will send him material I have obtained from the Toyota Motor Company in Japan which next year is marketing a new hybrid technology vehicle which will be a little more expensive than others.  I remind the Minister that we already have a much more environmentally friendly form of motor fuel called liquefied petroleum gas, which people are used to using.  It would be a simple measure in the budget to restore the use of this gas to what it was in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</P>
    <P>The Minister will go down in history for a comment he recently used in this House.  When we proposed certain measures to improve traffic flow in Dublin his only policy advice to Dublin commuters who sit for hours in traffic jams was that they should think before they travel.</P>

      <P>Insufficient money is being provided for the protection and improvement to the environment. A 2 per cent increase this year over last year in funding to the Department of the Environment and Local Government is pathetic when <Col N="925" /> the environment is deteriorating by the day. Every day there are reports of fish kills, water pollution and contaminated water which people cannot drink.  We must invest more in the environment and recognise it as a valuable asset.</P>
      <P>With regard to water quality, only a very small percentage of the population is served by water treatment plants.  In a recent survey of such plants per head of population, we were ranked eighteenth out of 19 countries.  Heavy curination is the only treatment process available to many rural areas, which is a sad reflection on society.</P>
      <P>This summer underlined the deteriorating quality of our waterways.  It takes six to eight years for this type of deterioration to become manifest and considerably longer to rectify.  We should act now and invest in our environment and not let things deteriorate irretrievably.</P>
      <P>Hitherto we have followed our European neighbours but now we can see the writing on the wall for them.  Already we can see the diminished quality of our waters to sustain salmon and trout. The condition of Lough Leane in Killarney is a sad reflection on us.  The lakes of Killarney are covered in algae bloom.</P>
      <P>We must invest more in monitoring.  It is no good having monitoring procedures closed at weekends.  A constant eye needs to be kept on our environment.  We must also invest more in waste water treatment and stop treating rivers and waterways as sewers.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government reports that 68 per cent of the population is connected to public sewers, that 15 per cent of sewage is discharged without treatment, 35 per cent is discharged following primary treatment, 47 per cent is discharged following secondary treatment and less than 3 per cent receives full tertiary treatment, which is what is required to remove phosphates and nitrates.</P>
      <P>I hope some of the increased funding of 11 per cent for roads this year will go towards completing the link road around Ballincollig.  The tunnel is due to open in Cork in 1998 but traffic from this tunnel will go nowhere unless the Minister provides the necessary funding to complete the road structure in Cork.</P>
      <P>We need to invest in the environment for our future and for our children's future, for tourism and our enjoyment of it.</P>

      <P>Sunday trading on a large scale by giants in the trade has serious implications for the survival of the grocery industry.  The scale of the Tesco-Quinnsworth organisation with a turnover of £13 billion, which is over three times the size of the entire grocery market and 20 times the size of its nearest competitor, is something about which everyone in the grocery trade is concerned.</P>
      <P>Sunday trading by multiples has major implications for a number of people, not only employees but those who service the trade.  Suppliers will be obliged to deliver on Sundays, especially in the fresh fruit product area of the grocery trade, which demands daily delivery.</P>
      <P>Sunday trading will bring cleaners into the framework who will be obliged to work.  The whole fabrication of the Irish grocery trade involves a large number of people.  Sunday trading by the giants will affect much of the trade throughout the country.  In recent years business people have invested heavily in the fabrication of trade in small towns and villages.  Given that this provides a major infrastructure, it would be a pity if that investment was threatened by the arrival of the giants in the bigger centres.</P>
      <P>Sunday trading has further implications.  In shopping centres where there is an anchor tenant the smaller units are forced to open even though they have no wish to do so.  Given the development of the grocery trade, legislation is needed to ensure the survival of the trade as we approach the new millennium.  In the past many business people invested heavily whether in farming or tourism.  While welcoming competition it is important to ensure that Tesco honours its obligations to the trade by safeguarding jobs not only at the retail but at the manufacturing end.</P>
      <P>Sunday opening will add to the viability and profitability of a multinational.  It will have severe implications also given that many have off-licences within their operation where there are restricted hours of operation.  There is a necessity for a retailer in a small town to open on a Sunday since he is providing a service.  There is no comparison between a privately owned company and a multinational, such as the Tesco-Quinnsworth Group.  We must be careful to protect the privately owned company and ensure its growth. Legislation is needed in respect of several areas, below cost selling and Sunday trading.  This whole issue needs to be closely examined.</P>

      <P>I wish to make two points on the Bill which the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, introduced in Opposition.  I appreciate the reasons behind the Bill.  Not alone do workers need protection, small family run businesses all over the country need protection from Sunday trading.  In England hypermarkets have been brought in and are putting small companies out <Col N="927" /> of business.  They are selling petrol at cost price and taking customers from a 40 mile radius which is proving detrimental for the small towns and villages in England.</P>
      <P>Great Britain allows Sunday trading only on a certain number of Sundays in the year.  This is something we have to contemplate as legislators. I ask the Minister when considering the protection of workers, who should have the choice whether to work on Sunday, to protect the family run businesses who have been the backbone of small communities since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>Last night I raised the question of revaluations in small businesses.  The Minister for Finance told me that £380 million was received in rates last year from small business.  This is a sizeable portion of Exchequer funding which is provided by that sector.  When introducing legislation will the Minister consider allowing Sunday trading on only a certain number of Sundays in the year given that small businesses cannot compete?</P>

      <P>Under an order made under the Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, there is no restriction on Sunday trading.  Gradually over the years businesses have opened on Sunday, beginning with late opening on Thursdays and Fridays before Christmas and about ten years ago Sunday opening before Christmas.  This phenomenon has developed and has become the norm.  The consumer expects to be able to shop on a Sunday and the market is driven by what the consumer wants. That is the reality.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party is hoping to checkmate the Minister by reintroducing his Bill and back him into a corner but he has done his homework.  He understands that Governments cannot legislate for everything in a constitutional democracy.  The purpose of good Government is also to direct and protect the people.  The electorate sets its own standards.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has set out the path he is taking.  He has already met representatives of IBEC and ICTU to review the position on Sunday trading.  He firmly believes, as I do, that the partnership approach and consensus is the correct one.  There are many reasons Sunday trading has developed in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many families the husband and wife are employed outside the home.  Previously, the working wife was restricted to foregoing her lunch hour to shop piecemeal for her family.  With Sunday trading the pressure is taken off the wife and mother.  She can do her shopping with the help of the entire family on Sundays.  Sunday is the only day families have to shop together, buy clothes for the children, do the week's grocery shopping and time to weigh the pros and cons of <Col N="928" /> major household purchases.  We have all done this.  Valuable quality time is spent with children teaching them the value of money and the art of shopping.</P>
    <P>Students also benefit from Sunday trading.  It provides much needed part time jobs and helps to keep students in college who could not otherwise afford third level education.</P>
    <P>Consumers now take Sunday trading for granted.  They like the flexibility of being able to spend their free time at weekends shopping in a leisurely fashion.  People like to browse through the new shopping malls and enjoy the ambience. They appreciate and admire the physical evidence of the Celtic tiger.  They have time to enjoy and appreciate the city centre and bring much needed revenue to traders.  They keep the city centre alive at weekends.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons Sunday trading is beneficial. It allows employees to choose when they work.</P>

The Government cannot and should not interfere with the right of people to choose when they will work and the number of hours they will work.  The workforce has responded to the demands of the market and, in general, chooses to work on Sundays.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that legislative restrictions on workers could extend to the private sector.  Many small business entrepreneurs, particularly when starting up, work all the hours God sends to make a success of their business.  The Government cannot and should not impede the entrepreneur.</P>
      <P>Other businesses such as banks and building societies have responded to consumer demands and extended their hours of opening.  It is not all that long ago when banks barely opened for a couple of hours in the morning and closed early. They offered little service to the public but as the public demanded more and better service the banks responded and now open all day and, given the least encouragement, would be willing to open their doors on Sundays.  They already carry on business on Sundays as every department store and shopping mall has bank card outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many shops have gradually extended their opening hours during the week.  Most supermarkets now open until 7 p.m. every night with late night opening on Thursdays and Fridays.  The staff choose to work these hours.  Some would argue that these extended hours interfere with their leisure activities and that Sunday trading infringes on their lifestyle.  This is not so.  People have a right to choose whether to work from 9 p.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday or to vary their hours of work and the days they work to suit their own circumstances.  We do not want employers, employees and owners of businesses to be dictated to by the State and told for how long and <Col N="929" /> for how many hours per day or week they can work.  We live in a democracy.</P>
    <P>People have chosen to trade on Sundays.  The consumer is delighted with the flexibility and the availability of services on Sundays.  It is the market that dictates.  The choice rests with the people. If employees agree to work on Sundays they must be compensated.</P>

      <P>Employees in other sectors work on Sundays. Hospital employees, airline staff, gardaí and other groups provide a service to the public on Sundays.  Their unions have negotiated terms and conditions acceptable to them.  The Minister of State expects that he will be able to do the same with MANDATE and ICTU.  The unions must also respond to consumer demands.  The idea of flexible working hours is not novel.  Workers can avail of job-sharing and flexi-time arrangements. Many civil servants start work and leave their desks early but that is a matter for another day.</P>

      <P>Competition is the lifeblood of trade in industry. Our economic success has been based as much on competition in the retail sector as on prudent management of the national finances.

      <P>As I remember the debate in the United Kingdom on this issue, there were zealots ranged on the business, religious and political fronts.  These debates should take second place to the basic, fundamental economic sense of the circumstances in which we now find ourselves in the modern world.  People's lifestyles have changed.  There is now no room for religious, economic or political zealotry on an issue such as Sunday trading.  The reality is that the public has voted; when you enter a shopping mall or corner shop on any Sunday you see the public voting with their feet, going into the shops and spending money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>We must recognise reality as it obtains within society.  People want Sunday shopping and the choice it affords them.  Some people work difficult hours during the week and others over the weekend.  I and my wife are in the lucky position of both being in the workforce and find Sunday shopping of benefit.  We are hardworking, endeavouring to make a living during the week, so it is good to be able to shop on Sunday.</P>
      <P>In no sense am I saying that Sunday shopping should be at the expense of the worker.  If Deputy Broughan had a little patience and gave me a decent hearing he would realise I am much closer to his position than he might imagine.  We must be extremely careful that Sunday shopping does not become a tool in the hands of greedy entrepreneurs, retailers, capitalists, call them what you like, with which to exploit the workforce.  As Deputy Broughan rightly said, a great many of my constituents find themselves in that position. Many of them raised this issue with me both before and in the course of the last general election, particularly those working in the Dunnes Stores retailing chain, who felt they were being abused by their management trying to enforce certain conditions on them.  I agree with Deputy Broughan that we cannot allow Sunday shopping to become something to which workers are subjected. Workers must not be forced to step on a treadmill on which they do not want to embark.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find precious little within it with which to disagree because it is only correct and proper that we protect workers and their employment conditions.  Conceptually it is only right that we should protect workers in the context of the realities obtaining within our modern day economy because one cannot fly in the face of economic reality.  Unfortunately, certain parties endeavoured to do so for years.  I am glad to say that formerly the Labour Party was one of those but is now catching up.  Its new Leader, Deputy Quinn, probably will make a great contribution in this respect in bringing his party face to face with the realities of a modern economy, which are that one cannot rule out competition and any attempt to do so would be just as wrong as exploiting the worker.</P>
      <P>However, therein lies the dilemma facing the Minister of State who, rightly or wrongly, when in Opposition introduced virtually the same Bill as the one now before us.  What Deputy Broughan proposes is quite unique in this respect in that he is offering to replicate the same mistake. It seems somewhat strange that he should be doing so, since we have had the courage to acknowledge we made a mistake.</P>

      <P>That is a sin of which Deputy Broughan might well be accused in future years, over-enthusiasm in Opposition.  The point I am making is that we are now a party in Government, as was the Labour Party.  I do not foresee it being very long before Labour is back in power, perhaps with ourselves or with another party, when it will have to confront the reality of a modern economy and do precisely the same as the Minister of State is now doing.</P>
      <P>While in Government had the Minister of State introduced the Bill he did in Opposition it would fly in the face of the delicate, careful process of social partnership established here which has brought this country, economy and the workforce about which Deputy Broughan speaks a long way, guaranteeing social and economic progress which would have been quite unimaginable some 20 or 30 years ago.  Yet Deputy Broughan is now saying we should upset that process.  The Minister of State is initiating a dialogue with the social partners on this very vital issue.</P>

      <P>That social partnership has been one of the cornerstones of our economic success, begun in 1987 when former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, began that dialogue.  The negotiation of a unique social partnership between trade unions and employers was not an idea that emanated from the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but rather from Fianna Fáil.  If it emanated from the labour movement, it is remarkable that its political running dogs in the Labour Party did not choose to do so before since they had ample opportunity when in Government with former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret Fitzgerald. Fianna Fáil delivered on that as a minority Government, not under pressure from any Coalition colleague of any kind.  The process of social partnership was a unique creation of Fianna Fáil in Government.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the Minister of State has sensibly decided to consult all the social partners in this regard.  I accused Deputy Broughan of over-enthusiasm in Opposition.  He is even running ahead of the trade unions some of whose workers who could be most directly affected by this Bill are not as anxious as Deputy Broughan to see them implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to place on record that I fully support the approach being adopted by the Minister of State in endeavouring to seek a solution to this issue through partnership, dialogue and consensus.  It is my firm belief that any agreement voluntarily entered into between the parties will be far superior to any forced on them by law and should be our approach to this issue.  Our industrial relations over many decades have been underpinned by a strong voluntary tradition, brought about through social consensus rather than based heavily on legislation.  Over the past decade we have had the Programme for National Recovery, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and now Partnership 2000, all of which have wrought outstanding changes in our economy and benefits to all employees, achieved through consultation, dialogue and partnership rather than through any enforcement of legislation.</P>
      <P>Neither is it any coincidence that, over the past ten years, there has been a remarkably low number of man days lost due to strikes, again due mainly to social partnership rather than to any legislative provisions, and should be the basis on which we continue.</P>
      <P>The Bill is well intentioned but why does it deal only with shops?  I fault any Bill that is so narrow in its focus.  We should not deal with these matters on a piecemeal basis.  We all use hotels, pubs and restaurants on Sundays.  We buy newspapers, put petrol in our cars, use the telephone, watch television, go to the cinema or to sporting events and engage in many other activities on Sundays, and people have to work to provide these services for us.  It is a misnomer, therefore, to try to restrict people's activities on Sundays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> I note in particular that the Bill does not apply to an employee who is normally expected to work for less than eight hours per week.  I am concerned that section might be abused and result in large numbers of weekend workers being employed, which would be unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>A wider debate on Sunday activities is necessary. There is no restriction in the Bill on family members working seven days per week to make their living.  The Bill runs the risk of bringing about over-regulation.  Some constitutional difficulties also arise with which I have a major problem. We should not rush into passing an amendment to overcome those difficulties; we have had enough of those in the past.  We must seek a balance between the rights of employers and employees.  The views of consumers must be taken into account in this legislation.  We do not want to make a farce of Sunday trading by restricting opening hours as we did with pubs.</P>
    <P>Many small shops need to extend their opening hours late into the night and on Sundays to maintain their market share.  Small shops in rural areas now have to remain open throughout the weekend to maintain their businesses because business has a tendency to drift into the larger towns.  That is the only way many convenience shops in small villages will remain open.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to the Bill is the correct one.  We must seek to resolve this issue through partnership, dialogue and consensus and not through legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill while in Opposition and expressing the view now that further consultation is needed with everybody concerned.  I was reared in a family that owned a small shop and I understand the difficulties of trading on Sunday.  I also understand the difficulties faced by employees and the need to regularise their entitlements and compensation for Sunday work.  I recommend to the Minister that further extensive consultations should take place.</P>
      <P>The corner shop, with which I am all too familiar, provided a service in the past and the owners of such shops deserve to be consulted on this issue as there are wide implications for that group.  In addition to providing goods for sale, family shops in the past provided a seven day service from 7 a.m. until 12 midnight.  The shop owners received little or no compensation for their hard work despite the fact that they provided a type of social service and confessional, and they were always open on Sundays.  As a result of competition, many shop owners had to employ family members and, thereafter, people outside the family to ensure there was sufficient staff to keep the shops open seven days per week. More often than not, Sunday was the best day of trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These shops, which played a vital role in the development of communities, are now a dying breed.  Because of the implications of Sunday <Col N="936" /> trading, this group of operators in the market must be consulted and their views taken into consideration. The employees who work in these shops must be consulted and their rights upheld.</P>
    <P>The corner shop has now been replaced in the centre of the marketplace by the large multiples around which has grown a number of smaller speciality shops which are now piggybacking on the volume of support enjoyed by the multiples in every location.  This is another group that must be consulted because these shops also open for long hours.  They run the risk of tight margins and trade seven days per week, but they too must survive. They should be consulted just like the family grocers or corner shop owners because they have staff implications also.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that employees of the multiples have rights relative to Sunday trading which must be recognised and upheld, but so too must the difference between an employee of a multiple and an employee of a traditional corner shop. There is a world of difference between the two operations.</P>
    <P>It is the general public who demand Sunday trading.  The general public wants a seven day per week service.  If shoppers did not support Sunday trading, the multiples would not open.  Because a seven day per week service is now part of our modern lifestyle, employees are required to work but their rights must be upheld.</P>
    <P>Consultation must be inclusive.  RGDATA, the trade unions, representatives of the multiples and the general public have to be consulted in an all-inclusive process.  That is the only way we will find a solution.  With consultation, however, we will discover that the problems are complex and not easily solved.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to support Deputy Broughan's Bill in the name of the Labour Party. I would like to take the opportunity to remind the House that when the then Deputy Tom Kitt introduced this Bill on 25 March 1997, authored by the MANDATE trade union, he placed it firmly in historical context.  He stated:</P>
      <P>From the days of Seán Lemass to the present day Fianna Fáil has continually provided for workers' protective legislation where it is required.  This Bill, which has the support of MANDATE, is in line with my party's historical solidarity with workers since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having thus wrapped himself in the tricolour and hoisted the red flag, Deputy Kitt went on to explain to the House that &ldquo;Sunday working in the retail sector is synonymous with casualisation in the workplace&rdquo;.  Warming to his theme, Deputy <Col N="937" /> Kitt, the shop worker's friend, concluded as follows:</P>
    <P>The continuance of the present trend is detrimental to the creation of well paid, secure jobs, both full-time and part-time, in the retail sector. The increasing casualisation of the trade in the absence of legislation will consign a further generation of workers, usually young females, to the uncertainty of temporary and casual employment for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The shop workers need not have worried, however, because Deputy Kitt anticipated that when his Bill &ldquo;becomes law, protection will be provided for those employed in retail outlets which trade on Sundays so that Sunday working will be optional as opposed to obligatory for those employees&rdquo;.  He went on to state: &ldquo;The Bill will go some way towards bringing the level of protection here for Sunday working into line with the level among our European partners and provide some regulation of employment on what, traditionally, has been workers' one day off each week&rdquo;.  There was even better news to come.  The then Government of which I was a member announced it would accept the Bill introduced by Deputy Kitt and it was agreed to proceed to the next Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the then Deputy Kitt was critical and commented at length on my role in persuading my then Government colleagues to accept the Bill.  He accused me &ldquo;of galloping into town Clint Eastwood style and riding roughshod over the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald&rdquo;. Nothing could have been further from the truth.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, should know that there are two 1939 Acts, one that deals with hours of work and the other with opening hours.  The Minister with responsibility for commerce deals with one and the Minister with responsibility for labour affairs deals with the other.  I took the view then and do so now that, irrespective of any social partnership considerations, a voluntary opt out of Sunday working was a reasonable demand from the workers concerned.  Because of the good working relationship I had with the former Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, I was able to get her agreement to allow the Bill introduced by Deputy Kitt to go to Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 March 1997 we had a new clean cut hero of the working class, invoking the support of MANDATE trade union and the pedigree of Seán Lemass, in his fight for voluntary working on Sunday.  In addition, not least because of my efforts, Deputy Kitt had Government assent and, to crown his achievement, he got a different mandate from the electorate when he became Minister of State responsible for this area.  Imagine the celebrations in Cavendish Row when their very own Steve Silvermint was ensconced in Government <Col N="938" /> with a Bill in his briefcase authored by MANDATE and introduced in the House.  For long suffering retail workers it seemed the end to compulsory Sunday working, but those gallant MANDATE members did not know they were dealing with Fianna Fáil and its double dealing Minister of State, Deputy Kitt.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is creating a first in Dáil Éireann, he will oppose his own Bill.  If there were premature celebrations in MANDATE headquarters on the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt's accession to office, imagine the mood in Kildare Street.  Excellent officials who had worked with the assiduous Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, in enacting the Organisation of Working Time Bill, 1997, were now required to come up with a fig leaf to conceal why the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, did not believe a word of what he told the House and MANDATE on 25 March 1997.  Knowing the dedication and creativity, as I do, of the officials in Kildare Street I greatly look forward to the damage limitation exercise that I expect them to mount in defence of the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, but the task is beyond them.  Nothing can be done for the Minister of State &mdash; he is too far gone.  One cannot advocate a Bill in March, oppose the same Bill in November and maintain any credibility.</P>

      <P>I dealt with Deputy Conor Lenihan yesterday and I do not like to engage in baby seal clubbing twice in a row.  The best the officials have managed in the Minister of State's script is that &ldquo;on reflection [not even on mature reflection] the Organisation of Working Time Bill enacted by Eithne Fitzgerald is a much better Bill than Deputy Kitt thought it was.  It is a delicate balance of differing concessions to both social partners&rdquo;.  In other words, the Minister of State did not and does not know what he is talking about.  His Bill was introduced to coincide with and, as a response to, a limitation identified by the MANDATE trade union in the otherwise excellent Organisation of Working Time Bill then being enacted.  At the time, the Government accepted the point identified by MANDATE as expressed in the Bill introduced by Deputy Kitt. Now that Bill is to commit suicide before the eyes of its author.  That must be a bitter experience for MANDATE trade unionists and if this represents, as Deputy Kitt argued on 25 March, Fianna Fáil's &ldquo;historical solidarity with workers&rdquo; shop workers must wonder if they can do without that kind of solidarity.  In this excruciatingly embarrassing experience for the Minister of State, I wish to quote his new found colleague, <Col N="939" /> the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, who said on 25 March 1997, &ldquo;Legislation produced by my party is so well drafted and thought out that the Government must accept it&rdquo;.  I submit the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, lacks what the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, suggested.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is an honourable man.  The Bill published by the then Deputy Kitt in November 1996 was a genuine attempt to improve the quality of life of the many workers who feel strongly about this issue.  However, he has been set up.  The Taoiseach and the deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy O'Rourke, who accompanied Deputy Kitt when he launched the Bill, have left him high and dry.  Despite the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt's pleading with his Whip to accept this Bill, as the previous Government did, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Enterprise have left him at the mercy of the Tánaiste, whose views about even the most minimal of labour market regulations are well known.  We now know who is the boss in that Department.</P>

      <P>Since this Government came into office it has done more to debase politics than any collection of political commentators could do. Its members went before the people in June on an election manifesto which the public was at least entitled to expect they would attempt to implement.  Since then we have had nothing but U-turns.  I will list them in case the public is unaware of what has happened since June. Mandatory reporting has been abandoned; zero tolerance has been forgotten; the steam which epitomised the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, in Opposition has turned into hot air; the public spending controls promised by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, thankfully have been abandoned; the strategy on the 10 per cent corporation tax has been abandoned; the campaign against Sellafield has been abandoned; the extension of higher education grants to PLC students has been forgotten; and the Government has been compelled to act on public service pensions as a result of a Labour Party Private Members' Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The much vaunted relaunching of Fianna Fáil in the run up to the last election was only a smokescreen.  It was an attempt to persuade the public that it had changed, a perception the public in part accepted but one without any basis in reality.  That deception is best manifested in the proposals of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to change the rules of the electoral game to suit Fianna Fáil once the electorate had voted.  Not only is he prepared to reverse measures aimed at eliminating the brown paper bag culture in Irish politics but he has returned to that old Fianna Fáil chestnut of attempting to change the electoral system to suit that party, even though such <Col N="940" /> change has been rejected twice in the past by the people.  However, even by those low standards what we are witnessing this evening is scandalous.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not perfect despite the then Deputy Kitt's absolute conviction that it was.  We concede it requires amendment and more careful consideration. That is why the previous Government referred it to a committee, but the Government's decision not to restore the Bill to the Order Paper and to vote down the Labour Party's efforts to have it re-entered makes liars out of those who supported the Bill before the election.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents only one part of a commitment to Sunday workers made by Deputy Kitt, prior to the election.  As Deputy Broughan stated yesterday, a referendum to overcome the obstacles to a full ban on Sunday trading by large multiples identified by the previous Attorney General was also promised by Deputy Kitt, but he has been told he cannot even expect to fulfil the lesser of the two commitments given to workers. That is Fianna Fáil duplicity of the highest order.</P>
    <P>The Members opposite have a chance tonight to redeem themselves in the eyes of the electorate and the workers involved in this issue.  I do not envy them the decision they have to make.  Those people to whom they made promises are in the Public Gallery.  They know what was said to them by members of Fianna Fáil and they will expect them to fulfil those promises.  One would have thought that is not an unreasonable expectation. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years the country has experienced a period of unprecedented economic growth which has led to an increase in consumer activity.  The spending power of the public has been greatly enhanced and many shops have responded to the commercial upswing with seven day trading.  However, if a large number of shops decide to open on Sundays, it is doubtful there will be an advantage to any shop owners.  Ultimately, there is only so much money to go round and even if there is widespread Sunday opening, it is irrelevant whether there are six or seven days in which to spend it.</P>
      <P>We are increasingly under pressure to shop just because shops are open.  It is convenient to be able to catch up on shopping on a Sunday. However, the danger is that Sunday will become the same as any other day.  Consumers can choose to avoid shopping.  However, shop workers have no choice but to put up with commercialism seven days a week.  It is not in our interest as consumers to have seven days shopping.  There are strong arguments for having a break in commercial activity.  Do we really want to be bombarded seven days a week with non stop messages of how and where to spend?  We need a break from the non stop materialism which in many ways defines our working week.  We need to distinguish between weekdays and Sundays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally, Sunday is a day of rest which people spend with their families.  I understand it is almost impossible to differentiate in law between <Col N="941" /> corner shops and large multiples and in the long-term, there are strong social arguments for imposing a total ban on Sunday trading.  A full working Sunday at the expense of family life is not acceptable.  Women, who constitute the majority of shop workers, and men are undoubtedly missing out on essential family time.  People have a basic right to time with their children and partners.  They also have a basic right to time to themselves.  If there is no break in the working week, one week merges with the next and this imposes considerable personal strain on workers.</P>
    <P>Most people work a five day week, Monday to Friday, and this coincides with the time children are in school.  There is, therefore, a structure to the week and the weekend.  However, Sunday workers have no such luxury.  Sunday is the only day on which children can catch up with parents, couples can spend time together and family activities can be organised.  Undoubtedly, when Sunday is lost to work, a family day is lost.  There is no other chance to catch up on that family time. Critically, the Protection of Workers (Shops) Bill gives workers a choice in this matter and puts considerable requirements on employers.  It allows workers to decide how their Sunday should be spent and confers basic rights on workers, protecting those who work on Sunday and those who opt not to work on Sundays.  I take great pleasure in supporting the Bill.</P>

      <P>All the Bill seeks to do is to give employees an opt out from Sunday working.  It goes one step further than the Organisation <Col N="942" /> of Working Time Act, introduced by my party colleague, former Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald. This ensured that workers whose contract necessitated work on Sunday received a premium payment for it.</P>
      <P>It is correct to go one step further on this issue. While the Constitution alludes to the importance of the family and its basic responsibility for children, the House has only in recent years begun to debate the difficulties facing families in modern Ireland.  I welcome that development.  The Bill provides an opportunity to cement one aspect of families' rights, which is, if they so choose, to be able to spend one day together.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan was correct when he said last night that many families need the money brought in by working on Sundays and they have little choice but to pursue that option.  However, on balance, this is bad for society as a whole.  The truth is that the only way we can vindicate a worker's right to spend time with his or her family on a Sunday is to make illegal any measure which would compulsorily force workers to work on Sundays.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the previous Bill in the last Dáil, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, alluded to his party's track record on vindicating workers' rights.  We could debate that at length. Fianna Fáil's record in this area does not stand up well.  However, I am sure some Members on the Government benches support the measures in the Bill.  The Labour Party is now giving them an opportunity to vote for a Bill which many of them support and which they voted for in good faith last March.  They are aware the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has been shafted on this occasion and if they are seriously interested in assisting workers in this area, they must vote for the Bill tonight.  As Deputy Broughan said, workers are coming under increasing pressure to give up their Sundays.  This is confirmed by the continued industrial relations difficulties on this issue.  Given the trend in the retail sector, that pressure will worsen.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to give workers an opportunity to reassert their rights.  Many workers, particularly the young who have no family responsibilities, may not choose to exercise this right and that is their prerogative.  However, the Bill does not seek to make Sunday working illegal.  It deals with choice.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, should be commended for recognising that point in the original framing of his Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill allows for the appropriate exclusion of family enterprises and short-term employees. It is not a draconian measure.  I do not understand why the Government will not accept the Bill and refer it to a committee.  I do not doubt it contains flaws but that is the case with all Bills introduced in the House.  The only conclusion I can draw from the Government's decision is that it is opposed to the principle of the Bill.  However, I suspect that opinion is not shared by many Government backbenchers and I call on them to <Col N="943" /> exercise their muscles tonight and vote for Deputy Broughan's Bill.</P>

      <P>That the Minister of State is about to destroy his masterpiece must upset the representatives of MANDATE to whom he spoke with such sympathy and understanding when he and a number of Labour Party Deputies met them in Wynn's Hotel just before the last Government fell.  I am bewildered by Fianna Fáil's attitude to this matter.  However, it is in close accord with the attitude the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, took when he was in Opposition and the way he has been transformed since he went into Government. This is of much the same standard which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has set for us.  I set the O'Donoghue scale at the order of eight or nine equivalent to the old earthquake scale.  I give it a rating of nine O'Donoghue units, the ultimate standard having been set by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the gold standard for political about turns.</P>
      <P>It must erode the confidence of people in the political system to see such an about turn over in a short space of time.  One accepts that time moves on, circumstances change, etc., but there was no change of any substance between the time we met MANDATE representatives and they put their concerns to us and now.  It is an appalling piece of political opportunism as the Minister of State walks away from commitments.  How can people take him and Fianna Fáil seriously when they behave in this manner?  How could people have respect for what politicians say in Opposition when they behave in this manner within such a short time of entering Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is another fine example of how people's behaviour in Opposition visits them when they enter Government.  It is important that the attitudes politicians adopt in Opposition are responsible and reasonable and can be sustained and vindicated in Government.  We have seen an exhibition of the most appalling type of opportunism and tomfoolery from the Minister of State.  Most ordinary, fair minded and decent people would find the Bill worthwhile as it seeks to deal with <Col N="944" /> the stress Sunday working places on people who are forced into it against their will.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Moynihan-Cronin said, there is no obligation on people to work on Sunday and the Bill provides the opportunity for them to make the decision not to work that day and to have no deleterious implications attached to it.  That is a reasonable and basic provision.  The Bill will have important implications which were referred to by Deputy O'Shea last night when he spoke about the effects extended openings of multinational supermarkets on Sundays have for small traders. There is no doubt the grocery industry is consolidating into huge multinationals and I am not sure that is desirable.  If this trend continues &mdash; and there is considerable evidence of its expansion &mdash; the number of small traders will be reduced significantly.</P>
    <P>Our basic concern must be for those who work in this industry and no one can dispute that, for many of them, the conditions and pay levels leave great scope for improvement.  The Bill will make life easier for them by restoring the concept of people being entitled to a day off and the idea that Sunday is a day of rest.  People would prefer the opportunity to enjoy themselves rather than being forced to work against their will with very little notice or opportunity to dissent.  It is a great pity the Minister of State and the Government were seen to behave in the manner in which they did and it raises the most disturbing questions in regard to credibility in the political system.  That is also an unfortunate aspect of recent events.</P>

    <P>New shopping trends have emerged in the 1990s.  The modern family needs and demands <Col N="946" /> flexible retail shopping hours.  Everyone avails of Sunday shopping and we have come to regard it as standard practice.  We cannot tell business people and companies that they cannot trade on Sundays.  Market forces have determined and shaped the current practice of Sunday trading in large and small retail outlets and many businesses say that the additional shopping day is essential to their profitability while some say it is essential to their viability.  Other business people hold the view that there is only a certain amount of money in circulation and shoppers just spread available money over seven days instead of six.  There are similar differences in the perceptions of the staff.</P>
    <P>We cannot turn back the clock as Sunday trading is with us and here to stay.  The only way we can move forward is by agreement and consensus, we must continue to talk to the representatives of the employers and address the concerns of the trade unions representing the staff as any other approach would be neither desirable nor realistic.</P>

This is not the case because in responding to the Second Stage of the Protection of Workers (Shops) Bill, 1996, the Deputy's party colleague and then Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald, stated that the details of the Bill needed to be explored in a more mature, balanced and considered manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Bill as it stands is not workable. I am trying to give my views on this, and I hope that out of this tunnel will come the right <Col N="948" /> answer for all legislation that passes through this House.  As this Bill is constituted, it would impose restrictions on the rights of employers and employees to freely contract with each other.  For example, if an employer finds that none of his employees wishes to work on a Sunday it is normal for that employer to advertise for substitutes to take their place.  This Bill would make it illegal to do so, with the exception of someone who never works more than eight hours in any one week.  This would not be in the potential employee's interest nor would it be in the interest of the business itself which might fail, resulting in the loss of the jobs even of those employees in six-day jobs.  The Bill, if passed, could create a legal quagmire, particularly for small shopkeepers.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on his personal style in managing his brief.  His successful use of dialogue and straight talking has brought about the introduction of a code of practice in the drinks industry in relation to alcopops just this week.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has been a member of Fianna Fáil for most of his adult life and, like his father before him, represents the great tradition that is Fianna Fáil throughout the country.  However, he has added a new element to that tradition on which he might like to reflect.  History shows that Mr. de Valera, who led that party for so long and was its dominant figure, ultimately ended up voting for the things he opposed at the outset.  The Minister of State has introduced a new dimension by ending up opposing things he originally voted for.  It adds to the extraordinary intellectual and political versatility and linguistic and political agility that we have come to expect from Fianna Fáil.  However, he has done it with some style, and because of that he must be forgiven in part.  He is being directed, no doubt, by a Cabinet decision not to accept a measure which he could very easily accept and admit to Committee Stage to deal with the issues Deputy Noel O'Flynn brought to our attention.  There is no Bill that cannot be <Col N="949" /> improved on Committee Stage, no matter what side of the House it originates.</P>
      <P>The present Government is walking down a very precarious road if it thinks that negotiation by agreement through the social partners is going to produce satisfactory results.  If too much is put on the social partnership, by way of things for which agreement must be found, it will ultimately break the back of social partnership.  It is obvious that this country has had its economic prospects and fortunes transformed by social partnership. Fianna Fáil made an honourable contribution to the re-establishment of social partnership in the mid-1980s.  They did not have a monopoly on it, but they made an honourable contribution.  We are now in our fourth agreement, two of which I, along with others, helped to negotiate.</P>
      <P>There are issues arising in the social partnership that are incapable of being resolved by agreement because of the intransigence of the employers.  One of those issues is the right of trade unions to be recognised to negotiate in certain workplaces, whether foreign owned or indigenously owned.  There cannot be a partnership at national level if one side of the partnership at local level is shooting the other partner or putative partner in the foot.  The Minister of State had a golden opportunity to build confidence by accepting this Bill at Second Stage and putting it into Committee Stage.  We on this side of the House are realistic; we know that committee would not commence its work for some time into the new year, by which time some progress might have been made in the social partnership negotiations.</P>
      <P>What we are looking for is not some shop by shop agreement that can be unilaterally torn up or abandoned by one or other side.  We are looking for legislative rights for workers.  If Deputy O'Flynn wishes to adopt the kind of approach that was prevalent 50 years ago, equal pay was subject to the agreement of employers; there is not a single right a worker has today that was conceded voluntarily in the course of negotiations and that could not be taken away once the next economic storm came.  We want rights written into law, rights that reflect the proper balance between employer and employee.  For most people in our society the only thing they have to sell is their labour.  The only thing they have to bargain with is their ability to work.  The history of our society is about the slow but relentless march of people to get rights to underpin their negotiating power.  This is one small balanced step.  We want to give workers the right not to be compelled to work on Sunday but to make it an obligation to give due and proper notice and to take into account the necessity for firms to provide a service on Sunday.  There is no dispute about facilitating people's access to retail services 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  This is the modern reality and many workers derive a benefit from it.  However, this is not the issue.  Rather it is the right not to be compelled to work on Sunday when one might have other obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> The Minister is incapable of accepting that this right should be enshrined in law.  He said we should see if employers agree to it but we know they will not.  We also know what is happening in regard to the workforce in other areas of the economy.  Employers, particularly small employers, are taking social partnership for granted.</P>

      <P>We will not consolidate the extraordinary success of our society if we do not give real rights to the people who need them.  The people we are talking about are not third level graduates with fancy degrees and a high capacity to earn a good salary in the marketplace.  We are talking about people who in many cases are forced to earn additional income because the primary income in the home is not sufficient.  We are talking in the main about young people and women who take up work outside the home to augment the family income.  They are more vulnerable and intimidated and have less ability to sell their labour than others and characteristically they are part-time workers who for reasons of operational history have not been able to get the full force of the trade union labour movement behind them. School teachers and civil servants enjoy a monopoly in terms of their jobs and can exercise this through a trade union.  However, as these workers cannot rely on the normal process of labour market negotiation and bargaining between the social partners for their rights they must depend on legislation.  The Minister can give them these rights tonight by accepting this Bill.  He wanted to do it in Opposition and his former constituency colleague agreed to accept his Bill in principle. What happened in the meantime?</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to accept the Bill in principle, after which we can work out the detail.  We can also be informed by the dialogue of the social partners.  However, if they do not agree we should tell them we will provide this right for workers in law.  That is the test the Minister must pass.</P>

      <P>This is not a good night for the image of politics or the Minister, Deputy Kitt, who has effectively committed political hara-kiri on the work he undertook in Opposition.  We strive to improve the image of politicians and to make their words their bond.  Yet we are now faced with an appalling situation where a person who gave a pledge in regard to this matter last March is reneging on it.</P>
      <P>In its newsletter MANDATE gave prominent coverage to the Minister's Bill on Sunday working. It stated: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil's Tom Kitt, the party spokesperson on Labour Affairs, has published a Private Members' Bill.&rdquo; It went on to elucidate the key principle of the Bill, voluntary working on Sunday.  It is appalling that the Minister has totally reneged on his word.</P>
      <P>There has been an unbelievable sequence of events since the Bill was published last November. The Minister told us in March that having consulted widely among the social partners, ICTU, IBEC, RGDATA etc., he decided the principle of voluntarism was the way forward in regard to Sunday working.  During the debate on his Bill he castigated the rainbow Government and the then Minister, Eithne Fitzgerald, yet six months later he has reneged on every statement he made that night.  This is an embarrassing climb-down by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The way the Taoiseach pointed at us this morning when we raised this matter gave the impression that he had overruled the Minister and that he and his colleagues had decided not to allow him to come forward with the Bill.  In view of this perhaps the Minister should consider his position.  Is this a resignation matter?

      <P>The Bill significantly advances the rights of some of the most vulnerable workers in society, mainly young people and women on short-term contracts.  Those are the people the Minister has failed.  Under sections 4 and 8 of his Bill he proposed to give them a basic protection, a voluntary opt-out from compulsory Sunday working.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech contained much waffle which I presume was written by the bureaucrats in his Department.  According to it he suddenly saw the light in Government following some obscure consultations with the social partners.  He effectively hid behind the former Minister, Eithne Fitzgerald, and spent most of his time rightly commending her for the advances she made in the Organisation of Working Time Act.  She also accepted the Deputy's Bill and sent it to committee. Having returned to Government, the Minister outrageously abandoned the position he held in Opposition.</P>

      <P>Heavy traffic flows could be relieved by investing in our national road structure.  The large volume of traffic in Dublin, Cork and other urban centres is strangling our economy.  An industrialist told me recently he would not set up industry in Tralee because it is too difficult to get to and from Dublin Airport.  We must invest in the road structure that serves the airport because it is vital to all parts of the country.</P>
      <P>We should also invest in the visual as well as the fixed environment by improving the appearance of our towns and cities and providing green areas and urban forestry.  As we have the necessary information, it is up to us to pass on a healthy environment to our children.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Clune for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  Large sections of the population would argue the Book of Estimates is a ritual, a few increases and reductions here and there.  While it may not have a great impact on the public, it has an impact on Departments in terms of the amount of resources they are given to do the job of Government.  I welcome the additional expenditure provided for in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>As in recent years, this year's Book of Estimates is a reflection of the prudent economic decisions taken in the late 1980s.  At that time a political consensus was achieved on the crucial issues facing our economy and we are now enjoying the results.  Given that we achieved consensus then on taking the correct but difficult fiscal path, surely we should reach another consensus now about poverty, social deprivation and helping those who have not benefited from the economic boom of the last few years.  That consensus would tackle long-term unemployment, social disadvantage in education, the drugs menace and the other problems afflicting rural and urban area.  A residual group of the population has not benefited one iota from our economy and now that we have an opportunity to make a difference for that sector, we should do so.  Money should be put into the areas where people have not benefited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in jobs have gained much over the last few years &mdash; they now take two holidays a year and have two cars &mdash; but if they want to preserve their prosperity they should ensure that everyone gets a fair share.  In recent years, however, an underclass has been left outside the consensus. The Clondalkin partnership report showed that in parts of my constituency and other urban constituencies, one third of ten and 11 year olds do not attend school on a regular basis.  How could our society have allowed this to develop?  This is why it was crucial in this Book of Estimates that money was put directly into areas of social need through education.  I am, therefore, disappointed <Col N="956" /> in the provisions in the Education Estimate, in particular those for primary schools.</P>
    <P>In many parts of my constituency, the long-term unemployed have been brought back to work by way of community employment schemes. Deputies on all sides acknowledge this is an excellent way to bring people quickly back into the workforce.  The Estimates provide for a 2 to 3 per cent increase for these schemes, as opposed to the massive increase given to the IDA.  It is understandable that moneys should be put directly into the IDA to bring jobs to Ireland but the additional money going to community employment, to benefit the people suffering most from long-term unemployment, is paltry by comparison. This represents a failure on the part of Government &mdash; I do not say this in a political way, it applies to all Governments &mdash; to give priority to poverty and the underclass who have not gained from our economy.</P>
    <P>The anti-drugs provision is another example. The last Government was the first to address the problem seriously but there has been no increase to those funds in the Book of Estimates.  That is another priority which has been overlooked.  I welcome the increase in the resources given to local authorities to increase the new start housing programmes next year.  However, this will not make a huge difference to the thousands of people on the housing lists for South Dublin, Kerry or Dublin Corporation.  On the key issues of community employment, school attendance, education, anti-drug programmes &mdash; vitally important to the areas ravaged by this menace &mdash; and housing, we have a great opportunity to ensure that proper resources are provided for these communities.  Let us not fail because the opportunity will not come again.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Callely.  I welcome the increased funding for housing provided in the 1998 Estimates.  The total provision of £453 million in 1998 represents an increase of almost 14 per cent on the estimated expenditure this year and reflects the Government's commitment in an action programme to providing a suitable standard of accommodation for all our people.  Over £214 million has been provided for the local authority housing programme, an increase of £40 million or nearly 23 per cent on the estimated expenditure for 1997. It will enable local authorities to meet commitments on their ongoing programmes and to fund a programme of 3,900 new starts or acquisitions in 1998 compared to an outturn of about 3,500 in the current year.  This level of funding is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities as provided for in its action programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, of major improvements to voluntary and other social housing schemes. Highlights of this package include new maximum levels of assistance to voluntary housing bodies <Col N="957" /> under the capital assistance scheme which exceed the previous levels by amounts ranging from £5,000 to £15,000 per unit of accommodation; wider income limits, lower rents, higher unit cost limits and a higher level of ongoing support for voluntary housing under the rental subsidy scheme; a 50 per cent increase in funding for communal facilities in voluntary housing projects; an increased income limit for the shared ownership scheme, with an increased level of subsidy which will assist shared owners to meet higher house prices; a £5,000 increase in the maximum local authority house purchase loan and an increased income limit.</P>
    <P>This Government's priority is to ensure that households have access to affordable, good quality housing.  The terms and conditions of the social housing schemes have not been updated since 1995 and have fallen out of line with building costs and house prices.  This is leading to a slow down in social housing provision which must not be allowed to continue.  I congratulate the Minister of State for reviewing the schemes and delivering major improvements to the range of social housing options.  These measures are in addition to the major increases in funding for the local authority housing programme announced in the context of the 1998 Estimates.  The package will restore reality to the local authority housing schemes, ensure their expanded use and provide an opportunity for social housing in locations where it had not previously been attempted.</P>
    <P>The housing package has some excellent points.  Under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme, voluntary housing bodies are assisted with non-repayable capital funding from local authorities to provide accommodation, usually one or two bedroomed units, to meet special housing needs such as those of elderly people with disabilities, homeless persons or smaller families.  The maximum levels of capital assistance have been increased from 1 July last.  For one and two person units, the limit has risen from £27,000 to £32,000; for family-type houses and traveller bays, the limit has risen from £33,000 to £40,000.  Special grants are available for communal facilities; where works have commenced on or after 1 July 1997 suitable proposals may qualify for grants of up to 90 per cent of the approved cost of the works, or a total equivalent of not more than £3,000 for each unit.</P>
    <P>Under the voluntary housing rental subsidy scheme, such bodies are assisted with loan finance and subsidies from local authorities to provide housing for renting, particularly to meet the needs of low income families.  The basic income for eligibility for a tenancy has been increased from £9,000 to £10,000 with effect from 13 November 1997.  No income limit will apply to 25 per cent of applicants provided they are approved applicants for local authority housing.  A new rent formula, backdated to the subsidy year commencing 1 July 1997, reduces the rent chargeable from 20p to 18p for each £1 of income over £80 per week.  The <Col N="958" /> formula also reduces rents chargeable in respect of subsidiary earners.</P>
    <P>The recent announcement of the education technology investment fund by the Government represents a major commitment by the State to the future of the information technology industry. It is widely accepted the investment will go a long way towards resolving the major educational bottleneck which has threatened growth in the industry.  The fund is a response from Government to the concerns expressed by the indigenous and multinational IT industry that inadequate resources were being given to the technology education area, and will also be directed at the more general problem of emerging labour shortages.</P>
    <P>The investment fund is £250 million: £100 million in 1998 and the balance over the following two years.  The breakdown is as follows: £60 million for additional places at both technician and degree levels in the computer software industry; £20 million in accommodation and equipment needs in the hotel and tourism sector; £20 million to support apprenticeship places; £80 million to renew and develop the infrastructure in the third level technological sector; £30 million for a major equipment renewal programme in third level institutions; £15 million to meet the capital needs of promoting research and development and technology transfer; and £25 million, balanced between capital investment and investment in teacher training in first and second level schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, is to be congratulated.  He has said funding will be allocated on the basis of priorities developed in consultation with industry and education.  I support the appeal by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to the corporate sector, particularly high-tech industry, to contribute to the new fund.  She stated &ldquo;through the fund the taxpayer will invest heavily in the quality of our education system and its graduate output will be of enormous benefit to business&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent review of public service pensions.  Almost 77,000 retired public servants are to receive pension improvements averaging about £300 a year, at an annual cost of £23 million to the Exchequer, as the Government has decided to bring pension improvements into line with recent public sector pay deals.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has explained that public servants who retired before restructuring deals were agreed under the PCW will now receive <i>pro rata</i> increases in their pensions.  In addition to the £23 million current cost of the improvements, back payments totalling the same amount are due to the vast majority of the 77,000 retired public servants.</P>
    <P>The control of farmyard pollution scheme was introduced in 1994 and proved to be very popular, resulting in more than 18,000 applications. The available funding was insufficient to meet the unprecedented demand and this was acknowledged in the mid-term review process, with the <Col N="959" /> scheme getting priority status.  This resulted in an extra £20 million being allocated to the scheme which will go a long way towards meeting existing commitments.  I hope the Minister will make provision for further funding for this very important scheme.</P>
    <P>There have been 8,000 applicants to the dairy hygiene scheme since it was introduced in 1994. The available funding was insufficient to meet the unprecedented demand for this scheme also, which was acknowledged in the mid-term review process which gave the scheme priority status. This resulted in an extra £8 million being allocated to the scheme which will go a long way towards meeting existing commitments.</P>
    <P>The scheme of early retirement from farming is operated under Council regulation 2079/92.  It provides an incentive for older farmers to cease farming and pass on their farms to younger trained farmers who, thereby, enlarge their holdings to create more viable units.  To date, 6,750 applicants have joined the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers was one of the submeasures operated under the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry 1994-9.  The programme had an indicative budget of £17 million for the scheme and was launched in December 1994.  It was expected that about 3,000 young farmers would participate.  By 1 September 1997 a total of 3,100 young farmers had been paid almost £17 million under the scheme.  In addition, there are about 600 other applications being processed currently, with a potential grant commitment of about £3.5 million.</P>
    <P>The Department, as part of its submission to the mid-term review, sought additional funds in the region of £10 million to enable the continuation of the scheme.  This was additional to the funds sought in other areas where the level of applications had already exceeded the level of available funds.  The mid-term review took on board the views of an independent evaluation report, along with a report prepared on the operation of the first half of the operational programme completed by Fitzpatrick and Associates, both of which recommended the suspension of the scheme.  Accordingly, it did not make any additional funds available for the continuation of the scheme.  I hope the Minister will reconsider this situation and make the necessary funding available.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on the clear picture he has given of the position for 1998.  I welcome his statement that &ldquo;the prudent budgetary policies which have done so much for the success of the economy will be maintained&rdquo;.  We all appreciate what can go wrong if budgets are not adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has enjoyed unprecedented economic progress.  While it may be difficult to enjoy the same levels of progress in the years ahead, we should be able to maintain and enjoy the fruits of <Col N="960" /> such progress, if they are handled properly, for many years to come.  It is equally important to continue to attract significant investment to support our future development.</P>
    <P>It is very encouraging to see the demand for personnel in the various employment sectors.  It is important we use these opportunities to ensure real and lasting jobs and training in the years ahead.  I emphasise the need to be more innovative in the area of training.  It has been brought to my attention that we should revisit the area of apprenticeships and examine the available opportunities, particularly in the current climate.</P>
    <P>I give a cautious welcome to the Health Estimate, particularly the additional funding received in 1997.  It is important to focus on the need, particularly in Dublin, for improved step down facilities, which is causing the blockage in the acute hospital beds and having an impact on the accident and emergency services and elective procedures. It is only with appropriate step down facilities that we will see real progress in this area. It has a serious impact on waiting lists.  It is very sad to read that many people die while on waiting lists for long stay beds, cardiac operations or other procedures, which is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Many Members of this House must be tired of having to raise the issue of the mentally handicapped. Someone in a position of authority, whether it is a Minister or a Minister of State, will have to address this issue appropriately and put in place a proper care programme over a given period of time, so that the carers, loved ones, spouses, partners and families of the mentally handicapped will know the level of care to be provided in the years ahead.  Members understand what I am saying in this regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the area of justice and crime, particularly drug related crime.  I have spoken in the House on many occasions on this matter but we need to see great improvements.</P>
    <P>The various housing programmes and schemes, especially the shared ownership scheme, merit alterations to qualification levels.  There are huge numbers on waiting lists.  Most politicians have encountered sad situations involving the denial or provision of inappropriate accommodation in overcrowded conditions.</P>
    <P>The car scrappage scheme resulted in the submission of 42,000 cars for scrapping.  It also generated almost £100 million in revenue.  Given this, and the ensuing improvements to driving on the roads, I have requested the Minister to review the abolition of the scheme.</P>
    <P>According to the Estimates, an additional £122 million is to be spent on social welfare.  Will the Minister ensure that it is given to those who have served the country well and have paid into the system but are on restricted incomes at the latter end of their lives?  It will enable them to enjoy the benefits of the current economic climate</P>
    <P>The current spending on asylum seekers is a misuse of taxpayers' money.  Expenditure by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs alone amounts to more than £25 million. <Col N="961" /> A couple of Deputies present in the Chamber who criticised me this morning for my views on this are seeking benefit payments.</P>
    <P>I support our international obligations, including adherence to the 1951 convention, and am proud of Ireland's humanitarian understanding and accommodation of genuine refugees. However, it is wrong that it takes over two years to process applications by asylum seekers for refugee status.</P>

      <P>A mechanism must be provided to ensure the necessary supports for genuine refugees.</P>
      <P>I am dismayed at the manner in which a leading national newspaper presented my views on this issue in an unfair and untrue manner.  It attributed views to me which are incorrect.  By contrast, Jerome Reilly's article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, 25 November was fair and balanced.  It arose from a press release where I called for a halt to the misuse of millions of pounds of taxpayer's money on asylum seekers.  I issued the press release following receipt of a report from the Eastern Health Board indicating that it takes over two years to process an asylum application.  It stated Ireland is the only European country experiencing a continuing increase in the number of asylum seekers and went on to say that in 1997 the proportion of asylum seekers here will be higher than that in most European countries.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that genuine refugees obtain appropriate support.  However, it is unfair that large numbers of asylum seekers &mdash; over 3,000 &mdash; who may not be genuine and who are probably attracted to Ireland because of its welfare state are enjoying its welfare provisions, including supplementary welfare benefits and medical cards. Our own hard pressed, retired pensioners and those on waiting lists see others enjoy the fruits of the present economic climate, including their enjoyment of the use of private rented accommodation paid for by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs through the health boards.  I ask those Deputies who hypocritically criticised my statement this morning &mdash; to be honest and acknowledge that my request is reasonable.</P>

      <P>They are especially inappropriate in this debate.  We are discussing the revised Estimates for the various Departments.  The Estimate for the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation provides for a revised sum of £89,323,000.</P>
      <P>The tourism outturn for many areas proved to be much greater than estimated.  There is the possibility here of a new potential growth industry in tourism development.  Selling Ireland abroad is one of Bord Fáilte's primary roles.  It is essential that efforts are renewed to ensure that areas of slack this year will be counteracted by more positive selling, including ascertaining the difficulties experienced by tourists, whether over pricing by the hotel industry, as cited in a recent article, or the terrible litter problem which costs local authorities millions of pounds to address.</P>
      <P>We all have a responsibility to ensure that our agencies abroad sell a product of Ireland that contains a clean and environmentally friendly atmosphere which will attract tourists from all over the world.  While the European and North American market has been successful in the past, we are not investing enough in the emerging markets in Asia and Australia, especially with regard to tourism promotion.  Five times more tourists visit the UK than Ireland.  My former colleague Michael Moynihan, who previously fulfilled a ministerial role in tourism, had an ingenious idea that people visiting the UK should be encouraged to continue their journey to Ireland for a small sum.  This could be done by ingenious product selling abroad.</P>
      <P>We have no idea of the numbers visiting Ireland, nor the reasons for their visit.  Tourism figures are compiled from formulae which have no basis in fact.  Other countries go to the trouble to ascertain from where and why visitors travel and how long they intend to stay, whether it be for business or pleasure.  I will have more to say on this subject since I have been given responsibility by my party leader to develop this industry. Part of the tourism industry involves sport.  With the Tour de France coming to Ireland next year we will have to meet the various public bodies in Cork, Tipperary, Wicklow or Dublin to ascertain their needs.  The Departments will have to ensure the necessary finance is made available, for this once in a lifetime opportunity to sell Ireland to 500 million or 600 million television viewers.  We must spare no effort to project Ireland in its best image.  There are individual projects about which I am concerned in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promises were made before the election and people are upset when they are not fulfilled.  The Seán Kelly sports centre was funded in the past by the Department of Education.  Fianna Fáil promised the deficit would be made up.  I want that deficit made up.  There is also a deficit in the Excel project.  Fianna Fáil said it would fund the Excel project in full &mdash; an indication that I could not do it.  I ask the Minister, Deputy McDaid, to address that problem and the whole area of funding <Col N="963" /> for sports complexes which are dependent on FÁS workers and other agencies.  We have to look at the areas of recreation and sport and ensure they are properly funded.  I look forward to one of the greatest sporting years in Irish history in 1998.  The Minister who is committed to this area can be assured of my assistance.  I shall continue to urge him on to better deeds.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  As spokesperson for social, community and family affairs I propose to deal with social welfare issues. It is obvious I will not be able to deal with all the issues.</P>
      <P>We are considering an estimate of £2,724 million to provide services in respect of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. People who would not be fully acquainted with the wide cross section of the community who are either totally or partially dependent on payments from the Department may consider this expenditure is of huge proportion in a population of 3.5 million.  On examination of the allowances paid to individuals, on benefit or assistance, one is immediately struck by the inadequacies of such allowances to provide even frugal comfort for these people.  In view of the anticipated buoyancy of the economy that section of the population which is dependent on these payments from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs &mdash; the marginalised in society &mdash; look to the Minister for Finance on budget day for increases in their allowances to enable them to have a reasonable standard of living.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain items A.7 and A.8 in the Estimate, consultancy and agency services, which involve a total estimated expenditure of £31,375 million?  This appears to be a huge sum for one year.</P>
      <P>In regard to old age non-contributory pensions, I am concerned about the existing regulations governing the assessment of income from savings. The assessment is 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent. Given the low interest rates &mdash; approximately 1 per cent &mdash; and since the majority of old age pensioners do not have savings, will the Minister change the regulation and assess the income to the actual interest earned by the savings?  If the Minister knows where pensioners can get 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent interest on their savings I am sure he will let them know.</P>

      <P>This is the Minister's chance.  If the regulation is not changed I am concerned that old people will revert to the practice of keeping money at home.  This is not acceptable because of the high number of robberies and assaults on the elderly, particularly in rural areas.  Changing this regulation would entice pensioners to lodge their savings in some financial institution.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider allowing widows and women in the home the opportunity to participate on FÁS and community employment schemes?  Widows on contributory pensions, who are technically lone parents, are debarred from participating in such schemes because they are not considered to be on the live register.  This anomaly is unjust, particularly at a time when widows could benefit from the extra income as well as the opportunity to get out of the house for some time each day.  This is discrimination.  I appeal to the Minister to address the matter of widows and women in the home.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the problem of participants in FÁS schemes who, following the completion of such schemes, are penalised in that they are denied certain payments such as the Christmas bonus, butter vouchers and free fuel. The greatest anomaly is that they will be denied a weekly allowance for their dependent children over 18 years who are in full time education.  It is unthinkable that these participants who were previously entitled to this allowance will no longer receive it.  It is as if we are asking them not to send their children to school.</P>
      <P>The estimated increases for 1998 show only a modest increase on the 1997 expenditure.  We must await the decision on budget day to see how the Estimates will reflect the income of the various recipients.  I sincerely hope and expect the Celtic tiger will deliver a substantial increase to everyone in receipt of social welfare payments and that the Government will fulfil all the promises made to the people in June.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate, with particular reference to my brief, agriculture, food and rural development.  I strongly believe that the thrust of budgetary changes should be to make farming attractive to the rapidly increasing number of young farmers who are no longer prepared to pursue a career in farming because of the hardships involved.  These are real hardships, not imaginary or illusory, as some people would have us believe.  The figures are evidence of the fall in the number of young people participating in farming.  There has been a fall in the number of farmers under the age of 35 from 14 per cent, or 21,600, in 1994, to 12 per cent, or 18,000, in 1996. The fall is continuing and is reinforced by those who have a knowledge of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> In September, for the first time in a number of years, it became clear young people are not pursuing a career in farming because the agricultural colleges are not able to fill all their places for training young farmers.  That fall is being accelerated.  A ludicrous decision of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in August to suspend installation aid for young farmers has exacerbated the situation.  I do not know on what basis or on what report that decision was based.  I challenge the Minister to lay those reports before the House so that we can debate them because I believe they are not founded on a correct premise.  This decision was a retrograde step.  Since 1986, 5,741 young farmers had taken up the scheme.  The lump sum involved, £5,600, was extremely useful in meeting transfer costs, legal fees and tax liabilities and in financing necessary on-farm investment.  Some who expected to benefit were short-changed.  I know of a young man with the necessary qualifications who encountered problems in having the matter of title relating to a Land Commission farm resolved.  It was his intention to use the lump sum to pay off large arrears owed to the Land Commission and thus remain on the farm but he lost out.</P>
    <P>The decision taken by the Government was disgraceful. The Minister for Finance should reintroduce the scheme in the budget on Wednesday next at a cost of between £5 million and £6 million per year.  The Government took in an extra £700 million this year.  It should give back 0.75 per cent of this to young farmers to give them their day in the sun.</P>

      <P>The Government parties should honour their pre-election commitment to reintroduce the control of farmyard pollution scheme. Approximately 18,000 benefited under the previous scheme.  The Government parties also gave a commitment to reintroduce the dairy hygiene scheme.  It is extremely important that the control of farmyard pollution scheme is reintroduced to help farmers qualify for the REP scheme under which the installation of proper anti-pollution facilities is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is critical that incentives are provided to encourage people to remain in rural areas, a matter close to the heart of the Minister of State and one on which he was vociferous when in Opposition for which I give him credit.  He was also vociferous on the issue raised by my colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin.  As the Minister for Finance does not favour the introduction of a scheme similar to the urban renewal scheme I ask him to consider the possibility of introducing a pilot scheme under which the new house grant would be doubled to provide people with an incentive to build in rural areas.  This would help to keep Garda stations, schools and churches open and local football teams going.  If the trend <Col N="966" /> of degeneration is not reversed rural Ireland will be decimated.  The inter-family lease arrangements under the farm retirement scheme should be changed and the enlargement clause deleted while the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should give a firm commitment that no further rural Garda station will be closed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed increase in spending under the REP scheme which is demand-led and note that a sum of £6.5 million is earmarked for the national beef scheme in 1998 to put a computerised system in place for the identification and registration of cattle.  This should help to reassure consumers.</P>
    <P>When Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the former leader of the Labour Party was subjected to vitriolic abuse from Fianna Fáil on the reopening of live export markets.  What has the Minister for Agriculture and Food done to honour the commitments given in the Red Cow Inn on the Naas dual carriageway in the presence of 1,000 farmers?</P>

      <P>The strong performance of the economy is unprecedented.  It is predicted to grow by 7 per cent this year.  With inflation running at 1.5 per cent and interest rates at an all-time low we are in a sound financial position.</P>
      <P>We should reflect on how this economic miracle was achieved.  I remember the bad days when inflation was rampant, interest rates were at an all-time high and the future looked bleak.  The seeds of revival were sown in 1987 by the then minority Fianna Fáil Government.  Successive Governments have followed its policy of managing the national finances prudently.  I pay special tribute to the social partners for their contribution through the various national wage agreements. This should be recognised in considering the Book of Estimates.  To them I say well done. We must ensure the prudent management of the national finances continues into the next millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important item to be dealt with in the forthcoming budget is that of taxation.  At the last election all political parties, including my <Col N="967" /> own, entered into a contract with the public and gave a firm commitment to tackle the issue.  We must honour this commitment.  One can argue about whether the higher or lower rate of tax should be reduced or whether the tax bands should be widened but the burden on PAYE taxpayers has to be reduced.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance that the issue of social welfare is addressed.  There has been much talk about the Celtic tiger, a title I am beginning to hate.  Many people, particularly in rural areas, feel left out and that they are not sharing in its success. The marginalised, the poor, the long-term unemployed, old age pensioners, widows and widowers and those in receipt of social welfare payments seem to have been left behind.  I have been saying for years that there is an anomaly in the system, that benefits such as free electricity, free television licence and free travel have not been extended to widows and widowers and those in receipt of disability pension but nothing has been done in the past ten years to rectify it.  The time is now right to extend these benefits to the people concerned.  I call on the Minister for Finance to ensure this is done in the budget.</P>
    <P>For ten years the fuel allowance has remained unchanged.  One can buy very little with the weekly payment of £5.  Applicants are refused the allowance for the silliest of reasons, for example, where they are in receipt of a small retirement pension.  That should be addressed in the budget.</P>
    <P>An increase of 2 per cent, 3 per cent or 5 per cent is fine for somebody with an annual income of £100,000 but for somebody on, say, £68 per week, it amounts to very little.  For years the gap has become ever wider between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;, to the extent that now we have a two-tier society and those at the bottom of the scale feel quite aggrieved and hard done by.  This is something else that must be addressed in the budget.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the carer's allowance paid to people providing a very valuable service to the community if properly administered saves the State money in the long-term, but there are many anomalies in the system.  The means test is fairly severe.  For example family members looking after their loved ones, perhaps elderly parents, but who work and return home in the evening, are not deemed eligible for the carer's allowance even though they are contributing to keeping elderly people out of hospital a solution which would cost the Exchequer a much larger sum.</P>
    <P>People who provide home help in my region are paid £2 per hour, a miserly sum by any standard, another matter which should be investigated. It is ludicrous that carers also in receipt of unemployment assistance will have that allowance deducted from the assistance payment.  That must also be addressed.</P>
    <P>All Members are only too well aware of the huge hospital waiting lists which appear to become ever longer regardless of what funds are <Col N="968" /> made available to the various health boards. People are awaiting hip replacements, heart operations, and smaller operations.  In the case of public patients the waiting lists appear to be an insurmountable obstacle in their endeavours to gain admission.  I call on the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that some emergency programme is implemented to correct this problem.</P>
    <P>I suppose most Members become somewhat parochial when speaking on the Estimates.  I will refer to the orthopaedic hospital in Kilcreene in my constituency whose services I understand are being transferred to the Regional Hospital in Waterford.  I am most unhappy about that proposal. Those services should be retained at St. Luke's Hospital Kilkenny with appropriate funds being provided for its upgrading.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris spoke at length about his brief on sport, tourism and recreation.  I drew up a policy document now regarded as the blueprint for the new Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation whose underlying thrust was to deploy the functions and activities of that Department to divert young people from many social problems particularly by the dangers of the use and misuse of drugs.  From the Book of Estimates, I am happy to note in this respect some progress has been made, particularly in the case of the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Flood, who will work in disadvantaged areas, through the many voluntary workers in this field. I am disappointed with the level of grant aid for the recreational facilities scheme, one of the best ever introduced here.  I suppose it is understandable given the unfortunate reneging by the former Minister on his promises, having spent some £9.5 million for election purposes.</P>
    <P>I refer to the on-farm investment schemes, particularly the installation aid grant which I am confident will be reinstated since it was a commitment in our election manifesto which should be honoured along with the commitment to control farmyard pollution and establish the dairy hygiene schemes.</P>

I hope the policy document issued by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, will be implemented.  It will go a long way to solving many problems.</P>
      <P>This Government is presented with a golden opportunity in its forthcoming budget.  While there appears to be a general perception that there is a great deal of money in the Exchequer unless it is directed to the more worthy and deserving within our society, we shall have failed our people.  I know the Minister for Finance will certainly address those issues on budget day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>We talk about the Celtic tiger, buoyant revenue, unprecedented growth, low rates of inflation, interest and falling unemployment. Nonetheless there are those within our society who have fallen very far behind because of that rapid growth within our economy, in particular elderly social welfare recipients in recent years.  Since the establishment of the Commission on Social Welfare in the 1980s, against a backdrop of a very depressed economy, the recent economic boom has brought the country much prosperity.  Unfortunately, we continue to base social welfare payments on the recommendations of that commission made some time ago.  Social welfare recipients, particularly the elderly, have been left well behind and the Government is afforded a golden opportunity to address that position once and for all.  We must remember that Celtic tigers will come and go but we shall always have the elderly within our society.</P>
      <P>The essential housing grants and security systems introduced for the elderly alleviate their anxieties and concerns.  As people become older and less mobile, they are more vulnerable to crime and are afraid of falling in their homes and so on.</P>
      <P>People speak about social inclusion, but there is also social exclusion in that there is now a huge school truancy problem in urban areas and there appears to be no means by which the appropriate legislation can be enforced to ensure their attendance. This truancy tends to lead to petty crime. All the surveys, analyses and statistics show that those who drop out of school at an early age become involved in petty crime straightaway, leading to larger scale crimes.  On examining the circumstances or lifestyles of for instance a drug baron, very often one discovers that person fell by the wayside, having dropped out of the educational system at a very early age.</P>
      <P>The overall problem of drugs must be seriously addressed.  Indeed for far too long, like the ostrich, we kept our heads in the sand, and failed to recognise the scourge plaguing our society. Heroin is a problem encountered at a very early age.  Yet the authorities, successive Governments, even the Garda refused to acknowledge the existence of a huge problem particularly in Dublin inner city which has led to a total breakdown of social order in certain areas.  I recommend the provision of proper treatment facilities, with the extension of methadone programmes, in addition to psychiatric and counselling services not only for drug addicts but for their families, the latter being crucial to the proper care and rehabilitation of a drug addict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, has been referred to as the million dollar man.  I understand the figure for education and science is £250,000,000 so perhaps we should call him the billion dollar man.  That is an acknowledgement of the fact that this economy is growing at a rapid pace.  There is a great deal of prosperity and we are getting much inward investment, but we must invest in technology, <Col N="970" /> training and retraining.  There will be golden opportunities for the long-term unemployed if proper training facilities are put in place.</P>
    <P>The whole area of computerisation and computer literacy must be seriously examined.  We must encourage private investment in education in addition to State funding.  We must put computers in schools and set up classes for the young and people who have not had the opportunity to attend such classes in the past.  That vacuum must be filled.</P>
    <P>The problems affecting people with mental handicap have been referred to.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the many parents and other family members who spend long hours looking after family members with a disability or a mental handicap.  That must be acknowledged because for too long we have neglected these people who are entitled to the full support of the State in addition to whatever services they require.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that I had to rush my maiden speech.  I would like to have dealt with issues such as agriculture, dairy hygiene grants, control of farmyard pollution grants and installation aid.  I believe Deputy Penrose might yet vote with us on budget day.</P>

      <P>In our wildest expectations some years ago none of us could have anticipated the contribution made by the Minister for Finance in which he set out an optimistic prospect in the Estimates for the coming year.  He certainly offered hope in dealing with many of the major problems in the economy over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the drop in unemployment and I want to draw attention to the fact that even though there has been a major drop in unemployment levels and a dramatic increase in the number of employment opportunities created, a significant number of young people, particularly in the west, cannot obtain employment. It is important not to neglect investment in the capital programme to ensure that infrastructural investments in western areas in particular are expedited.</P>
      <P>The current trend in the Department of Finance is to indicate some type of curtailment of the incentive schemes introduced some years ago to direct finances into disadvantaged areas.  I pay tribute to the seaside resorts scheme which has been extremely important in attracting development to resort areas.  In Kilkee, approximately £18 million to £20 million worth of projects will be unable to proceed unless the seaside resorts scheme is renewed or extended.  In relation to incentive schemes generally, it is important that the Minister examines capital allowances to enable infrastructural investments to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, when the Government was unable to provide the capital to build offices for Government staff, a scheme was initiated <Col N="971" /> whereby the private sector was encouraged to design, finance and build offices.  That scheme saved the taxpayer enormous amounts of money. Such an initiative could be extended for the provision of services such as sewerage systems in small villages.  If capital allowances were given to builders under those type of initiatives, they could be incorporated in schemes such as the seaside resorts renewal scheme.  In that way, the capital needed by the State would be provided by the private sector thereby enabling much of the infrastructural work to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to make a plea on behalf of charitable organisations which have lobbied all Members of the House to get tax concessions on corporate donations to charitable organisations.  I ask the Minister for Finance to look favourably on that request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I want to make some points in relation to my own brief on marine and natural resources because in the debate on the Estimates, fishermen are often forgotten.  Of all occupations, fishing is one of the most hazardous.  Anyone watching the news tonight will be aware of the difficulties currently facing fishermen, as expressed by the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, because of the various restrictions imposed on them.  Those restrictions appear to be impacting on one segment of the fishing community, namely, the fish catchers.  There seems to be a considerable gap in the profits made between the net and the fork.  In other words, the processors and distributors are making money while the catchers of the fish are not doing so well.  They are the people who have to fish in all kinds of weather.  Quota restrictions are badly affecting fishermen also.</P>
      <P>In their programme for Government, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats promised to ban all flagships.  It is questionable whether that can be achieved because under the Treaty of Rome, people have freedom of access.  The current position, however, is that approximately 150 foreign flagships are fishing in Irish waters, plundering our fish stocks and landing the fish on foreign shores under the quotas of the United Kingdom or Spain.  Parallel with that problem, the fish processors, as a result of the instability of white fish supplies throughout the year, are buying from countries which have fished over their quotas and from countries where no restrictions apply.  The fishermen, therefore, face many difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem is that many of our fishing vessels tend to be very old.  The former Minister, Deputy Barrett, did excellent work in the marine area.  He initiated the marine fishing safety review which concluded that 64 per cent of the fishing <Col N="972" /> fleet had safety deficiencies.  In a Fianna Fáil manifesto produced by Deputy Michael Smith, he referred to the consideration of providing some type of electronic location device for fishermen at sea.  I ask the Minister to respond in regard to one particular measure which is important to fishermen from a safety point of view, namely, the provision of radio control equipment for fishing vessels at sea, the overall cost of which has been estimated at approximately £6 million.  That would be a significant gesture because many of the recommendations in the fishing vessels safety review will impact considerably on fishermen.  If they do not have the necessary resources they will be unable to implement those recommendations and it is important to send out a positive signal to fishermen.</P>
    <P>Fishing is a hazardous occupation and each year fishermen have to travel further out to sea. Many vessels have been lost and anything we can do to assist our fishermen with regard to safety is extremely important.  I invite the Minister to consider that.  Although we are spending some money on the modernisation of vessels, many vessels require basic safety equipment and refurbishment.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to properly invest in ships for fishermen because of the constraints that exist with regard to European Union and national funding and the differential which must be met by the owners of particular ships who want to improve and upgrade their vessels.  Many owners cannot meet those demands.  If we are serious in our intention, we will have to provide greater incentives to fishermen.  In countries such as Scotland and Spain, owners are building bigger vessels and are encouraged to do so.</P>
    <P>In the budget I hope the Minister for Finance will introduce a business expansion scheme or some additional financial incentives for business people to invest in fishing vessels.  Bankers are reluctant to invest in the white fishing fleet in particular because they do not consider it will yield a sound return on their investment.  The Minister for the Marine must give serious consideration to what can be done to meet the needs of our fishermen. There will not be an incentive for fishermen to fish in the future and the fishing industry is important to our economy.  Many of our fishermen live in areas in the south west, the south, the north west and the west and are a vital cog in the economies of those communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my Front Bench colleague, Deputy Finucane, for sharing his time. The Minister for Finance and the Government are in a fortunate financial position.  When they come to finalise budgetary policy in the next few days they will have an unprecedented amount of financial resources available.  For the first time in the history of the State a Government will be able to consider different choices in how resources should be allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> I wish to dwell on budgetary and financial policy and how it will impact on the elderly.  A growing number of our people are facing difficulties and it is hoped that as a result of our Celtic tiger economy the Government will be in a position to address their problems.  I strongly support Deputy Moynihan-Cronin about the means testing of social welfare allowances, in particular the means testing of pensions.  It is bizarre to have a system of means testing which provides that moneys can be assessed at 15 per cent.  We all know that no investment here yields a return of 15 per cent.  An improvement was made to the system of means testing by the former Minister, Deputy De Rossa, last year, but we need to go further and introduce a fair means test whereby money is assessed at what it would be worth.  We all know that is not 15 per cent or even the current 7 per cent minimal rate of assessment.  The rate of assessment should be more akin to rates in the marketplace.  Money should be assessed at ordinary bank deposit rates. That would cost the Government money, but if we want to take a step in next week's budget towards having a fair and just society, changes must be made where they are necessary.</P>
    <P>A number of associations representing the elderly have called for the Government to give serious consideration in 1998 to granting a medical card to all people over the age of 66, regardless of their incomes.  Statistics indicate that approximately 80 per cent of senior citizens have medical cards.  We are beginning to enjoy the fruits of our Celtic tiger economy which were developed by the tens of thousands of people who worked here down through the years.  The least we can do for our senior citizens is to ensure they are entitled to health benefits free of charge by providing them with a medical card.</P>
    <P>I hope in next week's budget the carer's allowance will be increased and that improvements will be made to the nursing home subvention regulations because the current system is not sufficient to deal with the social problems faced by the elderly and those who care for them.  There will be another opportunity to discuss these matters in more detail, but I wanted to put forward those suggestions.</P>

      <P>More time should be given in future years to discuss the Estimates because this is the time to put down a marker in regard to the forthcoming budget.  At this point we can say what should be done in advance of the budget, but when it is announced we can only talk about what should have been done.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, introduces the budget next week he will have a bountiful harvest. I hope he will be gracious enough to acknowledge the role of the previous Government in laying the foundations that has given him that harvest to dispense.  I hope he will be fair in disbursing the funding available to him and that he will not forget the elderly who built this nation.  They worked hard in harder times than this generation is witnessing or will ever appreciate <Col N="974" /> and they are still in need of improvements in many areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance should not forget those with a mental and physical handicap.  We must pay tribute to the many thousands of families who care within their family circles for a person with a mental or physical handicap.  There are many shortcomings in the system and many benefits to which they should be entitled, especially in good times.  We are renowned for the care of those less fortunate than ourselves.</P>
      <P>The main point I wish to make concerns the Government's discrimination against the Border region from its inception on 6 June.  In Opposition it championed the cause of that region, but in Government it has neglected the six counties, the Border region and what should be done there. We are now witnessing the benefits of the peace process and people can now move freely.  There is an opportunity for the Government to give a lift to a region that has suffered for the past 25 years, but there has been total silence and neglect. That is not acceptable.  The Minister of State, above all people, will understand why that is the case.  It is ironic that he is present when I make this charge.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who has sole responsibility apparently for handing out the thousands of jobs she has announced, in regard to which I wish her well, has not announced one job for the Border region, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan or Louth.  I am particularly concerned about the Cavan-Monaghan area.  The Tánaiste realises she will never have a foothold in the Border region.  Therefore, she has decided to target areas of the country where she can increase the vote for her party and hopefully win seats.  Fianna Fáil in Government is supporting that policy which is not acceptable to me.  It is wrong, unjust and unacceptable to people who have suffered as a result of the spillover of violence from the North.  I want to see an immediate change in that policy and jobs to be announced for that region.  It has been the focus of international attention and industrialists could be attracted to it if the Government made an effort to do so but it has not.  Lip service was paid to the region, but when it comes to action, the Government has failed miserably.  I appeal to the Government to change its policy on the Border region where industrial sites can be bought for £5,000 to £6,000 an acre compared to £25,000 in the more affluent areas of this country at which jobs have been targeted.  I will seek to raise this matter and get a reply to it on another occasion.</P>

      <P>I ask the Government to reintroduce the house improvement grant.  Fianna Fáil abolished that grant in l987 and it is only right and proper that a Fianna Fáil led Government should reintroduce it.  That grant enabled people to carry out house improvements.  Some elderly people do not qualify for the disabled person's grant or the essential repairs grant, both of which have narrow criteria.  Local authorities are being <Col N="975" /> asked to give those grants in cases where a house improvement grant would be more appropriate. That grant generated a lot of employment in rural areas for suppliers of building materials and small builders.  The Government should consider this issue in the context of bringing life back to rural areas.  It would generate more employment there.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Boylan's points.  Over the last 12 months potential investors have considered using an advance factory in County Longford. I made representations to the previous Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, about this matter and I hope the Minister will ensure that a project is installed in that factory in the near future.</P>
      <P>The comment is being made throughout the country that the Government is anti-farming.  It has proven this point because the economy is booming and there is money for everything except farming.  The Government has brought down the hay knife and cut off the wedge on which farmers survive.  It has displayed sheer hypocrisy in its policies in this area.  When Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in Opposition, they laughed at the then Minister, Deputy Yates, who was doing a remarkable job. Farmers now know that was the case and shame on the Government for cutting the budget in this area.  Farmers are waiting in the long grass but they will emerge.  The Government should wake up and get the markets for cattle reopened.  It should also reinstate installation aid for young farmers.  It was criminal to abolish it.</P>

      <P>It will not be a good budget for the management and staff of the Asahi plant in Killala, County Mayo.  Task forces are established when problems arise in areas and a group was set up in Killala.  Announcements were made in the past, and will probably be made in the future, about job creation but no jobs have come to County Mayo or the west.  The employees of Asahi are not looking forward to the budget. Instead they are wondering what social welfare payments they will receive next week.  That is sad. I pay tribute to the staff and management of the plant and I hope the Government will do something to bring employment back to that area.</P>
      <P>I am sick and tired of hearing about the Celtic tiger.  Many people have never seen it.  The only tigers they see every week are rent men, coal men and children looking for money which is not there.  I hope the Government will consider the less well off in the budget.  Many men, women and children are on waiting lists for heart and other operations.  Some are waiting to be called to St. Luke's Hospital but no beds are available for them.  It is time money was spent on people with disabilities and other problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also sick and tired of hearing about businessmen who have everything.  They receive tax initiatives and breaks.  More people from Dublin, Cork and London own property in County Mayo than people from the county.  This is what the Celtic tiger has done for Mayo.  Nobody can <Col N="976" /> afford to live in Westport and the surrounding areas.  They have to move out because landlords from Dublin and Cork are collecting revenue from people on holiday in the area.  Local people cannot afford to buy houses in their town.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will introduce measures in the budget to allow young couples to buy their own homes.  I also hope it will provide money for houses for people who have been on council housing lists for up to six years.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to bring my remarks to the attention of the Minister for Finance and the Government.  The businessmen are well able to look after themselves.  We saw how Ben Dunne looked after himself.  He had so much money he did not know what to do with it so he gave it to his friends in Fianna Fáil.  That type of behaviour must stop.</P>
    <P>The less well off must be considered.  Such people lose their medical cards because they are £2 or £4 over the limit.  This must stop.  The means testing of social welfare in rural areas must also stop because people are attacked by the Department. It sought to catch cheats and frauds and I agree they must be rooted out.  However, the Department targeted small farmers with 15 ducks and 14 cows in the west.  It did not go after people working and claiming social welfare or the owners of unsafe building sites where young people from the west fell off buildings and died. Such people and not those receiving small amounts of social welfare must be taken on.  Land in Belmullet and Westport is not the same as land in County Meath.  I hope provision will be made in the budget for the less well off.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for sharing his time.  I am delighted the Minister has a substantial balance available for distribution as a result of his prudent preparation of the Book of Estimates.  He may have difficulty spending it all so I wish to make some suggestions about how he could usefully use a small amount of the money available across a number of Departments.</P>
      <P>I represent the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny. It does not immediately spring to mind when the disbursement of funds is considered. Carlow-Kilkenny could be called the Brigadoon of Irish politics; it is prominent during elections but quickly forgotten afterwards.  Counties Carlow and Kilkenny are often referred to as prosperous areas and perhaps that is why they are overlooked when jobs and funds are handed out. An increasing number of my constituents are unhappy about that position.  They expect me to make the case for the counties to the Government. I intend to ensure that they receive a reasonable share and are no longer at the end of the line in terms of jobs and funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> My constituency has a strong case and money would be well spent in either county.  The prosperity in both counties is largely the result of self-help and enterprise.  However, there is only so much they can achieve.  The counties need support from the Government if they are to continue to be successful.  I am aware that the completion of ring roads and bypasses is the responsibility of the National Roads Authority.  However, I ask the Minister to find a way to encourage major expenditure on the road systems in Carlow and Kilkenny and particularly to allocate funds as soon as possible to ensure the completion of ring roads in the two counties.</P>
    <P>Good road networks are essential for the success of industry and business in general.  Carlow and Kilkenny cannot move forward unless their road systems are modernised.  The current traffic congestion causes delay and inconvenience to individuals and industry.  Furthermore, the attractions of both counties as locations for new industry are severely impaired.  I constantly receive representations from the chambers of commerce, businessmen and individuals regarding the state of the roads.  It is beyond time to do something about them.  I appeal to the Minister to take firm action to ensure funds are made available immediately to the relevant authorities to carry out these projects which will not only be good for both counties but also of considerable assistance in alleviating the problems caused to the national and international traffic using the roads in Carlow and Kilkenny.  The Waterford-Kilkenny road is a disgrace.  It carries national and international traffic to the port of Belview, which cost millions to develop, but the access routes are in a deplorable condition and in need of immediate funding. The N9 road around Thomastown also needs to be addressed.  The lack of a proper road network there is choking the small village.</P>
    <P>Job creation is high on the Government's agenda and there has been much good news in the counties recently.  I compliment the Government and the IDA on the good work they are doing for the country. However, I am concerned that the creation of jobs and the location of new industry in my constituency and particularly Kilkenny does not reflect the national picture.  The recent announcements of job creation in various parts of the country left my constituents underwhelmed.  I ask for immediate action in this area.</P>
    <P>In the context of education, the gaelscoil in Kilkenny and Ormonde College require immediate investment.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to these schools.  I wish to make many other recommendations but I will do so in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the many statements made during the debate which were interesting and covered a great deal of ground.  However, it is disappointing that so many of the statements <Col N="978" /> from the Opposition continued to criticise the Government for its handling of the 1998 Estimates, despite the clarity with which my colleague, the Minister for Finance, explained the position.</P>
      <P>I am sure members of the public listening to some contributions are thoroughly confused.  It may be that the creation of such confusion is what the Government's critics hope to produce.  I want to answer these criticisms about the Government's handling of public expenditure and it has no intention of allowing them to stand.  It is a simple matter to end the confusion and show that our policies are prudent and responsible.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance outlined the Government's expenditure policies in the clearest possible manner.  He stressed the importance of the programme commitment to limit expenditure growth and made clear that meeting it is a major priority for the Government.  This would be done not just for its own sake, but because proper management of public expenditure is the key to successful budgetary policy and to continuation of the consensus approach which has brought Ireland such economic success.</P>
      <P>Any reasonable observer of the comments made by the Minister and I when working on the finance portfolio in Opposition would acknowledge that we are extremely committed to the control of public expenditure and see it as the bedrock of economic success.  He explained in detail how current and capital expenditure changed in 1997 and presented the main elements of the Government's plans for 1998.  Other Ministers explained these plans in so far as their areas were concerned.</P>
      <P>The reasons the Government decided to allocate additional spending to particular areas next year were set out by the Minister for Finance and other Ministers.  The background to the Estimates has been presented openly and transparently, yet the Government has still been subject to attack. The criticisms made by Deputies have largely centred on the fact that the expenditure figures in the 1998 Abridged Estimates Volume produce a 1.8 per cent increase over the likely 1997 outturn, one which is considerably less than the 4 per cent target in the Government's programme.  A number of speakers argued that this result has only been achieved by bringing forward expenditure to this year.  The Government is supposed to have set out deliberately to increase the 1997 outturn in order to reduce the gap between the outturn and the 1998 Estimates, but nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has already explained the Government's approach, but it must be spelt out once again in order to see that the criticism has no basis.  Over the medium to longer term, the Government faces a number of significant costs, which he referred to earlier, including the need to put the payment of teachers' salaries and the recoupment of higher education grants to local authorities on a proper basis, the obligation to fund An Post and Telecom Éireann pensions <Col N="979" /> and the need to meet the unpaid interest accruing on small savings schemes.  These are substantial financial obligations which must be met by the Government.</P>
    <P>In the case of teachers' salaries and higher education grants, it was right to do so as there was no justification for continuing with the present system.  The payments to the pension funds and the savings reserve fund are also justified.  In most cases the Exchequer, like a commercial business, will only make payments to meet debts which arise immediately for payment but the obligations to these funds are not like that as the liability is real and at some stage in the future the costs will arise for payment.  The difference is that, unlike most bills, payment is not immediately required. This makes no difference to the debt as it is still due for payment and the only question is timing.</P>
    <P>If the Government were planning to make payments to cover debts which had not arisen or which would not arise for a number of years, the criticisms some Deputies made would be in order and I would have to agree with them but this is not what the Government is doing.  There are only two options open to it.  It can clear the debt to the An Post and Telecom Éireann pension funds and the small savings reserve fund over a number of years or it can sit back and wait until a much larger cost has to be met.  Given the present fiscal position and long overdue need to address these questions, it is the right decision. All Members would accept that now is the time when there are funds available so that we do not have huge costs to meet in the years ahead.  We should maintain a prudent approach when dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>Are those who criticise the Government seriously suggesting that it should wait until the bills must be paid?  What the Government is doing is fully justified.  The Exchequer is in a strong position thanks to the buoyant economy. It is wise to use these additional resources to clear some of the debts and to create room for manoeuvre in future.  The next task for the Government is the presentation of the 1998 budget.  All parties have shared the position in which we find ourselves today and realise that the prudent decisions which have been taken have led to the opportunities for us as a nation as we face into 1998.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Abridged Estimates set out the main elements of the Government's spending plans for next year.  The budget on 3 December will make some changes to these plans and will spell out the Government's fiscal policies for the coming year. Deputies can be certain the 1998 budget will continue the broad policy approach which has brought Ireland such economic success in recent years.  The Government will ensure budgetary policy will continue to support sustainable growth, social development and taxation reform. This will be done within the guidelines to which it has committed itself in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> Deputy Noonan asked the Minister for Finance to spell out the Government's medium term budgetary policy so that the Dáil and the public can be aware of what approach the Government intends to adopt, particularly in light of economic and monetary union.  The budget will do precisely this and the Minister will wait to deal with it next Wednesday.  The first step towards the 1998 budget was taken with the publication of the Abridged Estimates on 12 November and the Estimates were within the limits set by the Government's programme.  Next week's budget will also be seen to meet the commitment on spending and other important commitments which we presented in our programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked for information on the Government's drug strategy.  The Government is committed to the war against drugs and has made further progress in supporting the work of the local drugs task forces.  In 1997, funding of £10 million is being made available and we have also repeated that allocation for the task forces in 1998.  Arrangements for the establishment of a youth services development fund are receiving detailed consideration at official level.  The proposals will then be examined by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, I wish to comment on the plan to provide new accommodation for the Houses of the Oireachtas on the former College of Art site, a plan which was recently approved by the Government. We are aware, as Members, of how limited and inadequate the facilities are in the Leinster House precinct.  New demands are being placed on all of us, individually as representatives of our constituents and collectively as parliamentarians. These demands have increased the pressure on the space available within the House.  Facilities are clearly no longer adequate for either Members, staff, press or visitors, particularly the public who want access to these important buildings.</P>
    <P>For instance, the committee system has created demands for space and facilities for Members, press and the public which did not exist previously and they are set to increase in the years ahead.  Members have also been acutely aware for many years of the shortage of adequate research and library facilities and, in particular, of suitable private meeting rooms in which to consult constituents and deputations.</P>
    <P>In the light of all this, the Government has approved the Office of Public Works' development plans for Leinster House, which involve the provision of new accommodation on the former College of Art site.  When it is completed, the new building will offer all the facilities one would expect to be available to a modern, democratic Parliament.  It will be sufficiently flexible to provide for any new requirements which may arise in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for any Deputy to suggest that this Government's policy will favour one part of the country over another.  All Deputies may be <Col N="981" /> assured that Government policies emanating from Departments will ensure an equitable approach to job creation, etc.</P>

      <P>My former colleague in this House and former Minister of State, Ms Joan Burton, brought this matter to my attention.  It was given some publicity in the media a couple of weeks ago when the EU Court of Auditors reported, unfavourably in many respects, on the disbursal of funding and the use of funding here. The former Deputy and Minister of State was amazed that an area she has represented for almost five years, namely, the district of Lucan, should somehow have been caught up in an apparent new beef scam and in a litany of unfortunate events which have gone on in Irish trade for far too long.  I am calling now on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to bring in the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation to examine all the circumstances of this matter and report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The EU Court of Auditors discovered that a 455 tonne consignment of Irish beef which was originally destined for Egypt ended up travelling around Europe and perhaps part of Africa for many months before finally reaching the Congo Republic.  This consignment was accompanied by a false and forged certificate of origin and the auditors drew attention to it in the context of illegal claims for export refunds.  The certificate of origin was endorsed by a non-existent chamber of commerce in Lucan, County Dublin, with an accompanying signature.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Harney, said over the weekend that she was putting in an inspector to examine this matter urgently.  She needs to go much further.  We need a Garda inquiry into why the good name of the business community of Lucan was impugned in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also extraordinary that a French meat exporting company, Sogeviandes, should have picked on this district of County Dublin to validate their unlawful certificate in this way.  The former Deputy and Minister, Ms Burton, I and <Col N="982" /> everyone else in this House feel that the Lucan business community and their public representatives should be rightly outraged by this discovery at the European Court of Auditors.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food has made the usual lukewarm, almost lackadaisical, response to the disclosure of this matter by the EU Court of Auditors, saying basically that it did not affect the beef, etc.  It affects the reputation of the village of Lucan, now grown into a huge and important district on the west side of Dublin. There has been massive development there of residential housing and business over the past 20 years and it is deplorable that its reputation has been impugned in this way.</P>
    <P>We had the famous beef tribunal, a number of years ago in which many investigations took place in front of lawyers about tax evasion, damaging behaviour in the meat plants of Ireland, with a damaging outcome for our meat exports, and this was accompanied by the huge scandal of massive fees for the legal profession.  We ended up none the wiser and now we have somebody using the name of the village of Lucan in this illegal scam.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts, of which I was proud to be a member during the course of the 27th Dáil, tried to re-examine the territory covered by the beef tribunal.  I remember important contributions by Deputies O'Malley and Rabbitte to our discussions over those four and a half years.  We too ran into a kind of <i>cul de sac.</i>  What I am asking this evening is that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, take responsibility on a day when one of her junior Ministers had to come in here and defend the indefensible, voting against his own Bill.  She should take this matter to the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation to examine it and to see why on earth the business community of Lucan was impugned in this outrageous way.</P>

      <P>I am here to reply on behalf of the Tánaiste who is unable to be present because of her attendance at a function relating to her office.</P>
      <P>Chambers of commerce play a valuable role in certifying the origin of goods.  Certificates of origin are not often needed because most trade is conducted on the basis of declarations made by exporters.  However, certificates of origin are sometimes required by the authorities in the importing country.  In those cases it is the practice in many countries, including Ireland, for a list of chambers of commerce to be authorised to issue certificates of origin to an exporter.  This system works to the satisfaction of exporters.  It is also regarded as satisfactory by importing authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the conditions which must be met before a chamber of commerce is authorised by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to issue certificates of origin is that it must be affiliated to the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.  In October 1994, a person or entity purporting to be the Lucan Chamber of Commerce <Col N="983" /> issued a forged certificate of origin to a French company based in Malahide for a shipment of beef for export to Egypt.  This body was not affiliated to the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and was not authorised by the Minister to issue certificates of origin.  The shipment was rejected in Egypt and was re-imported to the Community via Corinth, Greece.  It was subsequently re-exported from France to the Congo.</P>
    <P>This information was revealed in the recently published report of the European Court of Auditors. The case was examined as soon as the Department was informed of it.  There is no evidence from the initial investigation that the substantive information contained in the certificate was incorrect.  Furthermore, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed that there was no abuse of the EU export refund system in connection with the consignment.  Certificates of origin are not used at any stage to demonstrate eligibility for export refunds nor to validate export refund claims.  They are never submitted to nor seen by the paying agency. However, there remains an irregularity in that a certificate of origin was issued by a body which was not authorised by the Minister to issue such certificates.  This is a matter of some concern to the Minister &mdash; not least because it is essential to maintain the high standing of the system whereby Irish certificates of origin are issued by authorised chambers of commerce.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Garda Fraud Squad was asked by the Minister to investigate the incident with a view to considering whether a prosecution would be justified under the Forgery Act. The Garda Síochána has already made some progress in its investigation and it will report back as soon as possible.  The Minister is also awaiting the advice of the Attorney General on what other legal steps may be available.</P>
    <P>In summary let me emphasise that there does not appear to have been any substantive abuse in this case of the EU export refund scheme.  On the other hand, the Minister is determined to protect the integrity and reputation of the system whereby chambers of commerce are authorised to issue Irish certificates of origin.  For this reason, she has already authorised a Garda investigation in order to determine whether a prosecution would be justified under the Forgery Act.  In addition, she has consulted the Attorney General in order to ascertain whether any other legal steps would be appropriate.  As soon as the Garda report has been received, the Minister will take whatever action is necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the system whereby certificates of origin are issued in Ireland.  I hope my reply goes some way to alleviating the Deputy's concerns.  I thank him for raising the matter.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> In 1997 more than 5,100 applications were made for a place on a Higher Diploma in Education course in one of the five colleges offering the course, namely TCD, UCC, UCG, UCD and St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  There were probably 2,300 applicants as no doubt some people applied to more than one college.  Eight hundred applicants were offered a places on a course.</P>
    <P>In the case of UCG there were 1,455 applications for 185 places.  The selection was based on 50 per cent random selection and 50 per cent academic results.  It basically depended on how well one did in one's last examination.  In the case of UCC there were 965 applications for 185 places.  The selection was based on academic results, including experience with youth clubs, teaching, extra curricular activities and additional qualifications.</P>
    <P>In the case of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth there were 1,300 applications for 150 places. Selection was based on academic results, suitability of subjects for teaching and the quality of the application form.  In the case of Trinity College there were 989 applications for 110 places and 600 applicants were interviewed.  Selection was based on academic achievement, a personal statement on experience etc., and references.  In the case of UCD there were 1,450 applications for 170 places.  Selection was on the basis of 50 per cent random selection and 50 per cent academic achievement.  The only hope ordinary graduates have of getting a place is through random selection.  However, this is a 17 to one chance as most applicants have honours degrees or Masters and are teaching.</P>
    <P>The system is very unfair and not enough people are being given a place on a course.  There are not sufficient places for everyone but the number should be increased.  In addition, the procedures should be standardised.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11 March stated:</P>
    <P>The Department of Education is to consider the establishment of a centralised application procedure for students of the Higher Diploma in Education following representations from the USI and other organisations.  According to a spokesman for the Department of Education, representations have been received and the Department is consulting with the Higher Education Authority on the matter.  It is hoped that the system could be in place for applicants in 1998.</P>
    <P>I understand that this will not now be the case. This is unfortunate as a central clearing office, which presumably will be part of the CAO, would facilitate applicants and simplify the procedure. Under this system there would be one application form, one fee and one office.  The review group includes the heads of universities and representatives of the Department of Education and the Higher Education Authority.  It is very important that they come to a decision as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> We must not regard a H.Dip. qualification as an entry to teaching only.  It is an excellent qualification for entry to many other occupations and a good preparation for life.  If graduates cannot get teaching jobs they may be able to get other jobs.  This is a very important consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which is also of concern to me.  When I was in Opposition I raised it on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>The Higher Diploma in Education is a one year post graduate qualification designed to prepare graduates for a career in teaching.  I accept the Deputy's point that it is also relevant in other fields.  The H.Dip. is currently offered by the education departments of Trinity College Dublin and the four universities of the National Universities of Ireland at Cork, Dublin, Galway and Maynooth. The current annual quota for admissions to the H.Dip. of 800 was set on the basis of a recommendation by the Higher Education Authority. Therein lies many of the problems.  The introduction of this quota almost overnight created panic and many people who had left college without doing the H.Dip. suddenly applied for a place, thereby creating a huge logjam.  The present situation is not satisfactory and there is much concern about the selection process.  The colleges have also been put in an invidious position in terms of the number of applicants and the selection process.  The Higher Education Authority's advice was based on the recommendations of a working group composed of representatives of the universities, my Department and the authority. The working group took account of the best available data on the demand for second level teachers.</P>
      <P>The need for a quota for places on H.Dip. courses is based largely on the perceived demand for second level teachers.  This, in turn, is related to the employment opportunities for H.Dip. graduates.  Decisions in relation to the quota must also be seen in the context of the necessity to direct scarce resources to address the skills needs of the economy.  Resources are being targeted to priority areas to increase the output of technicians, students with proficiency in languages and graduates in computer science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group, which is under the chairmanship of the Higher Education Authority and is supported by an analyst and statistician, has been reconvened to undertake an in-depth review of future needs for second-level teachers.  The terms of reference of this working group are: to develop a model which may be used to forecast future aggregate patterns of supply and demand for second level teachers; to use this model to produce forecasts for the period up to 2016 and to illustrate the impact of varying key assumptions on these projections and to provide alternative forecasts based on a number of assumptions; to review current patterns of intake by subject or subject area and to seek to establish demand forecasts by subject area as a basis for forward planning <Col N="986" /> of supply &mdash; this aspect of the work would also have regard to specialist teacher requirements such as home economics, art, music, etc.; to make recommendations on required intake levels on an aggregate basis and by subject or subject type; to identify gaps in data which should be used as a basis for ongoing review and refining of future supply and demand for teachers; and to determine the required intake levels to the H.Dip. programmes followed by the determination of specialist teacher needs outside these programmes.</P>
    <P>The working group is examining all relevant factors such as pupil numbers, pupil-teacher ratios, teacher retirements and career breaks. Pending receipt and examination of the recommendations of the working group I am not in a position to make an announcement at this stage. It is not possible to make a decision for the 1997-98 school year in November but I intend early in the new year to meet the education departments of universities to discuss H.Dip. courses and whether reform is required.  This will take place in parallel with the work of the working group which I hope will report back to me as quickly as possible.  This is a serious issue for young people who wish to pursue a career in teaching.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and I hope to be able to report progress on it in a few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and to wish him well in his portfolio. I am pleased the Minister is present to reply to this debate.  Gaelscoil Ó Doghair, Caisleán Nua, is a tremendous success story, mainly because of the driving influence of its principal, Daithí Ó Murchú, and the other two teachers at the school. The parents of west and east Limerick have responded to this service and the school now has more than 220 pupils, with 29 parishes represented. All-Irish education is facing a bright future in west Limerick.</P>
      <P>In 1993 the Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, recognised the success of Gaelscoil Ó Doghair by creating the first Gaelcoláiste in the mid-west, in Newcastle West.  In 1995 the Gaelscoil received confirmation that it was included in the capital building programme, but since then there has been no serious commitment to building the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the Gaelscoil operates mainly from prefabricated classrooms.  There is a threat by Limerick County Council of immediate eviction from the classrooms.  Six prefabricated classrooms have been condemned by officialdom.  This sorrowful mess can only be resolved by an immediate provision in the forthcoming budget for a nine <Col N="987" /> teacher Gaelscoil on the site.  Negotiations are at present being finalised by the Department of Education in consultation with Shannon Development, which provided the site.</P>
    <P>This Gaelscoil has had to operate with inadequate accommodation.  The parents, pupils and teachers have had to put up with unsuitable accommodation.  The teachers have done their best to provide excellent education in inadequate surroundings.  The Minister should honour the promise made in 1995 to provide in west Limerick an educational establishment of which we can all be proud as we face the new millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Táim buíochas a ghabháil don Teachta Dála an scéal seo a luaite san Dáil anocht.  I am aware Gaelscoil Ó Doghair has experienced difficulties to date.  The school is staffed by a principal and seven assistants.  The September 1997 enrolment was approximately 207 pupils.  That the construction of a new school has been included on the Department's capital programme since 1995 created expectations which have not been realised.  It simply meant that planning could start, but it meant nothing in terms of Estimates.  That is why nothing has happened since 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The priority status of the project meant it could not be superseded by other schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I came to office the Gaelscoileanna file is the one that has caused enormous headaches.  There are about 35 Gaelscoil projects, with another 15 to come on stream because of recognition given in the past two to three years.  In the past ten years an <i>ad hoc</i> planning process has been involved in regard to Gaelscoileanna, the vast majority of which are in poor condition, with temporary prefabs, classes held in dressing rooms and so on.  I intend to deal with this issue as quickly as possible.  The capital Estimate for 1997 was £27 million and I succeeded in achieving £40 million in this year's capital Estimate, which will improve the position.</P>
      <P>The Department is in the process of purchasing a 2.5 acre site which is considered adequate to accommodate an eight classroom school.  The parents' committee, however, wishes to purchase a further 2.15 acres.  The Department has agreed to facilitate the vendors' request for a single purchase transaction.  The parents' committee will reimburse the Department the cost of the 2.15 acres and the Minister will reassign this part of the site to the parents' committee for use by the Gaelscoil.  The purchase of the site is conditional on planning permission being obtained within six months from the contract date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning documentation is being prepared by the Department while consultation is ongoing with the board of management on the school building.  I am conscious of the need to provide the new facility as quickly as possible.  When the <Col N="988" /> planning stages have been completed satisfactorily I will give every consideration to releasing the project to tender and contract in the light of existing contractual commitments and available capital funding.  I am not yet in a position to give a realistic commencement date for construction. I thank the Deputy for the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position in regard to the school.  I will bear in mind the comments he made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent reports outline the grim truth about the number of young people who are almost totally disengaged from our educational system.  The Clondalkin study shows that there is chronic absenteeism among 25 per cent of pupils, with most of them missing for more than four months of the year.  The same can be said of several other areas throughout the city.  A report from the Ballyfermot area indicates general absenteeism of 20 per cent, which suggests that a larger number may be absent for long periods.  In recent times we have seen OECD study findings on literacy levels among the adult population. Much attention has been focused on the finding that almost 25 per cent of the population has literacy problems while there has been little attention on the fact that 17 or 18 per cent of those aged 15 to 25 years, the recent products of the school system, experience serious literacy problems. We can no longer hide from the truth that our education system is failing many of our pupils.</P>
      <P>Most surprising about today's reports is that this information is not systematically collected in the Department of Education and Science &mdash; I am not pointing the finger at the present Minister. It is bizarre that in a country committed to compulsory legal education, where everybody must attend school up to the age of 15 years, there are no routine systems to identify the extent to which children are performing adequately, receiving the necessary support, attending school regularly and achieving literacy standards.  That information is not systematically compiled.  The Minister does not have access to reports on individual schools to show that problems are being redressed or that the tide is turning.</P>
      <P>The Clondalkin report shows the problem is deep-rooted, and I do not pretend the Minister for Education and Science alone can address it. Many of the 25 per cent of children involved come from families with serious problems outside the school system.  The contrast between the environment at school and the education system is so divergent that it is difficult for many pupils to concentrate on the curriculum pursued. Behavioural problems arise as a result of frustration, creating great difficulties for teachers in the classroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must take seriously the recommendations of this report.  An education and welfare service is needed to identify those at risk not only in <Col N="989" /> Clondalkin but in areas such as Tallaght, Darn-dale and the north and south inner city.  This is just one example of a serious problem.  We must also expand the Early Start and Breaking the Cycle programmes.  It is incredible those two initiatives are taken up by only about 3 per cent of the pupil population.  At present 16 per cent of pupils are educationally disadvantaged, and those schemes only scratch the surface.  Of the primary education budget, only 2 per cent is devoted to special measures for the educationally disadvantaged, and that is not good enough.  There is 61 per cent unemployment among people who leave school without qualifications.  The report shows that many of the particularly chronic absentee pupils become involved in drug taking and various types of delinquency and the cost to themselves, their families and the State is enormous.</P>
    <P>To assign only 2 per cent of the primary budget to special measures for disadvantaged areas under the Early Start programme and Breaking the Cycle is not acceptable. We must also examine the curriculum to ensure it is practical and one to which people can relate.  Many children who leave school with numeracy and literacy problems are well able to evaluate things that matter to them. Many of them are able to read the odds in bookie shops and to compute the meaning of odds without the favourite, which are complex mathematical computations.  However, if they are taught in an alien system they will not get results.  I support the call for practical goal driven education subjects.</P>
    <P>The most important recommendation in the report is the need for specialist school based units.  We must set up units in schools to deal with absenteeism and with children who are experiencing difficulties at home.  Such units could deal with pupils on a one to one basis and help them get back into the school system.  They could also examine activities outside the formal school system. It is obvious from the report that homework, the traditional after-school activity, is inappropriate for most of these children, but plenty of activities have been successfully developed on a pilot basis in other parts of the city which are expanding the capabilities of these children.</P>
    <P>We must empower the areas in which the disadvantage occurs.  The State spends extraordinary sums of money in areas of deprivation, but the people do not benefit from the results.  Agencies must work in co-operation with communities to determine how resources can best be used.  That should be our long-term objective.  Innovation and new thinking will come from the communities. The traditional approach of the Department of Education and Science managing the activities of schools must change.  We must build partnerships at local level.  The Minister may be correct not to agree with regional boards, but he cannot avoid the need to develop the power to plan strategically and to allocate resources on a devolved basis so that projects can be selected.  The local <Col N="990" /> community should have the power to make those choices.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister sets a number of targets and that in three or four years' time the chronic absenteeism in Clondalkin will be dramatically reduced.  That is the way we must tackle disadvantage, but to do that we need resources.  Two per cent of the primary budget is not enough to crack the cycle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for raising the issue and for making a worthwhile contribution. I agree with much of what he said in terms of the approaches that are required to deal with early school leaving and absenteeism.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the Clondalkin Partnership's report about school absenteeism in parts of Clondalkin and the recent OECD report on the extent of the adult literacy problem.</P>
      <P>I am pleased my Department was able to contribute to the cost of the worthwhile research for the Clondalkin report.  The Department is anxious to build up research and data on absenteeism throughout the country.  It has collected data on disadvantage and early school leaving under the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  It is not fair to say the Department does not have a comprehensive data base on this matter.  Comprehensive data on students and their backgrounds were collected from schools under the old disadvantaged scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the information is confidential in that it relates to individual students. Schools do not want negative publicity.  The pupils and their parents are entitled to some confidentiality. It is well known that schools submitted data to the Department on why they believed their school should have disadvantaged status and designation under the designated disadvantaged scheme.  Under the Breaking the Cycle initiative data were submitted to St. Patrick's College.  The Department is anxious to contribute to the research under the partnership scheme.  I accept the need to continue to collect data that can inform policy decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also states that the majority of children in the Clondalkin area attend school regularly and that the school system &ldquo;gets most things right most of the time&rdquo;.  The report is useful in that it details the views of the various parties involved, namely, the pupils, school personnel, parents and youth and community workers.  Many of the issues examined in the study are already being addressed in the range of special preventative and support schemes promoted by the Department of Education and Science, at primary and post primary level.  At primary level, these include intervention measures such as pre-school services, remedial education, the home-school community liaison service, the teacher counsellor scheme, youth encounter projects and the disadvantaged <Col N="991" /> areas scheme.  A number of issues must be addressed at primary level.  An evaluation is being carried out on the Early Start programme and the National Forum on Early Childhood Education will be held in January and February. Projects such as Early Start demand huge resources.  Yet other resources, such as community pre-school playgroups, were by-passed to a large extent.</P>

I am merely making the point that if I were to increase the number to 100, there would not be enough teachers to do anything else.  There are a number of early education projects that must be brought into the framework and given equal treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the groups involved are in disadvantaged areas.  The Early Start programme has been successful, but other projects in the early education field also need support.  That is why we intend to develop a comprehensive early education policy and framework.  We will try to utilise all the resources at our disposal in the community and in the Department to provide a properly focused early education system, which has a key role to play in terms of eliminating early school leaving, absenteeism and disadvantage.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level, measures include curricular reforms such as the junior certificate elementary programmes, alternative leaving certificate programmes, training through the provision of Youthreach for unqualified early school leavers and the provision of additional educational services to second level schools to cater for the needs of disadvantaged pupils such as the allocation of disadvantaged, remedial, guidance, home-school links and resource posts.</P>
      <P>I recently put in place additional measures to continue to address the need for urgent action, including a new initiative over the next two years, the details of which will be announced shortly, focused on structured pilot projects in urban and rural disadvantaged areas for the development of an integrated area based co-ordination of services to cater for young people aged 8 to 15 who are at risk of leaving school early.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to develop that in a partnership context in local areas.</P>
      <P>I recently announced my intention of setting up a national forum on Early Childhood Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> In July I announced a major expansion &mdash; up to 1,200 addition places &mdash; in Youthreach programmes which has been very successful for many young people.</P>
    <P>New initiatives have been agreed for implementation in 1998 and 1999.  These include the provision of £1 million for the strengthening of counselling, guidance and psychological services for participants on the Youthreach and traveller training programmes.  Early next year I will publish new legislation which will replace the School Attendance Act, 1926, and update arrangements for the school attendance service.  All the above existing schemes and new initiatives have a particular relevance to children and young people from disadvantaged urban areas.</P>
    <P>Adult illiteracy is greater than some people realised but we knew the OECD report was coming. The situation in Ireland provides an unfavourable comparison with the position in other countries.  I am anxious to see the funding for adult literacy programmes increased.  I have already allocated an additional £250,000 for the adult education service, to be spent by vocational education committees on literacy and basic education for adults in 1997.  I am committed to improving the literacy services within a proper policy framework for all aspects of adult education, in particular, for those who left the formal system without qualifications.  It will be designed to stimulate an extensive debate on the advancement and development of adult education.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of a Green Paper, I will consult widely with all interested parties and the outcome of these consultations will form a White Paper and, in due course, legislation to put the entire adult education area on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>Arising from the national literacy survey, I am currently setting up an expert group on learning difficulties, which will commission a study of cases of learning difficulties encountered by adults who have participated in adult literacy courses.  I hope this study will lead to proposals on how primary school performance can be assessed so as to allow literacy problems to be remedied within mainstream education rather than after years of silent suffering.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment, a number of significant initiatives on the issues of early school leaving and adult literacy have been implemented or will be implemented over the coming months.  The Government is committed to comprehensively addressing these issues and I am confident we will do so.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 November 1997.</P>

      <P>I met with the World Media Network on Thursday, 13 November 1997.  I did so following a request from <i>The Irish Times</i> who are a member of the network and were hosting an editorial meeting of the group in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The World Media Network is a grouping of 20 newspapers around the world, but predominantly European.  It started in 1990, embracing such titles as <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>La Stampa.</i>  It has since expanded to take several Middle Eastern titles as well as a number of Latin American and Asian ones.  I am circulating a list of current members with this reply.  <i>The Irish Times</i> has been a member since 1992.</P>
      <P>The network publishes two supplements each year, one geopolitical, and the other a guide to summer cultural events in Europe.  Recent topics have included Europe; World Centres of Power; Cities; and Health.  The network's editorial meetings alternate between its headquarters in Paris, and at six-monthly intervals, the home cities of its members.  Recent meetings have been in Madrid, Cairo, Sarajevo, Istanbul, Marrakesch and Turin.</P>
      <P>Those attending the briefing in Government Buildings were editorial executives who usually report for their newspapers on these briefings. You will see from the list of papers circulated, it provided a very good opportunity to present a positive view of Ireland and, in particular, the Irish economy and the peace process to a wide international audience.</P>
      <P>I was accompanied at the briefing by the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs.  We discussed aspects of Irish economic and foreign policy with the group and briefed them on progress in the peace process and the all-party talks.</P>

      <P>I believe the Deputy's question is prompted mainly by the critical comments made on the advertisements about the recent referendum to amend the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The difficulties presented on that occasion for large sections of the general public were undoubtedly related to the complex issues involved which did not lend themselves to easy, simple explanation in the form of an advertisment.  Nevertheless, the lessons are being absorbed and I am determined that we will not have a repeat of that experience in promoting debate on major public policy issues in future.</P>
      <P>I am confident the issues raised by the Deputy can be addressed in the new quality customer service initiative for the Civil Service.  As indicated in reply to questions last week, I launched the customer service action plan for my own Department on 12 November and the plans of the other participating Departments and offices will be published over the coming weeks up to the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The Government's 1798 Commemoration Committee, of which I am chairperson, has made substantial progress in devising the National Programme of Commemoration.  To date a number of projects and events have been developed to mark this important period in our history.</P>
      <P>In line with the objectives of the commemoration, as endorsed by this Government, it is the committee's intention to develop a broad-ranging, comprehensive and inclusive programme which commemorates the ideals of the United Irishmen and the &ldquo;Fellowship of Freedom&rdquo; that inspired them in 1798.  With this in mind, it is felt that the commemoration programme should focus primary attention on the principles of democracy and pluralism which the United Irishmen advocated.  The programme will focus attention on the ideals of the leaders of 1798 and will acknowledge the Ulster dimension and particularly the contribution of the Presbyterian tradition, with its emphasis on justice, equality and civil liberty.  It is felt that particular focus should also be given to the international perspective of the United Irishmen and the enduring links which 1798 forged with America, France and Australia.</P>
      <P>The Dublin-Belfast Choral Festival, an Ecumenical Service, a Dublin-Belfast International Conference, a 1798 Commemoration Scholarship, documentary programmes by RTE and significant exhibitions to be mounted by the National Library and Museum and by the Linen Hall Library, Belfast are some of the many worthy projects and events being funded by my committee. I am circulating, in the Official Report, a full list of the events confirmed or under consideration.</P>
      <P>There are many projects, should extra funding become available, that my committee would have an interest in developing.  These projects would include some suitable local projects which are being organised in areas throughout the country which were involved in 1798.  I am currently in discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on this matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to the allocation provided for the CSO in the 1998 Estimates which in gross terms reflects a decrease of 14 per cent on the 1997 forecast outturn.  The original 1997 allocation for the CSO reflected the carry-over cost of processing the 1996 Census of Population.  When account is taken of this cost, however, there is, in fact, a small increase in net allocations between 1997 and 1998.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that gross expenditure for the CSO rose from some £13.8 million in 1995, to £23.8 million in 1996 to cover the cost of the conduct and initial processing of the census.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Criminal justice statistics are the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and, in the case of crime, prisons and probation statistics, are published in annual reports.  Some statistics on the criminal justice system are also published annually by the Central Statistics Office in its Statistical Abstract.</P>
      <P>Under the Statistics Act, 1993, the Central Statistics Office has the authority to coordinate statistics compiled by other public authorities. However, its right to access the records of public authorities does not extend to the records pertaining to a court, the Garda Síochána or the prison administration.  While administrative records provide valuable information on reported crime, it is the view of the CSO that estimates of actual, as distinct from reported, crime could be based only on national representative surveys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September, the CSO launched the new quarterly national household survey, which will be an <Col N="999" /> important source of statistics about the population, households and the labour market.  It involves surveying 39,000 households per quarter throughout the country.  Consideration is being given to including a module on crime on this survey for a future quarter.</P>
    <P>I might add that the 1998 estimates for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform included a specific provision of £250,000 for research.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I see no need to review the role of the Central Statistics Office in respect to criminal justice statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>In order for society to fully address the pervasive nature of poverty and to promote the concept of an inclusive society, as recognised in our programme for Government, it is important that the National Anti-Poverty Strategy &mdash; or NAPS &mdash; becomes an integral part of the thinking of Government Departments.  Consequently, it has been a priority of the strategy during this early implementation stage to embed the NAPS process across Departments and the wider public sector and to ensure that the appropriate institutional framework is put in place to facilitate its implementation.  A unit was established in my Department to co-ordinate the implementation of the strategy.  The unit serves as a key resource in providing back-up services for the relevant NAPS structures as required; preparing and analysing papers relevant to poverty and social exclusion and co-ordinating anti-poverty initiatives of a cross-cutting nature across Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The NAPS Inter-Departmental Policy Committee, which was set up to oversee the formulation of the NAPS, has remained in place and has met three times since April.  This committee is comprised of senior officers who have responsibility for ensuring that the NAPS provisions relevant to their Departments are implemented.  It is so-chaired by my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs (including Local Development), chaired by the Taoiseach, was established by <Col N="1000" /> Government and is a key element of the NAPS institutional framework, underlining a commitment to a more inclusive society at the highest level.  The first meeting of the sub-committee took place last month.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency continues to play a key role in the NAPS.  The director of the agency is a member of the NAPS Inter-Departmental Policy Committee and the agency is responsible for overseeing an evaluation of the process on behalf of the IDPC.</P>
    <P>In addition, the CPA will provide support, in an advisory capacity, to individual Departments and local and-or regional structures on the development of anti-poverty strategies.  The CPA will be particularly called upon to advise on anti-poverty strategies in the context of the local government reform process.</P>
    <P>While the priority for this year has been to establish the institutional structures on a solid footing, considerable progress has been made in implementing the strategy.  Liaison officers have been appointed in key Departments to fill a communication and co-ordination role.  It is through the network of liaison officers that the NAPS unit interacts with Departments.  The unit has met with liaison officers on an individual basis to discuss the preparation of departmental baseline documents based on commitments set out in the NAPS, An Action Programme for the Millennium, and Partnership 2000.  Departments are also compiling workplans for 1998, setting down objectives and targets relating to social inclusion for the year.</P>
    <P>I met with representatives of the seven funded national anti-poverty networks recently to commence a round of consultation about the future role the voluntary and community sector will play in the NAPS.  Preliminary discussions with the Department of the Environment and Local Government have also taken place to discuss the important role of local authorities in the NAPS.</P>
    <P>Public opinion was identified in the NAPS document as being extremely important for the success of the strategy.  An information and public education strategy is being drawn up with the aim of promoting public discussion and understanding of the value of a national anti-poverty strategy and highlighting the contribution that anti-poverty initiatives can make to improving the social, economic, political and cultural life of society.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 40, 118, 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people, who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  It is not intended to be a compensatory payment for earnings foregone nor a payment by the State for the caring services provided.</P>
      <P>At the end of last September, 9,930 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at an estimated full year cost of £36.4 million.</P>
      <P>The maximum weekly payment in respect of carer's allowance is £70.50; the maximum widow's contributory pension is £71.10 and the maximum widow's non-contributory pension is £67.50. Regulations preclude, with very few exceptions, the payment of welfare benefits and allowances concurrently.</P>
      <P>The Department does not maintain statistics on the number of widow-widowers who are also in receipt of a carer's allowance.  Therefore, it is not possible to estimate the cost of paying a carer's allowance in addition to a widow's pension.</P>
      <P>However, any expansion of the carer's allowance scheme to include a wider group of beneficiaries would have cost implications which would have to be examined in a budgetary context.</P>

    <P>Last October I hosted a pre-budget forum at <Col N="1002" /> which representatives of various organisations involved in the social welfare area were invited to present their priorities for next month's Budget.  The carer's association was among those organisations present who made a submission.</P>
    <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to the following:</P>
    <P>(a) progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit; and</P>
    <P>(b) increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
    <P>In line with these commitments, I will consider the further development of the scheme in the context of an overall review of the provisions for carers, which is being carried out by my Department and in the light of budgetary considerations.</P>

      <P>I understand that the person concerned who is aged 18 has applied for a grant under the higher education grant scheme, but has not been successful.  Issues relating to such grants are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.  The Deputy may wish to pursue this with the Minister concerned.</P>
      <P>The supports which my Department provides in this area are directed mainly at people who have been unemployed or are lone parents and wish to pursue courses of education.  These supports include the third level allowance and the second level allowance.  To qualify for participation in these schemes, the person must be aged 21 or over, be in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance or a one-parent family payment for at least six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the information supplied, it would appear that the person concerned does not satisfy any of the conditions of entitlement.  In relation to the position of prospective students whose families are dependent on social welfare payments, increases are payable to recipients of social welfare payments in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 18 years.  Where the parent is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, the increase is payable where the qualified child is in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd <Col N="1003" /> birthday.  A child increase is being paid in respect of the person concerned.  In addition, child benefit is payable up to age 19 where the child is in full-time education.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the employment support services which are provided for under subhead G of my Department's Estimates.  These services include the back-to-work allowance, the area based enterprise allowance, the second and third level allowance, the students summer jobs scheme together with a number of other initiatives.</P>
      <P>The estimated provision in 1998 for these services represents an increase of 15 per cent over the current year.  This increase arises mainly on the back-to-work allowance, the area based enterprise allowance and the third level allowance.</P>
      <P>The increase in the expected cost of the back-to-work allowance accounts for more than half the overall subhead increase and is due to an increase of 3,000 in the average number of participants in 1998 together with the carry over cost of the 1997 budget improvements.  The increases in the area based enterprise allowance and third level allowance are due mainly to increases of 500 and 700 respectively in the expected number of participants in 1998.</P>

      <P>The home-help service is operated by the health boards who come under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  The underlying philosphy governing the operation of the service is that it is a community-based good neighbours scheme which would attract volunteers primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community service and, as such, the service does not come within the realm of conventional employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> In so far as entitlement to social welfare payments is concerned, the position is that any income deriving from participation in the home-help service is not taken into account for the purposes of determining entitlement to means-tested social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>A further issue, however, relates to the position of people who, by virtue of being engaged as home-helps, are deemed to be unavailable for work and thus have no entitlement to claim unemployment assistance in respect of any day in which they undertake such work.  Any change to the existing statutory provisions in this regard would have to be considered in the context of the costs involved and would also have to have regard to the position of other similar types of employment.</P>
    <P>I understand that a review of the home-help service has been initiated by the Department of Health and Children and my Department will offer every co-operation to that process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.  The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme an allowance of £43 is payable in respect of children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £58 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years.  The rate was last increased in 1996.  The clothing and footwear component of the consumer price index published by the Central Statistics Office has been falling since 1994 and fell by 8.9 per cent between November 1996 and October 1997.  Any proposals to increase the rate of payment cannot be viewed in isolation from the general increases in basic payments.  Over the years, basic social welfare payments have been increased by more than the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision under social welfare <Col N="1005" /> legislation to cover any other costs concerning school attendance.  The Department of Education and Science has responsibility in relation to the provision of school books and examination fees.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance scheme has more than doubled in the last seven years from £5.6 million in 1990 to £12.7 million in 1996.  A sum of £13.5 million has been set aside in the estimates for the scheme this year.</P>
    <P>Any changes in the scheme will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my previous reply to Question No. 28 on 15 October 1997.</P>
      <P>In assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed, such as free board and lodging in the family home, is also taken into account. The purpose of including this item in the assessment of means is to ensure that, by taking account of different household circumstances, the available resources are targeted at those who are most in need.  The abolition of this assessment would, therefore, remove this targeting and would have substantial cost implications.  One of the principal arguments for the abolition or relaxation of the benefit and privilege rule for young unemployed people, is that it encourages them to leave the family home in order to qualify for higher unemployment assistance payments and rent supplements.  However, the limited evidence which is available does not suggest that this is happening to any significant degree.  A report published by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1993: &ldquo;Pathways to Adulthood in Ireland: Causes and Consequences of Success and Failure in Transitions Amongst Irish Youth&rdquo;, while not directly addressing this issue, presented evidence which did not lend great support to the argument outlined above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report looked at the rate over time at which young people moved out of the family home.  It found that leaving home is a highly complex process with many different facets, including the pattern of full-time education participation and the nature of employment sought.  Most interestingly, in this context, the research found that unemployed people were the slowest group <Col N="1006" /> to move out of the family home.  While these results must be interpreted in the light of the complex factors which prevail in the decision to move out, they do not lend support to a view that unemployed young people are more likely to leave the family home because of the qualification conditions for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>More recently, in its report in 1995, the review group on the role of supplementary welfare allowance in relation to housing considered the issue of how the benefit and privilege provision might be contributing towards young people leaving the family home and claiming rent supplement. While the group found that the possible effect of the benefit and privilege rule was one of a range of factors which may have contributed to the growth in rent and mortgage supplementation since 1989, they were not able to establish the relative importance of any individual factor. However, the group concluded that key factors in the growth of numbers of people claiming rent and mortgage supplements, included the increased availability of information relating to welfare entitlements and increased public expectations regarding welfare support levels.</P>
    <P>While the available evidence does not support the notion that the benefit and privilege rule is a highly significant factor in the movement of young people out of the family home, my Department will, nevertheless, continue to evaluate this provision in the light of any new evidence which becomes available.</P>
    <P>A number of improvements have been introduced over recent years in the assessment of the benefit of board and lodging.  For instance, in 1991 provision was made for the introduction of a minimum weekly payment of £5 for claimants whose only means were assessed from board and lodging.  This minimum payment has been progressively increased to £25 per week.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that, where the combined net parental income does not exceed £19,698 per annum, a claimant is entitled to at least the minimum £25 weekly payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The cost of abolishing the assessment of the benefit of board and lodging for unemployment assistance purposes is estimated to be in the region of £20 million in a full year.  The question of implementing any further improvements to the provisions for assessing benefit and privilege, would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of existing priorities and available resources.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that policies to address the effect of divorce on families cover a wide range of areas including income support, mediation and counselling services, family courts, and services for children.  The latter two areas relate to the responsibilities of the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children.</P>
      <P>In relation to income supports available through the social welfare system, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, provided that a divorced person will not lose out in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements.  In relation to occupational pensions, the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, requires that pension rights must be taken into account by the court in any financial settlement.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the Fianna Fáil policy paper &mdash; May 1997 &mdash; on Irish Families in the New Millennium, the family mediation service and the marriage counselling sevices are key supports available to families in crisis situations, including those involving separation and divorce.  The mediation service enables couples whose marriages have irretrievably broken down to address issues arising consequent on breakdown.</P>
      <P>The Government programme indicates that priority will be attached to the establishment of a national mediation service.  It is also recognised that the availability of counselling services is essential for families dealing with difficult relationship issues and this Government is committed to pursuing greater provision and support for existing counselling sevices in this area.  My Department is taking over responsibility for both family mediation and marriage counselling services &mdash; which are currently the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the New Year.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive shortly the final report of the Commission on the Family.  I expect that this will cover issues relevant to families in marriage breakdown-divorce situations as well as issues relating to the prevention of marriage breakdown and the question of joint parenting, whether within or outside marriage.  I expect that this report will form the basis for a programme of sustained action to deal with family affairs' issues generally.  This should complement the proposals outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium and its supporting policy documents.  I will be considering shortly, along with my Government colleagues, how this programme of action can best be supported at administrative level.</P>

The six weeks payment does not arise where each spouse has an independent entitlement to an insurance based contributory pension.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department to examine the proposal to introduce a three months bereavement allowance during the first year of bereavement in certain circumstances.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years different methods of assessing the value of capital have been applied to the various social assistance schemes.  However, more recently the process of standardising the assessment of capital across the different social assistance schemes has been initiated, so as to improve the equity of the system. The introduction of disability allowance scheme in October 1996 and the one-parent family payment scheme in January 1997 presented the opportunity to commence this process.  Under the new assessment provisions, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent of the capital value and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Social Welfare Act, 1997, provided for a further extension of the revised capital assessment provisions to the old age (non-contributory) pension, widow's and widower's (non-contributory) pension, orphan's (non-contributory) pension, carer's allowance and pre-retirement allowance schemes, with effect from 17 October 1997.  The revised capital assessment provisions are of benefit to the majority of social assistance recipients who have capital.  For example, a single old age pensioner can now have capital of up to £6,160 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age (non-contributory) pension &mdash; an increase of £3,173 on the previous arrangements.  A married couple can <Col N="1009" /> have capital of up to £12,320 and still qualify for the maximum pension &mdash; an increase of £6,345. A single pensioner can have up to £35,575 and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension, while a married couple can have up to £71,146 before losing entitlement to the pension.</P>
    <P>In addition, the effective assessment rates of capital have been lowered for most recipients with capital.  For example, under the former arrangements the effective assessment rate for all levels of capital for old age (non-contributory) pension purposes were approximately 10 per cent in the case of single people and 5 per cent for a married couple.  Under the new procedures, capital of up to £20,000 is now assessed progressively up to a rate of 6.75 per cent in the case of a single pensioner and up to a rate of 3 per cent in the case of a married pensioner couple.  As only about 2 per cent of single old age pensioners and 4 per cent of married pensioners have capital in excess of £20,000, the new arrangements have improved the income position of the vast majority of old age pensioners.  The question of extending the new capital assessment procedures to the other social assistance payments, i.e. unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, is being examined in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources and other priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputies refers to the position of the self-employed over the age of 56 on the extension of social insurance to the self-employed in April 1988.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the old age (contributory) pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age. This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age (contributory) pension. They may be covered for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions subject, of course, to satisfying the normal qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>However, the self-employed in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any person prior to age 56, could qualify for the old age (contributory) pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Refunds of the old age (contributory) pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age (contributory) or non-contributory pension.  In this year's Social Welfare Act provision was made for self employed contributors, who entered insurance in 1988 but were already over the age of 56 at that time, and, who had previously paid social insurance contributions as an employee, to receive a refund of the pensions element of their self employed social insurance, provided that they do not qualify for an old age (contributory) or non-contributory pension.  Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving such a refund.  I recently announced the introduction of a new <i>pro-rata</i> pension so that, in future, people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age (contributory) pension.  From 21 November a yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions will give a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 will give a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person will also need to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions.  This measure will be of benefit to many self-employed contributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible.  I have asked my Department to examine the general issue relating to the self-employed group aged over 56 in April 1988.  As <Col N="1013" /> any proposals would have a major cost implication they fall to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>Any person resident in the State can, of course, qualify for an old age (non-contributory) pension which is payable subject to a means test.</P>

      <P>I intend to make Social Welfare local offices more accessible to the public and to increase the number of hours they are open as part of the drive to improve customer service.  In this regard I see lunch time opening as the priority where this is warranted.</P>
      <P>With regard to opening of the offices on a six day rather than a five day a week basis there has been no significant level of demand for this and I am not convinced it would be justified having regard to the volume of business likely to be done and the associated extra costs.

      <P>I understand that the person concerned has been in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance up to 16 July 1996. He subsequently served a prison sentence from 17 July 1996 to 31 July 1997.</P>
      <P>Section 120 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, sets out the conditions governing the linking of claims for the purposes of claiming unemployment assistance.  Briefly, these provisions state that any three days of unemployment within a period of six consecutive days are treated as a continuous period of unemployment and any two such periods, provided that they are not separated by more than one year, are treated as one continous period of unemployment. Since more than one year had elapsed since the person in question ceased to be entitled to long-term unemployment assistance, his claim for unemployment assistance on his release from prison was correctly treated as a new claim and he was accordingly awarded unemployment assistance at the short-term rate only.  I recognise the fact that the award of unemployment assistance at the short-term rate will mean that the person in question will not qualify for the Christmas bonus, which is payable only with long-term social welfare payments.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that any departure from the existing legislative provisions would have to have regard to the wider implications and costs associated with such a measure.</P>

      <P>The establishment of an inclusive society, where all citizens have the opportunity and the incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country, is a fundamental objective of this Government.  In formulating proposals for inclusion in the 1998 budget, therefore, the Government will be endeavouring to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared with the more vulnerable sections of our society.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a wide range of commitments relating to the areas for which I have responsibility, including the following commitments:</P>
      <P>(a) to provide for substantial increases in social welfare payment rates, including increasing the old age pension to £100 per week over a five year period;</P>
      <P>(b) to progressively relax the qualifying conditions for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit and to increase the value of the allowance in real terms;</P>
      <P>(c) to implement the report of the commission on the status of people with disabilities, including an overhaul of the means by which the State supports the incomes of people with disabilities;</P>
      <P>(d) to refocus the tax and welfare system in favour of the family unity; and</P>
      <P>(e) to establish a national mediation service.</P>
      <P>In addition, Partnership 2000 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the following:</P>
      <P>(1) the implementation of the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare before the end of the partnership;</P>
      <P>(2) Family income supplement to be reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis;</P>
      <P>(3) the alleviation of the poverty trap created by the £60 spousal income limit for the purposes of entitlement to the qualified adult allowance and child dependant allowance; and</P>
      <P>(4) the strengthening and expansion of the community development programme operated by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the move by the Government to focus more effectively on specific areas of policy, my Department's policy focus is being strengthened and deepened in relation to the impact of State policies on family life.  In this regard, the recommendations in the final report of the commission on the family, which is due shortly, will form the <Col N="1017" /> basis for the development of an integrated policy to support families for the future.</P>

      <Quest>the rates of payment to benefit recipients for child dependants; and the reason different rates apply to different schemes irrespective of the status of the child.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16412/97]</QRef>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum rates of payment for child dependants are set out in a tabular statement which I will make available to the Deputy.  There are currently three different rates of child dependent allowances payable to social welfare recipients.  The reasons for this are largely historical.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that the rates be rationalised. Significant progress has been made &mdash; there were 36 different rates payble in 1987; now there are only three.  Further rationalisation would be extremely costly: the cost of paying all child dependant allowances at the highest rate currently paid is estimated to be in the region of £58 million.</P>
      <P>It is widely recognised that the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. This issue has been highlighted in various reports, notably the final report of the expert working group on integrating tax and social welfare.</P>
      <P>Policy direction in relation to child income support in recent years has, therefore, focused on targeting resources towards the provision of substantial increases in child benefit.  This approach, which centres on making child income support more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parent, has the effect of reducing work disincentives.</P>
      <P>Child benefit remains one of the most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes and because it is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc. , it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention, in the context of reducing disincentives to work, that priority has been given to utilising family income supplement (FIS) as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children.  Accordingly, in line with a commitment made in the Partnership 2000 Agreement, FIS will be reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on <Col N="1018" /> gross wages, as at present.  This will increase the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.  Since June of this year, FIS is calculated on the basis of gross earnings less any PRSI contributions, levies and pension contributions payable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying reason for the 16 per cent increase in the provision for supplementary welfare allowance next year is the expectation that the significant increase in expenditure and in take-up seen in recent years will continue into 1998.</P>
      <P>The main increases in SWA expenditure in recent years have been on rent supplements.  This can be attributed to the increasing demand for and cost of private rented accommodation.  A number of factors are contributing to that situation, including large increases in rent levels due to a shortage of low cost housing, a shortage of local authority housing, growth in marriage breakdown and increases in the number of one parent families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people receiving basic SWA payments has also increased in recent years.  For example, there were just over 19,500 people getting a basic SWA payment at the end of 1996, compared to 16,500 at the end of 1995.  Most of this increase is due to accounting changes which followed the transfer of administrative responsibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA), as it then was, from health boards to my Department in August 1995.  An increase has occurred in expenditure on disability allowance, i.e. formerly disabled person's maintenance <Col N="1019" /> allowance, which has, in turn, impacted on payments of supplementary welfare allowance for people awaiting disability allowance.</P>
    <P>Another part of this increase is due to the growth in the number of asylum seekers.  Asylum seekers are not permitted to work in Ireland while awaiting a decision on their claim and so are in receipt of weekly basic SWA payments and, where appropriate, rent supplements.  The cost of SWA payments to asylum seekers is not expected to be significantly higher in 1998 compared to 1997.  This is because the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland has fallen each month since July 1997 and it is expected that the backlog of decisions on asylum claims will be reduced significantly during 1998.</P>
    <P>A further factor contributing to the growth in expenditure is that participants on some back to work, community employment and educational schemes are allowed, within certain limits, to retain secondary benefits to which they were previously entitled immediately prior to joining the scheme.  Such secondary benefits include rent and mortgage interest supplements, subject to a £250 monthly limit in the amount of the payment and a £250 per week income limit, diet supplements, fuel allowance and the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance under the SWA scheme, butter vouchers, medical card and local authority differential rent.  Participation on these schemes can continue from one to three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department in conjunction with the Pensions Board is currently sponsoring a national pensions policy initiative.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the initiative is to facilitate a national debate on how to work towards a national pension system consistent with the aim of providing pension benefits which maintain a reasonable relationship with previous income levels so that established standards of living can be maintained.</P>
      <P>This initiative is now at an advanced stage and I expect a report, including recommendations, from the Pensions Board in the New Year.  The position of pensions, both Social Welfare and Occupational, and pensioners generally and the role of the social insurance fund will arise for consideration in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final report of the National Pensions Board, published in 1993, recommended that an actuarial review of the cost of Social Welfare pensions should be carried out at least every five <Col N="1020" /> years.  The first such review was published in September and I intend providing a legislative basis for such a review to be undertaken every five years.  The results of this review have fed into the initiative.</P>
    <P>The social insurance fund plays a key role in the provision of social protection in Irish society. People, when they are economically active, make contributions to the fund according to their ability to pay and depending on the range of benefits and pensions for which they are covered. These payments fund the pensions of an earlier generation of contributors and also pay benefits to persons who are not working due to unemployment or illness.  Contributors, accordingly, build up entitlements to various pensions and benefits which are paid to them as of right, without having to undergo a means test.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to enhancing the long-term security of the fund.  In this regard, one of the issues which I am examining for the future is the establishment of a Social Insurance Board. The possible role and composition of such a board is under consideration.</P>
    <P>Overall, this is a very important time for pensions policy.  We need to look comprehensively and very carefully, over a relatively short time frame, at the present position.  We then need to make decisions and, most importantly, to carry those decisions through so that we face up to, and deal with the medium and long-term issues so as to ensure that the living standards of future generations of pensioners are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>This national pensions policy initiative, the actuarial review and the setting up of the social insurance board are important steps towards achieving this.</P>

      <P>The 1997 budget provided for the introduction of a range of improvements in the social welare system, including as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) the introduction of two new payments &mdash; the widower's (non-contributory) pension and sickness allowance;</P>
      <P>(b) the extension of maternity and adpotive benefit to the self-employed;</P>
      <P>(c) an extension of the disability allowance scheme to provide for the payment of the allowance at half-rate to persons in part-time residential care;</P>
      <P>(d) a revision in the method of assessing capital for various social welfare payments;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) the continued payment of qualified adult <Col N="1021" /> allowance on a tapering basis for recipients of unemployment benefit and assistance, disability allowance, injury benefit, disability benefit and pre-retirement allowance where the spouse's earnings are between £60 and £90; and</P>
    <P>(f) a 50 per cent increase in the level of carer's allowance payable where a carer is caring for more than one person.</P>
    <P>The majority of the improvements provided for in the 1997 budget have already taken effect.  For example, the 50 per cent increase in the rate of carer's allowance and the extensions of disability allowance to people in part-time residential care and maternity and adoptive benefit to the self-employed were introduced with effect from early June, while the new widower's (non-contributory) pension was introduced with effect from 17 October.  However, the sickness allowance scheme has still to be introduced.</P>
    <P>Under current Social Welfare provisions, disability benefit (DB) is payable to persons who are temporarily incapable of work due to illness or injury and who fulfil the contributory requirements. However, there is no provision in the social welfare code at present for an analogous means-tested social assistance payment for people who have insufficient contributions to qualify for DB.  The needs of people within this category are at present catered for by supplementary welfare allowance.  This years budget provided for the completion of the cover available for people who are unable to work due to illness or injury, with the introduction of a new social assistance payment &mdash; sickness allowance.</P>
    <P>It was originally envisaged that the sickness allowance scheme would commence this year. However, it has been found that the level of computer systems development work which would be required to introduce this scheme is such that it could jeopardise the critical work which it is necessary to undertake in order to ensure that all the Department's computer based payments systems are fully prepared for the Year 2000.  In the circumstances, it has been necessary to defer the introducton of the sickness allowance scheme for the present.  I will be reviewing the position in mid-1998 in the light of progress on Year 2000 preparations.</P>
    <P>I should point out however, that all of those who would qualify for this new payment, are currently catered for under existing social welfare payments, such as supplementary welfare allowance and will not lose out as a result of the deferred implementation.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available categorised by postal district.  However, it is available by the relevant Social Welfare local office and I propose to circulate a table with this information with an indication of the postal district or districts served by each office.</P>
      <P>All of the local offices within the Dublin area have shown a reduction in the number of people signing on the live register in the year to October 1997.  The largest absolute decrease was in respect of the areas served by the Cumberland Street local office where the figures dropped from 10,113 in October 1996 to 8,865 in October 1997 &mdash; a decrease of 1,248, 12 per cent.  The largest percentage decrease was in the areas served by Victoria Street Local Office where the figures dropped from 3,631 to 2,821 &mdash; a decrease of 1,248 or 22 per cent.</P>
      <P>The live register figure for the Dublin region generally decreased by over 10,000 in the past year &mdash; from 84,493 in October 1996 to 74,179 in October 1997 &mdash; a decrease of 12 per cent.  The percentage decrease in the Dublin area is higher than the national decrease of 9 per cent for the same period.  The total number of people on the live register at the end of October 1996 was 267,586, and this dropped to 243,961 at the end of October 1997.</P>
      <P>The fall in the live register is due to the record level of job creation, the take-up of targeted schemes such as the back-to-work allowance scheme designed to facilitate the re-entry of the unemployed onto the workforce and measures introduced by my Department to ensure that only those entitled to receive payments get them.</P>

      <P>I indicated in my reply to questions on the topic of basic income on Wednesday, 15 October, that there is a commitment in Partnership 2000 to carry out a further independent appraisal of the concept of, and the full implications of introducing a basic income payment.  A broadly-based steering group for this project has been established under the chairmanship of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The steering group is currently in the process of finalising the terms of reference for the study, following discussions with experts in this area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government is committed to producing a green paper on the issue of basic income within two years.  The research being commissioned under Partnership 2000 will be an important input into that paper, and I would envisage that work on the green paper would begin when the results of the independent study become available.</P>

      <P>In the normal course, to receive payment of a social welfare benefit, allowance or pension, a person is required to provide ongoing verification of entitlement, through submission of medical evidence, declaration of unemployment, signature of payment voucher, etc.</P>
      <P>In cases where payment is made through post offices, it is restricted to one post office of the beneficiary's choice and the beneficiary is normally known to the staff of that office.  The beneficiary is required to attend personally to obtain payment or, where this is not possible due to illness, he-she may provide written authority to a third party to receive payment on his-her behalf. The payment voucher and the written authority, where applicable, are subject to signature verification by the post office official.  Paid vouchers are subject to a reconciliation process which selects cases, against previously determined norms, for review in relation to possible abuses.</P>
      <P>A proportion of payments are made by direct electronic credit to a bank, building society or post office account in the name of the payee.  In these cases, arrangements are in place for the financial institutions concerned to inform the Department as soon as they become aware of a client's death.</P>
      <P>The Department carries out over 400,000 reviews each year which include home visits and mail shots to customers.  These control mechanisms occasionally detect a client death that had not come to the Department's attention through other mechanisms but this is rare.</P>
      <P>In addition to the measures outlined already, discussions are ongoing with the General Register Office (GRO) with a view to obtaining regular information relating to death registrations when that office's records become computerised.</P>
      <P>About 20,000 pensioner deaths are notified to the Department each year.  The Department is ususally informed quickly by the next-of-kin, and in some cases by the post office concerned.  There are after-death pension entitlements available to the spouses of deceased pensioners, as well as death grant and widow(er)'s pension entitlements. The existence of these, and of the controls at the point of payment are effective in preventing abuses.  The periodic reviews mentioned also provide safeguards against attempts to circumvent those controls.</P>
      <P>The control of abuse is a high priority for my Department and the mechanisms to achieve this are kept under review in the light of experience.</P>

      <P>The abridged Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version) and summary public capital programme provide for grantin-aid funding of £2,273,000 to the Combat Poverty Agency in 1998, representing an increase of £16,000 on the 1997 provision of £2,257,000.</P>
      <P>This increase in funding in the 1998 Estimates arises from the additional pay costs in the agency's 1998 budget, to meet the agency's commitments under the terms of the PCW and Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 120 and 121 together. Under the social welfare legislation every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of any dependent of <Col N="1026" /> his has an entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance (SWA).</P>
      <P>The purpose of the SWA scheme is to provide a basic weekly allowance to people who have little or no income.  People with low incomes may also qualify for a weekly supplement to meet certain special needs including rent and mortgage interest supplements, a diet or heating supplement or an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help with the cost of any exceptional needs they may have.</P>
      <P>The total expenditure figures in respect of supplementary welfare allowance in 1996 are shown in the following tabular statement.  The actual breakdown of payments for each health board are not yet finalised.</P>
      <P>The number of beneficiaries and the number of recipients per health board are also set in the following tabular statements.  Because of the number of different types of payments and supplements under the scheme it is not possible to give an average payment.</P>
      <P>The most common request for assistance under the SWA scheme is in respect of rent and mortgage interest supplements.</P>

      <P>The free schemes, including the free electricity allowance and the free telephone rental allowance are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition.  This condition is not, however, applied in the case of persons over age 75 who are in receipt of a qualifying payment.</P>
      <P>Widows between the age of 60 and 65, whose late husbands had entitlements to the free schemes, retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>The free scheme included low-income pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type payment.  The weekly income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age (contributory) pension, currently £78 per week, plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.</P>
      <P>To extend the free electricity allowance and the free telephone rental allowance to all people over the age of 75 would involve significant additional expenditure which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>An EU regulation adopted in November, 1995, permits member states to use existing funding from the fisheries instrument for fisheries guidance (FIFG) allocations, for the part-financing of national early retirement schemes for fishermen.</P>
      <P>However, no additional funding has been provided by the EU to support such schemes.  This means that any scheme would have to be funded out of already fully committed funding under our other investment programmes for fleet modernisation and fish processing where the priorities are job maintenance and job creation.  I will however be encouraging the Commission to explore the scope for providing alternative resources of funding, such as the European Social Fund, for such schemes.</P>

      <P>As I stated in the Dáil on 18 November, implementation of this Act is primarily for the local authorities, who have been given wide powers to designate control areas, as well as powers of detention, seizure, etc. , with effect from 18 March 1997, when the Act was brought into operation. In view of renewed public concern about wandering horses in the Dublin area, where the problem is largely concentrated, my Department met senior representatives of the four Dublin authorities recently with a view to ensuring that progress with implementation is expedited.  I understand that each local authority with a &ldquo;wandering horse&rdquo; problem is working towards effective implementation of the Act with its functional area, although for a variety of reasons there are variations in the rate of progress in this regard.  I have made it known that I want the problem dealt with as soon as possible in all areas, and my Department is providing grant assistance to local authorities towards this end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to reduce Ireland's quota for the special beef premium was taken at the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 29 October 1996 in the context of a package of measures aimed at rebalancing the beef market in the EU following the sharp fall in beef consumption arising from the BSE scare earlier in the year.  The reduction in the special beef premium quota on the EU wide basis was 2.1 million premium rights, of which 284,000 rights related to Ireland.  It should be noted, however, that the lower quota applies for 1997 and 1988 only.</P>
      <P>The total number of animals recorded by my Department as being submitted to date in 1997 for the ten month special beef premium is some 765,000 head.  As the quota for 1997 is 1,002,458 quota rights, the balance remaining up to 5 December next, when applications close for the year, is some 237,458 quota rights.  In view of the fact that 620,000 male calves are registered as having been born between 1 January 1997 and 5 April 1997, and are thus eligible for submission for the ten month special beef premium in 1997, there is a possibility that the quota will be exceeded in 1997.</P>

      <P>Where an overclaim is found following an inspection, the EU Regulations which govern the area aid schemes specify that penalties must be applied.  The appropriate penalty for a 14 per cent overclaim is to reduce the area found by double the overclaim resulting in an area of 10.79 hectares. This area will be used to calculate the premium payments due to the herdowner.  The payments will issue within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>It is a requirement of Council Regulation 2079/92 under which the scheme of early retirement from farming is implemented that the minimum size of the holding to be transferred to an eligible transferee is five hectares of utilisable agricultural area.</P>
      <P>Currently over 7,000 farmers have availed of the scheme, which is well ahead of the anticipated target at this stage.  It is clear that the minimum holding requirement of five hectares of utilisable agricultural area has not had any significant impact on the uptake of the scheme.  However, as I have stated in reply to previous similar questions, when the current scheme is being reviewed it is my intention that this matter will be raised with the European Commission.</P>

      <P>The relevant information available is in respect of recipients of social welfare pensions, of whom some 33,000 individuals aged 65 years or over are estimated to have taxable incomes.</P>
      <P>In the case of social welfare pension income, the extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that the social welfare recipient, or the recipient's spouse, has in the particular tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that income tax statistics do not generally distinguish between the amounts of tax that arise from pensions and from other sources.  However, it is tentatively estimated that the cost in terms of tax forgone on combined pension and other income from exempting social welfare pensions from tax could be of the order of £30 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>The Finance Act, 1992 sets out the statutory requirement for the payment of vehicle registration tax on motor vehicles, whether new or secondhand, brought into the State.  All such vehicles are subject to the payment of VRT, except in circumstances where relief is specifically provided for, e.g. in the case of vehicles for use by disabled persons, at the appropriate rates set out in that Act, as amended.  The method of acquisition of the vehicle is not a determinant for the purposes of the payment of VRT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> As regards VAT, the position is as follows. There is a special EU regime for the application of VAT to motor vehicles.  In order to protect the Exchequer interests of member states, the VAT on new motor vehicles applies in the member state in which the vehicles are intended for use. A new vehicle is defined in EU VAT law as one which is less than six months old or has travelled less than 6,000 kilometres.  Such a vehicle which is moved from one member state to a second by a private individual for his or her use, is normally liable to VAT in the latter state and, in any event, must be subject to VAT in one of them.  Such a car may not be relieved of VAT on the grounds that it has been won in a competition.  The collection of VAT is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. If the Deputy has a specific case in mind she should ask the person concerned to contact the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to the transfer of radiotherapy services from St. Anne's to St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin.  By way of background, I should explain that St. Luke's and St. Anne's Hospitals were incorporated by Establishment Order in 1988 and since then the hospital has been run by a joint board of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993 it was agreed that radiotheraphy and oncology services at St. Luke's-St. Anne's Hospital should be consolidated at one site, St. Luke's.  It was also agreed with the Daughters of Charity to develop palliative care services by transferring some of the services provided at St. Anne's to the new in-patient facility at St. Francis <Col N="1040" /> Hospice, Raheny.  This new 19 bedded unit has since been commissioned and represents a significant enhancement in the provision of palliative care services.</P>
    <P>My Department is presently involved in a major redevelopment of St. Luke's Hospital at a cost of approximately £20 million.  This redevelopment, which has the full support of all interests represented on the board of the hospitals, involves the complete upgrading of accommodation throughout the hospital and the provision of a package of new radiotherapy equipment.  As part of the development, services at St. Anne's will transfer to the new St. Luke's Hospital which will have 144 beds, including day beds and hostel places.  These beds will be situated in an environment providing all normal modern hospital facilities, e.g. medical gases, nurse call system, patient amenities such as radio and TV and easy access to all areas of the hospital.  The hostel, which will have 20 beds available, will be specifically designed to support patients from outside Dublin in need of overnight accommodation while attending for therapy.</P>
    <P>The concentration of all facilities on one site will enable patients from across the country to benefit from the modern radiotherapy treatment facilities being installed at St. Luke's as part of the redevelopment and will ensure the delivery of quality oncology services by St. Luke's as the national tertiary referral centre.</P>
    <P>The hospital has assured me that any patients who would otherwise have been treated at St. Anne's will be admitted to St. Luke's following the closure of St. Anne's.  All the arrangements necessary are being put in place to ensure continuity of care for patients.  Finally, the hospital has stressed that admissions to St. Luke's Hospital is based on clinical need as defined by the consultant in charge.</P>

      <P>The development of St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, is a matter, in the first instance for the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have recently approved a capital grant of £475,000 for the purchase of a CT Scanner at St. Columcille's Hospital, and the necessary infrastructural work associated with the installation of the machine.  I understand from the Eastern Health Board that the radiology department at St. Columcille's Hospital will be extended to accommodate the CT Scanner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Captal grants totalling £186,000 were approved this year for the purchase of equipment at St. Columcille's <Col N="1041" /> Hospital.  A capital grant of £300,000 was also approved towards the upgrading of electrical services.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these developments will serve to significantly enhance the level of service to patients at St. Columcille's Hospital and is an indication of the Government's commitment to the continued development of acute hospital services in the south-east Dublin-east Wicklow region.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Eastern Health Board has also submitted proposals to my Department for the further development of the radiology department and a new day services department at St. Columcille's Hospital.  The submission is being examined within my Department, in consultation with the Eastern Health Bord.</P>

      <P>My Department's Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001 was published earlier this year and is based on information from the national intellectual disability database.  The assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential-respite places and 1,036 new day places over the next five years.  It is estimated that the cost of providing these services would be in the region of £63.5 million over the period.  Additional funding of £12 million was made available in 1997 to begin the process of meeting these needs.</P>
      <P>As outlined in both Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and An Action Programme for the Millenium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services for persons with a mental handicap in line with the needs outlined in that assessment.</P>
      <P>I am not yet however in a position to comment on the overall level of funding which may be available for any particular service in 1998.</P>

      <P>The dental treatment services scheme is a scheme designed for the provision of dental treatment services for adults &mdash; persons aged 16 years and over &mdash; with medical card entitlement.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by patients who are on the waiting list for lung or heart-lung transplant and I am committed to improving the existing situation.  Under present arrangements Irish patients considered in need of lung or heart-lung transplant are referred by their medical consultant for assessment to an established transplant centre in the UK and if suitable are put on the waiting list for a transplant.  At present the number of patients on the waiting list exceeds the availability of suitable organs.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, includes a commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland.  My Department is now carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the issues involved in establishing this complex service.  It is my view that the immediate requirement is to examine whether the existing service being offered to Irish patients and their families in the UK can be improved. In this regard officials from my Department have raised this matter in recent discussions with the United Kingdom Transplant Support Service Authority (TSSA) which monitors activity across all UK transplant sites.  The issue is being examined as a matter of urgency by the UK TSSA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My officials are also having discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Health <Col N="1043" /> in London, following which arrangements will be finalised for appropriate site visits to transplant centres in the UK with a view to contracting work to a selected and proven centre.</P>
    <P>The overall assessment of the issues involved in setting up a lung and heart-lung facility in Ireland will have particular regard to the experience of other countries, including those with a population size similar to Ireland, which have previously examined the feasibility of establishing a successful lung or heart-lung transplant programme. My Department is drawing upon the expert views of key professionals in this field as part of the assessment.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the establishment of any successful transplant programme is an extremely complex and difficult task.  One of the critical factors in the successful delivery of a quality transplant programme is whether the level of transplant activity in an established programme is sufficient to maintain the level of expertise required to achieve successful outcomes.  It is also essential to have appropriately trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multi-disciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes.  A phased approach needs to be adopted, recognising the need to build expertise and to create a programme that is viable in terms of the outcomes for patients, whether it be at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department have had a number of meetings with the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland to discuss the issues involved in setting up a transplant programme.  The association is being kept fully informed of developments in this area and I will meet representatives of the association in the near future to discuss the matter further.</P>

      <P>Under the devolved arrangements for the group water scheme programme, local authorities were asked to submit multi-annual programmes for group water and sewerage schemes and small public water and sewerage schemes costing up to £250,000.  Block grants for 1998 will be allocated based on the amount of funding available and the priority of the works proposed in each local authority area.  Cavan County Council has now submitted its multi-annual programme for consideration in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of rationalising <Col N="1048" /> the number of social assistance schemes is kept under continuous review.  As part of this process the new one-parent family payment (OFP), which was introduced in January 1997, merged the previous social assistance schemes for lone parents and deserted wife's benefit recipients.</P>
      <P>However, it should be borne in mind that different categories of social welfare recipients have differing needs.  The social welfare system must, therefore, be flexible enough to respond adequately to these needs.  For example, the different methods of assessing earnings as between the various social assistance payment schemes reflect specific policies being pursued by my Department, which are aimed at targeting particular groups of recipients for special attention.</P>
      <P>Most recently, however, the process of standardising the assessment of capital across the different social assistance schemes has been initiated, so as to improve the equity of the system. The introduction of the disability allowance (DA) scheme in October 1996 and the one-parent family payment scheme in January 1997 presented the opportunity to commence this process.</P>
      <P>Under the new assessment provisions, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent of the capital value and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent.  These provisions were further extended under the Social Welfare Act, 1997 to the old age (non-contributory) pension, widow's and widower's (non-contributory) pension, orphan's (non-contributory) pension, carer's allowance and pre-retirement allowance schemes, with effect from October 1997.</P>
      <P>The question of extending them to the other social assistance schemes, that is unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, is being examined in a budgetary context, in the light of the available resources and other priorities.</P>
      <P>Further rationalisation and streamlining of social welfare payment categories will be considered as the opportunities arise and resources allow.</P>

      <P>The widow's and widower's pension schemes recognise the financial difficulties that arise for people who are bereaved by the death of their spouse.  The qualification conditions for a widow's or widower's (contributory) pension are less onerous than those pertaining to other social welfare pensions reflecting the difficulties of widowhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> To qualify for a widow's or widower's (contributory) pension, a person may use the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years to satisfy the yearly average condition.  Also a widow or widower can qualify on his-her own or late spouse's record. The rate for the widow's-widower's (contributory) pension at £71.10 per week is currently 103 per cent of the Commission on Social Welfare's recommended main rate.  The non-contribuory rate at £67.50 is 98 per cent of the commission's rate.</P>
    <P>The one-parent family payment is available to those widows or widowers, with children who do not qualify for contributory widow's-widower's pension.  This payment is available to men and women who are parenting alone and it is designed first, to provide basic income support, taking into account the special needs and requirements of single parents, and, secondly, to encourage lone parents to return to the workforce so that, over time, they can achieve a greater degree of economic independence.  To his end, an earnings disregard of £6,000 per year is available under the one-parent family payment means test to those lone parents in employment.</P>
    <P>A widow's or widower's (non-contributory) pension is available to those widows and widowers without children who do not qualify for the contributory pension and is payable subject to a means test.  Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years and over.  The other free schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 and over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition.  In addition, widows and widowers between the age of 60 and 65 whose late spouses had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.  I will keep the supports for widows under review and they will be improved as resources permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In Ireland, child benefit remains one of the most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families and particularly to families on low incomes.  Because it is not taxable, is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc. , it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment.  Accordingly, priority has been given in recent years to assisting low income families and in particular, larger families. This has been achieved by increasing the higher rate of child benefit, payable in respect of third and subsequent children, from £25 in 1994 to £39 this year.  In addition, the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first and second child, has been increased from £20 in 1994 to £30 this year.</P>
      <P>Child benefit in a European context is a family benefit.  Such benefits vary considerably among member states of the EU both in terms of rates of payment, conditions of entitlement and family composition.  The latest edition, 1995, of MISSOC, the European Union information system on social protection, provides comparative tables on family benefits and other benefits in each of the member states.  A copy of this publication is available in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members.  A more up to date publication is expected shortly.  I will arrange for a copy to be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and for the Deputy to be notified of its availability.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over as well as certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Currently, about 497,000 people qualify for free travel at an estimated annual cost of £32.4 million.</P>
      <P>Free travel companion passes have been available since 1990 to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone.  The free travel companion pass enables a person aged 16 years or over to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, the companion passes are available to the following main groups: recipients of blind person's pension from my Department and to all blind people who are registered with the National Council-League of the Blind; people getting disability allowance from my Department who are medically certified that they are unfit to travel alone; recipients of invalidity pension who are medically certified that they are permanently <Col N="1052" /> wheelchair bound; and persons receiving care from a carer who is in receipt of a carer's allowance.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a major restoration of the Connolly Folly was undertaken by the Irish Georgian Society in the early 1960s.  In the intervening period there has been some deterioration and wanton vandalism. Since coming into State care in 1993, fencing and gates have been erected at the Connolly Folly in order to protect the site and an initial structural survey was carried out which indicated some cracking necessitating more detailed survey and monitoring.  This study is being undertaken at present and will be completed shortly and the need for any further restoration works to the Folly will then be evaluated.  However, I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that my Department's present priority must be the restoration programme for Castletown House itself.</P>

      <P>My Department established the expert working group on child care in July 1997 under Partnership 2000, to devise a national framework for the development of child care facilities in Ireland.  The Minister of State launched the expert working group on 18 July 1997 and it is chaired by an assistant secretary of the Department.  The group is due to report by end of December 1998.</P>
      <P>The term child care, for the purposes of this group, is used a decribe day care facilities and services for pre-school children and school-going children out of school hours.  It includes services offering care, education and socialisation opportunities for children to the benefit of children, parents, employers and the wider community. Thus services such as pre-schools, naíonraí, day care services, creches, playgroups, private child-minding and after-school groups are included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the group represent a range of Government Departments, statutory bodies, non-governmental organisations and individuals who have expertise and an interest in the area of child care.  The group is focusing on the following child care issues: financial and employment implications of an integrated approach to the provision of child care facilities in Ireland; registration, training and qualifications of child care workers; resourcing and sustaining child care within urban disadvantaged areas; resourcing and sustaining child care within rural areas; regulations and standards, implementation of the Child Care (Pre-School <Col N="1056" /> Services) Regulations, 1996 and Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991; the needs and rights of children in relation to the development of a national framework; and equality of access and participation in relation to a national framework.</P>
    <P>My Department placed an advertisement in the national press during the week ending 16 November 1997, inviting written submissions to the expert working group from interested parties.  I know the Deputy will be pleased with this child care initiative and I assure him I will present any proposals on child care which emerge from this expert group to the Government.</P>

The Garda authorities have informed me that it is anticipated that the sergeant will return to Carbury Garda station in the near future.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied with the level of policing in the Carbury sub-district during the temporary transfer of the sergeant to Rathcoole Garda station.  At present the area is policed by the garda allocated to Carbury Garda station and I understand that a vanette which is shared with the neighbouring station in Robertstown is available to him for the purpose of carrying out mobile patrols in the sub-district.  These patrols are augmented by regular patrols carried out by mobile units from Newbridge Garda station and the district headquarters at Kildare Garda station.  In addition, I understand from the Garda authorities that the sergeant in Robertstown gives assistance in Carbury as required.</P>

Two representatives from the school were present and were accompanied by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Miss de Valera and Deputies Daly and Killeen.  I was accompanied by my special adviser.  Arising from our discussions we arranged for further contact in order to advance this project without undue delay.</P>

      <P>I have received the communication to which the Deputy refers.  I am very pleased to note the positive impact which the appointment of a teaching counsellor has had on the school in question.</P>
      <P>Under the pilot phase of the scheme, my Department is already providing significant in-service training and support for the teaching counsellors.  An induction programme which focused on counselling skills was held in 1996 and the teachers concerned are currently participating in a diploma course in Trinity College Dublin. Participants in this course have access to the extensive library facilities of the college.  In addition, the West Dublin Education Centre has purchased a wide variety of appropriate books and materials to which the teaching counsellors also have access.</P>
      <P>A steering committee, which is focused on the in-service elements of this pilot scheme, meets on a regular basis in the West Dublin Education Centre.  Membership of this committee includes officials from my Department, representatives of the teaching counsellors and school principals involved in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The operation of the pilot phase of the scheme is being closely monitored by my Department's inspectorate.  A detailed evaluation of the scheme is currently under way.  I expect to receive a report on the outcome of the evaluation before the end of the current school year.  The question of any further expansion of the scheme will be considered following completion of the evaluation.</P>
