      <P>It is proposed to take No. 17 &mdash; Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance [1997] (Resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Private Members' Business shall be No. 44 &mdash; motion No. 16 concerning hepatitis C (Resumed) and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>The list of legislation to be published before Easter includes the bail Bill.  May I ask the Taoiseach when exactly it will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy any more precise details than that.  We intend to have it here before Easter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The referendum was held in November.  I presume it is not any great job to put the Bill together since it was more or less <Col N="2" /> ready in the Department of Justice prior to that according to the Minister.  Will we get it in February?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation involves the consolidation of two items of legislation concerning bail in one Bill.  That is now being done.  I have already indicated to the Deputy that the legislation will be produced here before Easter. It is receiving priority drafting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned Easter which reminds me of the National Parks and Areas Bill, a matter I continually inquire about in each session.  Each time I raise this issue the Taoiseach kindly writes back to me, but it was promised before Easter 1995.  I had a particular interest in it when I was in Government, concerning <Col N="3" /> a few national institutions in the city.  Will we see it before Easter 1997?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation will not be produced until the second half of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach promised the Bill would be available before Easter 1995.  Why will it not be available until the second half of the year?  What is wrong?  The Taoiseach wrote to me last summer saying he hoped it would be ready for the autumn session.  I appreciated the letter, but he might explain what has gone wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable drafting problems have been encountered in regard to this matter.  Obviously, any legislation framed in this area has to be consistent with constitutional rights and other considerations of importance.  When I wrote to the Deputy and made previous statements on this matter, I did not anticipate that those difficulties would be as intractable as they have proven to be.  The situation now is that this legislation will not be produced in the first half of the year, but will be produced in the second half.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to Members of the House, can the Taoiseach issue a comprehensive statement on behalf of the Government on the upgrading of Cork regional technical college and the other regional technical colleges, as leaked this morning to the newspapers?  We are owed a comprehensive statement detailing the terms of reference and the timetable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Teastas legislation I would like to know when we can have a comprehensive statement because it was mentioned in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, I refer the Taoiseach to an interview given by the Minister for Social Welfare which was published in yesterday's newspapers.  The Minister indicated he would have to stay in office until next Christmas because he has so much legislation to implement, including a referendum on Cabinet confidentiality. On the off-chance that he might know something about this, will the Taoiseach say if he has any slight notion or idea about what is happening in this regard? For example, when will legislation be brought before the House?  If the Taoiseach does not know and understand, we all know who is in charge here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has many calls on his time.  I understand he was not in the Dáil yesterday <Col N="4" /> to hear me answer Questions on that precise matter.  I invite the Deputy to improve his attendance rate in the Chamber and he might improve his information level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The marching season begins next month and I understand the recommendations of the North Commission dealing with that issue are being brought through the House of Commons tomorrow by Sir Patrick Mayhew.  Has the Taoiseach any knowledge of these recommendations and has the Northern Ireland Secretary been in touch with him regarding them?  They are important regarding the coming marching season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not strictly relevant now, but if the Taoiseach wishes to intervene that is his prerogative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we learn the lessons of last year when the marches led to a great deepening of divisions in Northern Ireland. It is important there should be a mechanism for ensuring that the right to march is exercised in a fashion consistent with the right of people who may not agree with the objectives of those conducting a march to have their dignity respected. This is obviously not an easy task.  The North Commission is about to report.  The Government maintains a close interest in the subject, recognising the rights of all concerned in the matter. This is a case of balancing conflicting rights.  It is not a question of one right having absolute precedence over another, but rather an issue of balancing rights in an appropriate and fair way that is seen to promote community relations rather than promoting division within the community, which unfortunately the events of last year did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Government's intention to give absolute priority to the establishment of the Food Safety Board of Ireland and to publish that Bill at the earliest opportunity, particularly bearing in mind the death of a young child from an unusual strain of the E-Coli bacteria which seems to me a warning sign that this is a long overdue Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has already established the food safety body on a non-statutory basis.  We are giving absolute priority to putting it on a statutory basis.  The Government is conscious of concerns about food safety and the need to ensure that this country, which is a major producer of food, is also a major leader in promoting the highest possible standards of food safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, for some nine or ten months ten pieces of legislation have been promised by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Is there any indication that the new Minister might at some <Col N="5" /> stage bring forward some of this legislation, in particular, the Utilities Regulatory Commission Bill, which is to give independent regulation to the energy, telecommunications and transport sectors? Specifically, is it still the Government's intention to go ahead with that Bill or are the deep ideological divisions I hear about stopping it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Freedom of Information Bill, the Taoiseach is reported as saying yesterday that the Government has no plans to change the Official Secrets Act.  If the Government does not plan to change the Official Secrets Act, what is the point in going ahead with a freedom of information Bill since the Official Secrets Act makes everything a secret and prevents the disclosure of information unless it is authorised, and this covers a very wide range?  The two are in conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any legislation that is passed now supersedes and amends any legislation which affects the area covered by the legislation being introduced.  Therefore, any changes that are necessary to facilitate the provisions of the Freedom of Information Bill are being made by it as it passes through the Oireachtas.  Further, I did not say what I was quoted as saying about the Official Secrets Act &ldquo;somewhere&rdquo;.  I said it here in the Chamber yesterday, but the Deputy was not here to hear me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will recall that he gave a personal commitment, as did the Tánaiste, that this Government would seek to improve the accountability of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to this House to some extent.  As the compellability of witnesses Bill maintains the <i>status quo</i> in that regard, does the Taoiseach intend to introduce other legislation which would enhance the accountability of the DPP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated when this matter was raised before, the accountability of the Director of Public Prosecutions is being enhanced by a requirement that he produce an annual report of his activities, something that was not done previously, and there will be provision for that to be discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned yesterday I was speaking about economic and monetary union and Ireland's prospects if the United Kingdom were to remain outside the system. Could one imagine a situation where we qualified for monetary union but decided not to move with our partners in Europe and just hang outside because sterling was not going to be party to the new system for reasons which I again emphasise have nothing to do with economics but with the nationalistic outlook in the UK? Who would come to our aid if the Irish pound came under attack? Certainly not our partners whom we would have abandoned in their quest for monetary union, and certainly not sterling with which we broke some years ago and which would have no interest in trying to help to defend us against an attack on the Irish pound.  Furthermore, our influence in a new European central bank set-up would be nil if we were to remain outside the group of countries which would make up the first round of the euro currency.  It is ironic that our <Col N="7" /> influence in controlling our fiscal policy is much influenced by Europe; whenever Europe sneezes we get a cold.</P>
      <P>However true that may be, as members of the first round of monetary union forming a European central bank, we may have a lot more influence than we have had over the past decade.  Our relationship with our nearest neighbour is not unique in European terms, nor is it unique in world trading terms.</P>
      <P>For instance, companies in Ireland who have been internationally successful and dealt practically exclusively in the international export trade with American have seen phenomenal changes in the value of the Irish pound in its relationship to the American dollar.  The sort of changes that have taken place would be way beyond anything comprehended between Ireland within a European monetary system and sterling outside it.  We have demonstrated that we, and individual companies, have the capacity to cope with the fluctuations of the various currencies.</P>
      <P>Another point to be borne in mind is that many of the major multinational companies from the States which have located in Ireland have set their European headquarters within the Irish economy.  Clearly those companies would not be happy to see a new European monetary system, which would remove all their concerns about exchange rates and give them easy access to their markets in a one currency system, jeopardised by Ireland deciding to remain outside although it qualified for monetary union.  America clearly looks to the European economy, not to the exclusive British economy.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that we should not take on board the consequences of Ireland entering European monetary union and the UK staying outside, but it is my absolute view that we should be looking now at those sectors which will be most seriously affected by the UK remaining outside monetary union and Ireland joining.  Those companies should be given clear signals and told to plan their company structures, markets and fiscal policy on the basis of such an eventuality.  They have at least another two to three years to ensure that the difficulties of Ireland entering monetary union and the UK staying outside can be largely reduced with proper foresight and financial management planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have emphasised, there are plenty of examples of companies, such as Waterford Crystal in my constituency, which dealt exclusively with the American markets for years and experienced horrendous changes in the rate of the punt to the dollar but which overcame many of those difficulties with proper financial planning.  It was not easy.  We do ourselves no favours by creating many spurious arguments for the sake of debate while at the same time realising on any cold and serious analysis that Ireland's fortunes are clearly linked to the developing EU and not to a UK in decay and disarray which has very little interest in seeing the expansion of Europe to the detriment <Col N="8" /> or reduction of its power base.  Ireland's fortunes cannot be attached to nationalist arguments within the UK.  Our future clearly lies within Europe where we have a contribution to make and where an exciting future lies for all our citizens. Once we reach the Maastricht guidelines we should accept in principle that Ireland's future, and that of its partners, lies in Europe and not elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, spoke last night about the various levels of education and I want to refer to the upgrading of Waterford Regional Technical College to Waterford Institute of Technology.  People inside and outside this House and the many vested interest groups around the country are quite entitled to make their opinions known with regard to their colleges but they should do so on the merits of their cases.  I will not accept any denigration of my city, county, college or region just so others can make their case to upgrade their area.  They are entitled to do so but they should do it on the merits of their case.</P>
    <P>Waterford's case has been unique.  It is the only region in the country which lacks a university and a campaign has been running for 12 years to address that.  Waterford regional technical college is a college of excellence which has achieved the highest standards in third level education.  It won the argument with the Sexton report, which clearly pointed out that there was a deficiency in third level facilities in the south-east and recommended the upgrading of the regional technical college to Waterford Institute of Technology status.  That was the correct decision.  No other college was mentioned in that regard.  I respectfully suggest to all others concerned that if they have a case to make they should make it on its merits.  The case for Waterford stands alone in bringing about a balance in the provision of third level education.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned from the beginning at the way the Department of Education has handled this decision.  It was announced in a very lowkey way.  There was no reference to it in the Minister's speech last night when she laid out her plans for third level education.  I was astonished that she should refer to colleges at Blanchardstown, Galway, Castlebar and other areas and make no reference to the one on which probably one of most momentous decisions was taken on third level education in recent years.</P>
    <P>I heard this morning of the decision with regard to the review of all of the colleges.  It is not and never has been my view that a decision should be taken to change the regional colleges to institutes of technology.  That is not advancement in education. There may well be a case for the consideration of one or two colleges along with Waterford regional technical college, but there should be no attempt to remove a most successful stratum of third level education, that is, the regional colleges. They must remain and be given the resources to expand.  Equally, the institute of technology structure is a facility which has been <Col N="9" /> missing throughout third level education and Waterford certainly deserves its opportunity.  It must be given the resources.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Education to clarify whether the Government will proceed with individual legislation in the Waterford case or whether the Dublin Institute of Technology Acts are to be amended to include Waterford regional technical college.  I wish all the other regional technical colleges the best of luck but Waterford should be left alone.  We have made our case and won our argument and we are not giving sustenance to any other constituency or county.  We are on top for once and we intend to stay there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has proved an awful budget for the Opposition. It has engendered no little panic and significant bickering in the Opposition parties and some desperate attempts by Deputy Bertie Ahern and Deputy Harney to convince the nation that between them, despite the evidence to the contrary, they constitute a cogent, confident, coherent and attractive alternative to this most effective Government.</P>
      <P>Knowing there was little he could do to knock a sound progressive budget, Deputy McCreevy went walkabout in the political outback to fill the time allotted and Deputy Michael McDowell, skilled advocate that he is, chose to create a man of straw, a budget never actually presented by this Government, before proceeding to knock it down.  None of their respective colleagues has since improved on these budget day performances. The more scrutiny to which this budget is subjected, the better it looks.  It is right for our people and right for the country.</P>
      <P>However, the most surprising feature of the budget is the bust-up it has produced both between and within the two Opposition parties. The year end 'think' pieces almost invariably concluded that a FF/PD alliance was both comfortable and inevitable.  It was merely a question of which of the Marys would be Tánaiste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney was under no illusion about who would win that battle.  As the Progressive Democrats insider told <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, &ldquo;Bertie suffers a deficit in the statesmanship department&rdquo; and Deputy Harney would be necessary in order to &ldquo;put a bit of gloss on him&rdquo;, while Deputy McDowell marked out his own territory with his &ldquo;alternative budget&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was all too much for long-suffering Fianna Fáil backbenchers who fundamentally disagree with a range of Progressive Democrats policies and are still sore about the conduct of the Progressive Democrats in the last unhappy FF/PD Government which came to such an ignominious end.  If plain Michael McDowell, as he then was, could inflict such wounds from outside the House, what humiliations might he inflict on Fianna Fáil <Col N="10" /> from inside Government? The party Whip, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was sent out to put the assertive Progressive Democrats back in their box.  They would, he said, have &ldquo;an insignificant say&rdquo; in any future FF/PD Government.  &ldquo;Fianna Fáil would be firmly in the driving seat&rdquo;, he said. As a contemptuous put-down of the thrusting Progressive Democrats, it ranks with Deputy Reynolds's prophetic &ldquo;temporary little arrangement&rdquo; and Deputy Cowen's memorable &ldquo;when in doubt leave them out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dermot Ahern may since have been disowned by his leader.  Both Deputy Bertie Ahern and Deputy McDowell assure us that the Chief Whip was under excruciating pressure at the time on local radio and he did not intend what tumbled out.  I hope he never comes under real pressure.</P>
    <P>The reality, of course, is that Fianna Fáil at Malahide has totally changed direction.  The pre-Christmas `love-in' with the Progressive Democrats is over.  It is now back to the &ldquo;keeping our options open&rdquo; strategy and a reversion to taking a &ldquo;both sides of the road with us&rdquo; strategy.</P>

      <P>The facts are that in a wide range of policy areas Fianna Fáil is unhappy with the strident selfishness of the Progressive Democrats. In addition, the Progressive Democrats believe their Deputies are born to rule and Fianna Fáil believe they have a divine right to rule unimpeded by any other expression thrown up by the electorate,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The speech by Deputy Harney in 1994, which it is timely to recall, states:</P>
      <P>In Hong Kong, for example, a very successful economy, people work for low wages.  They're not rich, but they are happy and they cope....</P>
      <P>Not too many people are happy on low wages. How can people cope with no welfare system, terrible public housing, a world entirely comprising an overcrowded, high-rise, nightmare metropolis? What will the residents of Clyde Road say to such a prospect?</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney is nothing if not consistent.  The graceful and delicate removal of the second veil reveals her plan to effectively scrap the social insurance fund.  Social insurance, the PD chorus sings, is crippling and it rewards laziness and sloth.  Who will be Minister for Social Welfare in her brave new world and what will that Minister have to do?  Will there even be a Minister for Social Welfare and will there actually be a social welfare system?  Deputy Harney tells us candidly that she is only interested in helping those who help themselves. This has a resonance of Norman Tebbit's &ldquo;Get on your bikes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In like-minded Seoul, a million people register their opposition to ever more harsh and draconian labour laws and restrictions on civil rights.  Or have I missed something?  Are they dancing in the streets with joy at the prospect?</P>
      <P>Contrast also the Harney vision with the actions of the Minister for Social Welfare, a budget day package that takes account of the findings of the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare, the strategy paper on the labour market, Growing and Sharing our Employment, published by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, and the interim report of the Commission on the Family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly the PD political stage show is one by performers who care little for real tax and social welfare reform, the pursuit of the goal of sustainable long-term full employment and the role of the family in society, unless they are in the top earning bracket.  We are watching an ensemble that seems dedicated to ignoring the more than 406,000 people to whom contributory pensions and other benefits are paid, and who have paid <Col N="12" /> in their contributions during their working lives, and tearing up the long-term solidarity compact between employers, employees, the self-employed and the Government that is the social insurance fund and the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Now another veil is tantalisingly cast aside.  We at first glimpse, then see in all its glory, the Deputy's dedication to creating a State aimed at helping those who can help themselves.  Cutting the top rate of tax must be the pressing priority; the top rate of tax must plummet, and almost immediately, to 40 per cent.  However much we must aim to reduce the income tax burden on middle income households, the picture in respect of total tax take is not as the PD Deputies would have us believe.</P>
    <P>The following comparative table published in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 January 1997 contains an analysis prepared by the international accountancy and management consultancy firm, KPMG. It is post-budget and examines the case of a household comprising a married couple with two children, an income of £50,000 a year, a company car worth £20,000 and annual mortgage interest repayments of £5,000 a year, in other words, the kind of people being wooed daily by the Progressive Democrats.</P>

    <P>Source: KPMG/Irish Times.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of Deputies to the left-hand column which relates to the income tax take.  It is important to remember we are talking about the PD argument that top earners get a raw deal under the tax system and that the preoccupation should be with reducing the marginal rate. The middle column gives the social insurance take or PRSI and the right-hand column shows the total deductions from wages of that person in that family circumstance on a £50,000 salary for each of the 15 countries of the European Union. Ireland is shown as sixth from the bottom of that league.  It shows that the following countries have less take-home pay and more tax deducted from <Col N="13" /> that income: Portugal, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Austria, France, Finland, Sweden and Denmark.  People in those countries contribute more in terms of total tax take than Ireland. Fianna Fáil agrees with me on this point but it is important to put it on the record because on budget day Deputy McDowell devoted the lion's share of his speech, and Deputy O'Malley on television with me, to complaining <i>ad nauseam</i> that the Minister for Finance had not altered the marginal rate of 48 per cent and that high income earners were being done down as a result.  The table proves conclusively that that is not the case.</P>
    <P>First, the income tax take for the household is above the EU average but also considerably below the income tax take for similar households in the most heavily taxed member states, Sweden and Denmark.  Second, the total direct tax take, including PRSI, is slightly below the EU average &mdash; that is because employee PRSI in Ireland is among the lowest in the Community.  It is lower than in the UK and considerably below the take in countries as varied as France, Germany, Portugal, Greece and Belgium, yet Deputy Harney wants to abolish it.</P>
    <P>As the KPMG analysis points out, concentration on the top tax rate would have cost the Exchequer less than the policy actually adopted by this Government.  In the language of the commentators it would have been less of a give-away. This is because, compared to the actual approach adopted by the Government, the benefit would have extended only to a minority of high earners.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the approach adopted by the Government inevitably benefits those on the top rate, and it goes a considerable distance down the road to creating an employment friendly economy and eliminating employment and poverty traps.  KPMG's assessment concluded that:</P>
    <P>Despite common perception, higher income earners do not fare that badly in the income tax stakes relative to their counterparts in other EU countries.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Progressive Democrats would question the KPMG study.  Playing to perceptions, stoking up prejudice and breeding inequality is the object of this PD prescription. Slashing 8 per cent off the top rate of income tax would cost £400 million in a full year &mdash; all going to the better off and not a penny going to the lower paid and no contribution to reducing employment and poverty traps.  Let us recall, the vision is one of Ireland as Hong Kong.  Poverty is good for you.  Now we are forced to press on.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy O'Dea made his ungracious intervention I was about to point out that another policy difference between him and his prospective partners in Government relates to privatisation.  The Progressive Democrats Party has made it clear that it proposes to sell off the ACC, ICC, the TSB and Aer Rianta.  Apart from one inglorious best forgotten interview by Deputy Ahern on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, Fianna Fáil says it will not go down that road.  Who are we to believe?  Deputy Harney made it clear in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 17 January that if the Progressive Democrats Party is in Government and Britain stays out of the single currency we may do the same, while Deputy Bertie Ahern has most definitely committed Fianna Fáil to entering the system.  So much for cohesion.  Again, who are we to believe?</P>
      <P>As Fianna Fáil cavils and the Progressive Democrats Party engages in begrudgery over the budget, do they really believe that Members have forgotten the performance of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government between 1989 and 1992?  I wish to summarise some of the relevant facts of the lifetime of that Government: 56,000 people were added to the live register and total employment showed virtually no growth; mortgage rates reached their highest level ever at almost 15 per cent, adding up to £80 a month to household costs; the average tax paid by a PAYE worker increased by 17 per cent; local authority dwelling construction reached its lowest level for decades; new housing grants also fell to their lowest level in decades; Deputy McCreevy introduced his infamous dirty dozen welfare cuts; child benefit was increased over three budgets by just 75p for the first two children and by £1.15 for the third child and subsequent children &mdash; this Government has increased the figures over three budgets by £10 and £14, respectively; VAT was increased on electricity bills from 5 per cent to 10 per cent and was introduced on telephone bills for the first time; VAT on a wide range of goods, including clothing and footwear, was hiked from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent and personal tax allowances were increased over three budgets by £50 for a single person and by £100 for a married couple &mdash; this Government has increased the personal allowance over three budgets by £550.</P>
      <P>The one definitive point which can be made about Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government is that they were dedicated to Deputy Harney's vision of a nation and an economy based on low wages and poverty and to a notion of citizenship based on seeking dignity, self-esteem and independence in unemployment, poverty and featherweight wage packets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to confront the central Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats criticism of the Government's public expenditure performance by comparing it with their performance in Government between 1989 and 1992.

    <P>The figures show the position when the Progressive Democrats entered Government with Fianna Fáil and the position during the lifetime of this Government.  Contrary to the impression given by Deputies McCreevy and McDowell, the public spending performance of their parties in power contrasts sharply with that of this Government. In 1990, the first year of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, the increase in real terms was 3.3 per cent.  In 1991 the figure was 6.4 per cent; in 1992, 6.7 per cent; in 1993, 6.1 per cent; in 1994, 4.9 per cent; in 1995, 3 per cent; in 1996, 4.4 per cent and in 1997, 4.7 per cent. That was the actual performance, and it was the only substantive argument commentators on the other side of the House had about the budget.</P>

We are approaching all these issues in an integrated, coherent and planned fashion.</P>
    <P>The Government is rewarding work and has increased tax free allowances, reduced the standard rate and widened the standard rate band. PRSI continues to be reformed and tax-PRSI integration proceeds with the social insurance fund being protected and the social welfare system being made even more employment friendly. The two systems now interact more effectively to provide a helping hand for those who cannot work and a springboard for those who need help entering the paid workforce and a real incentive to work.  On the corporate side of the equation, two thirds of all jobs are at the low rate of employers' PRSI and thresholds have been raised.</P>
    <P>Enterprise is also being promoted.  The standard rate of corporation tax has been cut and the new low rate introduced for small firms has been further reduced.  The BES will be expanded this year by allowing relief to companies going for a DCM listing, aimed at increasing the attractiveness of the stock exchange to Irish companies and expanding investment opportunities for Irish institutions &mdash; something to which Deputies Harney and Ahern, if vaguely and incoherently, profess to aspire.  Virtually every day foreign investors vote manifest confidence in Ireland and indigenous firms bring new developments and jobs on stream.  Confidence is at an all-time high.</P>
    <P>We are witnessing expansion in employment unparalleled in the history of the State.  In the past two years more than 100,000 new jobs have been created in industry and services.  With the policies the Government is pursuing, we are set for another excellent year on the employment front.  In a pre-budget statement in <i>The Irish Times</i>, Deputy Harney, referred to New Zealand and the creation there of 180,000 jobs in a very short period, but she turns her face from what is happening here.  By the end of this year, in the life of this Government, in the region of 150,000 jobs will have been created by enterprise in Ireland</P>
    <P>This Government is also conscious of the legacy of neglect it inherited in the huge problem of long-term unemployment.  The glib approach of other Administrations, most notably the Fianna Fáil-PD Government, was that it is intractable.  It is not intractable and the communities plagued with long-term unemployment and visited by other associated plagues, cannot be left to rot. They will not be left to rot by this Government.</P>
    <P>Social solidarity is being strengthened.  In the last two budgets the Government has significantly enhanced the social protection system, made access to the system and its benefits more equitable and easier, enormously increased child supports, and made large strides in making the social protection system employment friendly.  The last two budgets have also enhanced a number of affirmative action measures targeted directly at <Col N="17" /> the long-term unemployed and introduced a range of new measures.  The back to work allowance scheme has been improved &mdash; the number of places increased by 5,000 this year.  The jobstart scheme and job initiative have been introduced, the workplace scheme has been developed and community employment is being more effectively targeted at the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Getting a job and finding it rational to take a job is the key to everything.  Both requirements are necessary.  Other things being equal, once in gainful employment a person's life chances will improve dramatically.  Even if people who have been long-term unemployed lose their new-found jobs the chances of getting other jobs are significantly higher. The integrated package of measures relating to tax, social welfare reform and affirmative action introduced by this Government, this co-ordination of social protection, low income support and affirmative action programmes, combined with tax and PRSI reform that concentrates on low earners, basic tax free allowances, the standard rate and the standard rate band, is the comprehensive formula for creating an employment friendly economy and pursuing the goal of long-term, sustainable full employment in a competitive national economy within the framework of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The nod-and-wink culture of Fianna Fáil autocratic populism is well past its sell-by date and good riddance to it.  The right wing rhetoric of the Progressive Democrats has never had appeal in Ireland.  The idea that one can be resuscitated and the other propagated and that the twain can then entwine in harmony is a myth plain to see in the pages of history.</P>
    <P>In Government Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats could not bear the sight of each other.  Leaving aside party incompatibilities, the chemistry between the two parties was poisonous. The reality during the Fianna Fáil-PD Government was a history of humiliating public putdowns, one-upmanship, noises off stage, heads on a platter and ultimately chaos and disintegration. What has changed?  Nothing, except that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats desperately want to get into Government.  The policy differences and the personalities have not gone away. The putative Taoiseach to Mary's Tánaiste has told us that he is reserving a special role <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland for Deputy Reynolds.  I think I hear a snort from down Limerick way.  Policy on Northern Ireland is already irreconcilable between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Both parties pursue contrary policies on economic and monetary union.  The two parties advocate opposite positions on privatisation. Fianna Fáil does not share the Progressive Democrats obsession with the top rate of tax.</P>
    <P>This is by no means an exhaustive list, but those are the major questions facing Irish public life.  A prospective Government whose participants hold opposite views on those major issues would do serious damage to the social and economic <Col N="18" /> progress under way.  Do the Irish people want to go back to a Government riven by dissension and preoccupied with settling old scores?  I believe not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister of State's speech, even though very little of it related to the budget, which we are supposed to be debating.  I reject his two principal defences of the budget, the first of which relates to the income tax and social insurance take based on the KPMG report.  He made a virtue of the fact that we are only sixth on the league table of EU countries in terms of the percentage of gross income taken in social insurance and tax.  That is a misleading and disingenuous comparison.  Our economic performance must be compared with that of other countries.  In recent years we have had high powered growth rates which easily out-performed our EU competitors.  Most, if not all, the countries to which the Minister of State referred have experienced minimal growth rates, many of them have just come out of recession.  It is misleading to make a virtue of the fact that we are only taking tax and social insurance from gross income.  It highlights the bankruptcy of the Minister of State's arguments in defence of the budget.</P>
      <P>I also reject his comparative public expenditure table.  It must be noted that the last Fianna Fáil-PD Government came to office after a period of substantial fiscal retrenchment forced on its predecessors by the excesses of the Garret FitzGerald-led Government between 1983 and 1987.  It is in that context we must examine the public expenditure record of the last Fianna Fáil-PD Administration.  On the other hand, this Government came to office against the background of unparalleled economic growth, which has continued unabated during the lifetime of this Administration.  We should compare like with like when seeking to defend the budget.</P>
      <P>A budget cannot be considered in isolation.  It must be considered in conjunction with the public expenditure figures set out in the public expenditure estimates.  It must also be considered in the context of the state of a country's economy. When this budget is examined in the context of the current state of the economy and in conjunction with the public expenditure estimates, it has the capacity to be the greatest catastrophe ever inflicted on this economy.  Economic growth rates are such that Ireland's gross domestic product will be 34 per cent higher in 1997 than in 1994 and it continues to expand rapidly.  The Minister for Finance projected that growth this year will be 6.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a major reversal of all accepted economic theory and proved economic practice, this unprecedented boom has been accompained by unprecedented expansionary fiscal policy.  Expansionary <Col N="19" /> fiscal policy is generally promoted in a weak economy about to slip into recession.  No properly qualified Minister or set of economists would propose massive fiscal expansion accompanied by rapid economic growth.</P>
    <P>For the past two years we have had unprecedented fiscal stimulation in conjunction with record economic expansion.  If fiscal stimulation took the form of tax cuts, accompanied by appropriate matching controls of public expenditure, they would be justified because the fruits of economic growth would go back into the economy to sustain the inevitable financial winter.  However, fiscal stimulation has taken the form of ever increasing and reckless public expenditure, at a level which leaves little room for tax cuts and twice that promised by the rainbow Government. Ireland's hard pressed taxpayers must wait at the end of the queue while the Government continues to recklessly squander the fruits of economic growth.</P>
    <P>I am not an advocate of the minimalist state; I have no vested interest in seeing, nor is it part of my philosophy to wish to see, Ireland return to the era of the Dickensian workhouse.  That is not the issue, although listening to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, one would think it is.  We must look at the total level of public expenditure in the light of economic performance.  Ireland's economic performance is such that the rate of public expenditure is unjustified and public expenditure is rising to a level where the State has too great an involvement in the economy.  I am interested in the sick, the poor, the old and the handicapped.  We cannot regard them as a cost to be dispensed with when economic theory so demands.  Nobody wishes to return to that era.</P>
    <P>However, public expenditure is recognised by all independent economic commentators as being too high as a proportion of GDP in current economic circumstances.  The Government has allowed the public expenditure juggernaut to continue unchecked.  If it had its solemn promise to maintain public expenditure increases below the levels of economic growth, the State's role in the economy would have been diminished accordingly. This would have created the opportunity for meaningful tax reductions.  Unfortunately, the Government did not keep to its promise.  The fruits of economic growth have been confiscated by the State.  The funds available to reform the tax code and to reduce the tax burden have been sequestered to pay for an ever-increasing and ever more reckless growth in public expenditure. The juggernaut continues unchecked.</P>
    <P>It is salutary to reflect on the impact our tigerish economic performance and Asian type growth rates have had on unemployment, the country's most endemic problem and the greatest single cause of poverty in society.  Since 1990 the economy has grown by 41 per cent yet, over the same period, the fall in the unemployment rate as measured by the most reliable yardstick, the Labour Force Survey, has been marginal &mdash; from 13.4 <Col N="20" /> per cent to 12.9 per cent.  Why is it that Asian type growth rates, fuelled by an intoxicating but transient cocktail of free money from Brussels, has had virtually no impact on unemployment? The growth in employment has come from new entrants to the labour market, mainly women, school leavers and returned emigrants.  This depressing picture is reinforced by the most recent Labour Force Survey which shows no fall in the numbers of long-term unemployed in the 1996 survey despite an extra 46,000 taking up employment during the same period.</P>
    <P>This merely confirms what we should know &mdash; our tax system still offers no real incentive to those seeking unskilled or low-paid employment because their after tax income is usually less than their not benefit from welfare and other income supports.  A favourable tax regime is the <i>sine qua non</i> of reducing unemployment, which, as I have said, is the primary cause of poverty in society.  If the Government had kept its promise, solemnly given despite what the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte says, and had adhered to an annual real increase in public expenditure of 2 per cent, the current spending figures would be £500 million less.  That would have presented an opportunity for real tax reform which would make a significant impact on unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to the tax provisions in the budget as a tax giveaway.  As the Minister's figures demonstrate, it is a tax &ldquo;take-away&rdquo; because the total take in taxation will increase by £364 million of £1 million per day over the coming financial year.  It is misleading to describe it as a giveaway.</P>
    <P>In general, Government spending has been rising at four times the rate of inflation.  Even a modest improvement in this abysmal performance would allow huge capacity for tax reduction or reduction in the national debt.  There are inflationary dangers in applying a large fiscal boost to the economy at this stage of the economic cycle.  The former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Lawson, pursued a similar strategy in similar circumstances in 1987-88.  The result was an unmitigated catastrophe from which it has taken the British economy almost a decade to recover.  The British experience should have alerted the Government to the dangers of injecting even more spending into an already overheated economy.</P>
    <P>In its latest bulletin, the Central Bank estimates that our economy is operating at full potential capacity at a growth rate of between 4 and 5 per cent.  On this basis and measured against that yardstick, the economy has been operating above capacity for the past three years.  Therefore, the inflation rate is balanced on a knife edge.  This is borne out by recent figures indicating rapid credit growth, increasing house prices and buoyant car and consumer goods sales.</P>
    <P>This budget could provide the match which will ignite inflation.  The Minister will be aware that rising inflation will not only disqualify us from entry to economic and monetary union, to which <Col N="21" /> the Government appears totally committed, but will also result in a loss of international competitiveness and rising interest rates, which will cause employment and output to contract.  The tax reliefs should have been greater and should also have been matched by appropriate spending cuts so that the overall impact on the economy would have been as close to neutral as possible.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the strong arguments on both sides of the EMU issue.  The country needs to have a proper debate on the matter.  If Sweden, Germany and Britain can debate the issue, why not us?  The same groups &mdash; the trade union leaders, the employers' leaders, the farmers and certain members of the Catholic hierarchy &mdash; which tried to persuade us that devaluation would be a catastrophe for the economy in 1993 when sterling left the ERM are now trying to sleepwalk this country into EMU regardless of what the British do.</P>
    <P>In 1993 due to Britain leaving the ERM and the appreciation of the punt against sterling tens of thousands of Irish workers were exposed to the danger of unemployment, particularly in labour-intensive industries for which the UK was our major market.  That, combined with the international markets, forced devaluation despite the flawed consensus to the contrary.  It was that act of devaluation in 1993 which provided the base for the record economic growth we have enjoyed since then.  That devaluation was forced on us by the markets against the advice of the Department of Finance.  That same flawed consensus is trying to sleepwalk the country into economic and monetary union.  It is as if we may not dare question the desirability of Ireland joining economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>We should debate the issues in a rational way because the changes which will be wrought on the economy and the country's social fabric by membership of economic and monetary union, which we cannot leave, deserve such debate.  People working in labour/intensive industries, which are exposed to variations in the strength of the Irish currency against that of sterling, will be at the sharp end of economic and monetary union and such a debate is the least they deserve.</P>
    <P>I wanted to refer to a number of specific issues in the budget but I sought permission to share time.  Deputy Dempsey will use the remaining time for his contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Dea for sharing time.  It is important to contribute to the budget debate because, despite statements that it is pure theatre and a thing of the past, it performs the useful function of illustrating the general philosophy and policies pursued by a Government. The 1997 budget is no exception in that regard and it makes a number of clear statements about the parties of this so called centre-left Government. It confirms to everyone that Fine Gael is in Government but not in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since last September we have witnessed the spectacle of Fine Gael backbenchers forming <Col N="22" /> committees and drafting tax and budgetary policies with great flourish.  There were many leaks to newspapers and press conferences were held at which a number of proposals were put forward about lowering the higher and standard rates of tax.  This was intended to be a bottom line.  The special committee called for various improvements in respect of PAYE sector employees paying the 48 and 27 per cent rates of tax.  However, not one of the so-called bottom line proposals has been realised in the budget.  This display of contempt for Fine Gael backbench and grass root opinion could be ignored if there were some sign of an imprint on the budget of Fine Gael policy in areas such as macro-economic matters. However, it is clear that Fine Gael has had little or no impact on the budget or the Government.</P>
    <P>The party that made fiscal rectitude the cornerstone of its economic policy in the early 1980s has clearly abandoned that policy.  In view of subsequent events, one is obliged to question whether it was a policy or mere rhetoric.  It is clear that the so-called partnership to which Fine Gael Members refer has replaced all principle in that party.  To Fine Gael, partnership means having no principles and no impact on Government policy.  The current leadership of Fine Gael has decided that power, at all cost, is what counts. That party has no bottom line and no principles. If one were seeking a phrase to describe Fine Gael, one might call it the flexible friend within the troika of parties in Government.  It is the largest party with the smallest say.  In many cases, particularly in respect of the budget, it has no say at all.</P>
    <P>The present Administration is supposed to be a left-dominated Government.  Fine Gael allowed that to happen but what of the other parties in the so called left-dominated Government?  I was led to believe that the philosophy espoused by left-wing parties such as Labour and Democratic Left meant that the poor, the weak and the marginalised would receive priority in the policies pursued by those parties.  The policies of the so-called left-wing parties should be geared towards the needs of people in that section of the community, improving in real terms their standard of living and including them as a priority in distributing the fruits of economic growth.  I have no difficulty with that type of philosophy and I support it.</P>
    <P>Since I entered this House I have listened to the rhetoric of the left and its so-called concern for the weak and the marginalised.  For the first time in the history of the State we have a left-dominated Government and one would expect to see real and tangible signs of its influence over three budgets.  I am obliged to ask if that is the case.  &ldquo;Like hell it is&rdquo;, is the answer to that question.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance summarised his and his party's commitment to the idea of caring for the poor in society.  He referred to couples with earnings in excess of £30,000 and boasted that, not taking account of <Col N="23" /> the abolition of university fees, they would be £2,350 &mdash; approximately £102 per week &mdash; better off following the budget.  The Minister had the sheer brass neck to boast that pensioners had benefited to the tune of £7 per week during that time.  He stated:</P>
    <P>...take the case of a two-parent family with two children both over 18 and in full-time third level education, again with one spouse earning, say, twice the average industrial wage.  Their annual disposable income will have risen by about £2,350 as a result of pay increases and the tax and PRSI changes in my three budgets, even after taking account of the standard rating of certain discretionary reliefs....</P>
    <P>He proceeded to refer to an increase of £7 per week for pensioners over three budgets.  Had the Minister boasted about such an increase in respect of the current budget, I would clap him on the back and concede that it was a reasonable development.  However, he actually boasted about a £7 increase over three budgets and the so-called left wing, socialist Deputies loudly voiced their support.  Can one imagine the howls of protest that would have emanated from Democratic Left or the Labour Party if a Fianna Fáil Minister had made those comments during his Budget Statement?  Can one also imagine the performance of Deputies Rabbitte, De Rossa, Michael D. Higgins and their colleagues if a Fianna Fáil Minister stated that he had achieved a £7 increase for pensioners over three years?  A Fianna Fáil Minister would be vilified and reviled by those so-called socialists if he had the temerity to boast about an increase of £7 over three budgets.</P>
    <P>On the British political scene, much has been made of &ldquo;new&rdquo; Labour during the past two to three years.  However, little has been stated in connection with new Labour in Ireland.  New Labour in Ireland remains committed to the needy.  However, its definition of the term &ldquo;needy&rdquo; has changed.  The needy are now defined by the Labour Party as any Labour Deputy in danger of losing his or her seat.  During the past danger of losing his or her seat.  During the past six weeks these people have engaged in rhetoric &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte did so earlier &mdash; about the dangers of an alliance between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  Spokespersons for Democratic Left and the Labour Party have attempted to terrorise people by creating bogeymen and stirring up completely unfounded fears.  They have attempted to portray themselves as the friends of the poor and the socially excluded, despite the evidence.</P>
    <P>The activities in which these people engaged in an effort to stave off the inevitable result of a general election clearly illustrate the reason they have been so long in the doldrums.  They insult the intelligence of the people they represent by claiming to have their welfare at heart when that is not the case.  They have abandoned the poor and weak in society in favour not of the middle <Col N="24" /> classes or lower middle classes but the upper middle classes.  They insult the intelligence of those people by thinking they can buy their votes with a variety of recent Damascus-like conversions. The Labour Party has indulged in an orgy of spending since its guru returned to tell it how to win the next election and fool the electorate, as it did in 1992.</P>
    <P>There is nothing sacred in the quest for electoral support.  The RPT, the tax which formed part of Labour's commitment to tax wealth and spread the fruits of economic benefits, was abolished to try to save seats.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, stabbed the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, in the back during the negotiations of Partnership 2000, again to save seats, and the INTO was bought off with a last-minute agreement, throwing to one side a long-standing conciliation for teachers.  Ministers are running around their constituencies like Santa Claus with cheques or promises of cheques.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, is teeing up lottery fund grant applications for payment in March and April.  The Taoiseach and, more importantly, the Tánaiste are visiting their constituencies, which they have not done for some time.</P>
    <P>All of this is going on against a background of growing poverty as this left dominated Government ensures the poor get poorer.  Instead of narrowing the poverty gap, it is widening it.  The resources available, which are considerable, have gone to the haves rather than the have nots.  The gap between an unemployed couple and a couple on a salary of £20,000 per year has been widened by £530 per annum.  For a couple earning £40,000 per annum the gap is £1,072.  In the lifetime of the Government the figures are £1,405 and £2,737 respectively.  There are more people on the poverty line today than there were five or ten years ago.  It is an indictment of left-wing policies that the poverty gap is widening, divisions in society are deepening and there is no decrease in the number of long-term unemployed, with hardly a mention of young unemployed people.</P>
    <P>Two aspects relating to the environment were mentioned in the budget, the arrangements put in place to finance local government and environmental protection policies.  The package put forward on local government, particularly the financial aspects, were welcomed before Christmas, but the dangers are becoming obvious.  As a result of the changes made, there are extra demands on local government financing.  The 80 per cent motor tax retention by local authorities may, at the stroke of the Minister's pen, be reduced to 70 or 60 per cent.  The Minister is retaining power to levy charges for a specified period for specific purposes, but they are local service charges by another name.  The Minister's latest proposal on group water schemes is discriminatory and will cause havoc in rural Ireland.  Everybody should be treated on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>This budget shows we are in the countdown to an election, and the sooner that election is held <Col N="25" /> the better.  Considering the reckless approach adopted by the Government, if it is in office for another six to nine months we will have a huge problem post-1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this year's budget debate. The main themes of the budget have been clearly outlined by my colleague, the Minister for Finance. Its aims are clear and ambitious.  The Government intends to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.  The 1997 budget is a significant contributor to those aims and, taken together with the Partnership 2000 approach, we are positioning Ireland for prosperity into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of commentary at home and abroad on the nature of our economic performance in recent years.  The reality behind the statistics is evident throughout the country. The engine of economic growth is generating jobs for our people at a rate never equalled.  The imaginative application of European Union Structural Funds across the economy is transforming our infrastructure and further consolidating our economic success.</P>
      <P>We all have a responsibility to make a substantial contribution towards sustaining our economic development and in properly and prudently applying the resources generated by it.  Both Departments for which I am responsible, while fundamentally different, play an important role in this process.  The Department of the Marine encompasses significant developmental roles across the areas for which it is responsible.  In addition, it has important functions relating to the protection of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment.  As an island trading nation, the shipping sector offers a substantial opportunity for the generation of income and jobs.  The sector is highly competitive internationally and the Government's objective is to implement measures which underpin the competitiveness of the Irish shipping sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context I very much welcome the Government's decision, as announced in the Minister's budget speech, to provide special PRSI concessions for employers of Irish seafarers.  This further underlines my commitment to maintaining and developing the Irish shipping industry. It follows hard on the heels of a number of important provisions in the Finance Act, 1996, allowing Irish shipowners to avail of leasing concessions. In addition, a special subsidy scheme for Irish seafaring trainees was introduced by me last April.  I am convinced these various measures will secure increased employment in the shipping sector here and ensure a vibrant Irish shipping sector for the foreseeable future.  Much will depend, <Col N="26" /> however, on the response by shipping interests to these actions of the Government.  I look forward to positive developments from them before long.</P>
    <P>This package of incentives reflects the thinking of both the EU Commission and the Maritime Transport Council.  In the Commission's paper, Towards a New Maritime Strategy, there was agreement generally on the need to take positive measures to enhance training and reduce employment costs in EU fleets.  These views were further developed at the major two-day conference on EU seafarer training and employment held in Dublin towards the end of Ireland's Presidency of the EU.  I look forward to the final details of the new PRSI arrangements which will be announced in the Social Welfare Bill, 1997, to be published shortly.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech my colleague, the Minister for Finance, indicated that the impact of the current income tax regime on seafarers will continue to be assessed.  I hope positive developments may be possible in that regard before publication of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said, the positive impact of EU Structural Funds has been very significant in Ireland.  The marine sector is a very good example of this.  Irish ports and harbours are being rapidly developed to facilitate the lifeblood of the economy, our trade.  In 1996 we saw £30 million invested in our commercial ports. In tandem, business volume increased in all modes of traffic.  In 1987 we look forward to seeing the continuation of this rapid progress.  Allied with infrastructural development, the way in which our ports are run will be fundamentally changed in March this year with the establishment of new semi-State companies to run our major commercial harbours.  This move is intended to increase cost competitiveness in Irish ports by making them more market-led and free from centralised control.  My aim is to offer the highest standard of port facilities at the lowest possible cost to the benefit of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Historically the fishing industry has made a very real and significant contribution to Ireland's coastal communities.  In many such communities fishing provides an employment opportunity for young people who otherwise would have to look to our cities or further afield for work.</P>
    <P>Fishing has a future and I am committed to its continued development.  Demand for fish and fish products is growing and this underlines the opportunities and challenges facing the Irish catching, aquaculture and processing sectors.  I intend to ensure policy and strategies for those sectors are closely geared towards meeting those opportunities and challenges.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant upward growth curve in Irish fish landings and exports in volume and value terms in recent years.  Landings of whitefish, in particular, have risen by 30 per cent in volume and 23 per cent in value in the past two years.  Current indications are that the final 1996 whitefish landings and export figures will show further increases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> Exports of fish from Ireland are also increasing. In the two year period from 1993-95, exports rose by 30 per cent in volume and 20 per cent in value. This represents a very significant contribution to economic activity at national level.</P>
    <P>The processing sector is a vital part of the future development of the fishing industry.  The concept of added value is vital to the continuing development of the industry.  I am pleased that the Irish processing sector has shown the scope for significant development to date.  I look forward to continued progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Ireland's £140 million Operational Programme for Fisheries is continuing and has now reached its mid-point.  The programme provides for investment in the fishing fleet, marine and land based aquaculture, port infrastructure and facilities, processing and marketing, promotion of fishery-aquaculture products, human resources and marine research.  This investment is being carefully targeted to maintain and strengthen the contribution of the fisheries sector to the national economy, in particular, its contribution to the generation of growth and employment in the coastal communities.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency proved to be a hard-working one which ensured that EUs fisheries business ran smoothly and effectively.  We should pay tribute to the dedication and hard work of civil servants in all Departments, but I would like to pay particular tribute to the work of civil servants in the Department of the Marine who, for a period of six months, spent most of their time out of the country chairing meetings and looking after our interests at a loss in human terms to themselves and their families.  It is only right and proper that we should compliment them on their dedication and work.</P>

      <P>We were successful in concluding the important and difficult annual business of reaching agreement on total allowable catches and quotas, and negotiations between the EU and third countries, including Norway.</P>
      <P>Our six months' stewardship of the Union's common fisheries policy also enabled us to make significant progress on our priorities.  The Irish Presidency's key fisheries priorities were to improve fisheries control, enforcement and conservation and we made substantial advances in all these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> The Irish Presidency brokered agreement on the introduction of a satellite based monitoring system for Community fishing vessels.  This will be an extremely useful tool in the battle against illegal fishing.  We also secured agreement on new measures designed to improve co-operation and co-ordination by national administrations in fisheries control.</P>
    <P>Following the EU Commission's call for a reduction in the size of fishing fleets of up to 40 per cent, the Irish Presidency presented a compromise solution.  This will be the basis for a more equitable and conscientious response to the problem of over-fishing.  This was a very significant achievement by Ireland.</P>
    <P>Within the sea fisheries sector, aquaculture is a key component and one of growing importance. The industry is on a firm growth path with targeted investment of some £36 million in EU Structural Funds in the five year period up to 1999.</P>
    <P>Annual production is currently valued at some £50 million with 3,000 people employed.  Aquaculture makes a valuable and significant contribution to coastal economies.  The development of other areas of fisheries, such as aquaculture, is the key to the future successful evolution of the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The future development of aquaculture is critically dependent on modernising and streamlining the licensing and regulation of this valuable natural resource sector.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1996, recently passed all Stages in the Seanad.  It is a tangible recognition by the Government of the need to adapt the licensing and regulation of fish farming in line with best practice and thinking in the planning and environmental areas.</P>
    <P>This is a major legislative landmark which represents the outcome of intensive analysis of the respective needs of the aquaculture industry and the other users of our marine and freshwater resources.  The objective is to ensure an effective, secure and fully transparent licensing process which has full regard for all interests.  I am convinced that this new framework will set the course for further sustainable growth in the aquaculture sector.  It will deliver economic activity, exports and much needed jobs in our coastal communities.</P>
    <P>There is vast potential for the development of our unique marine tourism resource.  To build on Ireland's success to date we have to constantly enhance the products we offer to visitors.  Tourism angling has the potential for further development. To this end, £19 million has been assigned under the Tourism Angling Programme 1994-99 for the development of this sector.  This provides an opportunity for the significant development of tourism angling in coastal and inland locations all over Ireland.  It is being developed in co-operation with Northern Ireland under the INTERREG programme.  This co-operation serves as an example of effective North-South co-operation in addition to its purely economic <Col N="29" /> potential.  This is a quality product with a capacity to generate significant added value.</P>
    <P>Research is the key to progress and success in any area.  Development in the interest of jobs and of the future of our marine resources is critically dependent upon understanding those resources and the opportunities that they can generate.  In this context, the Marine Institute is now coming into its own.  Together with my Department it is working on theses as diverse as development of seafood resources, development of marine tourism and leisure, development of marine industries and transport together with the protection of the marine environment.  A new £1.6 million research vessel will come into operation this year.  The resources now being committed to marine research will pay dividends in years to come.  This continued success and viability of our marine resources is dependent on planning effectively for the future.</P>
    <P>This budget has provided an excellent basis for further progress in all areas of the marine sector. It is now the responsibility of those involved to seize the opportunities being offered to them.</P>
    <P>I am not only concerned with the opportunities afforded to the marine sector.  As Minister for Defence, I also welcome the impact of the Government's budgetary planning for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Economic management is generally dependent on sound sectoral policies.  The Government has put in place a planned strategic and multi-annual approach to achieve better management and organisation of the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, approved by the Government in March last year, is well under way.</P>
    <P>The rising age profile of military personnel has been of concern for some time.  In his 1996 Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance announced the provision of £13 million in 1996 for a voluntary early retirement scheme for members of the Defence Forces.  The intention of the scheme is to provide for the retirement of up to 2,300 Permanent Defence Force personnel between 1996 and 1988, while at the same time recruiting new, young members.  The scheme so far has been a success with 501 personnel taking advantage of the generous terms on offer.  A further 750 personnel are expected to avail of the scheme in 1997.  A sum of £30 million has been allocated in the 1977 Defence Vote for this purpose. I have announced the recruitment of 400 new members.  This will go some considerable way towards addressing the age profile problem.</P>
    <P>That is but one aspect of the radical reorganisation of the Defence Forces which I am carrying out.  The implementation plan approved by the Government in March 1996 contains detailed proposals covering the reorganisation of the Defence Forces into a new three brigade based structure together with the Air Corps and Naval Service components.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government is committed to continuing a programme of major investment in <Col N="30" /> equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.  In the three years 1995-7, no less than £29 million has been provided for infrastructural investment in military barracks.  Furthermore, an £8 million programme for the replacement of the Army's primary tactical communications system commenced in 1996 and is due to be completed this year.  The placing of this contract represents a major step in the upgrading and re-equipping of the Defence Forces with the latest in modern radio communications equipment.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Naval Service has a crucial role to play in the protection of Ireland's coastline.  Modern equipment is essential if it is to carry out this task effectively.  I have allocated over £6 million in this year's Vote towards the purchase of an additional naval vessel.  Requests for proposals were sought at the end of last year to provide us with an overview of the market and match what is available to our needs.  I am committed to advancing this process as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future of the Defence Forces, there will be a rationalised force with younger personnel and better equipment.  Crucially, the military authorities are fully engaged in and committed to this process, having been involved in its development from the beginning.  I am convinced that the investment we are making is essential to position us properly for the challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>Ireland is experiencing a period of unprecedented and sustained economic growth.  One thousand new jobs are being created each week, the highest number of people are at work in the history of the State and interest rates are at historically low levels.  This is a prudent budget reflecting the Government's commitment to fiscal responsibility and long-term economic planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my ministerial colleague, Deputy Barrett, for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>This country and its people need a modern and effective public administration.  Given the importance of public service efficiency in the overall competitiveness of our economy, it is imperative that the public service does not lag behind the private sector in either its standard of management or the quality of its service delivery.  As the Minister for Finance noted in his Budget Statement, the programme <i>Delivering Better Government</i>&ldquo;sets out a complete range of changes which are designed to improve the performance of the public service, increase value for money and deliver a better service to the citizen as customer&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme <i>Delivering Better Government</i> is at the heart of the strategic management initiative, or the SMI as it is more commonly known. The SMI is simply a way of focusing attention on the fundamental issues that managers in the civil and public service need to be concerned with on an ongoing basis if they are to provide a better overall standard of performance.  For example, <Col N="31" /> what business are we in?  Who are our customers? What services should we be delivering?  Why are we doing what we are doing?  Could we do it differently and better?  They need to focus specifically on these questions.</P>
    <P>The importance of an efficient and effective public service is amply illustrated by the fact that it employs 192,380 people giving rise to a pay and pensions bill of £4.792 billion in 1996.  Moreover, Government costs, current and capital, account for some 38 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>A central element in the programme of change is the introduction of a wide-ranging set of financial management initiatives, the fundamental aim of which is to strengthen the whole area of public expenditure management and to underline the primary responsibility of spending Departments for managing their expenditure programmes within settled allocations and to be fully accountable for the results achieved.  The rolling programme of expenditure reviews set out in <i>Delivering Better Government</i> will form a significant element in this enhanced framework of accountability.  Beginning this year, such reviews will hold up to scrutiny every three years the objectives and cost effectiveness of each major departmental spending programme.</P>
    <P>Constraining the growth of public expenditure is central to achieving the Government's medium-term budgetary goals.  The financial management initiatives include not just periodic reviews of expenditure programmes but the introduction of multi-annual budgetary projections which appeared for the first time in this year's budget.  By enabling a longer view to be taken of emerging expenditure trends and their impact, multi-annual projections facilitate a fuller understanding of the effects of policy changes on spending and taxation.</P>
    <P>The programme of change for the public service sets out a framework in which selective changes can be brought about, focusing in particular on two areas which the Government believes are of central importance, namely, the management of performance and service delivery, the areas in which improvements will have the greatest effect on value for money and thus on the competitiveness of the economy.  The programme addresses a much wider range of issues such as accountability, devolution and delegation, freedom of information, financial management, regulatory reform, better use of information technology and improved co-ordination between Departments but its ultimate success hinges essentially on these two pervasive factors, performance management and quality service delivery, and the extent to which they are bolstered by the other components of the change programme.</P>
    <P>The ultimate aim is essentially one of cultural change to create a performance management culture. To do this, we need to attach greater importance to performance <i>per se</i> in the public sector &mdash; how it is measured, how it can be enhanced and where responsibility lies for ensuring <Col N="32" /> high standards are being maintained.  This means giving a higher priority to the evaluation of programmes of expenditure and the measurement of their effectiveness in such a way that meaningful action can be taken to correct deficiencies.</P>
    <P>Introducing a reliable system of performance management will not be easy.  The input and procedure-driven approach that has characterised the public service must give way to a focus on outputs.  This, in turn, will lead to a much stronger focus on service quality and delivery, a critical element in the change programme, and on ensuring more effective support for the productive sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>The programme <i>Delivering Better Government</i> was designed with an eye to improving performance measurement at all levels, that is, to establishing whether real progress was being made by public bodies and their individual employees in their move towards improved efficiency and effectiveness.  The private sector has fewer problems of this kind since, if one's competitors are realising higher profits or winning a larger share of the market, then one's own performance must, almost by definition, be deficient in some respect. With a collection of monopoly services, which is what the public service essentially is, there is limited scope for measuring performance by comparing one organisation with another.</P>
    <P>Since profit and significant financial inducements are not available to the public service as incentives to change, other factors must figure more prominently, such as job satisfaction, skills acquisition and career development, increasing the influence of staff within the organisation and enabling them to participate more fully in the decision making process.  These factors have been taken fully into account in formulating the programme outlined in <i>Delivering Better Government.</i></P>
    <P>One can easily forget how interdependent the public and private sectors are.  If the public sector becomes an undue burden on the taxpayer and the traded sector, it can significantly dampen the competitiveness of the economy.  On the other hand, if the private sector does not set high standards of management performance and establish what one might describe as national criteria of excellence, which all sectors of the economy must emulate, then the performance of the public service will correspondingly fall.</P>
    <P>The public sector cannot automatically expand with each passing year, but only in response to the legitimate demands made upon it by the taxpayer and the customer of public services.  These demands and forces are as valid as those operating in the marketplace and must be acknowledged.  The challenge is to strike the right balance between the needs of public service customers, and thus the level of public expenditure, and the competitiveness of the private sector and the needs of the economy as a whole.  This budget is designed around the correct balance and, through the multi-annual budgetary projections, the maintenance of that balance in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> Comparisons with the private sector may prompt one to ask how the public service management approach differs from that in the private sector.  In so far as all organisations deal with objectives, targets, skills, resources, outputs and a range of similar issues, the differences, such as they are, are not very significant.  However, a key consideration is the culture and general climate in which business is conducted.  In particular, the public service is called upon to provide a range of universally available services &mdash; education, health, social welfare, policing and security etc. &mdash; which the private sector could not supply.  If it did, it would have to be subsidised heavily by the taxpayer, lest there were cherrypicking in this area and the State was left to run the uneconomic aspects of the service.  Moreover, the provision of these services requires an approach that is equitable and open to public scrutiny.  The public service, therefore, operates under a number of influences which the private sector does not.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this the Government intends that the changes now being pursued will lead to a more outwardly directed approach with greater emphasis on strategic management where the needs of public service customers &mdash; the end towards which all activities are directed &mdash; are a paramount consideration when determining how each Department should perform and how its resources ought to be deployed.  The publication of Departmental statements of strategy will become one of the principal means by which Government Departments and public service bodies will signal the direction they are taking and how well they are addressing the needs of their customers.</P>
    <P>The approach is based on allied approaches to strategic management in the private sector, as well as that of the public sector in other administrations. The intention is that the end result will be an amalgam of those management practices in both the public and private sectors which are best suited to our public sector environment.</P>
    <P>There have been a few recent significant developments. Partnership 2000, which is expected to be ratified tomorrow by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, includes a specific commitment by the parties involved to the delivery of the modernisation programme in the public service.  In addition, payment of the local level negotiations provision of 2 per cent, provided for in the draft pay agreement, is predicated on the achievement of real verifiable progress in implementing <i>Delivering Better Government</i> and other sectoral strategies within the public service.</P>
    <P>On 15 January I had the pleasure of launching a code of practice for the delivery of public services to customers of commercial semi-State companies. Organisations subscribing to the code include the ESB, Telecom Éireann, An Post, Aer Lingus, CIE, VHI, Bord Gáis and Bord na Móna. I thank all of those semi-State companies who have come on board and enthusiastically supported <Col N="34" /> our code of practice.  Publication of this code marks a significant step towards effecting improvements in the overall standard of service to customers of the commercial State sector. Ways of strengthening the customer service ethos in the Civil Service and non-commercial public service are being pursued and I expect a code broadly similar to that in the commercial State sector to be introduced very soon.</P>
    <P>The various working groups set up last year to advance the programme of change set out in <i>Delivering Better Government</i> have made solid progress and we can expect to see the introduction of a number of initiatives to improve the public service later this year.  These will progressively and increasingly lead to better performance and better quality in service delivery.  This budget, by underpinning Partnership 2000, facilitates the process of ongoing change and improvement in the public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The gloss is already fading from the 1997 budget, which, far from being a radical one, was a minimalist measure.  The tax reduction was no more than the minimum Fine Gael could succeed in wringing from their left wing masters in this Government.</P>
      <P>This budget in particular offered us a great opportunity to do something radical in the area of social solidarity.  Previous Ministers for Finance were constrained by lack of resources or budgetary problems.  There were no such difficulties in this financial year.  There was no shortage of money to target significant gains at the most needy sections of society.  That could have been done as well as allowing for significant tax cuts.  Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost.</P>
      <P>A key objective of the budgetary process should be to look after those who are specifically excluded from the partnership process, which now makes most of the decisions on how the national cake is divided.  This partnership process, for all its merits, has helped create an insider-outsider society.  It is the duty of the Minister for Finance to ensure the needs of the outsider are looked after in budgetary terms.</P>
      <P>Two key groups who fall into this category are pensioners and those caring for the sick, handicapped and elderly.  Something generous could have been done for these people if we followed the course of action suggested by the Minister for Finance in a radio interview last Saturday.  This was closing the stable door after the horse had gone.  We should have targeted resources at the most needy social welfare recipients instead of giving small, across the board increases to everyone. What is the Progressive Democrats' approach to the unemployed?  The unemployed do not need more dole but more work.  The Progressive Democrats in its budget proposals showed that the course of action I described would have allowed us to provide an increase of £5 per week in the old age pension and an increase of £10 per week in the carer's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance was first introduced by <Col N="35" /> the last Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat coalition and is a measure of which we are justifiably proud.  It is not alone socially just, but also makes good economic sense.  Is it not far better that elderly people who are infirm would be cared for, where possible, in their homes by relatives, than be forced to go into institutions?  Our budget proposals also showed that the carer's allowance could be extended to a greater number of carers than the fraction of those who currently receive it.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to the plight of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and those who care for them.  There are an estimated 32,000 people here afflicted with this terrible condition, of which half are cared for at home by their relatives.  A terrible burden is placed on these carers.  It is hard enough to meet the demands of a loved one who is no longer able to look after himself.  It is even worse to know that the State is unwilling to recognise the social importance and value of the care provided for such a person.  A person caring for an Alzheimer's victim does not generally qualify for a carer's allowance because they do not satisfy the conditions laid down in a number of ways.  As far as I know, Alzheimer's disease is not yet recognised by the Department of Health as a long-term illness for the purpose of granting a carer's allowance. If we are anxious about social progress and justice this is surely an area that should have been addressed in the budget.</P>
    <P>A lot of help could have been given to many people at relatively little cost.  Some of the hardest hit people are parents of children with a mental and physical handicap, yet little provision was made in the budget to assist carers of such children. Little was done to make proper education and training provision for them.  This was a heartless budget for families of the mentally and physically handicapped.</P>
    <P>As regards tax reform, the budget figures speak for themselves.  The Progressive Democrats participated in drafting three budgets from 1989 to 1992 when we shared Government with Fianna Fáil.  These budgets, delivered in a much harsher economic climate than the one currently prevailing, cut the basic rate of tax by 5 per cent and the higher rate by 8 per cent.  Let no one deny that those tax cuts played a large part in the subsequent employment growth that occurred as a direct result.  The foundations for the kind of growth in employment this Government seeks to boast about were laid in the tax measures taken by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil when in power together for a short time.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has participated in drafting the last five budgets which were delivered at a time of unprecedented economic growth, development aid from Brussels and tax buoyancy. What have they done?  The three Government parties have managed to reduce the basic rate of tax by a single penny.  That is how much the Labour Party thinks of the workers.  It is not much to <Col N="36" /> show for Labour's five years of participation in Government.  Effectively, the Labour Party has ensured that radical tax reform has been kept off the Government's agenda.  No previous Minister for Finance had a better opportunity of bringing about a real reduction in tax rates.  Instead, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, opted for a minimalist approach, doing as little as possible.</P>
    <P>What does the average worker gain from this so-called giveaway budget?  Take the case of a single person on £150 a week, a not untypical wage for a young person in their first job.  He or she will gain the princely sum of £2.86 a week. That is not much of an incentive for a young person to go off the dole, take up employment and put his or her foot on the first rung of the ladder to a better paid job.  It is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>I have often encouraged young people to take a low paid job for openers, go on to prove themselves and then move to something better.  This budgetary provision will not act as an incentive for young people to give up the dole, and all the benefits that go with it, to take on a low paid job. It will not encourage them to join the labour force and work themselves up from there, which would be the best progression we could offer to young people.  This budget did nothing to encourage that kind of progression.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a single person on £250 a week, a relatively modest wage in today's world. After three budgets from the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Labour Party, that person will be paying £60 a week in tax and PRSI.  So their take-home pay is £190 even after this great and much praised budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Take the case of a married man with a wife and two children earning £250 a week.  Even allowing for an increase in child benefit, this family will be better off by £3.70 a week as a result of the budget.  That works out at 90p per family member per week.  Who is getting rich as a result of this budget?  It is not the ordinary hard-pressed workers, who daily have to shoulder the burden of keeping the economy rolling. How can we be serious about tax reform, rewarding effort and reducing unemployment if we continue to ignore the crippling burden of taxation on people with modest incomes?  If we really want to shift people from welfare to work we will have to take a much more radical approach than that outlined in the budget.</P>
      <P>The top rate of tax is a case in point.  The Progressive Democrats in Government with Fianna Fáil cut the top rate by 8 per cent from a punitive 56 per cent to a level of 48 per cent, which is still unacceptable.  If that Government had stayed on course further progress would have been made towards what we believe to be the medium-term goal of reducing the top rate to 40 per cent.  This objective of cutting the top rate of tax is portrayed by the Labour Party as if it were some sort of right-wing extremism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> For the benefit of Labour Party Members &mdash; there are none present, but one or two may be listening to me in their offices &mdash; let me quote for them the recent words of Mr. Gordon Brown, Tony Blair's spokesperson on finance and, most likely, the next British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  He said:</P>
    <P>It is because we understand the importance of work that there will be no return to penal marginal rates at the top.  As a signal of the importance we attach to rewarding work, I want to make it clear that I will not increase the top rate of tax.</P>
    <P>The British top rate of tax is 40 per cent.  In an open economy depending on exports to survive, with keen competition for jobs, how can we compete successfully for scarce overseas job generating investment if we continue to tax work at this level?  How can we expect big multinationals, given the choice, to locate here and create jobs if our pay rates are so much lower than elsewhere as a result of higher taxes?  How can we survive if we continue with those rates of tax?</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, this morning pouring scorn on our demand for reducing the top rate of tax.  Although he is not here to listen, he might read the record some day.  I would like to remind him that more than 40 per cent of workers slip quickly into the top rate of tax.  It is not just applied to the great Mercedes cars that he drives and other luxury items of that nature.  Ordinary workers on modest incomes also slip into the top rate.  We are not asking anything for people on very high incomes.  We are seeking this for those with ordinary modest incomes, who are trying to pay their way and make a living in conditions as they now apply.</P>
    <P>After five years of Labour in Government and three budgets delivered by a Labour Finance Minister, a person earning £261 a week still pays tax at the rate of 48 per cent on marginal income. If PRSI and the two levies are included, the real marginal rate for these people rises to 55 per cent. Does this make economic sense?  How can we possibly justify a situation where, if a person on modest wages earns an extra £10 a week, he gets £4.50 while the Government gets £5.50?</P>
    <P>The 48 per cent tax rate weighs heavily on ordinary PAYE workers.  It poses no problem for those wealthy individuals who evaded their taxes and then cleared their slate through the Labour Party's tax amnesty.  We must reduce the top rate of tax.  Other countries are doing it.  If we do not follow suit, we will put ourselves out of line in the very competitive environment that faces us. If Britain holds to a 40 per cent rate, how can we justify 48 per cent?  If Germany moves to a top rate of 35 per cent, as it plans to do, how can we hope to sustain a top rate that is 13 per cent higher than theirs?  Nobody wants Ireland to become a low-wage economy, but if we impose penal tax rates on well-paid jobs in mobile industries, like financial services and computer software, we will not attract these jobs to Ireland <Col N="38" /> but will lose them to countries which allow well-paid people to keep more of what they earn.  It is remarkable that the people on the left who shout loudest about the dangers of Ireland becoming a low-wage economy are the ones who most strongly oppose cuts in the top rate of tax.  This simply does not add up.  If we want to attract high-paying jobs, we must first of all stop taxing those jobs out of existence.</P>
    <P>It is important also to find out that this Government finally recognises that PRSI is a tax on work.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Finance has been able to deliver a much needed cut of 1 per cent in the rate of employee PRSI, particularly given the opposition he must have encountered from certain elements within this Government.  PRSI is a bad tax.  It discriminates against those on modest earnings.  Even after the budget changes, a person on £250 a week pays 3 per cent of his income on PRSI while a person on £2,500 a week pays less than 1 per cent.  Where is the justice in that?  PRSI discriminates against workers in the private sector.  They have to pay PRSI at a rate five times higher than the vast majority of their counterparts in the Civil Service. To put this in context, the average worker in Packard in Tallaght, now sadly out of work, would have paid about £10 a week in PRSI, but the secretary of a Government Department, on a salary of £75,000 a year and with a lifetime guarantee of employment, would pay just £4 a week in PRSI.  Where is the social justice in that? The Progressive Democrats would like to see employee PRSI and the two levies abolished altogether. It is wrong to ask working people to pay four different taxes on the same income.</P>
    <P>This Government has major questions to answer in relation to unemployment.  All economic forecasters, including the Department of Finance, are agreed that the economy will grow by at least 5 per cent in real terms in 1997.  If the economy grows by 5 per cent, that should deliver employment growth of 50,000 to 60,000 persons per year.  Why is that not happening?  Why, for example, in my constituency of Cork North-Central has there been no increase in the level of employment in the past five years?  Why is it that the number of unemployed stands at a stubborn 27 per cent and has not changed in the five years during which this Government has been in office? Why is it that this great growth in employment seems to have passed us by in Cork North-Central, that we seem to be immune to it?  The level of unemployment in my constituency is as high now as it was when this Government took office.</P>
    <P>It is inconceivable that the number of people at work in a small economy like ours could increase by 60,000 or more while the level of unemployment remains the same.  Is this Government saying that the level of registered unemployment is a constant at around 270,000 and that it will not come down, regardless of what is happening in the economy?  Ministers have repeatedly stressed that the Labour Force Survey provides the most accurate measurement of the real <Col N="39" /> levels of unemployment.  According to the most recent survey, the number of people out of work was 177,000 in April last, but the State was paying unemployment compensation to 281,000 people. That is a difference of 104,000.  We know that there is widespread abuse of the system.  The CSO has provided us with sound documentary evidence of that fact.  In the immediate aftermath of the CSO survey, the live register fell by a remarkable 24,000 in just three months.  In other words, registered unemployment fell by more in three months than in the previous three years. Despite that fall, the live register total is about 80,000 higher than the Labour Force Survey figures would suggest.  This is an unacceptable gap and it imposes an unacceptable burden on the taxpayer.  Unemployment benefit is paid to jobless people who are available for work and who are actively seeking work.  It is not a basic income for those who do not want to work, or a top-up payment for people who are working in the black economy.  With proper management, the level of registered unemployment could be reduced to around 225,000 relatively quickly.  That would represent a saving to the Exchequer of £160 million on a full year basis, money that could be used to fund tax cuts and significant increases for genuine and deserving social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is the largest party in this Government and it holds a majority of the seats at the Cabinet table.  Despite that fact, it is difficult to discern any trace of Fine Gael influence on the budget under consideration.  Over the past few months, Deputy Phil Hogan and the Fine Gael committee on tax reform have been like voices crying in the wilderness.  They have been calling for tax cuts to a basic rate of 25 per cent and a top rate of 45 per cent, but they got their answer; they clearly have no influence in this Government. Fine Gael in opposition championed tax cuts, public service reform and privatisation of State companies.  However, Fine Gael in coalition with Labour and Democratic Left has clearly found itself in no position to deliver on any of its own stated key economic policies.  It is a classic example of a party in Government but not in power.</P>
    <P>This is not a good budget.  It will not radically change the single most important problem, namely unemployment.  There are local authority estates in my constituency where unemployment is as high as 80 per cent. We are now seeing third generation long-term unemployed, and this budget does nothing for them.  It is sad to hear in recent times that the Construction Industry Federation is advertising in magazines in the UK seeking workers in the construction industry, in all the trades, wet trades and others.  They are seeking workers at a time when so many people are unemployed but not trained to take on the kind of work that is available, and this despite the fact that FÁS, the training agency, has an annual budget of £300 million, 50 per cent of which is spent on training.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> Clearly, we are not training people for the jobs which are now available and that is a result of a lack of manpower and training policies on the part of this Government.  It is nothing short of obscene that we now seek to bring in workers from abroad at a time when 270,000 people are out of work and so many families in my constituency are now experiencing third generation long-term unemployment.  That is a failure of manpower and training policies at a time when the taxpayer is putting up so much money to pay for training.  It is also obscene that a number of restaurateurs and others are bringing in workers from Spain and elsewhere because Irish people are not prepared to take on those jobs due to the high taxes on low-paid work.  If there is one acid test more than any other which I would apply to demonstrate the failure of this Government, it is its failure to put in place tax, training and education policies which would enable Irish people to qualify for the jobs available and create work for themselves.  That is a disgrace and it is my final condemnation of this budget and Government. Happily, it is the last budget of this Administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take this opportunity to comment on some of Deputy Quill's remarks which were provocative to say the least.</P>
      <P>To suggest that there is no mark of Fine Gael in this budget shows a deep misunderstanding both of Fine Gael's role in Government and of its policies.  This budget has been put together with the national interest at heart.  That is not confined to some niche of interests with which the Progressive Democrats seems to identify.  We have achieved an extremely well balanced package. There is provision for substantial tax reform for business, substantial increases in take-home pay for workers and increases in welfare payments well in excess of the rate of inflation for those who are at the margins of society.  If that is not achieving the objectives of Fine Gael, I am not a fair representative of Fine Gael.  Those values are at the heart of Fine Gael, and Progressive Democrat and other commentators who seek to confine the role of Fine Gael to that described by the Progressive Democrats are selling Fine Gael far short, and I have little time for that sort of comment.</P>
      <P>It is also important to state that this Government has had the needs of the long-term unemployed at the heart of its consideration in framing both this and other budgets.  Contrary to what Deputy Quill said, this Government has succeeded in reducing long-term unemployment by 26,000 in the past two years.  That is a significant reduction which has been overlooked by Deputy Quill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, long-term unemployment is one of the most difficult issues for any Government.  It is a challenge which is facing every country in Europe and the western world.  It is clearly a difficulty which has been created both by rapidly <Col N="41" /> changing technology and skill requirements and that poses significant challenges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill was a member of the National Economic and Social Forum which recommended the approach, which this Government has implemented, of introducing the employment service in 14 black spots.  I am surprised she suggested that the Government has not been addressing this because she put her name to recommendations which this Government is implementing.  It shows that Deputy Quill's contribution was a political one rather than an honest attempt to look at the problems we face as a society and see how we can make those measures work even better.  They are already working significantly as is evident from the reductions in long-term unemployment but they are by no means satisfactory or the end of the response. These are areas which we must refine continually and we must improve the measures and instruments to bring more people who have been excluded into the workplace.</P>
    <P>One can see the measures which are being introduced in this budget to do precisely that, such as the reform of the family income supplement which was introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  These measures are targeted at low-paid workers to ensure they see proper rewards for their efforts. That is an important part of the response to long-term employment and it is part of the way in which we can address these needs.  We must remove unemployment and poverty traps which have been a feature of the tax code and that has been a central element of the last number of budgets.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should review what has been achieved in the last three budgets.  That would provide a more realistic backdrop to this debate.  We, as a Government, have done what we set out to do.  We have delivered on the core objectives of making it cheaper to create a job and more rewarding to take up employment.</P>
    <P>We have seen the fruits of that delivery.  In the last two years 100,000 net new jobs have been created and 100,000 extra people are at work. That is almost an 8 per cent increase in the number at work in just two years.  That was a very significant achievement.  Indeed, the projections indicate a further record performance on employment in 1997 with the creation of a further 45,000 jobs.  Therefore, on the key test of employment creation, the Government strategy has been working.</P>
    <P>We have also seen tangible progress in reforming the tax code which has been a shared objective of parties in this House.  Again, it is worth reflecting on what has been achieved in three years.  The tax free allowance, for example, has been increased by 23 per cent which is way ahead of inflation in that period which amounted to about 6 per cent.  The tax band has also been expanded by 21 per cent which is also far in excess of the 6 per cent level of inflation.</P>
    <P>The impact of that on a worker earning the <Col N="42" /> average industrial wage is extremely significant. The tax take from a single industrial worker on the average industrial wage has been reduced by 5 percentage points from 31 to 26 per cent.  That has been achieved in three budgets, not through flamboyant change but as a result of steady progress across the board.  We have sought to share the benefits in that way and, therefore, we have concentrated on changes in the allowances, the bands and, this year, the standard tax rate and personal PRSI rate.  That approach has ensured that the benefits of tax reform have been spread fairly to benefit the broad mass of workers and have not been confined to any particular group of workers.  That conscious approach by Government has been rewarded by positive employment performance.</P>
    <P>It is also fair to say that part of the economic success which we have enjoyed in recent years has been secured by the partnership approach which has been adopted for ten years.  People who have been willing to accept more moderate pay settlements as part of a shared approach to planning the economic future of this country rightly expect, and are getting, a dividend for that effort in this budget and over the last number of budgets.  I am pleased to be part of a Government which is carrying out such broad-based reform of the tax code and which has already brought down the tax take on an average industrial wage by five points in three budgets.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of progress we want to consolidate for the future.  This is an important time when the <i>Partnership 2000</i> agreement, which sets an equally good framework for the future, is being assessed and decided on by the social partners. This budget has given a clear signal of the Government's commitment to the approach embodied in the <i>Partnership 2000</i> agreement, an approach that sets a clear vision for the economic and social aspects of our community.  That can be achieved by working together.  For its part, the Government is committed to reforming our tax code and delivering on the commitments which amount to £900 million in respect of income tax and £100 million in respect of business tax.  In this budget the Government has shown its commitment in terms of substantial progress being made towards both of those figures.</P>
    <P>There have been significant achievements in the area of business taxation in the past three years.  We had a very difficult position in our tax code some years ago where, effectively, a 40 per cent tax rate was being demanded by all those who were not in manufacturing or internationally traded services.  Clearly it was unreasonable to demand such a tax take from service industries. We have started to wind it back progressively in each budget.  We have reduced the corporation tax rate and introduced a new corporate tax rate for small companies for the first £50,000 profit. We have reduced those rates to 28 per cent on the first £50,000, a dramatic change from the 40 per cent tax rate of three years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> Equally, the overall tax rate of 40 per cent has been reduced to 36 per cent.  This is clearly sign-posting the way forward where we have a fairer tax take from corporate as well as personal income which allows enterprise to be rewarded, particularly small businesses who are the backbone of our employment growth.  That approach, a hallmark of the Government's business tax policy, is being rewarded by employment performance.</P>
    <P>We have tackled also other areas of business taxation, which have been of particular concern. Those Deputies who have worked closely in family businesses will be aware of the particular burdens which capital acquisitions tax could impose on small businesses.  When the owner-manager of a small business died the business was often at its most vulnerable and capital acquisitions tax wrought a substantial bill on that business.  We all recognised that was an unfair imposition and the Government has substantially modified it.  Three years ago only one quarter of the business assets could be disregarded.  Now 90 per cent of the business assets can be disregarded for the purposes of capital acquisitions tax.  In practice this means no tax would fall due on a business transfer between a parent and his or her child where the business assets did not exceed £1.85 million. That is a substantial threshold and protects most small businesses from erosion by capital acquisitions tax at a time when a difficult transition is being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The tax changes in the small business tax and capital acquisitions tax have made a significant difference to small businesses.  There is a significant concession in the budget for start-up companies where the costs incurred by a small business, prior to corporation tax, will be allowed against corporation tax.  The cost in a full year will be in the region of £4 million which will go directly to small start-up companies, to help them through that difficult start-up phase.  In this key area it is important that the Government eases the burden and supports development.  Business start-up is a difficult road on which to embark and it behoves the Government to make it as easy as possible.</P>
    <P>My Department, through the various agencies, has put in place substantial supports to help businesses through that period.  It is appropriate that that be matched by this type of change in the corporation tax structure, which gives particular concessions to business start-up.</P>
    <P>The most significant concession to business which the Government has achieved has been the sustained reduction in the tax wedge.  The constant theme of businesses, large and small has been the gap between what they pay in gross pay and what the worker receives in take-home pay. The progress made in respect of a reduction of 5 percentage points for the average industrial worker on the income tax code has been matched by the progress made in reforming PRSI, the social insurance code so that two thirds of all <Col N="44" /> workers are on the low rate of 8.5 per cent PRSI. Three years ago the vast majority of workers were on the 12.2 per cent rate.  The drop of 3.7 per cent for most workers has been a significant reduction in the wedge that employers have to pay.</P>
    <P>Equally there have been significant reductions in the employees share of the social insurance. Three years ago a rate of 5.5 per cent applied to all income.  Now the first £80 per week is exempt from PRSI and the new rate is 4.5 per cent.  That amounts to a reduction of about two percentage points on incomes of about £20,000.  For the vast majority of workers, the employee PRSI has been reduced by the equivalent of two percentage points.  When employers' PRSI, employees' PRSI and the income tax code is totted up, it shows that significant progress has been made in reducing the tax wedge which had been a barrier to employment creation.  The Government can rightly say it has made it cheaper to create a job and easier to take up a job &mdash; a core objective of the Government.</P>
    <P>We have succeeded in creating unrivalled strength in our public finances.  The most telling measure of that progress can be seen from the Government debt as a proportion of national income in 1994.  The proportion of national income mortgaged in public debt in 1994 was 88 per cent.  It was reduced this year to 73 per cent and by the end of this year is expected to be around 69 per cent.  We have taken close to 20 percentage points off the proportion of our income mortgaged in public debt.  That is a remarkable achievement and shows the strong healthy state of our public finances and is in accord with the Maastricht criteria &mdash; a core value the Government is committed to achieving.  The current borrowing level is well within the Maastricht criteria of 3 per cent and, more significantly, for the first time in memory we are planning for a current budget surplus.  We are no longer borrowing to meet day-to-day expenditures but rather are using revenue from day-to-day expenditures to pay back debt.  This significant turnaround is a symptom of the very healthy state of the economy.</P>
    <P>These figures are the real test of the healthy state of the public finances.  Some people have criticised the level of public spending, but it is very significant that the Government has succeeded in keeping public spending below the growth in national income every year it has been in office.  We have consistently reduced the take of public spending from national income and also reduced the public debt and taxation.  In addition, we have been able to provide much needed services in the health, social welfare and justice areas within a very healthy overall public finance framework.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that the Government sustains this position into the medium term.  We are facing economic and monetary union and all the financial aggregates must be in a healthy state.  It is important for businesses to address EMU in a <Col N="45" /> timely way.  It is very easy for people to regard economic and monetary union as another currency move which will not greatly affect their businesses.  However, this is not the case.  Membership of economic and monetary union will fundamentally change the way in which people do business.  For example, they will have to return their accounts in euros and will have to change their software programmes so that they can trade in euros and in both euros and punts for a time. Membership will require a radical change in the way companies organise themselves and it is very important that they move in a timely way to address these changes.  If they do not address these changes until the eleventh hour they will have to pay much more and there will be more disruption to business.</P>
    <P>My Department, supported by the Departments of Finance and Tourism and Trade, is leading an awareness campaign to help business plan the transition to economic and monetary union.  I am very pleased that many business organisations and associations are participating in the programme as it will enable us to disseminate the information to businesses in the various sectors. The message is very clear: Ireland intends to join EMU and there are real benefits and opportunities available if businesses prepare for them. Businesses must prepare for EMU now, not when it looms before them and they are not in a position to deal with the various challenges presented by the transition in the cheapest and the most effective way.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the extremely strong performance by the industrial development agencies.  The IDA and Forbairt turned in record performances in terms of net job creation last year.  Most significantly, Forbairt has achieved the best turnaround in net employment since 1979.  This justifies the decision to split the IDA and Forbairt and to give both agencies a clear focus.  The IDA had its best year ever in terms of the creation of net employment in the overseas sector.  Forbairt, which has gone through its transition, is successfully addressing the needs of indigenous business and also had a record year.</P>
    <P>The figures in regard to the detail of its performance are also very heartening.  Last year there were record figures for the linkage programme, with purchases by overseas companies of Irish raw materials and services outstripping the growth in sales from overseas companies.  In other words, the share of Irish materials used by overseas companies is increasing.  This is a heartening indication of the way in which the indigenous sub-supply sector has come of age and is delivering quality materials and services to the overseas sector.  It is only correct to draw the attention of the House to this particularly gratifying aspect of its performance over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to aspects of the social welfare code which have been a significant feature of the budget.  The increase in the family income supplement is very welcome and will help to remove <Col N="46" /> poverty traps which have been a feature of the interaction between the tax and social welfare codes.  The increase of £10 in the family income supplement will extend the benefits of the scheme to significantly more workers.  If one looks at the budgetary tables one will see that the highest gains are focused on low-paid families who have achieved increases far in excess of any other group on the social welfare or employment side. This is as it should be.</P>
    <P>We have been fortunate this year in that we have been able to provide very good increases, twice the rate of inflation, to those on social welfare. However, it is equally important to offer strong inducements to people to return to work. The interaction of the tax changes and the increase in the family income supplement show that very substantial gains can be realised by those taking up employment, even at low incomes.  That aspect of this and previous budgets is part of the long-term reform process being undertaken by the Government to make it more rewarding for unemployed people to take up work.  We must continue to build this incentive into the tax reform and social welfare reform packages.</P>
    <P>We have significantly modified another trap in the social welfare area through the introduction of a tapered withdrawal of the adult dependant allowance.  At present in cases where one spouse earns more than £60 and the other spouse is claiming social welfare they lose the adult dependant allowance which is worth approximately £40 per week.  As and from 1 April the Minister for Social Welfare will introduce a tapering relief so that there is no sudden loss.  This will remove a barrier which has been a bone of contention and a significant poverty trap in the tax code.  I commend the Minister for Social Welfare for the improvements he has introduced in this and other areas.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a very important change which will make capital more available to business and, in particular, emerging business.  It has always been important that the stock market take a more active role in supporting smaller indigenous companies in providing their capital needs. Sadly, in the past the stock market has not been a particularly accessible vehicle for indigenous Irish business.  I welcome the measures being introduced to help the proposed developing companies market of the Irish Stock Exchange.  This will only work if the overall cost of access to the market is reasonable.  It is important that the fee structure for access to the market responds to the needs and financial reality of growth companies. Our continued support for the market through measures such as those announced in the budget will have to be called into question if it is not shown to be.  The stock market has the capacity to be a more significant supporter of the capital needs of business.</P>
    <P>It emerged this morning that the price of beer, a very emotive topic in many people's minds, is set to go up by 5p to 6p per pint.  This occurs <Col N="47" /> against a background where the Government has shown enormous restraint in not levying extra taxation on beer in any of the past three budgets. The last time a Minister for Finance increased the price of beer was in 1994 &mdash; a 3p increase imposed by Deputy Bertie Ahern.  I am concerned about the reason for this apparent widespread and substantial increase and had discussions with the Chairperson of the Competition Authority this morning.  We share concerns about the possible anti-competitive features of the market and are considering the next most effective response in the circumstances.  I am concerned at increases of this scale occuring on such a widespread basis.  It is important that the industry be aware that the Government has kept down excise duties in this area to allow competitive pricing.  It would not be in the interests of the industry to allow increases beyond what is reasonable in a given year after such restraint on the part of the Government.</P>

      <P>Over the past three years he has succeeded in exceeding the guidelines on public expenditure which he set for himself.  The Irish people cannot afford to take much more success of this nature in the long-term.</P>
      <P>The 1997 budget benefited some people but it did not go far enough.  The test of any Government's integrity is how it treats the most vulnerable in society and among our most vulnerable are the elderly.  In three years the rainbow coalition Government has only succeeded in increasing the lot of old age pensioners by £7 or by less than the cheapest bag of coal.  The philosophy behind this political footwork is the less one gives them, the better off they will be.  This is in sync with the increase the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, gave to those living alone a short time ago where he increased their lot per week by less than the price of a box of matches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elderly have been extremely disappointed <Col N="48" /> by the performance of Deputy De Rossa and by the fact that this Government has ignored their plight.  The Government has badly miscalculated to the extent that this budget was meant to buy off the electorate in a general election year.  The Government is under the impression that those who pay tax at the rate of 48 per cent are extremely wealthy people who did not require any assistance in the budget, which ignores the fact that these people pay a real tax rate of 55 per cent when PRSI is added on to a major share of their incomes.  They are not as wealthy as they were made out to be by the Minister for Finance. He might do well to remember that many of these people are ordinary working people with families who are finding it difficult to get by.</P>
    <P>Many of them are in business and find themselves in a small pool which is being increasingly targeted by a Government blindfolded to their needs and their plight.  For example, small business people pay these tax rates and also pay commercial rates.  They pay service charges, refuse charges and will pay more for car tax and petrol. This is a disincentive to entrepreneurial spirit and merely douses ambition among the very people who have the capacity to generate employment and wealth in society.</P>

      <P>I have arranged for meetings to take place between my officials and representatives of the various churches and I have also had informal contacts on the matter.  Responsibility for those matters relates predominantly to other Ministers and it is not my practice to hold meetings about matters which are the responsibility of other Ministers.

      <NameTxt>Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no fundamental problem with meeting church leaders about any matter. As the Deputy may recollect, I had a meeting two weeks ago with the incoming Archbishop of Armagh, Dr. Sean Brady, and I have also had contacts with several other church leaders.  I would welcome regular meetings between Government and representatives of the principal churches.  That would be the correct way to proceed on this matter. It is not particularly desirable for the Taoiseach to get involved in meetings on legislative issues that are primarily the responsibility of another Minister.  If that were the case, Ministers would feel they were at risk of being second guessed in regard to their work.  While the Deputy may hold a different view in this regard, that would not be good practice for a Taoiseach to adopt.  I have followed that view successfully for the past two years or more.</P>
      <P>We should recognise the role churches have played in strengthening our social fabric and the importance of the values that pervade our churches in allowing people to deal with problems. As legislators we must understand that laws do not solve problems, people solve problems. Laws can provide a framework and guidance for people, but ultimately it is the people's responsibility that makes a strong society.</P>

      <P>I understood from the Second Stage debate on the Employment Equality Bill that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform consulted widely with church leaders before drafting the legislation.  I am not sure of the position in regard to the Education Bill.

      <P>There is an ongoing process of consultation before and after the publication of any legislation.  In the case of the Education Bill, I am sure the Deputy will recollect that, when he was in Government, the Minister entered an extensive consultation process, involving a series <Col N="50" /> of meetings in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, that were open to all educational interests.  That consultative process was carried forward to the publication of the Bill and consultation will continue to take place as the legislation passes through the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>A similar approach was adopted before and after the publication of the Employment Equality Bill and that bore fruit in the balanced and fair approach adopted in regard to section 37 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should allow me to answer his leader's question.  The position is not as Deputy Bertie Ahern stated.  Concerns were expressed by a number of organisations, including the INTO, about the drafting of the legislation in its existing form.  Strong views were also expressed in favour of the draft by church interests and others who favour a strong religious ethos in the management of certain institutions.  I am pleased that as a result of extensive consultation and discussion about the concerns on both sides, the Government agreed a fair formula for the wording of section 37.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitutional Review Group had a nominee from the Deputy's party and if there was a deficiency in consulting the churches, the responsibility should be shared among all the members of the group.  In any event, the report has been referred to a committee of the House on which the Deputy's party is represented.  I have no doubt the committee will ensure all interests, including those of the churches, are heard fully with a view to drafting changes.  These interests must be given a proper audience in conjunction with all the other views that need to be taken into account from other interests in society.</P>
      <P>The church leaders continue to play a valuable role in the peace process and in the political process of reconciliation.  They are consulted regularly by me and other representatives of the Government.  Only this morning I spoke to a leading church figure in Northern Ireland about the peace process.  Such contacts occur on a very frequent basis.  However, such work is best done in a low-key way because there is no gain in publicising every such contact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is the answer to both questions.  It is entirely reasonable for people to stage church parades.  However, where, as happened in Drumcree, 6,000 or 7,000 people assemble to go to a service in a church which can only accommodate 300 to 400 people, and where most of those involved would not normally attend that church for a service, the situation is more than what one might consider a normal procession or march to a church.  There is a need to achieve a balance and make a distinction between the continuance of local parades which represent a local demonstration of traditions and beliefs, religious and political, and the massing of large groups which may have an intimidatory effect, whether deliberate or not, on people in the locality who do not share their point of view.  Following the publication of the North report in the near future, I hope we will see a procedure which will allow an appropriate balance to be struck between the legitimate right to demonstrate political <Col N="52" /> and religious beliefs and the equal right of people not to feel intimidated or undermined by the massing of people.</P>

Do the leaders of the other Government parties share his view?  Given the Taoiseach adopts a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to these matters, does that put his party at a disadvantage when the other party leaders show no such reluctance? I would expect the Taoiseach to share my view on these matters and I would expect him to look after our interests.

That is a practice I have adopted successfully since becoming Taoiseach. That is not to say the Taoiseach should not be involved with all aspects of Government policy because that is clearly the constitutional responsibility of the Taoiseach of the day.  In regard to the matters referred to by the Deputy, I have involved myself intensively in seeking a satisfactory resolution of the genuine differences of interest that exist.  The proposals decided upon reach a fair balance.  This is an ongoing issue and problems of this nature will continue to arise in legislation.  It is important that there be a conciliatory and consultative approach to resolving them, as was adopted on this occasion.</P>

      <P>In 1996 the Law Reform Commission published two reports and two consultation papers, as well as its annual report for 1995. Copies of the reports were placed in the Oireachtas Library at the time of publication. These publications included a report on family courts, published in March 1996 and a consultation paper on the Unidroit Convention on the International Return of Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects, published in November 1996.  These documents arose from topics in the commission's first programme for law reform.  On topics referred to it by the Attorney General, the commission published a report on sentencing in August, 1996, and a consultation paper on privacy &mdash;&ldquo;Surveillance and the Interception of Communications&rdquo;&mdash; in September, 1996.  The commission's &ldquo;Report on Personal Injuries &mdash; Periodic Payments and Structured Settlements&rdquo; is due to be published tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This reply was prepared for delivery yesterday but I was delayed by the Deputy.  However, I apologise that it was not corrected.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for implementation of the commission's recommendations is a matter for relevant Departments.  I can, however, say that the recommendation in the commission's &ldquo;Report on Sentencing&rdquo; that penal servitude and imprisonment with hard labour be abolished has been followed in the Criminal Law Bill, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the commission has published 53 reports containing proposals for reform of the law, 11 working papers, 11 consultation papers and 17 annual reports.  This is a formidable volume <Col N="54" /> of work and I would like to place on record my appreciation, and that of the Government, of the valuable contribution made by the commission since its establishment in 1975.  I would like in particular to extend that appreciation to the individual members of the commission, four of whom recently completed ten years' service.</P>
    <P>The Government is giving consideration to the formulation of a second work programme for the commission in the context of the renewal of the commission, whose term of office, with the exception of that of the president, expired at the beginning of this year.  The Attorney General has had consultations with the President of the commission on the matter.  There are no plans to establish a criminal law reform commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct that, leaving aside the personal injuries report which was published today, the Law Reform Commission published four documents during the past 12 months on which no legislative action has been taken?  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government intends to implement the Law Reform Commission's recommendations on family law courts in full?  The original question sought the Taoiseach's views on the desirability of having a separate criminal law commission.  What are his views in that regard, given his statment that there are no plans to establish such a commission? Will the Taoiseach justify that assertion in view of the Government's record on criminal law reform?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the end of 1994, in so far as criminal law reform is concerned, the Government has introduced legislation on sexual offences, the proceeds of crime and the criminal assets bureau.  Legislation is in preparation regarding fraud offences, the indexation of fines, civil evidence and non-fatal offences.  There is an ongoing programme of criminal law reform.  I also indicated, in response to questions raised by the Deputy during the summer, that the Government would be introducing a general criminal law reform Bill each year to update matters of criminal procedure on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the introduction of a separate criminal law reform commission.  It would be best to proceed on the basis of using the existing Law Reform Commission for that purpose.  If a separate commission were established, there would be two law reform commissions &mdash; one to deal with civil law, the existing commission, and another to deal with criminal law reform, which would be a separate commission.  I do not believe two are required and I know of no country in Europe with two such commissions.  It would not be a good idea to establish a separate commission. Is that reply clear enough?</P>

Does he not also agree that two of the four pieces of criminal legislation outlined were introduced on Fianna Fáil's initiative? Is it not correct that the overwhelming proportion of the criminal law reform measures introduced by the Government resulted from accepting Fianna Fáil legislation, plagiarising other Fianna Fáil legislation and reacting with hasty legislation to respond to particular crises?  Does that not indicate that there is need for a criminal law up to standard, in view of the fact that the Government has failed lamentably to do so?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Justice is establishing a crime council which will advise her on all matters, whether these involve changes in the law, procedure or practice, that can be taken in hand to deal with crime.  It is better to take that broad approach rather than merely singling out law reform as if it will solve the problem.  Law reform without law enforcement and community support is not effective. I believe the broad approach adopted by the Minister of support for changes in the area of crime prevention and deterrence is the correct route to take.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's last statement regarding the Government's record on crime twists the facts somewhat.  In reality, the most important legislation passed by the House last <Col N="56" /> year was the Criminal Assets Bureau Act which, in effect, was originally introduced by Fianna Fáil.  That legislation would not be on the Statute Book and could not be used by the Garda Síochána had this side of the House not prompted action on the Government's part.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that the Law Reform Commission has published 53 reports.  If he does not have the information to hand, will the Taoiseach prepare an indicative list of the proposals made by the commission which were subsequently implemented by Governments in the past?  The Law Reform Commission spent a lengthy period dealing with the bail issue and because of pressure applied mainly by this side of the House, the Minister for Justice accepted the need for a bail referendum whereas the commission had proposed other action which was favoured by Democratic Left and the Labour Party.  Ultimately, however, the Minister for Justice got her own way because of the pressure.</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions last year I raised the issue of illegal use of the Internet.  The Taoiseach will recall that I requested the establishment of a working group on the broader issue of censorship which would deal with all aspects of the problem.  Successive Governments have failed to establish such a body but, rather than taking piecemeal action in respect of the Internet, I thought it would be a good idea to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October last, UNICEF and the Irish Service <Col N="57" /> Providers suggested the setting up of a working party to work with the Government and agencies, and that has been done.  I was in communication with the Taoiseach's office and received a reply on the matter prior to Christmas.  I have no difficulty with the working group and I hope it will be successful, but since the Law Reform Commission has vast expertise available to it &mdash; whether it has been used by this House and by Governments in the past is another matter &mdash; will the Taoiseach consider the use of that commission to assess legislation on video nasties, defamation laws on books and videos and so on? Perhaps that would assist in dealing with this complex issue.  The illegal use of the Internet needs to be dealt with in a broad way, otherwise people will continue to break the law.  Will the Taoiseach consider my proposal?</P>

      <P>The working party approach we have adopted is targeted to get results.  To refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission would not necessarily be the best way to approach this issue as it would lead to postponement of action rather than advance the matter. The working group may, however, identify specific matters that need a broader study which would be suitable to the Law Reform Commission and the matter could be referred to it by the Government on receipt of a recommendation to that effect from the working party.  That would be the best approach.</P>

      <P>The consumer price index &mdash; CPI &mdash; is compiled by the CSO from retail price quotations collected directly from a fixed panel of shops throughout the country and a range of postal inquiries.  The CPI is carried out on a quarterly basis at present but will be conducted monthly from February 1997 onwards.  Many factors, including movements in interest rates, influence the level of retail prices.  The CSO does <Col N="58" /> not separately analyse the impact of these general factors on the CPI.  The index is, however, directly affected by changes in mortgage interest rates.  Taking account of the ongoing increase in house prices and mortgage size, a rise of 1 per cent in rates would increase the all-items CPI by 0.42 per cent whereas a fall of 1 per cent would result in a decrease of 0.34 per cent.</P>

      <P>The consumer price index for mid-November shows an increase of 0.5 per cent over the mid-August figure, representing an annual inflation rate to mid-November of 1.9 per cent.  The year to mid-November 1995 showed an annual increase in the inflation rate of 2.4 per cent.  The annual average rate of inflation for 1996 was 1.6 per cent while the average rate of inflation for 1995 was 2.5 per cent.  The all-items CPI continues to be the official national measure of inflation.</P>
      <P>The inflation rate for the year to October for the EU as measured by the EU interim index of consumer prices &mdash; IICP &mdash; is listed as follows: Sweden, 0.3 per cent; Finland, 1.3 per cent; Germany, 1.4 per cent; Luxembourg, 1.7 per cent; France, 1.8 per cent; the Netherlands, 1.9 per cent; Austria, 2.2 per cent; Ireland, 2.3 per cent; Denmark, 2.6 per cent; Belgium, 2.6 per cent; Portugal, 2.8 per cent; the United Kingdom, 3.1 per cent; Italy, 3.2 per cent; Spain, 3.4 per cent and Greece, 7.9 per cent.  The European average for the 15 countries is 2.4 per cent.  We are, therefore, below the European average, in the first half of the league, and in terms of meeting the Maastricht criteria, taking inflation as one of the key factors, we are well on course to qualify for the economic and monetary union.  I do not have the projected figure as requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The consumer price index compiles average retail prices on a quarterly basis. Based on these average prices the increase in the retail price per gallon of road diesel between mid-February 1995 and mid-November 1996 was 29.2p.  This period is the closest available to that requested.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure I gave applies from mid-February 1995 to mid &mdash; November 1996.  Up to now the prices have been compiled on a quarterly basis, in February, May, August and November. As regards the factors that make up the 29.2p increase in a gallon of road diesel, in the budget of 1995 there was no increase in excise duty, in the budget of 1996 it was increased by 4.546p per gallon, or 1p per litre, in the budget of 1997 the increase was 6.819p per gallon, or 1.5p per litre.  One may ask where does the disparity arise between the increase by way of excise duty and the actual increase.  During that period account must be taken of Brent crude oil prices, the price increase per dollar per barrel.  The percentage increase year on year in the price of crude oil for September to December from 1995 to 1996 is as follows: the price of crude oil went up by 35.54 per cent in September, by 50.17 per cent in October, by 34.9 per cent in November and by 32.73 per cent in December.  The highest increases in the price of crude oil occurred in those months, the average increase being 44.01 per cent.  Those figures together with the increase in excise duty help explain part of the increase in the price per gallon of diesel.</P>

      <P>I understand the position in the Border areas is the opposite to what it was a number of years ago when there was wholesale closure of petrol and diesel retail outlets and service stations along the Border.  We saw the skeletons of service stations that were once thriving, commercially vibrant, entities.  Many of those outlets south of the Border have now reopened and the position that applied a number of years ago has been replicated north of the Border where petrol stations have closed because we, on this side, have a competitive advantage.  I do not have the relevant figures.  The Deputy is living in a Border country and I am aware from my occasional incursion across the Border that petrol stations and service stations generally which were non-active are reopening.  That would seem to reflect that the price differential had swung in favour of southern retail outlets as against northern retail outlets.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is correct in saying that petrol stations along the Border were closed in 1987 following a period when Fine Gael and Labour were in Government.  The position was reversed thanks to the decision taken by the former Deputy MacSharry.  As Deputy Leonard said, people are no longer crossing the Border to buy petrol and diesel.  Given the substantial increases in the price of crude diesel oil outlined by the Minister of State, does he accept that a prudent Government, having regard to competitiveness in business, the Border area and tourism, would not have increased the price of crude oil but reduced it as our leader did when, as Minister for Finance, he reduced the price of petrol by 9p a gallon in the 1992 budget?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy O'Hanlon's point about the need to enhance the attractiveness of economies in Border regions, that was one of the factors taken into consideration by the Government in the 1995 budget under which there was no increase in excise duty.  Nobody could say that a 4.5p increase in the wake of no increase in 1996 was exorbitant.  In calculating the level of excise duty that will be imposed on diesel, alcohol and tobacco, the Government takes cognisance of the likely cross-Border effects, given that another <Col N="61" /> economy operates to different standards on our land frontier.  That forms part and parcel of the logic that determines how a budget is framed. The Government has been particularly conscious of that.  As a result, in terms of it being attractive to people to travel across the Border, we have enhanced considerably the prospects of people travelling south and reversed the flow that was the norm up to a few years ago.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Walsh's question on the likely impact of the increase on inflation, as I said in reply to a question from the Leader of Fianna Fáil, we do not have that figure and we must wait until the relevant figures are available to determine that.  We operate on the basis of past experience and what the figure is likely to be, but we do not have that figure now because the budget was only framed and presented to the House two weeks ago.</P>

      <P>The butter voucher scheme is provided for in Regulations of the European Union which provide for the sale of butter at a subsidised rate to social assistance beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>The cost of the subsidy is borne by the European Commission.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is responsible for the negotiation of the scheme at European level and for the redemption of the vouchers and the recoupment of the sums involved from the European Union.  My Department is responsible for certain aspects of the implementation of the scheme, mainly the printing of the vouchers and their distribution to eligible beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>Ireland is the only member state still operating the scheme.  It was due to expire at the end of 1996.  I was concerned to ensure that its benefits were not lost and I liaised very closely with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to ensure its continuance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry successfully negotiated the continuance of the scheme for a further two years.  However, the Agricultural Council was only agreeable to its continuance with a reduced budget.  The reduction was proposed by the Commission due <Col N="62" /> to the declining pattern in Irish butter consumption over the last number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is scandalous that there is a butter mountain in Europe and that farmers are pouring milk down the drain, yet the Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry agreed to the halving of the butter voucher scheme to the most deserving recipients in this country?

      <P>On receiving this question I was surprised to note that Deputy Walsh had to ask if I was responsible for the scheme because I understand he had responsibility at some point for it when he was in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and negotiated the ending of the scheme at the end of 1996.  I, along with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, have ensured that it continues for a further two years.  The fact that it operates only in Ireland and that all other member states have had their schemes withdrawn by the European Union indicates the Government's success in continuing the scheme, not the reverse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider the slashing of that scheme by 50 per cent a success? This decision was taken during our Presidency, surreptitiously at the meeting in Dublin about which there was so much cant and hype on 16-17 December.  It was only a few weeks ago that the Minister for Social Welfare and his Department notified social welfare offices around the country that the butter voucher scheme would be reduced by 50 per cent which would affect large and poor families.  Is this another failure to implement a European Union scheme following the non-implementation of the Poverty IV Programme? What representations has the Minister made to allow a continuation of this scheme given the surplus of butter within the European Union?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I took an active interest in this matter and as far back as September I made contact with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry as I was concerned that the scheme should continue.  The Government of which Deputy Walsh was a member was responsible for negotiating an end to the scheme at the end of 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the only member state in receipt of money from the European Union for the issuing of butter vouchers.  The ending of the scheme in other countries is the result of the decline in butter consumption.  It was introduced in the first instance to encourage its use but there has been a substantial decline in recent years.  The EU Commission review of the scheme in 1995 demonstrated that between 1987 and 1995 butter consumption in Ireland fell from 21,000 tonnes in 1987 to 12,000 tonnes in 1995.  It also showed that trends in the consumption of spreads such as Dairygold <Col N="63" /> had moved in the opposite direction. Clearly, the purpose of the scheme was no longer valid so far as the European Union was concerned. Despite this, the Government succeeded in having it extended for a further two years.</P>

      <P>The Minister has informed us that butter consumption has declined.  What was the uptake of vouchers last year and the year before?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The average projected live register figure for unemployed persons for 1997 is 262,000.  This is a decrease on the average figure for 1996 which was in the region of 279,000.</P>
      <P>In projecting the live register figure for 1997, a number of factors were considered, including the projected strong growth in the economy which will enhance job creation, the various programmes in place to help unemployed persons wishing to return to work and the positive results expected to continue as a result of the recent package of measures to combat social welfare fraud.</P>
      <P>This year's budget and Estimates are framed on the basis of an expected additional 45,000 jobs in the economy in 1997.  It is impossible to say how many of these jobs will be filled by people coming from the live register.  I hope, however, that the buoyant labour market conditions will result in many persons on the live register getting an opportunity to take up work.  There is substantial movement of people off the live register each month, on average about 10 per cent of the total, and analysis carried out by my Department indicates that some 50 per cent of this is made up of people finding work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be acknowledged, however, that the number of people in the labour force is also continuing <Col N="64" /> to increase.  Young people who have completed their education, emigrants returning from abroad and considerable numbers of women formerly on home duties all seek to avail of job opportunities.</P>
    <P>A number of other specific positive measures were announced in the budget which will help unemployed persons to get back to work.  These include an increase of 5,000, to a maximum of 22,000, in the number who can participate in the back-to-work allowance scheme and the provision of an additional 3,500 places on community employment projects for unemployed persons. The back-to-work allowance scheme has proved to be very popular among unemployed persons and has been a great success in helping them to get back to work.  Since last August the number of participants in the scheme has increased by some 3,000.  Other initiatives which will continue to reduce the number unemployed include the part-time job incentive, Jobstart and educational opportunity programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The average projected live register figure is 262,000.  This demonstrates that the Government is failing to make an impact in reducing the unemployment figure, particularly the long-term unemployment figure.  The average projected live register figure is the same as that which applied when the Minister took office. While there are technical changes to the family income supplement scheme and an increase of 5,000 in the number who can participate in the back-to-work allowance scheme, there is nothing for the local employment service.  Speaker after speaker on the Government benches has mentioned the number of jobs which have been created, but the taxpayer is still funding an average live register of 262,000.  Is the Minister satisfied with this figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every other Deputy on both sides of the House, I am sure the Deputy will never be satisfied with the live register figure until it has been eliminated.  The Government has been extremely successful on the jobs front.  It has enabled 100,000 new jobs to be created and anticipates a further 45,000 new jobs to be created this year.  A number of new schemes are in place.</P>
      <P>I have also improved the family income supplement scheme which enables people with dependent children to take up work which may be low-paid.  We are spending the significant sum of £30 million for this purpose this year.  Despite the strident criticism by an ISME spokesperson on radio this morning, this is also a significant subsidy to employers as it enables them to pay low wages.  It is difficult to take criticism from an organisation such as ISME which is crying that its members cannot get people to work for what are effectively slave wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those crying that the social welfare system is a competitor of small business should look at the facts.  There is the family income supplement <Col N="65" /> scheme to help people with children to take up work while under the back-to-work allowance scheme people retain 75 per cent of their unemployment assistance payment in the first year, tapering off to 25 per cent in the third.  In the budget provision was made for the retention of adult dependant allowances primarily to help women whose spouses may be in receipt of unemployment assistance to take up work.  A variant of the unemployment assistance scheme has been introduced to enable people who take up part-time work for a period of three days per week to retain substantially their unemployment assistance payment.</P>
    <P>All these schemes assist the unemployed as well as employers who should perhaps look at the pay and conditions they are offering before offering any further criticisms of the social welfare system. It seems that much of the criticism is based on ignorance of the social welfare system and what I as Minister for Social Welfare am doing to assist the unemployed and employers.</P>
    <P>We have also introduced substantial tax relief and reform in this year's budget, which excludes people in low-paid employment from paying tax. Last year we introduced an £80 PRSI allowance which ensures nobody pays PRSI on the first £80 of income.  This year we reduced the employee's PRSI rate from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent, another significant benefit and incentive to employees to take up work.  I do not accept criticisms that this Government, or I as Minister are not doing anything to assist the unemployed to take up work.  I reject criticisms from ISME, who are constantly on radio and television complaining, whingeing and crying about how they cannot get employees.  Perhaps they should look at the wage levels they are offering.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister explain how, in these times of rapid economic growth, where we are told a record number of new jobs are created every year, there is not a corresponding reduction on the amount of money set aside for unemployment payments in the overall social welfare bill?</P>
      <P>I have read the abridged Book of Estimates for 1997 where the Minister has set aside £1 billion for dole payments in 1997.  This would appear to anybody who can do ordinary arithmetic to contradict the promises implied by this and other Ministers that a record number of new jobs are being created.  Who is getting these jobs?  Why is there no reduction in the dole bill if we are creating all of these jobs?  Is the Minister trying to tell me that nobody who is now on the live register will get a job in 1997?  Why is there a bill for £1 billion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In my original answer I indicated in part the reply to the Deputy's question. First, there was a fall of 17,000 in the live register last year, which resulted in significant savings.  The average saving per thousand who come off the live register is about £3 million.  The <Col N="66" /> estimated average live register figure for 1997 is 262,000.  That, compared to the average provided for last year, is a further decline of 17,300, between what was provided for in last year's Estimates and what is provided for in this year's.  That is a significant decline in the cost of unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh was correct when he said the taxpayer is paying for unemployment benefit and assistance.  However, roughly half of the unemployed are paid unemployment benefit, which is an insurance payment which those in receipt of it paid for when they were in employment.  They are not getting anything to which they are not entitled, although I do not suggest those on unemployment assistance are getting anything to which they are not entitled.  It is a mistake to imply that unemployment benefit is a total burden on the taxpayer because the people in receipt of it are former taxpayers, who, through their PRSI contributions insured themselves against the contingency of unemployment.  It is worth bearing this in mind while discussing social insurance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quill asked why the numbers of jobs being created in the economy are not reflected in a corresponding decline in the live register.  There are a number of factors which explain this.  First, we have net migration into this country.  Last year, 5,000 more people came back to Ireland than left the country, compared to some years ago when it was substantially the reverse.  People who went away in the 1980s and got work, experience and skills are now returning and taking up jobs available in this economy.</P>
      <P>In addition, substantial numbers of women who were formerly on home duties are accessing available jobs.  The recently published labour force survey shows that something like 70 per cent of new jobs are taken up by women, the vast majority of whom were not on the live register. There is also still a large population of young people coming through our educational system. Most of those are coming straight from education into the labour market and taking up the new jobs that are available, rather than, as in the 1980s, simply getting a plane or ferry ticket and heading abroad.</P>
      <P>There are also increasing numbers of part-time workers on the live register who are registered as available for work and are in receipt of unemployment assistance for those days when they are not working.  There are close to 30,000 of those on the live register who are not unemployed in the strict sense of the word but are in theory available for full-time employment.  It is a growing figure because the number of part-time jobs in our economy is increasing and inevitably those people will be reflected in the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also a number of people, primarily women, who, to maintain their entitlement to an old age pension, sign for credits.  Because of their domestic circumstances, they are not entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit but continue to sign on the live register to maintain their <Col N="67" /> entitlement to a pension.  There are now close to 20,000 of those on the live register, which has risen from 12,000 or 13,000 four or five years ago. These factors explain why the number of new jobs being created in the economy is not reflected in the decline in the live register to the same extent and the gap between the numbers registered and the labour force survey.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the effects of our anti-fraud campaign in the last few months that there is also an element of fraud in the system, which we are getting to grips with.</P>

      <P>I am appalled by the Minister's intemperate and unfair criticism of ISME.  He is the Minister and there is no point in attacking a body outside of the House for his failure to address the problem of the long-term unemployed. There are now about 1,000 people more on the long-term unemployed register than there were when the Minister entered office.  Apart from tinkering around in the budget by putting 5,000 people on the back-to-work allowance scheme and adjusting the FIS, which were helpful, there was no real comprehensive attack on unemployment.  The Minister will certainly do nothing for it by attacking ISME in the House in an intemperate manner.</P>

      <P>I do not have time to deliver an extended lecture to the former Minister on what the Government has done about employment and unemployment.  I have already outlined the fantastic success of this Government in the area of job creation.  More people are now at work than ever before and in the past year our population has grown by 40,000.  The Deputy is being slightly unfair, but I suppose that is to be expected from a party that has no policy at all in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of long-term unemployment is a serious one, and we do not pretend it does not exist.  We have sought to deal with it through the creation of the local employment service which is successful.  It is a painstaking process, however, because the local employment service is based on talking to and assisting the long-term unemployed on a one-to-one basis.  This means identifying what their problems are, what skills they have and what skills are required in the local economy within a reasonable distance of where <Col N="68" /> they live.  It seeks to ensure that they gain such skills through FÁS schemes or local schools.</P>
    <P>Employers in the area are then contacted to ensure they employ people identified as long-term unemployed on the live register in any vacancies they may have.  In order to assist them in doing that we provide an £80 subsidy for employers.  We also provide a back-to-work allowance for employees in addition to an enhanced family income supplement.  All these things were provided not just in this budget but in previous ones.  The concentration has been on dealing with unemployment.</P>
    <P>The facts are there for all to see, including the number of jobs created in the last two years, falling numbers on the live register and more people returning from abroad.  People were virtually expelled from the country by various Fianna Fáil Governments that presided over high emigration. I accept no criticism from the Fianna Fáil benches about job creation and dealing with the unemployed. It is an area in which they have so patently failed generation after generation.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave a graphic description of all the new people coming onto the live register in recent years for a number of different reasons.  He failed to outline, however, the number of people who, by way of retirement or death, must inevitably come off the live register as some kind of a balancing factor to those coming on to it seeking jobs.  There is still an inherent contradiction between the Government's claim to have created so many new jobs while there has been no reduction in the size of the dole bill.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my written reply of 19 December 1996 to a question from the Deputy, work associated with securing compliance with maintenance orders is an integral part of the administration of the relevant scheme which involves about 45 staff.  Six of these staff deal directly with the liability to maintain family provisions in the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>A new scheme, the one-parent family payment, which was introduced at the beginning of this month, replaces the separate schemes of deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's allowance, lone parent's allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.

The staffing levels on this work will be reassessed in the light of work plans arising from the operational review and the implementation of the new scheme.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not think that 350 liable relatives is quite a small proportion given the total number of lone parents involved in this scheme?  Does he not also think that six full-time staff for the whole Department is too small to pursue a more realistic contribution from liable relatives who are usually the fathers?  Has the Minister any plans to increase the number from six as well as increasing the amount contributed by liable relatives?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, some 45 staff are involved in administering the relevant schemes.  Six of them deal directly with the liability to maintain family provisions.  I have no proposals to increase the numbers of staff.  A review of the liable relative provisions is under way.  In addition, we are monitoring the implementation of the one parent family payment to see how it works in practice.  I do not propose to <Col N="70" /> make changes until I see exactly what way that develops.</P>
      <P>It might be useful to explain some of the statistics in this area of liable relatives provisions in order to clarify for the Deputy the fact that there is no pot of gold or goldmine available out there. Since the provisions of the 1989 Act came into force on 29 November 1990, some 19,301 cases in payment have been examined to determine liability on the part of a spouse to make contributions to the Department.</P>
      <P>The results are as follows.  Of those 19,301, some 4,962 or 26 per cent were not traceable.  Of the rest, 9,140 or 47 per cent were themselves on social welfare payments, so the possibility of obliging them to make maintenance payments was insignificant.  Of the employed and self-employed there were 5,199.  Of those, 967 were unable to pay.  There were 978 under investigation and 2,509 are to be investigated.  Determination orders were made in relation to 745, with 350 of those paying and 343 not paying.  On subsequent re-examination 52 were found to be in changed circumstances and not to have a liability. It can be seen that 26 per cent were not traceable. Of the 19,000 checked, 47 per cent were in receipt of social welfare payments.  That accounts for about 73 per cent who were not in a position to make a payment or whom it was impossible to find in order to make a claim.  I have explained the statistics regarding the balance, and £1,183,189 was collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that £1 million out of a total expenditure on lone parent allowances and contributions of the order of £300 million is quite small, and that six staff is not adequate to trace so many people?  Is the Minister content to allow the taxpayer to pick up the tab for this colossal amount of money?  In reviewing the situation, I would like the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister to play a more active role in seeking a contribution from people who have a responsibility in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reluctance in the Department of Social Welfare to pursue these matters.  However, close to half of those traced are not in a position to make maintenance payments. It must also be borne in mind that in many cases, separation may have been as a result of violence.  Are we to insist that the mother of a family be forced to make contact again with a violent husband when she may have spent years trying to get out of his clutches, in order that we can collect £1 a week from him.  There has to be balance.  We are dealing with human beings and human relationships and we have to ensure that in trying to save money we do not have the effect of making life hell for even one man or woman. Unfortunately, we have far too much violence against women in our society and it is not my intention to put the screws on through this system in such a way as to make life intolerable for the person we are supporting through the one-parent <Col N="71" /> family payment.  Nevertheless, we are not in any way complacent about checking cases and pursuing, in so far as we can, the requirement that a person make maintenance available for his spouse and children.  It should be borne in mind that up to half of those traced were not in a position to make any payment and that the administrative cost of ensuring that a payment is made once a payment order is obtained, is very high. The question arises as to whether in the long-term it would be worth the expense of trying to increase the take in this area, bearing in mind that of the 745 orders made it was only possible to implement 350 of them.  There are difficulties, and the domestic problems that may be caused for children and spouses and the administrative cost of pursuing a person perhaps as far as the United States of America or Australia in order to get a maintenance payment must be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>It is basically a matter of the attitude in the Department to the need for enforcement.  It is appalling that there are only six staff chasing thousands of such cases.  Somebody who was deemed unable to pay in 1991 or 1992 should be checked frequently and not just written off once and for all.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the reply of 19 December in which he said that it is up to the lone parent or the deserted wife in the first instance to look for maintenance.  Why should the individual have to chase an abusive partner for maintenance when she would have to hand the money over to the Department.  We are spending taxpayers' money.  The Minister has introduced new schemes lately, including the one parent family allowance. He must know that there is wholesale abuse of that scheme.  There are thousands of people pretending to be lone parents.</P>

      <P>I reject the implication in the Deputy's remarks that the problem is the attitude of the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department of Social Welfare and the Minister for Social Welfare take their responsibilities extremely seriously in terms of how we spend the resources made available to us by those who pay their taxes and social insurance contributions.  I emphasise that for the first time ever a Minister for Social Welfare has made it clear that he is not prepared to tolerate fraud, and the result of that <Col N="72" /> has been seen in the effect on the live register and on other schemes.  The liable relatives legislation was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Minister. It provided that the spouse seeking the one parent family payment must in the first instance make reasonable efforts to seek maintenance from the spouse who has departed.  If they cannot do that for any reason, we will take that into account and put the necessary procedures in train.</P>

      <P>In law, it is the responsibility of the spouse seeking support from the Department to make reasonable efforts to get maintenance.  If he or she fails to do that the Department will pursue the matter.  I have indicated the numbers of cases pursued and the results.  The most significant statistics are that close to half of those identified are in receipt of social welfare payments and are not, therefore, in a position to make a significant contribution, and a little over a quarter are not traceable.  From the personal relationships angle, a deserted or separated spouse may face risks in pursuing a spouse or former spouse who departed as a result of violence.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that people with disabilities should be in a position to avail fully of the free travel scheme. Nevertheless, the feedback from the review conducted by my Department of the transport operator services covered by the scheme indicates that there would be substantial difficulties involved in seeking to modify and adapt existing public transport vehicles to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities, particularly wheelchair users.</P>
      <P>My Department's discussions on this matter with CIÉ &mdash; the main provider of transport under the free travel scheme &mdash; suggest that, rather than seeking to adapt existing buses, it might be more appropriate to purchase new vehicles specially designed for passengers with disabilities.  Clearly, such a step would involve substantial costs.</P>
      <P>The recently published report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities makes a number of recommendations in the area of mobility and access to transport.  It recommends, for instance, that every CIÉ, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus depot should have at least one accessible bus by June 1997.  It further recommends that the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications should subsidise the additional costs of such vehicles.  I have asked my Department to consult the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications regarding the issue of accessible transport in the context of the free travel scheme and I will bring the Deputy's concerns in this area to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>My Department's free travel scheme is expected to cost a total of £32.6 million in 1997, of which private operators will receive a sum of £1.15 million.</P>

I found that quite extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the CIÉ group and the Department of Social Welfare are not only now coming to the realisation that we are not talking about modifying and adapting the existing bus vehicles. Since I raised this issue 15 months ago &mdash; I started to raise this matter with the Minister in November 1995 &mdash; I have asked constantly why CIÉ does not buy an accessible bus the next time it is purchasing.  Is it not crazy that CIÉ continues to buy inaccessible buses when there are wheelchair users, mothers with buggies, elderly people and the 470,000 to whom the Minister referred and the Department spends £32.6 million towards free travel passes?  So many of these people cannot get on buses because they are inaccessible, yet the State, in the guise of the Department of Transport, <Col N="74" /> Energy and Communications or the CIÉ group, continues to buy inaccessible buses.</P>

      <P>I am not the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  My understanding is that the issue of the design of vehicles is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment.  The Deputy might have better luck if she addressed her question in relation to the actual design of public transport to the Department of the Environment.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications obviously has responsibility for the operations of CIÉ, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>I would be as keen as the Deputy to ensure that public transport is accessible to people with disabilities.  There are various ways of doing that, as the Deputy knows.  The Vantastic operation tried the dial-a-ride approach, where a person with a disability could ring a particular service and have a bus come virtually to their doorstep and drop them off at their destination.  Perhaps that is an option which the transport companies could examine, but my primary role as Minister for Social Welfare is to ensure that people with disabilities get a free transport provision.  It is for other Departments to ensure that they oblige transport operators to make accessible vehicles available.  As I indicated, I am getting in touch with the other Ministers involved in the area and I will be happy to keep the Deputy informed of any progress I make.  Of course, the Deputy is free to make contact with the other Departments also.</P>

      <P>I think it is the Minister's responsibility because in reply to a question with regard to time restrictions he said that they do not apply in the case of mentally handicapped people attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other disabled and blind people. Talking about time restrictions is one thing, but they do not matter when people with disabilities cannot access the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred in his reply to the Commission <Col N="75" /> on the Status of People with Disabilities and the recommendation that every depot should have an accessible bus by June 1997.  Is he giving the House a commitment today that that will happen?</P>

      <P>On the collective responsibility of the Government, I find it very difficult to make any progress on behalf of people with disabilities.  If the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications says he is not responsible for the fact that buses are inaccessible and the Minister for Social Welfare, who allocates the free travel passes to the people with disabilities, says he is not responsible if the pass cannot be used because the bus is inaccessible, the Minister and his colleagues should sit down and discuss this crazy position.  His Department is giving free travel passes to people who cannot access buses and his Government colleague says it is not his responsibility that the buses are inaccessible.  That is the position.  Will the Minister raise this matter with his Government colleagues with a view to having implemented the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. Every depot should have a bus accessible to people with disabilities by June 1997.  The Minister is providing £32 million for free travel <Col N="76" /> passes to 470,000 people, many of whom cannot gain access to the buses, all of which are provided by the State.  We are talking here about State funds and Government responsibility.  We need a commitment from the Government that the recommendation will be in place by June 1997.</P>

      <P>I have replied at length to the Deputy's question and have already indicated I am in the process of raising these matters with my colleagues in Government.  When the Deputy raised these matters with me before, she asked me to speak with CIE and the other transport companies about what they might be able to do. I have done that and have reported to her on the outcome of those discussions with the transport operators.  It is clear the transport operators are not in a position to provide the services being sought.  On foot of that I will discuss the matter with my colleagues in Government.

      <P>The Minister said he has met the CIE group who have raised various issues. We do not want all the city's buses adapted and everything modified at enormous expense.  I am simply asking CIE when it is next buying a bus to buy one that is accessible.  This would not involve a huge cost factor.  It is crazy to think that in the past 15 months it has not bought buses accessible to people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>Under the Partnership 2000 agreement recently negotiated, a working party including relevant Government Departments and the social partners will be established to examine the question of equal access by women to labour market opportunities, including training, education and employment programmes.</P>
      <P>In response to my proposal, it was agreed informally by Government to invite the social partners, the National Women's Council and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed to participate in a working party with the Departments of Social Welfare and Enterprise and Employment to examine the underlying issues that need to be discussed in this matter and to make recommendations to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues involved, which have been the subject <Col N="77" /> of a recent campaign organised by the National Women's Council and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, are important and I have already put in place a range of measures designed to provide more comprehensive information and advice to women in this regard.  These measures include: an information leaflet entitled &ldquo;Signing on the Live Register&rdquo; which is now available at all my Department's local offices.  This leaflet gives information on the live register, details about unemployment payments and credited contributions and full details about employment schemes, training courses and educational opportunities and how to qualify; access to the services of my Department's locally based job facilitators to inform and advise on the various options available; advice to spouses of unemployed persons in relation to their right to sign on the live register where such spouses satisfy the conditions to do so and advice about the option which is currently available under the community employment and part-time job opportunities programme which allows a person to participate in either of these schemes in place of his or her spouse.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 recognises that women should not be penalised with regard to the availability of employment supports, including training and that they should have equal access to all labour market opportunities.  I will soon consult the various groups and I hope to set up the working group as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>There is blatant discrimination by the Department of Social Welfare against women.  It is hard to believe that in 1997 there are still many women here who cannot participate in social welfare schemes while all men can participate in them.  A lady whose husband gets unemployment assistance had a query last week about the back-to-work allowance scheme. When she got a job and tried to get the benefit of the back-to-work allowance scheme, she was informed that because she was a spouse and a dependant of her husband she could not benefit from the scheme but if her husband got the job he could benefit from it.  What kind of system is it that it discriminates so blatantly against women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can choose any scheme designed for a specific purpose and say it does not suit somebody else.  A widow's pension cannot be paid to a person who is not married.  There are conditions that apply to every scheme.  The back-to-work allowance scheme is specifically aimed at the registered long-term unemployed.  The purpose of the scheme is to seek to assist those people off the live register into work.  It may be &mdash; I do not know the details of the specific case referred to &mdash; that the lady in question may have been entitled to be on the live register.  Either because she did not know of that right or because she chose not to exercise that right, she did not qualify for the back-to-work allowance scheme.  It is impossible to devise every <Col N="78" /> scheme to suit every category and every circumstance.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements I will introduce this year, the family of the person referred to will be enabled to retain the adult dependant's allowance even though her earnings would exceed £60 per week on a tapered basis.  This will be of significant assistance to the family and the particular lady to enable her to work when she wishes without any major loss of income.  We are moving to eliminate as many of the anomalies as possible.  I am about to set up a working group to examine the ways in which access to various schemes by women can be improved.</P>
      <P>I suspect the main concern about access to schemes is access to the community employment scheme.  Already there is provision whereby spouses can swap their entitlement to participate on a community employment scheme.  It was not I who required that to participate in the community employment scheme, one must be on the live register.  That requirement was established in the past to target community employment schemes at the long-term unemployed.  Many thousands of women participate in community employment schemes because they have a live register record or are lone parents.  There are anomalies in the system but we are seeking, by way of Government decision and by way of our commitment in Partnership 2000, to address those anomalies.</P>

I say this because during good times people buy motor cars and there are, hopefully, sufficient funds for local authorities, but when times disimprove one of the first casualties is the sale of motor cars, leading to a reduction in funds.

      <P>I wish to deal with what I would describe as my area of activity.  At a time when serious crime is rampant, it would be reasonable to expect the Government to devote greater resources to the fight against it.  It would be reasonable to assume that, but I often get the feeling that we are not dealing with very reasonable people.  It is a damning indictment of the low priority the rainbow Government attaches to crime that the amount of money allocated to the Department of Justice in 1996 as a percentage of GNP was the lowest in almost 20 years.  It is extraordinary that it was less than the amount allocated by, for example, the minority Fianna Fáil Administration which was obliged to engage in public expenditure cutbacks to rescue the country from bankruptcy after the drunken sailors had rearranged the deck-chairs on the <i>Titanic</i>.  The Estimate for the Department of Justice as a percentage of GNP in 1996 was 1.68 per cent.  At the risk of boring the Minister for Tourism and Trade, I will give the percentages for other years.</P>

He would do well to remember the biblical maxim, look not for the mote in the other man's eye but for the beam in thine own.</P>
      <P>In this context the rainbow roll of honour is worth recalling for posterity.  First up and first fired was the unfortunate Deputy Phil Hogan for leaking the budget.  Hot on his heels was the telephone call made by the Minister of State, Deputy Hugh Coveney, who was consigned to the sin bin when the joker in the pack and Svengali Finlay wagged their fingers.</P>

      <P>There was no such punishment for the Minister for ethics, information and whatever you are having yourself when she invited people to pay £100 a head to have a chat with the Minister for Finance before he framed the budget.  In the letter she used the words &ldquo;a unique opportunity to meet the Minister for Finance&rdquo;. Nobody even dared to suggest the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht should resign when the independent chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission decided to get involved in fund-raising for his lord and master.  We should not forget the North Korean connection and the advertisement which was not an advertisement.  An advertisement is not an advertisement when it is placed by the Leader of Democratic Left in a Democratic Left newspaper seeking employees for his office.  That is what I call in the words of Deputy Rabbitte, this morning &ldquo;a both sides of the road with us&rdquo; strategy.</P>
      <P>Then we had Deputy Michael Noonan, who in his handling of the hepatitis C crisis extended a grave insult to the family of a deceased victim. Hot on his heels came the Minister for Justice who failed to implement a decision to delist a member of the Special Criminal Court from August 1996.  We have still to ascertain whether she was all at sea or lost in the post.  Then we had the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Ivan Yates, who was in Kavanagh's pub in Enniscorthy when the Russians were going and thought he was in Dublin Airport.  Deputy Rabbitte should take a sup of whatever they were serving that day in Kavanagh's pub to see if will help to clear his mind.  Next up was the redoubtable Deputy Lowry who thought he was under surveillance in 1995 when he could not see any detectives following him.  His latest foray into cartel land ended with the hare hunting the hound and the Taoiseach making a distinction between what happens before and after one becomes a Minister.  Deputy Rabbitte might care to reflect, prior to his next outburst, whether he should take on a machine gun with a pea shooter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to fact sheet No. 1 issued by the Department of Social Welfare in regard to the budget.  I welcome the improvement in the method of assessment of capital and savings for recipients of old age pensions.  I have called for that for some time and at a time when we have historically low interest rates it is long overdue. That element of the budget stood out, yet it has received least comment.  We have historically high buoyancy and prosperity as a result of prudent management by successive Governments, not least the disciplined efforts since 1987 by Fianna Fáil.  Nothing in this budget indicates such a level of prosperity when we talk about those who are most disadvantaged in our society.  There is tinkering with the free telephone system and <Col N="83" /> no mention of improvements to the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>I welcome the removal of the discrimination in the assessment of savings as some people might have savings of £2,000 to £3,000 for their burial. The savings were assessed at a rate of 10 per cent interest when no such rate of interest was available from any institution.  One can laud the fact that this year saw the highest increase in social welfare benefits but, in context, the vast majority of social welfare recipients got £3.  Three pounds may be extremely welcome to a social welfare recipient in Dublin where there is an excellent bus service but in rural Ireland most people have to make their own way to the post office or to the social welfare office to collect their payments.  On the other hand, this budget has ensured if they use their own cars, the cost of running them on an annual basis will erode the benefit of the 4 per cent increase.  In a comparison of percentage increases given over the past 40 years, it is one of the lowest.  Giving with one hand and taking away with the other is the hallmark of this budget.</P>
      <P>Nobody suggests that the Conference of Religious of Ireland is a supporter of Fianna Fáil. It has been critical and constructive each year in its response to the budget.  In response to this year's budget it said:</P>
      <P>Money for the better off; rhetoric for the poor.  There is something profoundly wrong with a society where resources are growing dramatically yet it refuses to give priority to tackling poverty, unemployment and exclusion. This is exactly what Government has done in its budget for 1997.  The massive new resources which are coming on stream have been allocated to those who are already better off. Meanwhile, poverty, unemployment and exclusion will persist at their present totally unacceptable levels.  This Government has the resources to impact dramatically on poverty, unemployment and exclusion.  It chose to allocate these resources to those who are already better off.  Budget '97 marks the triumph of greed over need.</P>
      <P>That is extremely strong language.  I read its previous budget responses and nothing is comparable to the language used on this occasion.  It further states:</P>
      <P>We welcome some aspects of budget '97, especially the social welfare increases, the targeting of the elderly and carers, the healthcare package and the changes in family income supplement. However, when the whole budget is evaluated it is clear that most of the resources will continue to go to the better off in Irish society.  This budget aggravates the widening of the poverty gap between the long-term unemployed and all those with jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget was framed at a time when we have never enjoyed such economic prosperity but it has had a scatter gun effect.  It is all over the place <Col N="84" /> and to suggest it is not an election budget totally denies the fact that this budget has been framed solely with an election in mind.  The middle classes have been targeted.  They received substantial improvements in the budget and prior to it, such as the abolition of service charges, residential property tax and various income tax measures.</P>
    <P>The poor in our society have done extremely badly and I have no doubt most Government members will be told so in no uncertain terms as they travel around their constituencies.  I remind the Minister for Tourism and Trade that in a recent study by the Combat Poverty Agency, Donegal and Mayo were shown to be the most deprived areas of the country.  There is a feeling of further discrimination following some of the pre-election announcements.</P>
    <P>Mr. Jim O'Leary, in an article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> last Sunday, stated:</P>
    <P>One of the reasons Irish budgets now lack drama is that their contents are routinely leaked.  Also, the Government has surrendered most of its discretion in fiscal matters: the deficit target is now set with reference to the Maastricht Treaty, while revenue and spending are determined by the &ldquo;social partners&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The 1997 budget was framed in the shadow of Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness, the agreement on economic and social policy between the Government, trade unions and employers finalised before Christmas.  It includes a three-year public sector pay deal and commits the Government to spending £525m on social welfare improvements and £1bn on tax reductions over the next three years.  The only significant areas in which the Government retained any freedom of manoeuvre were the timing and detail of the tax and welfare measures.  However, even at this level, one suspects that there were &ldquo;understandings&rdquo; with the social partners.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) was opposed to a cut in the top tax rate, and their displeasure was particularly to be avoided last Wednesday as the trade unions will next week hold a special delegate conference to ratify Partnership 2000.  Failure to ratify would be extremely embarrassing for all concerned.</P>
    <P>All this suggests that something vital in Irish politics has died: meaningful debate about how the country should be governed and the economy managed.  It has been replaced by a suffocating consensus, so much so that Partnership 2000 will form the core of the manifestos of all the mainstream political parties in the 1997 election.  If power over social and economic policy resides in Merrion Street at all, it is in the well-upholstered rooms where trade union and employer leaders congregate and in the offices of those senior civil servants who orchestrate such proceedings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> Vital decisions are made outside this House, the contributions of Opposition Members are not listened to.  Ministers ignore requests for meaningful debates.</P>
    <P>We talk about prosperity in macro economic terms, but when considered in micro economic terms, is it enjoyed equally by all sectors of society?  This is the first opportunity I have had to place on record my disgust at the Government, particularly Ministers from the west, presiding over the creation of 17,725 new jobs, 71 per cent of which were located in Dublin.  That is an appalling record of job creation in rural areas, including counties Mayo, Donegal and Clare.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, gave assurances about APC on radio today.  While I wish that company every success in Castlebar, the west will need many more such companies.  It is unacceptable that more than 1,000 young people per annum leave County Mayo to take up jobs in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We knew in 1995 that additional jobs were in the pipeline.  While representations were made to locate those industries throughout the country, week after week the Minister and the IDA announced jobs in lots of 500 or 1,000 for the Dublin area.  We are told those companies want to locate near large centres of population to avail of the necessary services.  Similar industries that located here between 1970 and 1973, during the previous industrial revolution here, were satisfied to locate in rural areas.  Why is that not the case in 1996-7?  Dublin constituencies have been targeted to placate the electorate of the Labour Party and Democratic Left, even though the majority of those jobs will be filled by people with rural roots.  Young people are forced to leave their homes and villages to avail of third level education and jobs.  Despite more than 40,000 new jobs being created in Dublin since 1990, statistics show that unemployment has decreased by only 1,000.  The majority of new jobs targeted at the Dublin area will be filled by people from rural areas.  Why can they not be created in rural areas?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for western development and the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, spoke about the necessity for communities to provide local initiatives, such as advance factories and so on.  What local initiatives were provided by the people of Blanchardstown or Swords to attract the industries that will have huge economic and social benefits for those communities? Why do rural communities have to purchase industrial landbanks and provide factories for such new industries?  It is unacceptable that the IDA should wash its hands of those important functions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, stated recently that the Government has finally realised there is an imbalance in the location of industry and it is now changing the package of incentives to ensure that industry moves out of Dublin.  We did not have to read about the Taoiseach being caught in a traffic jam for two hours on the Stillorgan dual carriageway to realise that <Col N="86" /> Dublin is growing at a pace which does not benefit its citizens.  Growth in the city needs to be controlled. Neither the city nor rural areas benefit from industry being sucked into the capital.  The Government is committed to spending millions of pounds on developing infrastructure in Dublin, such as the docks area and so on.  There is another part of the country which should also be developed.</P>
    <P>I am annoyed at the recent approach of the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, in regard to salmon fishing. We were given a commitment that a debate would take place on the report of the salmon task force.  As public representatives we should have a say in the final package of measures drawn up for those fishermen.  However, by way of regulation, the Minister has curtailed the livelihoods of many small fishermen along the western seaboard without regard for the income they will lose.  I am pleased this matter was raised at a meeting of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy today.  It is another example of the failure of the Government to support rural areas.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with some amusement to Deputy O'Donoghue's colourful contribution. Pragmatist that he is, he did not put a figure on what he called a pragmatic and practical response by the Fianna Fáil aspirants to Government.  They may get their chance early in the next century but not this year.</P>
      <P>I also listened to Deputy Hughes talking about IDA Ireland and job creation.  As a Minister I accept one can never supply all the jobs one might wish in any part of the country.  However, when IDA Ireland attracts major industrial concerns to Ireland it does so in the face of competitive packages from other countries.  The choice of location is not finally directed by the IDA but is determined by the company concerned.  It is the company's choice to locate in Blanchardstown as opposed to Westport, for example.</P>
      <P>I am happy with recent IDA Ireland results and that there will be a bias towards job targets in the regions.  Last week I presented the ISO9002 award to McHale Engineering in the small village of Kilmaine, County Mayo.  That company is involved in the manufacture of agricultural machinery.  It exports to 27 countries on four continents and employs 60 people, including its own designers, engineers and welders.  It operates in the face of international competition and succeeds despite currency fluctuations and competitive pressures.  Its product is a world leader and 35 per cent of round bailing machines sold last year in Great Britain were manufactured by McHale Engineering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an example of a small company which spends money on research and development and constantly reinvests in changing its product for <Col N="87" /> the future.  It is an outstanding example not of despondency and despair but of a company which has thrived in its original location and done so in the face of international competition with the assistance of the State agencies.</P>
    <P>We do not often take into account the creation of jobs in sectors other than the industrial sector. For example, the Mayo County manager recently released statistics to Mayo County Council, of which Deputy Hughes is a member, showing that the European Regional Development Fund spend in County Mayo from 1989-93 was £4.2 million and from 1994-96 was £46 million.  This is not money which disappears into a black hole; it reappears in the creation of jobs in services and in sectors related to industry.  If we debate the issues we must take all the elements into account.</P>
    <P>I hope the initiative taken by IDA Ireland in terms of a regional determination of jobs will yield results.  I am happy Deputy Hughes has welcomed the announcement by American Power Corporation to proceed with the Castlebar project as a stand alone project.  It was part of the company's original proposal to come to Ireland and locate in Counties Clare and Louth.  Having built a plant in the Philippines it now proposes to proceed with a stand alone operation in Castlebar.</P>
    <P>The 1997 budget is a bridge to the future linking our economic successes of recent years with our plans for the 21st century.  Cental to its design is Partnership 2000 which ensures that this approach, which was so vital in the past, will be continued.  I hope the Partnership 2000 approach will be adopted by all involved.  Without such a fundamental element it would be difficult to sustain the current economic boom.  The budget has been framed to enhance the competitiveness of an economy which is the envy of Europe and is considered the Celtic tiger by the Asian countries. We now enjoy the fastest growth rate in western Europe and clearly meet the Maastricht criteria for membership of economic and monetary union and it is the firm intention of the Government to maintain that position so that Ireland joins as a founding member.</P>
    <P>The success of the Government strategy is clear from the filibustering and inane criticisms from the Opposition which has no clearly defined economic policy.  We await the Fianna Fáil policy document on the economy and, given Deputy McCreevy's analysis on budget day, we will be waiting a while longer.  God knows what will be in it.  The new found friends of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, published Deputy Michael McDowell's plans for the economy. However, members of Fianna Fáil moved quickly against them, seeing in them an extremist and unworkable concoction.  Be they rottweilers, poodles, labradors or dalmations they do not provide an alternative option for the people.  A political marriage between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats would be doomed to irrevocable breakdown from the start.  There is <Col N="88" /> concern in the business community that the current low interest rate regime, which creates a good investment and job creation climate, would be ruptured by crises that would happen on a monthly basis in such an administration.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to note that the criticism of the Progressive Democrats came from the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  I served as Fine Gael Whip and, while I like the Progressive Democrats as people, when whips' agreements were made the decisions were not adhered to because of their craving for publicity or the unsuitability of the decision made to the general body of the Progressive Democrats.  If that is their deep-rooted approach to partnership it will not work in Government.</P>
    <P>The overall strategy in this year's budget will benefit development of the tourism and trade sectors which are experiencing an unprecedented boom.  The budget also contains specific measures in the areas of taxation and social welfare which will help to create employment.  The tourism sector had another record performance in 1996.  The total number of overseas visitors is expected to be up by 10 per cent to a level of about 4.6 million. In line with this increase in numbers, visitor expenditure is estimated at £1.45 billion, a 12 per cent increase.  Our objectives are to create 35,000 new jobs and to have an annual revenue yield of about £2.25 billion by the end of 1999.  This will mean bringing in between five and six million visitors on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Current market indications are that the British market will send us more than 2.2 million visitors for the first time in history.  The US and mainland European markets are also likely to produce particularly strong performances.  I am heartened that more than 700,000 American visitors came to our shores.  This is an important market and it continues to improve.  These are excellent annual results and can be attributed to strong consumer demand stimulated by sustained marketing and targeted advertising.</P>
    <P>The role of Bord Fáilte has changed to that of a sophisticated international marketing agency and the new Tourism Brand Ireland follows from analysis and research carried out by Bord Fáilte. The new brand will pay huge dividends in the future.  Consequently, the tourism industry must respond to that dividend in terms of facilities, quality, personnel and competitiveness.  Allied to our uniqueness as a people, the importance of this development speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Tourism is now a major contributor to the wealth of the nation and generates 8 per cent of GNP.  In employment terms, it sustains 107,000 jobs.  The real success of 1996 was the growth in Ireland's share of the world tourism market.  The average rate of tourism growth in Europe was 3 per cent but Ireland managed a double digit increase.  That means both the product and the price have entered a happy confluence which attracted the customers.  This year, I am expecting the industry to sustain these levels of growth.  For <Col N="89" /> the first time in our history, I expect in excess of five million visitors.</P>
    <P>The industry is buoyant and faces the future with confidence.  That is not to say there are no problems confronting us.  We must beware of complacency, competitiveness, seasonality and the need to extend the season.  I recently launched a nationwide music festival &mdash; entitled &ldquo;Celtic Flame&rdquo;&mdash; which was devised by the Tourism Council as an off-season attraction to lead into the St. Patrick's week festival.</P>
    <P>As with overall economic growth, tourism growth does not happen by accident and cannot be expected to continue unless well thought out comprehensive strategies are in place.  A number of these were introduced in 1996.  First, there was the launch of Tourism Brand Ireland.  The development of the brand represented a response to an identified need to move towards a strategic consumer marketing approach, focused on long-term yield and return on investment.  In other words, bigger spenders spending more money in the economy.  Our tourism performance in recent years benefited enormously from the removal of disadvantages in access and related costs compared to competitors.  Other developments which contributed to growth were the peace dividend, the investment to update our product and the fashionability of Ireland internationally thanks to our music, literature, film, theatre and sport.  One of the consequences of Bord Fáilte's research was that, were there a return to permanent peace in Ireland, an additional five million British people would seriously consider holidaying here on an annual basis.  It would not be desirable to have the five million visit at once but an annual increase of 10 per cent would provide strong growth in the economy.  It was widely acknowledged that further major increments of growth could not be driven by such developments and a more assertive, targeted and integrated approach to market development is required.</P>
    <P>Tourism Brand Ireland builds on two key identified tourism assets &mdash; accessible unspoiled pastoral scenery and interaction with friendly engaging people.  This is the foundation of the new marketing approach.  It is sufficiently different from the product benefits offered by competitors to make the more discerning and higher yielding tourist want to visit Ireland repeatedly, and as such, is part of a deliberate strategic policy to ensure growth primarily from more spending per tourist rather than increasing tourist numbers.  In other words, we do not want to try to continually increase numbers without forgetting that yield is all important in terms of economic development.</P>
    <P>Second, a comprehensive programme for the use or roll out of the brand is being put in place and already the new logo is starting to become a familiar feature of tourism promotional material and publications.  The Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative, for example, the main consumer advertising partnership, composed of representatives of Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the industry North and South, has <Col N="90" /> committed its resources behind the deployment of the brand.  I expect and am encouraging the industry generally to row in fully behind the brand to ensure its effectiveness in successfully shaping the promotion and marketing of tourism well into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative &mdash; OTMI.  This international marketing vehicle, which followed from the 1994 US Marketing Initiative, has been a singularly unique success.  It has brought together the public sector tourism bodies and more than 50 commercial investors from the industry in a fruitful partnership, and significant increases in tourism benefits have resulted from its carefully orchestrated advertising media campaigns in the British, US, German and French markets.  Furthermore, the industry's hands-on involvement through its participation on the board and sub-committees of the OTMI has provided valuable assistance and input and genuinely fostered a spirit of understanding and co-operation.  This type of co-operative marketing effort is to be encouraged at all levels.</P>
    <P>I stated previously that tourism is the one sector that, irrespective of one's political affiliations or religious beliefs, can benefit both economies, North and South.  It is a coming together of peoples in the interest of peoples.  Irrespective of the political situation, this is one sector that has benefited both economies.  In that context, the OTMI involves the entire island of Ireland for everyone's overall benefit.</P>
    <P>Third, the Domestic Tourism Marketing Initiative, which the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, launched in February 1996, is specifically targeted at developing shoulder and off-season domestic tourism.  A sum of £500,000 was secured towards the cost of developing a home holiday initiative with co-financing from the industry to encourage greater marketing of home holidays.  This is worth hundreds of millions of pounds per year.  The Minister of State established a high level working group comprising representatives of the tourism industry, the relevant State tourism agencies and officials of the Department of Tourism and Trade to develop the initiative on a partnership basis.  The working group has developed an integrated national marketing programme to accelerate growth in home holidays, with particular emphasis on the shoulder and off-season periods.  A further £500,000 was invested in this for 1997 and the campaign will be relaunched by the Minister of State on 10 February.</P>
    <P>CERT, the State tourism agency, launched an initiative to promote career recruitment and succeeded in ensuring that all places in the 1996-97 programmes have been fully taken up.  Also planned is a national campaign for this spring to target 6,000 further recruits, which will be considerably boosted by employment initiatives currently being undertaken by employer bodies.  In that context, it is important to note the Irish Hotels Federation introduced a code of ethics and practice with the understanding that this is <Col N="91" /> an industry as distinct from a lightweight, short-term, low paid operation with no career prospects for its employees.  It is an industry involving people and the presentation of the best of our country.  In that sense, I am glad there have been moves from within the industry and CERT to respond to that traditional perception.  I hope this campaign will prove fruitful in making young people understand that careers in the industry offer good pay and conditions, long-term prospects, promotional outlets, etc.  I want the industry to be perceived in that way and not be just a romantic illusion as are other industries.  Tourism, which employs 107,000 people and will soon increase its capacity in that regard, should have that status as an industry.</P>
    <P>Last year, a new company was formed &mdash; Feilte Dhuibh Linne Teoranta &mdash; to revamp the St. Patrick's Day National Festival in Dublin.  The reaction was very positive but the new festival was not perfect.  This year, plans are already advanced for an even better and extended event in March.  The Department provided a Supplementary Estimate of £100,000 in 1996 to assist with marketing and other organisational costs associated with the 1997 festival.  A further £100,000 will be advanced by the Department to the festival in 1997.  St. Patrick's Day falls on Monday this year and, therefore, the festivities will commence on Friday night and finish on 17 March.  This is a very good opportunity to market a modern image of Ireland as TV and media coverage is international.</P>
    <P>It is time we recognised that, unlike many other countries, we have a national day which provides an outstanding opportunity to present a week long festival of the best of Irish.  We should not be under any illusions that, by the year 2000, St. Patrick's Day festivals in Ireland will be the best in the world.  This will present an outstanding opportunity to the Irish diaspora to return to Ireland to witness its transformation from a hovel ridden, poverty stricken country 150 years ago to a modern, energetic, committed and dynamic country preparing for a new century.  Great support for this idea has come from Irish business and I look forward to the festival's success.</P>
    <P>In framing the budget the Government took steps to ensure the maintenance of a dynamic, low inflation economy aimed at maintaining growth in sustainable employment and improving our competitiveness.  Building on the economic successes of recent years the budget will further promote enterprise, reward work and strengthen social solidarity &mdash; the Minister for Finance has made that clear on a number of occasions. Important initiatives include further reductions in corporation tax, reduced employers' PRSI, new provisions for firms to claim for certain pre-trading expenses, improvements in capital acquisitions tax and concessions to workers on income tax and PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>In regard to corporation tax, I am confident the reduction to 36 per cent from 38 per cent and <Col N="92" /> from 30 per cent to 28 per cent on the first £50,000 of taxable income will further improve significantly the competitiveness of our exporters. The Government has achieved a real reduction of nearly one third in the corporation tax rate for SMEs which play an important role in our economy and which are increasingly the focus of our trade promotion supports.  The reductions in PRSI and PAYE will benefit industry significantly. These, together with the back-to-work-allowance scheme, will encourage companies to invest in employment and should help improve the work ethic.</P>
    <P>Controlling public expenditure is essential to the achievement of the Government's medium term budgetary goals.  We must ensure that our public expenditure programmes give value for money and are directed at areas of need which have the ability to create wealth and employment. In this context my Department, as part of the Government's Strategic Management Initiative, has recently published its Strategic Management Statement 1997-1999.  From a trade perspective our stated mission is to optimise Ireland's earnings, thereby increasing employment and wealth creation.  Our trade target is to achieve growth in exports of indigenous goods and services, other than food, to £4.5 billion per annum by 1999.  The targets provide for a special focus on the indigenous sector and emphasise the importance of continuing in our efforts to increase our share of trade with Europe and decrease dependency on the UK market, which is extremely important to us.  I am confident we will achieve these targets with the help of this budget, which will create the necessary competitive environment for our exporters.</P>
    <P>In this context I am aware that our exporters to France and Germany are experiencing some problems at the moment due to the strength of the punt compared to the franc and the deutschmark. Exchange rate problems have always been and will continue to be a factor in international trade.  Last year, for example, we experienced further difficulties in the sterling market.  ABT, the trade board, set up a specific task force to look at companies experiencing difficulties in this regard and the results prove the benefit of setting up such a task force.  On a sombre note, industry cannot expect the State to act as insurer in these situations and exporters will have to gear themselves for dealing with such problems as they arise.  However, the advent of the single currency block will improve the situation for our exporters in a number of markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in presenting his budget to the House, outlined in detail the economic and social achievements of the Government since 1994.  For example, during 1996 we achieved export growth of 11 per cent in the first eight months of the year, total employment increased by 45,000 over the year to April, GNP grew at 6 per cent, well above the European average of 1.75 <Col N="93" /> per cent, and inflation averaged only 1.6 per cent compared to the EU average of 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>During Ireland's Presidency, progress was made on EU external trade policy in the context of the inaugural ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation, EU-US relations, Asia-Europe relations and EU-Canada relations. One of the primary objectives of the EU's external trade policy was to ensure a strong EU contribution to the ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation, held in Singapore in December, and to achieve an outcome reflecting the Union's priority of consolidating and developing the multilateral trade system.  This was achieved with the EU playing a very active role in the process leading to the adoption of a ministerial declaration of the WTO which addressed the issues relevant to the further strengthening of the multilateral trade system.</P>
    <P>As vice-chairman of that group I attended 38 meetings during that period and had to resume the Council of Ministers of Trade of the EU on eight successive occasions.  It was an outstanding example of partnership and analysis by the countries of Europe in that they were given up-to-date information on what was happening and had time to analyse it and give their views.  That meant that Europe was in a very strong position to work with Commissioner Brittan in getting the declaration through the WTO.</P>
    <P>In addition, a ministerial declaration on trade in information technology products was adopted by a number of WTO members, including the European Union.  This provides for the progressive elimination of customs duties on agreed information technology products by the year 2000. Deputies may not be aware that two thirds of the people living on this planet have never made a phone call.  This market is worth $500 billion and the fact that we have the sophisticated equipment and our people are educated to do the work increases Ireland's attractiveness internationally. We have the capacity to become a very big partner in information technology, which is a major market of the future.</P>
    <P>In regard to EU-US relations, significant progress was made on the New Transatlantic Agenda launched in Madrid in December 1995.  Highlights include the Information Technology Agreement which, when finalised, promises to liberalise more than $500 billion in trade annually, agreement in principle on a mutual recognition agreement on conformity assessment with formal negotiations to be concluded by 31 January 1997 and initialling of a customs co-operation and mutual assistance agreement.  Significant progress was also made on Asia-Europe relations in the context of followup activities to the first Asia-Europe meeting &mdash; ASEM &mdash; and preparation for the ASEM ministerial meeting in Singapore in February 1997 which will be attended by the Tánaiste.  From a trade perspective, the aim is to reinforce economic dialogue and co-operation between the two regions, with particular emphasis on the facilitation and promotion of two-way trade and <Col N="94" /> investment flows.  An EU-Canada summit was held on 17 December 1996 which endorsed the EU-Canada action plan and accompanying political declaration.</P>
    <P>This budget will lead to a stronger, more competitive Irish economy.  I am confident the various measures aimed at promoting enterprise, rewarding work and strengthening social solidarity, enshrined in the budget and in the new programme, Partnership 2000, will improve the well-being of all in our society.</P>
    <P>One feature of the budget which is of particular importance to me and my county is the recognition by the Government of the valuable entity of the regional technical college campus in Castlebar. A sum of £600,000 has been provided to renovate the facility already leased by the Department of Education at the old St. Mary's Hospital, Castlebar.  When work is completed next year we will have a state of the art, fully renovated, outstandingly equipped campus and I have no doubt the quality of the courses will stand up to any test.  The ultimate test of a regional technical college is the quality of its courses and their attractiveness to students.  One may spend a fortune on buildings, but if the quality of courses is not recognised by students it is of little value.  I am very happy with the allocation of £600,000 in 1997 and whatever money is required to complete that section of the building will be made available in 1998.</P>

      <P>One of the tests of this budget is whether, if this was not an election year, the Government would have introduced such a budget.  The answer would have to be no.  The budget is for one year only.  There is no medium or long-term planning, no curb on public spending and no targeting of available resources.  On a parochial note, there is no regard for the Border region.</P>
      <P>The seeds of the boom in the economy were planted in 1987 when the Fianna Fáil minority Government took hold of the country's finances, which were totally out of control following a Fine Gael-Labour Government.  I was proud to be a member of that Government which took difficult decisions in the national interest and I am proud to see the fruits of the work of that Government, the booming economy of recent years.</P>

    <P>Despite the boom there has not been any reduction in the national debt since the Government came to power.  It made the point that the national debt was reduced for the first time in 1996, but the reality is that since the Government came to power two years ago the national debt has increased by almost £700 million at a time when the economy is booming and the tax take has been very large, particularly in 1996.  The <Col N="95" /> Government set targets for public spending for its period in office.  Its spending is already £500 million over that target.  The targets set allowed for increases higher than the rate of inflation in the three budgets it introduced.  That adds up to one thing only, that it is not possible for a Government made up of three parties with varying ideologies to set spending targets and adhere to them. If the Government is so reckless in good times when there is plenty of money in the Exchequer, it is questionable what it would be like if it were to continue in power for the next five years, particularly if there were a downturn in the economy. We will face a problem in 1999 when the present tranche of Structural Funds will run out. We do not know the level of funds we will receive after that.  All observers accept that we will not receive anything in the region of the funding we received on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>The Government does not appear to have made any provision for the rapid increase in the cost of public sector pensions.  I understand the cost will increase from £560 million to £1.4 billion over a short period.  That is something the Government needs to address as pensions are paid out of day to day funding.</P>
    <P>The Government made great play of reducing income tax by 1p in the pound from 27p to 26p. That tax reduction was introduced by a Labour Minister after three years in office.  That can be compared to tax reductions made by two former Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance, our leader, Deputy Ahern, and prior to him, Deputy Reynolds, who over a similar period in much more difficult times were able to reduce the lower rate of income tax by 8p in the pound from 35p to 27p and the higher rate from 52p to 48p.  The Government has nothing to boast about in terms of what it has done for taxpayers, particularly the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to increase excise duty on petrol and diesel is irresponsible, given the massive amount of tax collected in 1996.  Two serious consequences are that it reduces our competitiveness in business, which could be costly in terms of job losses, and it undermines the economy of the Border region.  The cost of transport is high.  This increase is a tax on jobs, it reduces our competitiveness and it also has an impact on tourism at a time when we are trying to attract tourists.  That increase was not necessary because the Exchequer was awash with money and collected over £300 million more than was budgeted for last year.</P>
    <P>The decision is particularly serious for the Border economy.  The Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, earlier today referred to a time when petrol stations were closed leaving skeleton towns along the Border.  That was the position in 1982-7 when a Fine Gael-Labour Government were in power and if it continues in power that will be the position again.  The Government had closed the gap to the extent that many people in the north travelled south to buy petrol, but following the <Col N="96" /> increase in the budget and the difference in prices they do not consider it worthwhile travelling.</P>
    <P>The Government did not learn anything from what happened in 1982-7.  It was interesting to listen to the Taoiseach tell us last Wednesday, the day the budget was introduced, that he could not understand why we were concerned about the increase of 11.5p in the price of a gallon of petrol. It would be interesting to compare the Taoiseach's failure to understand our concern about that increase with what our leader, Deputy Ahern, when Minister for Finance said about excise duty on petrol when he introduced the 1992 budget.  He said:</P>
    <P>The wide gap in petrol prices between here and Northern Ireland has been an important factor in cross-Border fiscal shopping in the past.  ... Reducing tax differences clearly has a role to play in promoting an even closer alignment. Accordingly, I propose to reduce the tax on petrol by 2p per litre or 9p per gallon.  ... The timing of this change should also provide a useful boost to the important tourist sector.</P>
    <P>Those are the words of a man who understands the implications of increasing the price of petrol and diesel.</P>
    <P>The Government is not committed to the Border region.  It has not shown any sign of a commitment to it since it came to power.  For the first time in the history of the State there is not a Minister or a Minister of State from a Border county. The United States and the European Union are committed to the regeneration of economies in the counties on both sides of the Border.  The Washington Conference, the Pittsburgh Conference and European funding for peace and reconciliation all worked to help the regeneration of the Border economy.  The Government has not done anything to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place.</P>
    <P>My constituency covers a number of Border counties.  Out of 14,081 jobs in overseas companies created here in 1996, 22 were located in Cavan and 25 in Monaghan.  Given that 107 jobs in overseas companies were lost in those two counties, there has been a net loss of 60 such jobs.  That is appalling.  A Government that stands over that record, at a time when the United States and the European Union are putting support structures in place to help regenerate the Border economy, should be ashamed.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for the Environment to build a proper road structure.  A proper east-west road should be built from Dundalk to Sligo.  The road system could be compared to the spokes of a wheel in that they all link up with Dublin.  There is not a proper east-west road north of the Galway road.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education should sanction the provision of an outreach third level facility in Cavan-Monaghan to ensure a pool of graduates, say in electronics, who could take up jobs in hightech industry.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Tourism and Trade <Col N="97" /> is present.  He and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment should address the factors underlying the statistics I gave to ensure that a fair share of jobs is located in those counties.  The Minister for Finance should co-ordinate the activities of the various agencies to ensure proper results are achieved from funds under INTERREG, the Delors Package and the various agencies that promote the economies of Border counties and that it will not be the case that out of 14,081 jobs created in overseas companies only 22 and 25 will be located in Cavan and Monaghan respectively.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that money was not made available for investment in small towns.  Successive Governments have been committed to decentralisation. While this policy has worked well along the west coast and in Cavan town it seems at county level there is a conscious policy to centralise everything in the county town.  The Army barracks in Cootehill, for example, was closed and personnel moved to a new barracks in Cavan town.  The ESB offices were also closed.  There is an urban renewal scheme in Monaghan town.  The Minister for Finance should introduce tax concessions to allow derelict buildings in small towns to be refurbished.</P>
    <P>There is no responsibility on the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to look at the ESB's rationalisation programme.  Why did the ESB negotiate with a commercial bank and not with An Post to collect electricity supply payments?</P>
    <P>I welcome the improved capital allowance for farm pollution control but I am disappointed support has not been provided to help small farmers control pollution.  I am also disappointed that the control of farmyard pollution scheme abolished by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has not been reintroduced.  The BSE crisis has been badly handled by the Government since the announcement in the House of Commons on 20 March.</P>
    <P>I have talked at length about group water schemes since the Minister for the Environment made the decision to abolish water charges in urban areas, ignoring the interests of those living in rural areas in the process.  This was followed by the announcement that responsibility for administration of the schemes would be transferred to local authorities which do not have sufficient resources to meet their present capital or current expenditure needs.  Those involved in group water schemes do not want local authorities to assume this responsibility as they will have the power to place a limit on the volume of water supplied and will be able to charge farmers any figure they like.  In seeking to correct his monumental blunder &mdash; nothing unusual for the Labour Party which has nothing to offer those living in rural Ireland &mdash; the Minister has succeeded only in making matters worse.  It is not too late, however, for him to sit down with representatives of group water schemes to work out a fair and equitable scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government missed a great opportunity to <Col N="98" /> address many of the critical issues facing society. Because of the measures taken by Fianna Fáil in 1987 and following years, it inherited a booming economy and higher than expected tax returns. Because of the varying ideologies of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left, it fluffed this opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the spirit of Joyce is reflected in the opening paragraph of the Budget Statement delivered by the Minister for Finance. He stated: &ldquo;It is a budget about change, compassion and confidence&rdquo;.  The only connection between these three words is that they all begin with the letter &ldquo;c&rdquo;.  It seems the need for alliteration was much more important than the reality.  It was appropriate that the Minister should include a budget taken from one of Joyce's literary works, it was as relevant as some of the figures included in the Budget Statement.</P>
      <P>On the expenditure figures, insufficient emphasis has been placed on the Minister's Houdini act. He has managed to keep the figures down in a clever way.  As everybody knows, with sleight-of-hand one can prove almost anything with mathematics. The Minister will take in £60 million in car tax and give approximately the same amount to local authorities in rate support grants.  To prove that he had not increased expenditure he reduced the length of the cycle and the expenditure figures would look much smaller and nobody would notice that the revenue figure had dropped by the same amount.  This is a good trick to hide the fact that expenditure is rising and people are getting little value for money.</P>
      <P>In many ways this is a budget for urban Ireland. While problems are being experienced in urban Ireland, if one analyses the figures, one will see it is not the people living in poorer areas who are gaining but the privileged in society.  For the second year in a row it is the choice projects in the centre of Dublin which will benefit most. They will not do much, however, for those trying to eke out a living in the huge corporation estates on the periphery of the city and are of no importance to the people who live outside it.</P>
      <P>Whatever else it may be about, this is not a budget about change, it is about giving away a fixed sum of money and giving something to everybody.  It is a damage limitation exercise to ensure everybody feels they have been given something extra but there are no reform measures.  There is a need for change in the tax and PRSI systems.  One does not pay levies up to a certain ceiling, but once one goes above it by £1 levies are paid on the entire amount.  Will the Minister for Finance explain the rationale behind this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system is full of anomalies.  Year after year I have shown how many of these crinkles can be ironed out with revenue neutral measures.  What is annoying is that, although everybody nods in agreement, the following year the Minister for Finance will add to the number of anomalies. This year there is a new twist in what is already <Col N="99" /> a complicated system.  Most ordinary people do not understand how it works.  There is an obligation on us to ensure it is fair and understandable. It is not reasonable to expect ordinary people to be <i>au fait</i> with every peculiar rule and act as if they were computers.</P>
    <P>The interface of social welfare and tax has become so complicated that I came across a case recently where, through a lack of knowledge of the social welfare code on behalf of an accountant and a tax misunderstanding, the person had to pay £1,300 too much in tax.  I do not blame either side for what happened but the reality is that there is a hugely complicated list of what is taxable and what is not.  Unemployment assistance is not, unemployment benefit and disability benefit are partly, and pensions are totally.  If I go from disability benefit to an invalidity pension, in one different portions are taxable and in the other the whole income is.  In trying to rationalise and make up our minds which it is, and whether all means tested allowances are not taxable and all other benefits are, we have reached a halfway house between everywhere.  Lone parent's allowance is taxable and unemployment assistance is not.  If we put most Deputies to a written examination on what is taxable, I doubt if too many of us would pass.  We are then told this is a budget of change.</P>
    <P>Eighty or ninety per cent of people do not have accountants to take care of their tax affairs.  They try to make an honest tax return and want to understand the answers they get back.  It seems to me that it is simple to construct a tax system that 80 or 90 per cent of the ordinary workers, including the self-employed but more importantly the PAYE worker, can understand.  Why not rationalise it?  Most of these steps can be taken if one puts one's mind to it.  It is easy to model revenue in neutral ways if that is what is needed.  Every year we go through the charade of talking about these issues and every year there is a refusal by the Government to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>We have created an extraordinary social welfare system.  I am delighted the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, is here because he has a responsibility towards the farming community.  There is no point in going to Brussels and negotiating extra headage grants and ewe premiums if every pound of that which goes to the farmers in my constituency winds up in the pockets of the Department of Social Welfare. That is the system that exists.  Do not tell me that the farmer with five, ten or 15 suckler cows or 50 or 100 ewes can survive and raise a family without some assistance from the State.</P>
    <P>I have a question which needs to be answered in a fair and honest manner.  How can the Government explain and justify the following? After the increase in social welfare, a farmer and his wife with one dependent child, living on a farm where the assessed income is £115.38 per week, would be entitled to the princely sum of £5.38.  On the other hand, a single parent family with one dependent child with the same farm <Col N="100" /> income of £115.38 per week would be entitled to £82.70 lone parent's allowance per week.  Two people will be £77 per week better off than three. That is the situation the Minister has created since 1 January 1997.  Can he explain the logic of that and how he expects three people to live on £77 per week less than two people can?  This is not something he has inherited, which is normally the song of this Government, but is something he has created.  I am not complaining about what lone parents receive because they need every penny of it.  However, I cannot understand why married couples are so penalised, particularly those who are self-employed.</P>
    <P>There was huge reform when the problem regarding dependent spouses working was recognised. At the moment when someone goes over the threshold of £60 and the dependent spouse is working, they lose the dependent spouse allowance which, after increases this year, is £40 per week.  If someone goes up a pound they lose £40 and half the child dependant allowance.  The Minister came up with the big reform of raising the threshold to £90, on a tapered basis.  The logic of this should be thought about, particularly in the context of what he did, quite rightly, for single parent families.  A person gets an extra £30 and it tapers off.  When they get to £90, they lose £40 plus £6.60 for every child.  Who will go from £60 to £90 in wages, to lose £10 plus £6.60 for every child?  It is ludicrous and we wonder why people, when they reach the £60 threshold, will not work for less money.  The increase to £90 is not doing any good because a person is still losing money. This is the 120, 150 to 300 per cent tax rate we have built into our system.  Nothing was done this year for the marginal rate of tax those in the exemption limits pay, who are mainly either old people or those with big families.  We are still taxing them at 40 per cent of the marginal rate, even though we reduced the basic standard rate of tax to 26 per cent.  Why was that not reduced?</P>
    <P>I must comment on the petrol price increase announced in the budget and the changes proposed by the Minister for the Environment to pay for the abolition of domestic water and sewerage charges.  Most people in rural Ireland do not have public sewerage and only half have public water. If the Government thinks it can take over the group water schemes for £5 million, it will be waiting until the cows come home.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell me, as a member of Galway County Council, when we have taken over these water schemes &mdash; if we ever get around to doing it, as we need £70 million in Connemara alone to bring our water schemes up to standard &mdash; where we will get the money to maintain them?  Because the Government in Dublin hid and ran scared, it has left rural Ireland to pick up the tab.  I am disappointed that the rural Members in Government bolted and allowed rural Ireland to pay for something they were giving to urban Ireland.  Rural Ireland will pay and it will not have the advantage of the services and this Government will be remembered for it.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for getting a rousing reception for the start of my speech.  I have been a Member of the House for the past 16 years and I have yet to see a more popular, balanced or progressive budget than this one. There is no doubt the budget is exactly what the country needs to maintain the overall record growth the economy is experiencing in Europe.</P>
      <P>The economy continues to perform exceptionally well with output growth of 7.25 per cent last year compared to an OECD average of 2.5 per cent.  This strong growth was underpinned by low inflation and a low interest rate environment.  The expansion in the economy is indeed impressive, especially in the context of a relatively weak performance in the European economy and the negative impact of the BSE crisis on the beef industry.</P>
      <P>The underlying strength of the Irish economy has been achieved by a focused approach to fiscal, monetary, income and employment policies by this Government.  One of the most tangible, and certainly most important, benefits of this growth has been the increase of 50,000 in the numbers at work last year.  The outlook for this year appears good with output growth of 6.5 per cent forecast.  Inflation is likely to remain moderate and domestic demand should continue to grow.  On the employment front, it is expected that the total at work will rise by a further 45,000 in the year as a whole.</P>
      <P>As now seems imminent, the successful conclusion of Partnership 2000 provides the framework for social and economic progress and cohesion over the next three years.  The agreement with the farm organisations, which forms part of Partnership 2000, provides a basis for ensuring the continued strength and competitiveness of the agri-food sector over the coming years.</P>
      <P>The overriding concern in the short term is to ensure that the high animal health status of Irish produce is maintained, and that consumer confidence in livestock products is strengthened both at home and in our important export markets. Therefore, we have agreed in Partnership 2000 that the computerised animal monitoring system currently being developed in my Department will be fully implemented in 1998.</P>
      <P>The production of low cost and high quality products that can compete in the more liberalised trading environment of the future is essential. The long-term competitiveness of the agri-food sector will depend crucially on attracting new entrants to farming, providing the necessary training, advice and research back up to all farmers, and encouraging necessary investment throughout the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partnership 2000 contains commitments to improve existing arrangements for education and training for farmers.  It also makes provision for <Col N="102" /> an independent review of advisory services to ensure an effective and efficient delivery of Teagasc programmes in this area.  Incentives to encourage new entrants into farming include, among other things, a commitment to seek the continuation of the early retirement scheme after 1997.  The agreement also provides for significant tax concessions to encourage investment and the early transfer of land.</P>
    <P>The relatively high age profile of Irish farmers has been a persistent obstacle to structural change within the agricultural sector over many years.  I am, therefore, pleased that this year's budget has ensured that a coherent set of tax incentives will be in place, which will greatly assist the entry of young people in to farming and encourage investment among farmers generally.</P>
    <P>As regards farm taxation, the targeted set of measures agreed in the context of Partnership 2000 and announced in the budget includes the renewal of the special stamp duty relief for transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers for a further three years.  This concession will save young farmers some £4.5 million in a full year and will continue to act as an important incentive to the early transfer of land and, in turn, to structural change within the farming sector.</P>
    <P>Farmers will also benefit from the increase in agricultural relief for capital acquisitions tax from 75 per cent to 90 per cent for those transferring land, buildings, livestock and machinery with effect from last Thursday.  This and other incentives will further ease the transfer costs for farmers.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the investment needs of young farmers and, therefore, I consider that the continuation of 100 per cent stock relief for young trained farmers for a further two years will continue to benefit new entrants who have to invest in building up stock numbers.  All farmers can continue to avail of the 25 per cent stock relief which will release resources for productive investment for the upgrading and replacement of facilities necessary to reduce production costs and enhance efficiency.</P>
    <P>Another important Government objective is to maintain an environmentally sound farming sector. During the discussions on the new programme, the farm organisations pressed strongly for the introduction of incentives for investment in necessary on-farm pollution control works.  For some years I have been pressing for this in successive budgets.  Some incentives were needed to encourage farmers within the tax net to undertake pollution related investment.</P>
    <P>The commitment in Partnership 2000 to improve the existing capital allowances available to farmers for such investment has now been honoured. The budget has provided for a special one year accelerated capital allowance of 50 per cent of the expenditure incurred on necessary pollution control measures up to an expenditure limit of £20,000 with the balance of expenditure written off over the following seven years.  This <Col N="103" /> concession is favourable to farmers and I am confident that it will also make a significant contribution to the protection of the rural environment in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The commitment of small to medium-sized farmers to environmental protection is clearly demonstrated by the strong uptake of the control of farm pollution scheme which had attracted some 18,500 participants at the time of its suspension in 1995.  To ensure that the momentum of on-farm pollution control investment is maintained over the coming years we agreed, in the context of Partnership 2000, to give priority to the reintroduction of the control of farm pollution scheme, along with the dairy hygiene scheme, if additional funds become available in the midterm review of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Some other budget changes of benefit to farmers are also worth highlighting.  The decision to increase the VAT refund rate again this year to 3.3 per cent from 2.8 per cent last year at a full year cost of £14.1 million will provide a welcome boost to incomes of farmers who are not generally registered for VAT but who are required to pay VAT on their inputs.</P>
    <P>Tax paying farmers will also share the benefits of what has been, by any standards, a good budget.  A further cut in the standard rate of income tax from 27 per cent to 26 per cent, coupled with the widening of bands, increased personal allowances and an increase in the income tax exemption limit should all put more money into farmers' pockets this year.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the integrated package of measures for the farming sector in this year's budget should boost, income, promote on-farm investment, particularly necessary investment in environmental protection, and help to improve the structure of the Irish agricultural sector.  The new measures, along with the renewal and improvement of incentives for investment and the orderly transfer of land, are important elements in the drive for improved competitiveness in the sector.</P>
    <P>The food industry, and agri-business generally, will benefit along with the industrial sector from the general lightening of the tax burden in this budget.  Specifically, the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 38 per cent to 36 per cent, and from 30 per cent to 28 per cent on the first £50,000 of company income, will reduce tax on non-manufacturing activities.  The increase in the threshold for lower rate employers' PRSI will also be very welcome to agri-business.  Companies in this sector will also benefit from the substantial reduction in the &ldquo;tax wedge&rdquo; which will be achieved by the new income tax and PRSI rates for employees.</P>
    <P>In addition to the £25 million special package of tax measures for agriculture in the budget, the Estimate for Agriculture, Food and Forestry provides for expenditure totalling £763 million in 1997 of which £376 million is from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The overriding concern with competitiveness <Col N="104" /> and environmental protection in this year's budget is also reflected in the Estimate.  Some key features of this year's Estimate include provision of more than £101 million for REPS in 1997, a year on year increase of almost 80 per cent; provision of almost £63 million for the early retirement scheme, an increase over 1996 of 43 per cent; and a sum of almost £50 million provided for on-farm investment.  The Estimate also provides for a 56 per cent increase in the grant level for institutional research and development in the food sector and reaffirms my commitment to enhancing the long-term competitiveness of one of our most important industries.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of farm income in 1996 was a creditable performance against the backdrop of the BSE crisis.  Inevitably, the benefits were not distributed equally across all sectors with very strong growth in output values in the pigs, sheep and cereal sectors, a very marginal decline in milk output values and, as expected, a sharp decline in output value in the beef sector.</P>
    <P>Last year was, by any standards, a very difficult one for beef producers.  However, every effort was made to maintain stability in the market and support producer income when the crisis emerged.  The emergency market support measures adopted, the reopening of international markets and the recovery in consumer confidence within the EU helped stabilise the sector towards year end.</P>
    <P>The negative impact of the BSE crisis on the income of beef farmers was partially compensated for by the special BSE package of £70 million which I secured in June of last year.  The June compensation package also provided for an amendment to the rules governing the deseasonalisation premium, worth £16 million and currently payable, to guarantee its continuation this year.  The additional £31 million package agreed in October will provide a further cushion to producers. Despite signs of a weakening of the international market for dairy products, milk prices were more or less maintained at the high levels achieved in 1995.</P>
    <P>Since the 1992 CAP reform changes, direct payments have become a vital element of farmers' incomes, and 1996 was no exception.  The Central Statistics Office advance estimate of income for 1996 indicates that direct payments of £873.2 million were paid out to farmers and these transfers now account for 42 per cent of aggregate farm income.  These payments played an important role in maintaining farm incomes in 1996.</P>
    <P>The outlook for 1997 is very difficult to predict. Unfortunately, the BSE crisis seriously undermined consumer confidence in beef in the EU and, while there has been a significant recovery in the consumption of beef in recent months, it is unlikely ever to return to pre-BSE levels.  In view of this, the Agriculture Council adopted the Commission's proposals for a reform of the beef regime last October.</P>
    <P>The reform package will be helpful in restoring <Col N="105" /> balance to the market in the short term.  Clearly, in view of the export orientation of the Irish beef industry, it is of major importance to it that balance is restored to the EU market as rapidly as possible.  I was particularly pleased with the improvements in the extensification arrangements, which are worth some £15 million per annum to approximately 66,000 Irish beef producers without any change in their stocking rates. The paring back of the special beef premium quota to actual usage is a temporary measure for two years and it should have only a very limited impact on our producers.  I am also very pleased that we managed to withstand considerable pressure from many member states for a reduction in the suckler cow quota because this protects the production base of our beef industry for the future.</P>
    <P>While the beef reform measures agreed last October will be very important in removing surplus production, they are only designed to deal with the short-term consequences resulting from the BSE crisis.  The Council of Agriculture Ministers in Europe believes that further changes in the beef regime are necessary to align beef supplies in the Union with the likely long-term level of internal and external demand while ensuring that the Union's ability to meet its international obligations will not be prejudiced.  Accordingly, the Council has asked the Commission to come forward with further beef reform proposals by the end of April with the objective of having them agreed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As agreed in Partnership 2000, the Government's approach to the reform of the beef sector will be determined by the need to protect the income of beef producers through price stability and to ensure that full compensation will be paid for any price reductions arising from the reform. We will also aim to ensure that any changes in the premium system will continue to favour extensive grass-based production and that the present structure of the beef support arrangements is maintained.  In addition, particular emphasis will be placed on ensuring that Ireland's export opportunities are maintained, and that our ability to share in developing export markets is enhanced.</P>
    <P>My immediate objective with export markets, however, is to ensure that traditional markets are all available for our beef.  Clearly, the recent closure of the Egyptian market to live animals and the restrictions imposed by Russia are causes of concern.  I assure the House that everything possible is being done to maintain access for Irish cattle and beef to all third country markets.  On invitation from the Tánaiste, an independent team of Egyptian veterinarians were in Ireland last week to examine the BSE situation here in order to enable the Egyptian authorities to review the ban on imports of live cattle from Ireland.  While I am happy with the progress of the visit, a final decision on the future of the ban will not be taken for some weeks.</P>
    <P>As far as Russia is concerned, a delegation <Col N="106" /> from the Department, headed by the chief veterinary officer, visited Russia last week to outline the position in regard to BSE here and the measures enforced by my Department to control the disease and to safeguard consumers.  While the delegation was unable to dissuade the Russian authorities from extending the ban to five additional counties, it did succeed in persuading the Russian authorities to agree to a formula for lifting the restrictions.  In the cases of Limerick and Cavan, both of which had four cases of BSE in 1996, the restriction will be lifted if no new case emerges between now and 1 May.  It is quite clear in all our contacts that the increase in the number of cases to 73 last year, including cohort cases, is the sole source of our problems, not a lack of confidence in our controls.  Therefore, future difficulties will be in direct relationship to the number of cases in 1997.  More generally, it has been agreed that normal trading arrangements will be restored if there is evidence that the level of BSE has reached a peak in Ireland and the number of cases has declined.</P>
    <P>While the extension of the restrictions is regrettable, I am confident that the full Russian demand for Irish beef in 1997, which will be significant, and is of the order of 350,000 steers, will be met by counties where the restrictions do not apply and there should not be any undue impact on producer prices.  The Russian authorities have indicated that they are fully committed to the continuation of the beef trade with Ireland and it is important that this very critical market remains open to Irish beef.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the recent 10 per cent cut in export refunds.  My Department has made it clear to the Commission that the cut is unjustified and unnecessary at a time when the income of beef producers is still under severe strain, and I am seeking to have the decision reversed.  This issue was raised at last week's Council of Ministers meeting and support was forthcoming from a number of member states for a quick reversal of the decision.  The Taoiseach has raised the matter directly with President Santer, and he has also written to him seeking an immediate increase in the refunds.  Commissioner Fischler undertook to examine my suggestions, and I am pleased that my suggestion for a shorter period of validity for export licences has now been adopted at the beef management committee last Friday, reducing the prefixation period to 30 days.  I will continue to press for the restoration of the export refunds to realistic levels in order to guarantee reasonable returns to producers.  The problem is that there have been very heavy volumes &mdash; over 40,000 &mdash; prefixed on the Continent at the lower level and the Commission's attitude is that if it can get refunds at that level there is obviously no need to increase them.  Ireland has a special case, however, and I will continue to press it.</P>
    <P>As we enter 1997, dairy markets are quite stable.  Despite the intervention activity last year, stocks remain at very modest levels and will not <Col N="107" /> impact on market sentiment.  There are some good initial signs in terms of demand for our products in important export markets, such as Russia.  On the other hand, there is every reason to believe that competition for markets from countries like New Zealand will continue to be keen.  Also, the ongoing implementation of the Uruguay Round in the dairy sector will tend to increase competitive forces on the internal EU market.  It goes without saying, therefore, that Ireland, with its export orientation, must remain competitive if we are to retain existing markets and capture new ones.</P>
    <P>This year will see the beginning of the formal discussion at EU level on future policies for the dairy sector and the review of quotas.  In anticipation of this, we have seen various ideas being aired both here and elsewhere.  There are, without doubt, important issues at stake for us in the forthcoming negotiations which will commence when the Commission brings forward its analysis and ideas.  In the meantime, continuation of the open debate and analysis within the industry can only be useful.  Work will also continue within my Department, in consultation with the industry, with a view to making the best possible preparation for the commencement of these important negotiations.  As indicated in Partnership 2000, the Government's aim in these negotiations will be to protect the role of milk production in the context of farm income and rural development and to ensure that the maximum national benefit is derived from milk production and due recognition is given to Ireland's export dependence.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the good performance of the other commodities will be maintained into 1997. Pig prices and output were up in 1996.  As the impact of the BSE scare has eased, demand for pig meat, and prices, has inevitably declined.  In 1997 prices may not reach the levels of last year but output volume should increase.</P>
    <P>Sheep prices also benefited from the difficulties in the beef industry with exceptionally good prices in 1996 pushing output value to an all time high.  This is especially welcome after the difficulties in 1995.  As long as the difficulties continue in the beef market we can expect demand for lamb to remain buoyant.  Demand for lamb has increased by 40 per cent in the UK which means there are fewer UK exports into the key French market and this has given us more elbow room and a stronger position there.</P>
    <P>Consumption of poultry meat is also up and the expectation is that output volume and value will increase again in 1997.</P>
    <P>Cereal producers have now had two good years following a very difficult period.  The outlook for 1997 depends crucially on two factors which are very difficult to predict at this stage &mdash; the weather and the world market.  Initial indications are that world production will be up and, therefore, prices are likely to be under pressure. Nevertheless, with good weather there is no <Col N="108" /> reason to believe our output value should not at least be maintained.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of uncertainty about income developments this year, some of which is fuelled by unnescessarily pessimistic speculation, but I see no reason for any panic or despondency. The agricultural sector may be sure I will continue to make every effort to ensure that 1997 is another good year for farm income and for the food industry.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I want to say a few further words about the BSE problem.  The House will be aware from my comments that, apart from beef and BSE, the agricultural sector is doing reasonably well.  Obviously, there are real concerns and difficulties in the beef sector.  I want to outline briefly my priorities for this year and the coming period in relation to BSE.  I want farmers and the community at large to be aware that the Government is working on a concerted strategic plan of action.  We have already established at Secretary level, the highest level in the Civil Service, in the Department of the Taoiseach, my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs a group to focus on the most appropriate political follow-on to Ireland's third country markets, and the Egyptian, Russian and other efforts will continue.</P>
    <P>The most important thing I can do is eradicate BSE from Ireland.  We have made giant steps forward in the past 18 months in relation to extending the depopulation policy to cohorts and progeny, to take the depopulated meat out of the food chain and to cull imported UK animals irrespective of whether they have the disease.</P>
    <P>We have taken the most stringent steps in Europe in relation to meat and bonemeal, which is the acknowledged method of transmission of the disease.  If one is in the white meat business, one simply cannot have any contact with meat and bonemeal unless one is absolutely dedicated to it and has no bovines whatever, that is, as a feed compounder, farmer, distributor or whatever.</P>
    <P>However, we must go further and we are in discussions with the Commission in relation to an approved eradication plan for BSE in Ireland. Specifically, I am very determined that we will make significant changes at the earliest possible date to the rendering industry.  My Department has had discussions with the rendering and meat industry as well as the farm organisations over recent days to outline the urgency of our plans. This is to ensure, first, that every rendering plant is capable of the providing the 135º centigrade heat treatment with the highly pressurised system which is required by EU law from 1 April.  This is essential.  Specified risk material, that is, the 3,000 tonnes of sheep and cattle offal &mdash; the spine, skull, head, brains and so forth &mdash; will be taken out of the feed chain and incinerated.  At present it forms part of meat and bonemeal.  That will involve dedicated facilities to render it separately.</P>
    <P>We are looking at a situation whereby 1997 will see major change for the rendering industry.  I <Col N="109" /> want to get approval for the Department's BSE eradication plan so we can tell the world that not only are we eradicating BSE, of which I am already confident, but that Europe is endorsing our eradication plan.</P>
    <P>I have never controlled the price of beef and I have been very conscious of the fact that, with the green pound revaluation, the safety net price for beef under the GATT and CAP reforms of 1992 is 74p per pound, which would be totally unacceptable to anybody and would involve serious financial losses for everybody.  The Department has submitted a detailed paper on intervention to the Commission to try to get a floor price well above that figure.  It is talking to the industry and the Minister for Finance about the deboning allowance and other measures so that the meat factories can maintain the highest possible price.  In addition, the Department is seeking an increase in the refunds.</P>
    <P>It is very important that, unlike last October, the farm organisations and Opposition parties have been extremely responsible in recent weeks, and I pay tribute to them on that account.  Farmers did not panic.  Unlike last October, when farmers in counties Tipperary, Cork and Monaghan panicked because they could not sell their cattle to the factory quickly enough at 82p per pound and within six weeks prices had gone up by 5p and 6p per pound, this time people have not panicked and prices actually increased last week.  Steer slaughterings are up 60 per cent so far this year on last year and they were up last year on the previous year.  We can get through this in an orderly way.  Price stability is my second priority and I am doing everything I can with the Commission.  I was again speaking to Commissioner Fischler about these issues at 8 o'clock this morning.</P>
    <P>Despite my best efforts the price of beef has been affected by the BSE crisis.  Uniquely, due to the green pound revaluation and other factors, Ireland has been hit badly over recent weeks.  It is my ambition to produce another compensation package for farmers modelled on the one last year comprising two parts: first, something of the order of £25 million for the green pound revaluation; and second, the £31 million BSE compensation agreed together with whatever national Exchequer figure can be added to it.  No decision has been made but I will try to put together a sizeable compensation package.  Perhaps it would be better to await market developments with a view to identifying the most needy based on price developments.  I assure farmers I am determined to eradicate BSE, to do the best I can to ensure price stability and to produce a further package of compensation.</P>
    <P>Beef is more important to our economy than agriculture is to the European economy.  We are the largest exporters of beef in the northern hemisphere.  We stand to lose more.  Leaving aside the fact that we have had only 194 cases of BSE while Britain has had 168,000 cases, we have more cases of BSE than any other country in <Col N="110" /> Europe and this have caused our problems.  The big increase last year as well as the age profile of those cows have caused a problem.</P>
    <P>This is a national problem and we are all in this together.  I look forward to working constructively with everyone in the agriculture and food sector to deal with those problems and to deploy the full resources of Government to ensure farmers' concerns are given top priority at the Cabinet table and in Brussels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might convert the House and his Labour colleagues but he will not convert the farming community.</P>
      <P>Once again we have a huge media circus covering the budget on radio, television and in print. The Minister lost a major opportunity to deal with the most important matter now facing us.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on making some changes in the budgetary process.  I understand the 1998 budget is scheduled by the Department of Finance for late 1997.  The Minister has been helpful in shortening the length of the annual financial statement.  The word &ldquo;budget&rdquo; in business connotes planning and control.  In the case of Government, we are not dealing with budgetary control in that sense.  After the start of the financial year we are presented with a list of proposed payments and expected receipts for 1997.  No adjustment is made for the fact that some of these receipts were earned in 1996 or that more while earned in 1997 will not be collected until 1998.  The same points apply to the expenditure figures.</P>
      <P>If a business produced a list of receipts and payments for the bank manager omitting novelties such as profit and loss accounts and balance sheets it would be interesting to see how far it would get.  I note the three booklets produced on budget day &mdash; 84 pages in total &mdash; managed not to mention how much we actually owe.  It can be worked out, but I see why the Minister does not want to produce a balance sheet.  Businesses could not do that, not only because of the bank manager but because they need information and planning to control their operations and stay in business.  Business does not have the luxury of enjoying a captive customer, for example, the taxpayer. Government has the ability to increase prices without consultation.  The business person who is also a taxpayer does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this system of public accounting is used also by other Governments, compliance with the Maastricht Treaty definition has to do with accounting skills as much as what actually happens in the underlying economy.  One of our leading European countries is actually using creative accounting methods so that its books will fulfil the Maastricht guidelines.  I am talking here about Government accounting in Europe in 1997.  Estimates of cash receipts and payments for the next three years are welcome and I commend the Minister on this but I would also like to see some accounting for the substantial differences <Col N="111" /> between previous Estimates and actual performance.</P>
    <P>There is a huge hullabaloo every year about the annual financial statement of the Minister for Finance in which he announces changes that represent movements in the two per cent to three per cent range in expenditure over the previous year.  There is nothing about the other 97 per cent and happily for the Minister, for a week the Irish world focuses on the 2 per cent-3 per cent change. For the other 51 weeks nobody looks at the 97 per cent of expenditure either.  The position is that last year's expenditure has to be increased this year.  It does not seem to matter that some of it might not recur or might have been exceptional. It must be continued and increased.</P>
    <P>The characteristic of the Minister's last three budgets is that they are all a little bit good and a little bad.  In his first Budget Statement, the Minister claimed it was a radical budget and used inspirational rhetoric.  Nothing radical has occurred &mdash; the rhetoric has become jaded.</P>
    <P>There have been good things.  The car scrappage scheme is a great success.  As I pointed out in an Adjournment Debate last year there is still a big gap between &ldquo;a real old banger&rdquo; and the cost of a new vehicle.  To get these &ldquo;crocks&rdquo; off the road requires extending the scheme for a further two to three years.</P>
    <P>The inequitable and unfair residential property tax is to be abolished.  However, it will be replaced for many by an equally unjust and inequitable Dublin Targeted stamp duty tax.  The cost of living is considerably higher in Dublin than elsewhere and to this is added the extra stamp duty tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recognised the opportunity to greatly assist small business and the importance of this sector to our nation's economy.  However, he has not followed through with a substantial help to the sector.  Small improvements in a delayed timeframe, while better than nothing, are not enough.</P>
    <P>There are two matters under which the reign of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, may be judged.  He may introduce another budget this year, if a new Government does not take office until after 14 December 1997, for reasons well understood by Members.</P>
    <P>Napoleon liked lucky generals and Deputy Quinn is certainly a lucky Minister for Finance. This makes it more disappointing that the nation was not able to benefit from his undoubted abilities. From Fianna Fáil the Minister inherited national finances in a strong shape.  Our economy has benefited greatly from a strong export trade, coupled with low interest rates, and got a huge bounce from our devaluation in January 1993 within the European Monetary System.  The Minister has made reductions in rates of tax but the amount of tax paid by taxpayers has continued to increase.  One of the principal reasons for this is the main item of public expenditure &mdash; public service pay.  Since the Minister took office <Col N="112" /> this has consistently exceeded all rates of inflation, a situation which will continue for the rest of the century.  He has paid a high price for Partnership 2000.  It would be good to hear he had already agreed it and will not be outmanoeuvred before it commences.  It is against these huge increases that laudable comments about expenditure increasing by 2 per cent in real terms have to be examined.  I do not wish to comment on press reports and I would prefer if the Minister would say if the 9.25 per cent increase for public sector pay meets his approval.</P>
    <P>Public expenditure was the big challenge facing the Minister during his term of office.  As this term nears its conclusion, the major problem and opportunity facing him and the nation is the single European currency. The Minister should have spoken about this and little else during the 70 minutes or so when the nation's attention was focused on him and no doubt he was also observed closely in 14 other European capitals.  Our policy to date on European Union has been very simple.  We joined the Common Market, then the EEC, when Britain joined in 1973 and then there was no distinction between the Irish pound and sterling.  We have benefited greatly from the Common Agricultural Policy and before Greece and later Spain and Portugal joined, we got a special share of regional and Structural Funds which will continue to the end of the century or thereabouts.  We agree with everything and get as much money as we possibly can and we have done very well.  We will now join the single European currency if it goes ahead, even if the German and French people do not share the enthusiasm of their leaders.  Joining the single European currency is undoubtedly an opportunity with many advantages.  The Government seems to have decided that on the balance of advantage we should join.  No doubt there are also a number of significant minuses to joining.  However, we have been apprised only of one side of the argument.  The Minister for Finance should have used his hour or so on Wednesday last, when he had the attention of the nation, to give us, as openly as he could, the pros and cons of joining.  He may be right in assessing that the pros outweigh the cons but the rest of us would like to know the down side so that we can anticipate problems ahead.  Does he feel that Germany is coming to the end of long decades of sustained growth?</P>
    <P>The only reference of the Minister to the single European currency was a one liner to say we will continue to meet the entry requirements.  Surely he does not intend to join without telling the rest of us lowly beings.  Many people believe that the chances of Britain not joining economic and monetary union range between probable and definite. We should examine the position on the basis that the UK will not join.  While there would still be advantages for us, joining without the UK would lead to a greater number of disadvantages.  The Minister and his officials must apprise us of both sides of the argument.  If the consequences of joining are all good, why are they so coy about putting forward both sides of the argument?  It may be that the German and French political leaders are not correct about the benefits of a single <Col N="113" /> currency and that the fears of the French and German public are justified.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall that one of the principal reasons our economy is so strong and our currency is near the top of the EMS band is that we were able to devalue our currency four years ago.  It is also important to remember that while we struggled to avoid devaluation during the winter of 1992-3 we did not receive much help from our friends.  Joining economic and monetary union without Britain and Northern Ireland and without being able to independently devalue our currency may be the correct thing to do, but I would like to see the evidence.  Like my party, I am open to change and willing to move forward. However, this is too grave a matter on which to be blindly led by the hand.  We all want to see a stronger Europe, even if it means the introduction of 15 budgets and a reduction in the number of Ministers for Finance to one, with the venue to be decided.  This is the most important matter facing us and it is what this debate should be about.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the two previous budgets and some important matters which the Minister for Finance did not mention.  The Minister for Finance represented us well during the Irish Presidency and was a charming host in Dublin and Brussels.  His third Budget Statement, like the previous two, was beautifully presented, perhaps with less <i>gravitas</i> but with more gratification.  All the budgets introduced by the Minister have had many good measures in them.  Having held back in previous years, the Minister made a special effort this year to satisfy as many people as possible. I am sure he hopes that this feeling will continue until the next budget.  He stressed, to the amusement of some, that this is not an election budget but rather a budget in an election year. Perhaps he is correct and he is only playing a John the Baptist role with the Messiah, his political master and cordial friend, in orchestrating another budget for later this year.  This would enable a new Cabinet to take office in December.</P>
    <P>No reference was made to some of the not so pleasant measures such as the reduction in mortgage interest relief and voluntary health insurance relief.  The examples given in the table do not relate to people with mortgages or health insurance or to those who smoke or purchase petrol and diesel.  Petrol has been increased by 11.25p per gallon while diesel has been increased by 6.5p per gallon &mdash; the ordinary man in the street understands the term &ldquo;gallon&rdquo; better than the term &ldquo;litre&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have been told that we will be better off as a result of the budget and will pay less income tax.  If this is so who is paying the £4,926 million in income tax?  This is an increase of £1,085 million on the figure for 1994, the year before the Minister moved to Merrion Street.  Cuts in relief <Col N="114" /> help the Government and during the Minister's three years in office he has increased income tax receipts by a massive 28 per cent.  This is not a figure which should be ignored.  Maybe I should adjust the figure for inflation in order to get the real figure, but 28 per cent sounds real enough to me.</P>
    <P>The rate of VAT and corporation tax was also increased substantially, but we still need to borrow more money each year.  The Minister has borrowed £1,701 million.  The increase in 1997 is approximately 50 per cent higher than that in 1996.  We are doing so well we can borrow more but is this wise or necessary?  Should we not try to save something for a rainy day?  There has been reference to a 2 per cent real increase in expenditure. During the Minister's tenure in office expenditure has increased from £11.2 billion to £13.4 billion, an increase of £2.2 billion or 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Given the level of borrowing and the fact that expenditure is exceeding the rate of inflation, how can we expect inflation to stay relatively low?  Housing and mortgage interest represents approximately one quarter of the retail price index.  The rate of mortgage interest relief has been reduced but everything else has been increased.  Pressure on interest rates is perhaps only around the corner.  In the old days the Minister could gladly have taxed the old faithfuls &mdash; drink, petrol and tobacco.  When we had high rates of inflation the effect of these changes was not significant.  However, this year the Minister was clearly and properly worried about the rate of inflation and had to leave drink alone, with only increases of between 7p and 11p on a gallon of petrol and 7p on a packet of 20 cigarettes. These increases alone cause a 0.2 per cent increase in inflation.  I do not see how the well published growth in expenditure in recent years, together with continuing borrowings and the effect of this year's financial statement, will make it easy for the next Minister for Finance, who will come from this side of the House, to control inflation.</P>

      <P>We laid proper foundations but the Government made a mess of them.  The Government will go down in history as having wrecked the economy in spite of low inflation and interest rates.</P>
      <P>It is no coincidence that periods of high annual growth coincide with periods of low annual inflation.  However, there are already some straws in the wind, as can be seen from the fact that the rate of inflation is starting to creep up and the Minister has projected a lower growth rate of 5.5 per cent this year, reducing to 4.5 per cent next year.  According to the Central Bank, an independent body, inflation is projected to increase from 1.6 per cent to more than 2.3 per cent in 1997.  As we know from experience, once inflation takes off it can go from a trot into a gallop, with many a canter in between.  Regardless of whether this is an election year, it is the solemn duty of the Minister for Finance, irrespective of party affiliations, to keep inflation down.  I appreciate that we have a three party Government, but there is only one Minister for Finance and he has to bear responsibility for this, in addition to the plaudits he enjoyed in recent days.  It would be a right old bloomsday if the Minister let the inflation cat out of the bag.</P>
      <P>The real level of the higher rate of personal income tax is 50.25 per cent.  I will explain why I say it is 50.25 per cent and not 48 per cent.  The principal feature of the budget is that the personal rate of tax remains at 50.25 per cent.  There are far too many single people and couples paying tax at this rate.  High rates of tax mainly hit city dwellers who enjoy higher incomes but who also suffer a higher cost of living and a lower standard of living.  Proximity to the DART, the National Concert Hall and universities is not, as the Minister suggested, compensation for handing over more than half of one's income to the State.  The reduction in the lower rate from 27 per cent to 26 per cent means these taxpayers will be £99 per year, or about three pints of Harp per month, better off.  The Minister has never referred in his three budgets to the iniquitous 50.25 per cent rate of personal taxation.  He has reduced the rate for companies from 40 per cent to 36 per cent and to 28 per cent for very small companies.  The rate of capital gains tax has been decreased by 1 per cent to 26 per cent, while human beings remain stuck on a rate of 50.25 per cent.  It is most unfortunate that many commentators refer to the 48 per cent rate as if the levies totalling 2.25 per cent did not exist or did not have to be paid in cash.  The Minister should not allow inflation to take off and he should try much harder to control public expenditure.</P>

      <Col N="116" /> The Minister's willingness to give £100,000 to help preserve the memory of James Joyce was a nice touch.  In my school days, the late Canon Sheehan was a more favoured author.

      <P>Canon Sheehan was a good literary writer.  He wrote famous books such as <i>Glenanaar, My New Curate, Tristim Lloyd</i>, and <i>The Graves of Kilmorna</i>.  The Minister will recall that one of his illustrious predecessors initiated a tax exemption for artists here which has been a great success.  Perhaps the Minister will consider an initiative to attract other important wealthy people, who are creators of enterprise, to our shores.  Many of these people would be attracted to reside in our friendly country if they were to pay tax on incomes up to £500,000.  That is a large income by Irish standards and tax on it should satisfy the greatest begrudger.</P>
      <P>However, many people in the UK, the US and other English speaking countries earn in excess of £1 million annually.  Attracting a small number of those people here with their ideas, flair and track record of achievement would not do us any harm.  It is also sad to think that some of our past and present captains of industry, who have helped create considerable employment in this country, feel they have to live abroad for tax considerations, including taking account of the consequences for their family members.  We attract writers and artists to our shores but should try to attract top business thinkers from around the globe.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for helping people starting up in business.  Expenses which the Revenue Commissioners classified as pre-trading expenses have not been allowed as a deduction for tax purposes against the income of the future business. This unfairly increased the cost of starting business for some people and in other cases a great deal of time was wasted trying to avoid this artificial distinction.  I am pleased that the Minister has made this grey area white.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister held on to the unfair, unjust and inequitable residential property tax until the last moment when he finally bowed to pressure from other Labour Party Deputies and supporters.  The next general election must be held within 12 months.  It is sad that the Minister should hold on to this tax for so long particularly as a man of his intelligence knows it is unfair.  The cost of living in Dublin is much greater than in rural Ireland. The cost of getting to and returning from work is much greater in terms of time and expense; the cost of housing is higher; the cost of land is greater and mortgages are bigger and more expensive.  Many single people working in Dublin come from rural Ireland and leave the city in droves by private transport every Friday.  They <Col N="117" /> had to pay residential property tax out of their taxed income which is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>This also applies to stamp duty.  If the Minister is using stamp duty as a crude vehicle to control house prices he should set a threshold of £250,000, not £150,000, which unfortunately buys very little property in Dublin or its environs today.  It is an outmoded tax that is not based on earnings or wealth.  It inhibits the transfer of property at a time when the world is moving towards a free market.  It is a tax that has to be paid out of taxed income.  It is a tax of the past and should be abolished.  There is no capital tax on sales of family homes except this duty.  The proposed 9 per cent stamp duty on second-hand houses, which will only apply in the principal cities in this country, penalises city dwellers, puts up the price of land, discourages the existing second-hand house market and encourages new house building.  One has to take a 50 year view of housing stock.  Are we right to encourage a market in new homes and discourage a market in older homes?  The current reduction in the number of school children will result in a reduction in the number of first time home buyers.  The Minister made little or no attempt to achieve savings in our growing public expenditure.  It should not take a great effort to find savings that would replace the income lost from residential stamp duty.  The 6 per cent and 9 per cent rates could be phased out over three years to make matters easier for the Minister.</P>
    <P>Wages and salaries inevitably are higher in Dublin than in the rest of the country because of the higher cost of living in Dublin.  This also applies to public and civil servants.  In a neighbouring jurisdiction this problem is recognised by giving a London allowance for civil servants. Those who live in Dublin have to pay tax at a rate of 50.25 per cent because they have higher incomes.  It annoys these people to be informed they are paying tax at 48 per cent.  The Minister should remove the 2.25 per cent income levies. People who pay higher taxes do not have relief on mortgage interest as do those who pay the standard rate of tax.  The tax threshold is higher for married people.  This does not compensate for the cost of feeding, clothing, housing, heating and transporting a spouse and children.  Why are more people paying more than half of their income in taxation?  There are lower rates of taxation here but the real standard rate is an inexcusable 50.25 per cent.  If companies pay 28 per cent and 36 per cent why do individuals pay 50.25 per cent?  Income tax receipts have increased by 28 per cent over the three years of &ldquo;Quinn Bloom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister donated £100,00 to the friends of James Joyce.  I request similar funding for the unemployed.  This sum is miserly but would be enormous for those who work on behalf of the unemployed.  It would help them to research and communicate ideas to help the unemployed get back to work.  In his previous budget speeches the Minister referred to helping the unemployed. <Col N="118" /> Providing funds for their representatives would create workable and meaningful initiatives.  The simplest and best way to help the unemployed is to develop an environment for enterprise to create more jobs.  The biggest and most important sector where jobs can be created quickly and permanently is small business.  The Minister makes frequent reference to small business and recognises its importance.  It is symptomatic of his approach to do a little good here and there but never to seriously address any issue that his well intentioned ideas have not been turned into a practical and pragmatic action plan.</P>
    <P>Two years ago in the budget debate I suggested he create a special 25 per cent rate of tax for companies in this sector with profits up to £100,000. That fell on deaf ears.  Last year the Minister brought in a tax rate of 30 per cent on profits up to £50,000.  The maximum saving in tax to any organisation would be only £4,000 and would be deducted from its tax bill over a year later.  That is not the type of initiative which would encourage a small business owner to employ an extra salesman and buy a van or to employ an operator and acquire a new machine.  The £100,000 threshold is a low figure but it would be a start.  This £50,000 figure can be classified as better than nothing.</P>
    <P>Family employees in small businesses continue to pay more PAYE than other workers.  Most people would regard this as discrimination and a disincentive to enterprising people who, in many cases, have given up safe jobs.  They have done this to better themselves and create work for other people and in the process have often had to put up their family homes as security.  These businesses ask that the profits needed for the development of the business are not taxed.  We need more good and permanent jobs in this sector. They could be created more quickly with the active support of a forward thinking Minister for Finance.  Clearly the present Minister sees himself in that role but unfortunately his actions do not match his fine words.  I propose that, rather than make small reductions in corporation taxes, the cuts should be directed solely at the small business sector.  Are the big non-manufacturing taxpayers creating or shedding jobs?  Banks are trying to reduce numbers.  One new job created by every second small company would be magic as far as our unemployment numbers are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry referred to farming and he painted a rosy picture.  He then ran from the Chamber because I was here.  The last matter to which he referred was BSE.  Two green pound devaluations have taken approximately £130 million out of the agricultural economy.  The agricultural community faces one of its worst years ever.  Prices are falling, farmers are nervous and there is little point in the Minister trying to justify what he has done.  He has achieved nothing in his short period in office, but his hands are tied because of the involvement of parties that have no interest in agriculture. Farmers should be properly compensated for the <Col N="119" /> devaluation of the green pound.  Barley prices have decreased from approximately £104 to £95 per tonne and milk prices will decrease by 10p per gallon, but the Minister said nothing about that this afternoon.</P>
    <P>There have been major problems in the agricultural sector under this Minister.  He failed to promote a proper live trade market for cattle.  Cattle that are not suitable for processing here must be exported.  The rural economy will suffer greatly this year.  The Minister and the Taoiseach should try to put confidence back into the agricultural sector.  The Minister referred to world production in cereals.  It will not be possible to sell grain at harvest time because of a surplus.</P>

      <P>During its campaign on the divorce referendum, Democratic Left used the slogan &ldquo;Time to Face Reality&rdquo;.  At that time we believed the people were ready to face the reality of modern Ireland, not as we wished it to be but as it is.  We were proved right.</P>
      <P>The budget is grounded in the same view.  It is based on the reality that our society is divided, that the gap between rich and poor is great and that tax reform is too vital an issue to be left to the crude reactionary ideology of the right.  That ideology is encapsulated in Deputy Harney's pronouncement that she is interested in helping only those who help themselves.  That attitude defies logic.  Why should only those who help themselves receive assistance?  What about those who cannot help themselves?  Do they not matter? Are they not citizens with rights and needs that must be respected?</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, on getting it right.  The budget addresses the reality of modern Irish life.  It helps those who need help as well as those who help themselves.  It is part of the Government's long-term sustained strategy that will ensure high economic growth, high job creation, social cohesion and stable Government.  The taxation provisions will make a significant difference to low and middle income earners who have carried the unfair tax burden for far too long.  They have paid the price and they are entitled to something in return.  It is widely acknowledged that this budget addresses that imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget is also confirmation of the Government's commitment to Partnership 2000.  I am pleased the new agreement is receiving increasing support across the trade union movement.  I also compliment the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, whose social welfare provisions are significant.  From the very young to the very old, greater supports have been provided. Targets laid down by the Commission on Social <Col N="120" /> Welfare are being met.  Families are being strengthened, the elderly are being protected and those out of work are being encouraged back to work.  Poverty is being faced as a reality in our society.  This economic system requires Government intervention to ameliorate its effects, which are not easy to overcome.  If we abandon our role in tackling poverty, as the Progressive Democrats would like us to do, the inequalities will become more acute and corrosive.  There is no single overnight magic formula to combat poverty.</P>
    <P>I listened to Father Sean Healy of CORI denounce the budget and I do not doubt his sincerity. However, his position would be strengthened enormously if he examined the reality of poverty and the way we are dealing with it.  The Government has introduced an anti-poverty strategy to ensure that all Departments play their part.  Perhaps it is time Father Healy examined his department in this regard.  He should consider the lack of a role for religious orders and voluntary bodies in providing accommodation for the travelling community.  The report produced by the Catholic Social Service Conference, CROS-SCARE, states:</P>
    <P>The voluntary sector generally has not seen the direct provision of accommodation for travelling people as its role even though this level of involvement is considered appropriate for every other disadvantaged group in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would welcome Father Healy's assessment on how religious orders and the voluntary sector might help to combat poverty in this way.</P>
    <P>Social exclusion is a major challenge facing our society.  It requires an integrated approach and appropriate mid to short-term measures to deal with it.  In the case of travellers, access to health, education and other services depends on the availability of adequate and permanent accommodation. I am pleased the capital allocation to local authorities for new and refurbished traveller accommodation has been increased to £11 million in 1997, an increase of 83 per cent on last year's provision of £6 million.  This substantial increase reflects the increase in activity following the adoption by the Government in March last of a national strategy on traveller accommodation.</P>
    <P>Overall this year's budget provides more than £400 million for my Department's housing programme, an increase of 9 per cent on last year's provision.  It allows me, as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, to again meet the Government commitment of 7,000 social housing starts annually promised in the policy document, A Government of Renewal.  Taking account of the local authority housing programme and the full range of social housing measures, the needs of more than 10,000 households will be met in 1997.  This level compares favourably with the figure of some 8,500 in 1994 and 6,100 in 1992.  The capital provision of almost £175 million for this year's local authority housing programme will enable authorities to achieve some 3,900 housing starts and acquisitions.  This year's allocation of <Col N="121" /> £175 million is £16 million more than last year, an increase of 10 per cent on an already high figure and more than four times greater than that spent on the programme in 1992.  This is a clear indication of the Government's continued commitment to the local authority housing programme as the mainstay response to meeting social housing needs.</P>
    <P>In 1996 a full assessment of housing needs was carried out nationally.  The results showed that at last the housing needs have stabilised and show a slight decrease.  This is an important achievement in view of the housing record of previous Governments. In 1989 there were only 708 local authority house starts during the first year of the Fianna Fáil-PD Government and less than double that in the second year, while at the same time the budgets introduced by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats favoured the rich and better off.  They were miserable levels of housing provision and created a backlog on the housing list with which this Government has to deal.</P>
    <P>In the private housing sector things were no better under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  Mortgage interest rates reached their highest level of almost 15 per cent.  New house grants fell to their lowest level for decades.  In 1990 the figure was less than 4,500.  It is salutary to compare that with the track record of this Government.  For the second consecutive year we have had record levels of house building in the private sector along with historically low interest rates.  While no Government can claim credit for all factors relating to this success, it nails the lie once and for all that policies to deal with social exclusion, to provide investment in health and education and to increase the social welfare payments are inimical to economic growth.</P>
    <P>As a Government we are determined to face all the political challenges that modern life presents, even the difficult ones such as the drugs menace that, through official lethargy and neglect, got a grip on our poor communities.  The ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demands for drugs is an essential initiative already bearing fruit.  A key recommendation of the task force is that my Department should introduce an estate improvement programme to assist local authorities in tackling environmental and related problems of severely run down urban housing estates and flats complexes.  The allocation of £1.5 million to the programme this year and the commitment of a further £1.5 million in 1998 will have a real impact in the worst affected areas.</P>

      <P>This has been one of the longest running sagas in which many of us in politics have participated.  I have spoken previously on the tragic loss of Mrs. Brigid McCole.  I accept that every effort is being made to address what may be the greatest medical tragedy with which we will have to deal.  However, it is difficult to understand why, when the Irish Haemophilia Society had gone to such lengths to get legal representation when the tribunal was set up, it had to leave on 15 January when it transpired that the issues of concern to it were not being addressed specifically by the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he considered the possibilities of extending the remit of the tribunal or setting up a new tribunal.  I cannot understand why the terms of reference of the existing tribunal cannot be extended to deal specifically with the hepatitis C infection issue.  I thank the Minister for his proposal to set up a new tribunal to commence when the existing tribunal has completed its task.  However, the issue of hepatitis C should be dealt with specifically in all its aspects.  All those who have been involved in this tragedy should have their questions answered.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider our proposal to extend the terms of reference of the existing tribunal to deal specifically with the circumstances of infection of all victims, including the haemophiliacs.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with those who, through no fault of their own, have this terrible condition, one with which they must live all their lives and which makes them totally dependent on multiple transfusions and medical interventions.  There are almost 500 haemophiliacs in the country; they should have a voice and their concerns should be addressed specifically by the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it is important that people give blood.  I gave blood because my father always donated blood and I started when I was in college.  It is very important that young people in particular are encouraged to give blood. The momentum in this regard may have been lost in universities and colleges and the Minister should consider a promotion campaign in these institutions to encourage healthy young people to <Col N="124" /> give blood.  It is also important that those who are going for elective surgery should give blood prior to doing so.</P>
    <P>There has been a tradition that people give blood willingly and freely.  Many people are very concerned about the BTSB and about giving and taking blood.  However, it is important that extra efforts are made to ensure we do not have to delay surgery or import blood stocks.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le mo chomhleacaí, an Teachta Coughlan, as ucht a cuid ama a roinnt.  Chomh maith le sin ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn as ucht an rún seo a chur os ár gcomhair.  Is mór an cailliúint don Teach go mbeidh sí ag imeacht uainn.  Thar ceann an Chomhaontais Ghlas ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil brón orainn go mbeidh sí ag fágáil saol na polaitíochta.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an rún atá os ár gcomhair, I was keen to wait until the Government amendment was moved before commenting.  The Green Party welcomes the Government's plan to establish a new tribunal of inquiry.  The existing tribunal could have dealt with a number of the issues had it been given an extra week or so and had it been given the terms of reference to do so.  It is regrettable that we are once again fragmenting our efforts.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's verbal assurance that he will take on issues of concern to the Irish Haemophilia Society.  It is a pity these assurances were not given more formally.  This view has been expressed to me by the Irish Haemophilia Society which had felt that it was going to have its concerns addressed but was disappointed.  It is important to re-establish the confidence of the society in the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Consideration should be given to setting up a Europe-wide inspection service for blood transfusion service organisations.  Such a move was perhaps an opportunity lost during our Presidency of the EU.  The haemophilia society would like to see an inspection service which could operate without having to give prior notice of inspection. There are a couple of organisations which could take on the task &mdash; the Europlasma Fractionation Association or the European Medicines Evaluation Agency.</P>
      <P>The Green Party has proposed that the positions of responsibility in the BTSB should be rotated on a two or three year basis.  This might ensure that unacceptable practices would not arise.  I join with other Deputies in appealing to people to be generous in giving blood to the Blood Transfusion Service.  The public must be made aware that there are no inherent risks involved in giving blood.  It is important, for the benefit of the Irish Haemophilia Society and society in general, to maintain a safe and plentiful supply of blood.  We do not want to see the service collapse, whatever may be our concerns about public confidence.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the debate on hepatitis C.  However, the circumstances surrounding this debate are sad and upsetting.  Almost by definition, tribunals and court cases give rise to complex legal arguments. While the substance of these arguments is often reported in the newspapers, many members of the public find such debates impenetrable.  The essence of a very distressing and human story is often lost in the technicalities which embody legal debate.  Therefore, it is important to remember that, at the core of this debate, there are 400 people whose lives fundamentally depend on the quality of our blood supply &mdash; past, present and future.</P>
      <P>I would like to place on record my personal sympathy for the Irish Haemophilia Society and its members.  It is not often in human affairs that one comes across a group of people who are in no way responsible for the problems which have befallen them.  The Irish haemophilia community is one such group.  Our task, as public representatives, is to get to the bottom of their concerns &mdash; be these in respect of HIV, hepatitis C or, as is often the case, a combination of both.  I welcome the decision of the Minister and the Government to establish a new tribunal.  It is unfortunate and disappointing that the existing tribunal on hepatitis C has been unable to satisfy the concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society.  However, I recognise that the issues involved are complex and are, in part, outside the remit of the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan.</P>
      <P>The tribunal under Justice Finlay has worked well and speedily.  Its interim report has already been placed in the public domain and I look forward to the emergence of the final report.  While I am aware that, in pure legal terms, a decision could have been taken to expand or change the scope of the interim report on its presentation, I understand the problem faced by the Minister when such an extension was not explicitly sought by the tribunal.  Unfortunately, this issue has become a political football.  In that context, it is not difficult to imagine the wrath of the party opposite if the Minister were seen to intervene personally in the workings of the tribunal.  While I recognise that it is crucial to understand the background to the difficulties experienced by the Irish Haemophilia Society in respect of the existing tribunal, we should not allow this history to distract us from the core problem which must be addressed.  Whether the issues in question are to be addressed by the existing tribunal or a new tribunal is of secondary importance.  Our foremost concern is that we must get to the bottom of the issues at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to extend my good wishes to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  It is unfortunate <Col N="126" /> to lose any Member of the House in circumstances such as those surrounding her impending retirement from politics.  Last evening, she raised a number of issues which should be addressed.  Rightly or wrongly, the Irish Haemophilia Society must have its confidence in this process restored.  In a matter as sensitive as this, it is important that justice is seen to be done.  As such, it is important not that the specific concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society are included in the Government amendment, as alluded to by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, but that they are included in the terms of reference of the new tribunal when the Minister brings them before the House in a number of weeks.  I welcome the assurances the Minister gave in this regard during his contribution.</P>
    <P>Second, the question of time arises.  While it is understandable that the Minister would seek to wait to receive the report of the existing tribunal before initiating an inquiry which will examine issues arising from that report, the issue of time is crucial.  I urge the Minister to approach this issue with all haste and, based on his assurances, I am confident he will do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn also referred to the case of a haemophiliac which is being prepared for the courts at present.  Everyone is aware that the State was not covered in glory by its handling of the case of the late Brigid McCole.  It is crucial that we learn from such mistakes and ensure that the State does not place obstacles in the way of this legal claim and accords full co-operation to the individual involved.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the Minister is to be commended for his decision to establish the tribunal. Tribunals involve delays which can exacerbate problems, particularly when human life is involved.  To be anything other than complete and thorough in our investigation would be an insult to those affected by this problem.  I hope and am confident that the tribunal will close the book on this sorry saga.  It is essential that it does so.  The integrity of the blood supply and the Blood Transfusion Service Board is too critical a matter to be left in doubt.</P>

      <P>For those who received contaminated blood in the past, this matter is an undoubted disaster. Many of their lives have been ruined and all we can do is to try to help to the best of our ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the amendment tabled by the Minister. I also welcome the fact that, in subsection (ii)  of the amendment, he acknowledges the concerns expressed by the Irish Haemophilia Society. I am aware that such an acknowledgement will not make everyone happy but it is important that the Government do so.  The amendment also stresses that such further matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation in the light of the report of the hepatitis C <Col N="127" /> tribunal will be examined as part of the inquiry. I know that the Irish Haemophilia Society would like a specific commitment on its concerns mentioned in that section.  The terms of reference will be drawn up fully at a later date and in view of the fact that the Minister has agreed to meet the Irish Haemophilia Society to discuss its concerns, I understand why it wants to have an input on this issue and is seeking to ensure that its concerns will be written into the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The Minister has delivered much in respect of those unfortunate enough to be contaminated by infected blood.  He was unlucky to inherit a situation of this kind, for which he had no responsibility. The Minister has changed the management of the BTSB and established the tribunal of inquiry and I am sure he will fulfil his promise to establish a new tribunal to deal with the concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society and other issues.</P>
    <P>I could argue for a further ten minutes about whether the existing tribunal should have dealt with this problem or whether there was a need to do so.  There seems to be a conflict of ideas in this regard.  If the deliberations of that tribunal are to end, it might be just as well because we can have a clear run at the problem.  During his contribution the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>In finalising the terms of reference, account will be taken of such further matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation in light of the report of the hepatitis C tribunal.  Particular attention will be paid to the concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that the terms of reference for the new inquiry, which will address specific questions, will be drawn up and brought before the Dáil as soon as possible.  Every inquiry has specific terms of reference which ensure some focus on the matter before it.  The terms of reference of the proposed tribunal will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas and we will have an input at that stage if we are not happy with the position. I have no doubt, however, that everything will be in order.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have received blood transfusions will realise the importance of safety with regard to blood and blood products, which are vital for people such as haemophiliacs.  Deputy Coughlan referred to blood donors.  I gave my first blood donation while in college and was delighted that I had a rare blood group, O negative. Unfortunately, I contracted hepatitis a and had to stop giving blood, which I very much regret.  For those who are able to give blood, there is no difficulty in doing so.  It is very important that the present problem does not affect the supply of blood.  As the Minister said, in advertising for blood donors it is important to state that it is safe to give blood.  People are afraid to give blood because they believe it is not safe. The giving of blood saves lives and it is important that people be assured of the safety aspect.  I have <Col N="128" /> every sympathy for the people who have been infected with bad blood &mdash; I am a very good friend of one such person &mdash; and I have the utmost confidence that the Minister will deliver on this tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has just arrived in the House and I join with other Deputies in wishing her well in the future.  At least she is not going out with a whimper, she is going out with a bang.</P>

      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as debating the tribunal for haemophiliacs we are also dealing with the supply of blood.  I reiterate the comments made already, particularly by Deputy Sargent, that there is no risk in giving blood.  The message has become blurred and people are not giving blood.  It is vitally important that the blood supply is built up and maintained.  People are not adequately assured that there never was a problem in giving blood and, given all the safeguards that have been put in place, there definitely is no problem now.  None of us knows when we or members of our family will need a blood transfusion and the message must be sent out clearly that it is safe to give blood.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to establish a new tribunal to inquire into blood product infection, following the report of the current tribunal, is not only politically expedient, it is the correct decision &mdash; sometimes the two are not exclusive. That will be borne out in the long-term.  In providing for the establishment of the tribunal after the current tribunal has reported, the Government is ensuring that the tribunal will be able to inquire into all relevant matters which may emerge from the hepatitis C tribunal.  As Deputy Browne rightly pointed out, the tribunal must have very clear terms of reference and a stated aim.  The reason the tribunal on hepatitis C has been so successful is that the terms of reference are very clear.  That inquiry is progressing speedily and, after a long drawn out process, is getting the necessary information.  If we are to do justice to haemophiliacs, who have suffered as much as people infected by hepatitis C, a clear agenda will be necessary for the tribunal which will inquire into their plight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A safe blood supply is a fundamental public health matter.  In the past that safety has been undermined by what appears to be bureaucratic bungling on a monumental scale.  The task facing us is not to cast stones but to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never repeated.  I fully understand the concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society.  The new tribunal proposed by the Government will prove in the long-term to be the best way to address those concerns, which are many and which have existed for a number of years.  I know two people who were infected with bad blood and the symptoms of haemophiliacs appeared much sooner than was the case with hepatitis C.  I am sure the tribunal will inquire into the reason for that.  It is necessary to restore <Col N="129" /> public confidence in the blood supply, not only among patients and potential patients but also donors.  I reiterate there is no risk to donors.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned at recent reports that the level of blood donation has fallen. Although that may be partly due to seasonal factors, it is clear that many potential donors are wary of giving blood following the recent controversy, and who can blame them?  The message is not being sent out clearly enough that donors were never at risk.  Despite what has happened in the past, the fears are not justified.  The Government has acted swiftly and decisively to guarantee the integrity of the blood supply and the safety of patients and donors.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the current hepatitis C tribunal and the tribunal to be established will not only provide clarity for victims of infected blood supply but will indicate ways in which a recurrence of the problem can be prevented.  No tribunal, regardless of how clear its findings, can undo the grave damage that has been done, and nobody suggested it could.  No tribunal can restore the health of those infected or the peace of mind of those who fear they may be infected.  No tribunal can repair the pain inflicted on the families of victims or potential victims.  We can ensure, however, that in future no one will have to suffer, through the fault of the State or its agencies, as Mrs. Brigid McCole suffered and as others are now suffering.  At the end of the day we are all concerned about the welfare of those for whom we have responsibility.  Regardless of how painful it might be, we must find out what happened.  By doing that we can ensure that what happened in the past will not happen in the future.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to say, as I have said publicly outside the House since Monday, that there are so few women in politics that when one decides not to run again it causes ripples.  Despite the fact that the men who decided not to stand in the next election are equally capable and articulate, the ripples caused by their announcements were not as far flung or as deeply felt.  That is because there are always more men to take the place of men in public life.  One seldom finds women of the calibre of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn. She will be missed by women all over the country but particularly by her female colleagues in this House.  I wish her all the best.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak, albeit briefly, on this motion.  If my memory serves me right, this is the third or fourth time this matter has been before the House by way of substantial motion.  That is understandable because, to borrow a word used by Deputy Lynch, the ripple effect of the consequences of contaminated blood have been enormous.  Fortunately, neither I nor my family have been directly affected by it but, through constituency work, I have come in contact with people who have been and whose family members have been directly affected by it.  It has had a devastating effect on <Col N="130" /> their quality of life and their outlook.  It is appropriate that it has consumed a considerable amount of time and thought in the national Legislature.</P>
      <P>It is also important to put in context the fact that we are not alone in facing this problem.  It has affected a number of other countries.  Some of us will be familiar with what happened in France, the UK and Canada, to mention but a few countries.  Standing back from the immediate crisis of contaminated blood products and the haemophilia issue, by and large the manner in which the Government reacted and the measures it took hold up very well to any international comparison.  I am informed we are the only country that has put in place a compensation tribunal to deal with the victims.</P>
      <P>I do not want to dwell on old debates because there are specific issues before us tonight.  We have put in place health care packages for those affected.  In many ways I feel sorry for the Minister and the Minister of State because they have been running extremely hard on this issue merely to hold their ground.  Much unfair criticism has been levelled at them.  By any international comparison their response has been reasonable.</P>
      <P>When the Minister came into office the first steps he took indicated he immediately grasped the gravity of the situation because he appointed Bain and Company, consultants, to investigate the ongoing day-to-day operations of the BTSB and put a new management structure in place. The track record of the Minister can give us confidence that when the tribunal reports he will act with due propriety in implementing its findings. When the issue of HIV became contentious and it became clear that a health worker in County Kilkenny had contracted HIV through contaminated blood products, the Minister moved again, with considerable speed and due diligence, in indicating prior to Christmas that he would have the matter investigated.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is proof positive of his commitment to act.  The terms of reference of the Government amendment are also proof.  The Government amendment states that Dáil Éireann welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Health that the Government has agreed to establish a tribunal of inquiry to examine specific urgent matters of public importance, namely, the HIV infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB and, secondly, in regard to dealing with the haemophilia issue, such matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation in the light of the report of the hepatitis C tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Irish Haemophilia Society is not altogether satisfied with the Minister's response.  In a sense this is not the forum to discuss that.  We have a clear commitment, in principle, by the Minister to establish that tribunal after the present tribunal has made its recommendations. In view of the concerns expressed by the Irish Haemophilia Society, the critical issue will be the terms of reference of the tribunal to <Col N="131" /> be established.  Many of the concerns expressed, particularly by the Opposition, are legitimate in the context of debating the terms of reference that will apply to the tribunal to be established, but we are not doing that.  The Minister said the tribunal will be established, that its terms of reference will cover HIV infection of blood and blood products and such matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation in light of the report of the hepatitis C tribunal.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent we are somewhat premature in the lines of demarcation we are drawing here between the Government and the Opposition. We will arrive at that debate in a more informed fashion when the tribunal that is sitting has reported.  It will be clear then what exactly were its shortcomings in the context of the haemophilia issue.  Then we can have a reasonable and informed debate as to what those terms of reference should be.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two points that have been covered by virtually all the previous speakers. One is the difficulty the Blood Transfusion Service Board appears to have encountered in recent days in the context of the supply of blood and blood products.  It would be unfortunate if we were not to have an adequate supply of blood in our blood bank and had to import blood products. I do not want to cast aspersions on the quality of blood products that would be imported. Having taken so many positive and necessary steps to ensure adequate safety measures are in place in the blood bank, it would be unfortunate if the public were to walk away from donating blood and we were left with a shortfall.  I urge the public to respond generously by donating blood to address the current shortfall.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to that of practically all speakers in this debate by expressing regret at Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's decision to retire from politics. I have been an observer of her outside and, in latter years, inside the House.  She has been a great servant to her party and to the nation in the very many positions of responsibility she has held and in which she acquitted herself with distinction. It is unusual to throw bouquets at someone while he or she is still alive but I am sure the Deputy will acquit herself with distinction in whatever career she chooses to follow outside politics.  I wish her well.</P>

      <P>This is the second or third time I have spoken about this matter which continues to be a source of serious concern to the people directly affected and those who assist and support them.  It beggars belief that what Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has proposed is not acceptable.  It was reported that the Minister for the Environment, <Col N="132" /> Deputy Howlin, had indicated in the negotiations on the formation of the Government that he was not anxious to return to the Department of Health.  One does not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the reasons.  When this matter was first brought to his attention it was, to say the least, handled in an inept way which displayed a lack of competence.</P>
      <P>The poison chalice was passed to the Minister for Health.  As the matter was debated, it seemed that his desire to become embroiled in complex legal activity leading to settlements in the High Court took precedence over practical common sense.  I do not want, however, to criticise him or the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, unfairly as I recognise the problem had arisen many years earlier in the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
      <P>We are confronted with a dilemma.  It appears that the tribunal of inquiry, which is chaired by an eminent judge and which everybody agrees, given past experience, is being run efficiently and with competence, will not be allowed to finish the job it started.  The Minister is demanding its report on the current phase of its investigation.  It is not beyond its competence to report within four weeks while at the same time extending its terms of reference.  Given that they now possess a knowledge and understanding of what is a complex medical matter, it makes sense to ask the judge, his advisers and those who represent the various interests involved to look in great detail at the plight of those affected.  When the judge informed them that the matter fell outside the tribunal of inquiry's terms of reference they walked out.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried to convince the House that the motion should not be accepted.  Paragraph (iii) (b) of the amendment in his name reads: &ldquo;such further matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation in the light of the report of the hepatitis C tribunal&rdquo;. Paragraph (ii) reads: &ldquo;acknowledges the concerns expressed by the Irish Haemophilia Society&rdquo;. Why does it not go on to state that these will be addressed by the tribunal of inquiry or the proposed new tribunal?</P>
      <P>The extension of the tribunal of inquiry's terms of reference should not result in its report on the current phase of its investigation being delayed. Up to 200 people are affected.  Although there is a wealth of information available provided by experts from abroad, among others, on scientific advances in the testing of blood products and so on, we intend to start again at a new tribunal. This beggars belief and displays a lack of humanity and concern for those affected.  They should have adequate representation at the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For whatever reason, the Government is dragging its feet.  It appears that it does not want the matter addressed this side of a general election but what difference would another three or four weeks make if the tribunal of inquiry gets to the bottom of the matter and makes recommendations <Col N="133" /> to ensure that those affected are adequately compensated?</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the former Minister did not accept the advice of a particular civil servant when he brought the matter to his attention.  He has informed us that there was no compelling reason to set up a tribunal of inquiry but he did not have the political gumption to face up to the difficult dilemma confronting him and to insist that the matter be clarified.  My party's spokesperson on health has raised it time and again.  She was eventually accused &mdash; this was the former Minister's only defence &mdash; of playing politics.  Following the withdrawal of the Irish Haemophilia Society from the tribunal of inquiry yet another Private Members' motion has been tabled and a further step is to be taken.  Two people given responsibility for the running of the health service have displayed gross incompetence.  Their performance, to say the least, has been pathetic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears the fear that Ministers will be shafted takes precedence over the legitimate concerns of haemophiliacs.  That is sad but true.  Instead there is consideration of what the ramifications will be for Ministers, how this will affect the Department of Health and how one can ensure that senior civil servants will not discommode Ministers.  The needs of the individual Ministers, whether because of their egos or their efforts at self-preservation, take on an all-embracing importance.  They exclaim about setting up a review while privately saying it will lead nowhere.  They bring out advisers, get the spindoctors to work and blame the Opposition because, as in the past, the more muck thrown, the less blemish there will be upon this Minister or the previous one.</P>
      <P>This, by any standards, is a self-serving Government based on pious platitudes and impersonal concepts.  It has not once focused on the real needs and concerns of the people and the implications involved.  How galling it must be for victims to have to listen to lectures on openness, accountability and transparency, given that everything they have achieved to date, with Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, has been achieved through a thick fog that has made progress almost impossible.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept this Government did not take into account the desire, commitment and sheer will of the victims or their tenacity in winkling out the truth.  To her eternal credit, Deputy Geogheagan-Quinn has been their saviour. Even at a time of personal trauma, this principled woman was in the House last night and is here tonight to finish off something she set out to achieve which is to ensure that truth wins out at the end of the day.  She is trying to pin the Minister to the wall to make sure he is accountable on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple and straightforward answer to this issue is to extend the remit of the tribunal.  Haemophiliacs were told by this Minister that all of the difficulties they were experiencing would be <Col N="134" /> accommodated by the tribunal.  Unfortunately they now, once again, feel they have been abandoned. They have not elicited the information and truth for which they were searching.  They are not being accommodated in the tribunal whose terms of reference will not change before the final report is produced.  Not even one single line appeared on this issue in the interim report.</P>
    <P>The Minister should stand back from his amendment and ask himself what it will do?  It will serve, once again, to put the investigation on the long finger.  It will certainly not deal with the immediacy of the problem.  We on this side of the House are not playing politics with the issue.  We are dealing with it in the most humane way in trying to get at the truth despite the major cover-up that has been perpetrated up to now.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Irish Haemophilia Society to withdraw was not taken lightly.  It was born out of devastation because their case was not being heard and they were not given adequate assurances. Why can the Minister not show some concern and humanity and go along with the demands of haemophiliacs?  They do not believe this amendment will ameliorate their situation. There have been 70 deaths, four of them from hepatitis C and 66 from a combination of HIV and hepatitis C.  Time is definitely not on their side.  Assurances were given in the Dáil and on television but they have now come to nought. Deputy Moynihan-Cronin said that delays exacerbate problems.  I agree with her.  This is exactly what is happening &mdash; delays are further exacerbating the problem.</P>
    <P>We do not need further procrastination.  We must expand the remit of the tribunal and get down to the business of seeking the truth.  I and the Minister know the assurances given were not soundly based, whether it was because the Attorney General or staff within the Department who did not give the proper advice.  Surely on the basis of these assurances, there is an onus on the Minister to admit he has been wrong.  He has not deliberately misled the House or the society but the tribunal is not as all-embracing as it was portrayed to be.  The ready made answer is to extend the remit of the tribunal and to let them get on with the excellent job they have done to date. This seems to be quite reasonable and logical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to convey my dismay and sorrow that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn will not be a Member of the next Dáil, which will be substantially diminished by her absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there has been a general welcome across the political divide and among the public for the work of the current tribunal of inquiry and its speed, efficiency and competence, it is extremely regrettable and a source of genuine concern to Members of the House that, in the midst of all this success, there remains a group of people who feel and are excluded from the parameters of the tribunal.  Their concerns are not being addressed. It is surprising to Members that the chairman of <Col N="135" /> the tribunal has determined that the terms of reference of his tribunal do not embrace the concerns of haemophiliacs infected with hepatitis C from blood products supplied by the BTSB.  This is contrary to what was envisaged when the tribunal was established.</P>
    <P>Last year, following a long battle, more than 20 debates in this House, the Trojan efforts of the victims of infected anti-D, their representatives and Members of this House &mdash; particularly Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn &mdash; and in the wake of public outrage following the death of Mrs. Brigid McCole, what was once out of the question was suddenly public policy and a tribunal was established to get to the truth of the anti-D and hepatitis C scandal.</P>
    <P>In this affair, it appears that as soon as one door closes so does another.  Yet again we are seeing people being obstructed in their quest for the truth.  All of the evidence is that haemophiliacs infected with hepatitis C are more susceptible than others to developing cirrhosis of the liver which is more likely to be fatal in their case. We know that almost half of the 500 haemophiliacs in Ireland have been infected with hepatitis C.  Some have died of their infection and others will.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech last night said he was disappointed that the Irish Haemophilia Society withdrew from the tribunal but he accepted it would not be practical to extend the current tribunal's terms of reference to embrace that group of haemophiliacs.  He also accepts, as if he was a cool observer of the process, that the tribunal team feel the task of dealing with haemophiliacs is &ldquo;neither necessary or appropriate.&rdquo; This cool distance as regards the tribunal is not necessary.  A public inquiry, as established under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, is not a court of law but a creature of politics.  It is a body established to report to this Chamber and our supervision and consideration is highly appropriate at all stages.  It is within the power of this House to amend the tribunal's terms of reference.  The very fact that haemophiliacs had to seek a judicial review to win limited representation represented another unnecessary obstruction to sick and dying victims.  This sort of obstruction is familiar to those of us who have watched the manner in which women affected by anti-D, including the late Mrs. Brigid McCole, were treated by the State.  It was a feature of the strategy adopted by the State and the BTSB.</P>
    <P>Once again, another category of victim is experiencing the same cold, clinical, obstructionist approach from the State.  Is this in the public interest?  That must always be bottom line in this House.  We must leave aside the legal contingencies and self-preservation instincts of Ministers and think about the public interest.  I wonder what the team representing the public interest at the tribunal had to say about the manner in which this category of victim was being excluded.  They had to fight to get limited representation and felt <Col N="136" /> their concerns were not being addressed, so they withdrew.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was proposing by way of response to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's motion that he would establish a new tribunal to deal with the concerns of haemophiliacs, I would say that was going a long way, but the Minister's amendment does nothing of the sort.  All it does is acknowledge the concerns.  With the greatest respect, the 200 or more infected people who are involved deserve more than a recognition of their concerns.</P>
    <P>The amendment is a mixture of political cuteness and evasion.  It seeks to distract and deflect political criticism of the omission to deal with haemophiliacs with a weak promise to look at their concerns in the context of another tribunal which specifically deals with HIV infection.  It conveniently skirts the main objective of the Fianna Fáil motion before the House.  It indecently lumps in as an afterthought, by way of a general clause, the concerns of haemophiliacs. There is no tenable explanation for this lesser status being applied to haemophiliacs anywhere in the Minister's speech.  Notably, there is an absence of compassion or any feeling of remorse, empathy or apology.  This is familiar to those of us who have watched carefully the manner in which previous Ministers and the current Minister have dealt with the women who received anti-D.</P>
    <P>To apologise or empathise smacks of liability so the Minister's speech is carefully crafted to avoid any recognition of possible liability in relation to this category of victim.  It deliberately rules out any question of investigation by the future tribunal, or by this tribunal, of the tough legal strategy applied to the late Brigid McCole's case.  We know this legal strategy was part and parcel of the cover-up which is being exposed at the tribunal.  Yet, this is specifically excluded from the terms of reference of the current tribunal, and was ruled out entirely by the Minister last night for any future tribunal.</P>
    <P>This is the same cold face of the State to which the anti-D victims have become accustomed.  The same emotional bankruptcy was evident in the Minister's speech last night in relation to haemophiliacs as was a feature of his response to the women who received anti-D during the years he has been dealing with that matter.</P>
    <P>We must consider, as other Deputies have said, the human position of these victims.  We are talking about seriously ill and dying people.  It is worth remembering that it was only because of the death of Mrs. Brigid McCole, and the circumstances of her infection by the BTSB, that the State was shamed into holding a tribunal at all. We have learned from the tribunal thus far, and evidence from the Minister and his predecessor, that there was a determination at all times not to have a tribunal of inquiry.  It is easy to see now why there was such resistance to a tribunal.  The preference was for an expert group, but it was misled, rendering its report without credibility, and a compensation tribunal, which was an elaborate <Col N="137" /> exercise of accounting without responsibility and without the truth coming out.</P>
    <P>The truth is that Mrs. McCole need not have died because knowledge of a link between anti-D and hepatitis was reported to the BTSB by consultants before she was given the deadly infection by the BTSB product.  The cover-up heaps wrong upon wrong.  It is bad enough to have had this negligence without also having an administrative and political cover-up at the highest level.  We are only now seeing it unravel before our eyes, and it really is of breathtaking proportions.  There must be full accounting for that scandal, which goes beyond compensation.</P>
    <P>I wonder when the Minister realised that the tribunal for which we fought for so long and which was passed through this House as a final vehicle to purge the truth of this scandal, was inadequate to deal with haemophiliacs?  Why is the Minister playing careful and cute in relation to this category of victim?  I urge him to accede to the request of the Irish Haemophilia Society to include its concerns in the terms of reference either of the current tribunal or of the new one.</P>
    <P>What the Minister said last night about the new tribunal does not meet its needs.  At one stage he said he was concerned that the circumstances of the infection of all blood products should be fully and properly investigated, but in the same sentence he narrowed that by saying the work of the new tribunal would be &ldquo;primarily in relation to the HIV infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB&rdquo;.  In other words, the new tribunal will not address the issue of hepatitis C or other viral infections.  Elsewhere in his speech it appeared the Minister might limit the new tribunal to blood transfusions which would exclude products manufactured from blood such as the clotting factor used by haemophiliacs.</P>
    <P>Haemophiliacs and their families are entitled to learn the truth about the circumstances in which they contracted any infection through the use of any blood product; to an examination of how the threat of particular types of infection were dealt with when they became apparent; to an investigation which will make recommendations to ensure the risk of infection is entirely eliminated or &mdash; if that is not scientifically possible &mdash; to ensure that such risk is reduced to an absolute minimum.  They are entitled to have full confidence in blood products supplied to them on which they rely for life itself, and to have confidence in those charged with supervising the supply of blood products.  This will not be achieved by a tribunal which is confined to considering HIV infection.</P>
    <P>It is worth bearing in mind that a number of haemophiliacs who contracted HIV instituted proceedings against the BTSB but, with echoes of the late Brigid McCole case, they knew they had a greatly shortened life expectancy and settled their cases with the result that the actions of the BTSB were not subjected to any scrutiny.</P>
    <P>We know that several children with haemophilia <Col N="138" /> became infected between 1985 and 1990 at a time when no infection should have occurred due to viral inactivation of blood products.  Children as young as six were infected with hepatitis C.  We are talking about over 200 people with haemophilia who have been infected.  Three have already died as a result of hepatitis C, and 34 have died from a co-infection with hepatitis C and HIV.  The majority have chronic liver disease. This significant group of individuals deserves the best possible response from the State, not the minimalist, obstructionist response which has been forthcoming to date.</P>

      <P>It is of prime importance that the final report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the hepatitis C infection is published as soon as possible.  The interim report of the tribunal indicated that the extensive preparatory work done before the hearing of oral evidence commenced, contributed greatly to the expeditious manner in which the oral hearings were conducted.  Any extension of the terms of reference at this stage would, of necessity, require further preparatory work which would delay proceedings considerably and would lead to a lengthy gap between the giving of evidence and the publication of the tribunal's conclusions. The sooner the final report is published, the fairer it will be for all parties concerned.</P>
      <P>The tribunal does not consider that an extension of its terms of reference is practical at this stage.  The inquiry has been run efficiently and effectively by the Chairman, Mr. Justice Finlay. The example of specific terms of reference which have contributed so much to the efficiency of the inquiry will be followed to produce, it is hoped, an equally efficient tribunal on the lines proposed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I too am anxious that the concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society be taken into account.  Haemophiliacs are completely reliant on blood products and are usually the first people to suffer from any new infection of the blood supply.  They are, <Col N="139" /> therefore, entitled to an expectation that the blood supply be free of those viral infections which are currently identifiable and for which reliable tests are available.  This expectation applies equally to all users of blood and blood products.  The Minister for Health announced last night that particular attention will be paid to the concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society when the terms of reference of the new inquiry are being drafted.  The Minister has asked me to assure the House that he will meet the Irish Haemophilia Society in the near future to discuss their concerns.  He has also indicated that the society will be consulted when the terms of reference are being drawn up.  I am confident, therefore, that the society's concerns will be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that the proposed tribunal, as well as examining the HIV infection of blood and blood products, will also examine such further matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation in the light of the report of the hepatitis C tribunal. The Minister for Health told the House last night the terms of reference for the proposed inquiry cannot be drafted until after the final report of the hepatitis C tribunal has been examined. The reason for this is that it would not be in anybody's interest for a new tribunal to go over any of the ground already examined by the present inquiry, and it will not be possible to establish what issues remain unaddressed until the final report of the current tribunal has been examined.  I am sure the House will agree that the Minister for Health should follow the most prudent course and the relatively short waiting time involved should not be regarded by the Opposition as a reason for criticising the Government's proposed course of action.</P>
    <P>It is the strong belief of this Government that the establishment of a new tribunal of inquiry is the correct way to proceed.  In attempting to solve everything at once we do not want to end up solving nothing effectively.  The new tribunal will not be an open-ended inquiry.  Specific terms of reference for the new inquiry will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible after the report of the current tribunal has been examined and after consultation with the Irish Haemophilia Society.  Once these terms of reference are approved by the Oireachtas we will have a tribunal which will, it is hoped, get to the truth reasonably quickly.</P>
    <P>I express my gratitude to the large number of blood donors who have responded so magnificently to the current shortage over the past few days.  I appeal &mdash; I am sure the other Deputies in the House would wish to be associated with this &mdash; for this response to continue.  I am confident that it will.</P>

      <P>The final point made by the Minister of State has been echoed by all Members who have spoken in this House and outside.  I too appeal to all blood donors to come <Col N="140" /> forward to give blood.  There is an emergency, a great need, and nobody should be afraid to give blood.  I echo what Deputy Mary Coughlan said earlier.  It is time for the Department and for the BTSB to look at the possibility of introducing an education programme in the schools which would involve young people in donating blood at an early age, particularly in third level colleges.</P>
      <P>For the past 60 hours and some 15 minutes I have been reading my own obituary in the national newspapers.  I almost believed I had died and had gone to heaven.  Let me hurriedly assure everybody that I am not a candidate for sainthood. I wish my successor success in this job and the same job satisfaction I have got from a position which was so generously bestowed on me by my party leader two years ago.  Although many plaudits have been handed to me for various things, particularly in relation to the handling of the hepatitis C scandal, those plaudits are only deserved in a very small degree, because it would not have been possible for me, on my own, to do the research or put in the work to get the information that was required without the help of somebody else.  I know it is not something we are supposed to do, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I cannot let the occasion pass without expressing my very deep debt of gratitude to the researcher I share with four others, namely, Jackie Gallagher, for his outstanding work, his commitment to me and his dedication to this issue.  I am truly in admiration of his sheer professionalism.  I thank Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Kidney Association for their support, for the information they gave and for their steely determination in ensuring that all of the issues in this greatest health scandal of our time were brought to the forefront.  I thank all the Members of the House for their messages, cards, and letters, and their words of good wishes to me.  I thank my two wonderful spokespersons in the Dáil, Deputies Tom Moffatt and Séamus Hughes and, in the Seanad, Senator Mícheál Finneran, for their continued support and co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, was at the hepatitis C tribunal last week he said he believed he deserved credit for all he had done for the victims of this State scandal.  He went even further, saying that whatever he did wrong was far outweighed by what he did right.  I hope the Minister for Health and all of us never forget the evidence which was given by Mrs. McCole's daughter.  The young woman, Bríd McCole, spoke of the nightmare that hepatitis C has been for her family.  Their mother is the woman that has blown open this nightmare of hepatitis C.  Her legal action in pursuit of the truth has put the brightest spotlight ever on the workings of our State institutions and the cultures that operated in the BTSB and the Department of Health.  She is also the woman who exposed the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, and the fact that he deserves no credit and why his predecessor is also culpable in this affair.  Both of these <Col N="141" /> Ministers failed Mrs. McCole by not making the public interest the number one priority.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, as we can see from today's media reports, failed adjectly on a number of counts in relation to the public interest.  I sat a couple of chairs away from the former Minister, Deputy Howlin.  I was one of his admirers in Government.  I felt he was a sure-footed Minister who was always strong in his defence of the Government and of the health policy of that Government.  I felt he was a safe pair of hands, and a hands-on Minister.  Instead, I read in the papers today that he knew the Blood Transfusion Service Board was not co-operating with the expert group and did nothing.  I also read, to my utter amazement, that he was making &ldquo;top of the head&rdquo; decisions, to use his own words, in relation to a killing disease, in relation to human misery inflicted on men, women and children by an agency of the State.  I could not have been more shocked than I was when I read that. Miriam Lord most definitely has a point that deserves to be answered by the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  What was he doing in his big office in the Custom House?  Was he writing health strategy for a PR exercise to be published, or was he in Hawkins House?  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he cannot recall.  He should have been ensuring that victims of hepatitis C, the greatest health scandal in the history of this State, got their rights.  He has major questions to answer and I look forward to my successor getting those answers from him in this House.</P>
    <P>Like his predecessor, the present Minister for Health appears to have no regard for the public interest.  He particularly displayed this the way he has treated this House and how he behaved in relation to Mrs McCole's legal action.  In this House, he has been pathetic in relation to the report of the expert group and the new file that was discovered on the diagnosis of infective hepatitis. He maintained a desperate farce, and I am sorry to say he was aided and abetted by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea.  He and the Deputy consistently said that the file changed nothing when every other quarter accepted that the file, which was not shown to the expert group, indicated that the BTSB knew what they were doing in 1976-77.  In fact, had they acted on the diagnosis of infective hepatitis and the calls they received from GPs in the summer of 1977, Mrs. Brigid McCole might never have been infected with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>The Minister's endorsement of the legal strategy in the McCole case was his greatest failing in regard to the public interest.  He knew that the BTSB had no defence in the legal actions that were threatened yet he allowed jackboot tactics to be used at every turn.  He allowed every trick in the lawbook to be employed to frustrate her case.  This was definitely not in the public interest and I believe it was deliberately done to stop the truth emerging.</P>
    <P>I believe it is also deliberate that the terms of reference of the tribunal do not include the need <Col N="142" /> to examine who authorised this legal strategy.  In this motion Fianna Fáil is making one final appeal to the Minister to address the specific question of how Mrs. McCole was denied her anonymity in legal action and who authorised the tactics which included a challenge to an appeal for and early trial of a woman who was desperately ill.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage in the controversy the Minister is still behaving in the same intransigent, belligerent fashion.  The Minister for Health in his contribution last night tried to turn history on its head.  He claimed that when the hepatitis C tribunal was first proposed its only intention was to investigate the anti-D scandal.  Deputy O'Donnell and I had a very interesting meeting with the Minister in mid-October when the terms of reference for the tribunal were about to be published and both of us specifically asked if all infected victims, not just the women who received anti-D, haemophiliacs or kidney patients, would be covered and we were assured by him that there was no problem as his advice was that they would be covered.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, the Minister said in a television interview on 8 October that the tribunal would inquire into all the circumstances of the infection since 1976, both of blood products and blood, and how so many persons, men and women, were infected.  After the Minister's claim last night, I looked at my records and I have now discovered another host of episodes when the Minister said this tribunal would look into all the issues, not just anti-D.  On 8 October, he told the Dáil that the tribunal would investigate the hepatitis C infection of blood and blood products manufactured by the BTSB.  His comments that day did not indicate that it would be confined to anti-D.  In a briefing to journalists on 15 October 1996, the Minister said the tribunal would investigate the infection of blood and blood products with hepatitis C and, again, he did not say that it would be confined to anti-D.  This is the result of one of three issues; either Minister Noonan misled members of the Dáil, the media and the public, the Minister for Health was misinformed by the Attorney General and his Department of the Chairman of the tribunal is interpreting too narrowly the terms of reference.  The Minister appears to blame the Attorney General.  He said last night that he had to ask the Attorney General to ask the tribunal if it would be investigating haemophiliacs' issues relating to anti-D.  Why did he not know whether this was the case?  The Minister says the tribunal said it would not be appropriate for it to investigate the concerns of haemophiliacs.  We all want the tribunal to be efficient and speedy but, as I said last night, we do not want that to be at the cost of victims.  Lawyears and many others want this tribunal to be good public relations for future tribunals after the gross negative comment about the last one. However, victims cannot be forgotten and this House should be concerned that all the issues are investigated.</P>
    <P>Rather than reinventing the facts, Minister <Col N="143" /> Noonan might think of reinventing himself.  He should, once and for all, do what is best in the interest of victims.  I appeal to Deputies on that side of the House to accept our motion as the way forward.  The Irish Haemophilia Society has said that it is most unhappy with the amendment.  It was clear from the speech last night by the Minister, and by that of the Minister of State tonight, that the haemophiliacs are to be just an addition, as Deputy O'Donnell said, to the next tribunal. An inquiry into HIV was promised prior to Christmas and that is what the next tribunal will be about.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech last night said a very contradictory thing.  He said that the terms of reference for the new tribunal would be brought before the Díil as soon as possible.  However, he then went on to define &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; as after this tribunal had reported, which is at least a month away.  I fail to see why the report of the tribunal is relevant given that it is only investigating anti-D issues.  What will the tribunal say about haemophilia issues and HIV?  The tribunal has looked at viral inactivation of blood products as it relates to anti-D.  Does this mean the tribunal will report that it has considered viral inactivation and this will not be an issue for the next inquiry into hepatitis C?  If this happens, it means that a huge issue of concern to haemophiliacs will not be addressed.  It will also mean that BTSB documents relating to viral inactivation as they relate to other blood products apart from anti-D will never have been studied.  I do not believe the Minister will include the concerns of Irish haemophiliacs in the next tribunal and I want a commitment from him that it will happen because Deputy O'Donnell and I were told one thing in mid-October and we are now being told something different.</P>
    <P>In addition to losing sight of victims, this Government, not for the first time, was prepared to sacrifice public servants to justify its action or inaction.  I speak of the Government rather than just the present Minister because I believe he is part of a wider mindset, to his personal detriment.</P>
    <P>When the leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern, generously entrusted this portfolio to me he will recall one of the reservations I had about it was a sneaking admiration, which I can now admit in public because I am leaving, of the Minister. I expected him to be a good Minister.  He was a clever politician and he had a safe pair of hands.  As a result, one of the worst days as far as <Col N="144" /> I am concerned in this scandal was the day he made comments about a victim and her legal advisers, for which, of course, we now know he had to quickly apologise.  I sat here that night with a copy of his speech and I reached that page before he did.  I waited for him to reach that page hoping against hope that he would not read it and, when he did, all of us around this House heard a hiss of disbelief.  At that moment it was clear that what we had been watching for a year was a Minister in full retreat from the best of himself. The management of the health services needs the best capacities of the Minister and it needs him to stop retreating from them.</P>
    <P>This Minister for Health does not lack courage and he has shown that many times in the past.  I would wish at this point to put on record my absolute condemnation of the picketing of the Minister's home by Youth Defence.  It has been widely assumed that the statement which I issued on Monday attacked the media for invading politicians' private lives.  It did not; it drew attention to the changing context which regards a politician's family as fair game.  Protesters setting up outside one's family home is precisely the kind of invasion I believe to be unacceptable.  When I talk of the Minister's courage, therefore, I want to make it clear that I do not believe his family must show courage in the face of picketers outside their home because our families do not get elected, we do.</P>
    <P>It is not just the BTSB which needs to be reestablished in the public mind.  The entire health system is regarded with cynicism, mistrust and dissatisfaction by the public.  If public faith is to be restored to the health service and if it is to withstand the challenges it faces in the short and longer term, it will be achieved only by a Minister who puts people first and makes systems serve people, and not the other way around.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for being in the House to reply.  This matter relates to the killing of Irish Franciscan Brother, Larry Timmons, in Kenya.  I extend sympathy to his parents, brothers, sisters and the Franciscan Brother community. I have been aware of the work, particularly in Kenya, of the Franciscan Brothers for many years from their college in Mount Bellew in County Galway.  I call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government to raise the killing of Brother Timmons with the kenyan authorities.  As the Dutch Government holds the Presidency of the EU, it is important that it also raises this issue to add weight to the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the reports I have read, Brother Timmons was killed last Wednesday by a bullet fired by police who intervened in a robbery at the school where he worked in central Kenya.  The <Col N="147" /> local Catholic church has linked the killing to allegations Brother Timmons made the day before his death concerning bribery and corruption among local officials.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years three Irish religious have been expelled by the Kenyan Government and in each case the expulsion followed corruption allegations or human rights issues.  The EU should monitor closely the political situation in Kenya.  Observers have reported an increase in human rights abuses in Kenya where elections are due to be held later this year.  It has been reported that a Kenyan policeman has been charged with the murder of Brother Timmons and been remanded in custody until 10 February.  The religious in the area held a meeting to protest at the murder of Brother Timmons and the threat to their security.</P>
    <P>There is also concern for aid workers in the region.  The Catholic diocese in Nakura stated that Brother Timmon's killing was planned and was not an accident.  This issue should be investigated. I want a response from the Tánaiste on these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for the opportunity to join with him in exhorting the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to do all that is possible to ensure justice is served in regard to this matter.  I knew Brother Larry Timmons.  He stood up for the people he worked for in Kenya and has paid the ultimate price.  I understand the Tánaiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs have been active in seeking a report which has thus far proved unsatisfactory.  He will do everything he can, particularly through the Dutch Presidency, to seek full accountability on this matter.  All questions have to be answered in full. This may have implications generally for our volunteers and religious who work in Africa.</P>
      <P>This matter specifically raises serious questions.  I understand the Kenyans regard their relationship with the European Union as being very important.  I know the Tánaiste will ask his successor as President of the Council of Foreign Ministers to insist upon a speedy resolution of this matter and to ensure the person who has been charged is not simply made a scapegoat for this organised attack on Brother Timmons. Will he indicate when he expects a detailed account of what has happened?  Is there anything further we can do to ensure a country such as Kenya, which claims to have democratic credentials, will ensure the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice?</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of responding to the matter raised by Deputies Kitt and Cowen. It was also raised with me over the weekend by my colleague, Deputy Pat Gallagher.  I take this opportunity to express to the Timmons family and to his Franciscan colleagues the Government's deepest sympathy on the tragic death of Brother Larry Timmons.  The people of Ireland have been deeply moved by accounts of the life of Brother Timmons and his generous and principled commitment to the communities which he served, most recently in the diocese of Nakuru <Col N="148" /> in Kenya.  Against that background, news of the manner and circumstances of his death last week has been received with a sense of shock and sadness throughout the country.  I welcome the opportunity to inform the House of the actions the Government has undertaken to seek to establish the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.</P>
      <P>On receipt of news of this incident, I sought urgent clarification through diplomatic channels of the exact circumstances of Brother Timmons' death.  Our honorary consul in Nairobi has formally conveyed to the Kenyan Foreign Ministry and to the commissioner of police of Rift Valley province the Irish Government's deep concern about the incident.  He has requested that it be fully investigated and that we be fully informed of its findings and recommendations. In the absence of an Embassy of our own in Nairobi, and given that the Netherlands currently holds the Presidency of the European Union, we have also requested the Dutch Foreign Ministry to ask their ambassador in Nairobi to raise the matter with the kenyan authorities.  In a year in which national elections are due to take place in Kenya, the European Union is monitoring closely the human rights situation in the country.  The circumstances of Brother Timmons' death raise questions in this context which also need to be answered.</P>
      <P>On 27 January a policeman was charged with the murder of Brother Timmons and the police commissioner publicly expressed the Kenyan Government's shock and sadness at the manner in which he met his death, promising that there would be a thorough investigation of the incident and that all those implicated would be brought to justice.  I welcome the promise by the Kenyan authorities of a thorough investigation.  I will continue to monitor its progress closely, taking account of the concerns which have been expressed by Brother Timmons' community and by the local church authorities in Kenya.</P>
      <P>The Bishop of Kerry also expressed these views to me at the weekend on his return from a three week visit to Kenya.  There have been other violent raids in this area of Kenya in recent weeks and at least one other member of a religious order from Ireland was injured.  The reason for this violence is not clear at this stage but we are seeking further details.  At present I am not aware of evidence that it is being deliberately directed against Irish religious or aid workers as such.</P>
      <P>The tragic death of Brother Larry Timmons has heightened public awareness in this country of the dangers facing Irish missionary and humanitarian workers in the field, while at the same time reminding us of the enormous contribution they continue to make in Africa and elsewhere in the world.  It is the Government's earnest hope &mdash; and I am sure it is a hope shared by this House &mdash; that in the aftermath of this tragic event the Kenyan authorities will better safeguard the security of those of our people who continue to uphold our country's renowned tradition of providing humanitarian assistance to those in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to extend my sympathy to <Col N="149" /> the family of Brother Larry Timmons on his tragic death in Kenya.</P>
      <P>The matter I raise is one that has gone unnoticed for quite a while.  On 1 February 1996 the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and IBEC announced amid a fanfare of celebration that REPAK was to be introduced.  It was to take the responsibility for much of the work involved in collecting, recycling and reducing industrial and domestic waste from the Minister for the Environment.  That fanfare has become nothing more than a whimper in the public mind and REPAK has faded from the memories of those in the industry involved in recycling.</P>
      <P>The new company set objectives to collect waste from commercial outlets; to fund and extend the Kerbside operation to 50,000 houses; to fund and extend Rehab recycling operations and to set up a new household recycling system. It is a long time since that launch.  The Minister has questions to answer and needs to take decisions on how he will implement the Waste Management Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>On the same day, he pledged his full support for the development of REPAK and for its early &ldquo;operationalisation&rdquo;, a marvellous example of beautiful rhetoric for which he is renowned.  However, in terms of action we are left high and dry in many cases.  Over the past ten years, waste generation has increased by 38 per cent and 92.1 per cent of waste collected still goes to land fill.  The worst injustice is that some companies admit they generate waste and pay companies such as Kerbside the cost of recycling.  Other companies flatly deny they play any part in generating waste.</P>
      <P>This has continued because of the Minister's <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to dealing with the crisis.  It is ironic that some of the parent companies of the companies that claim they do not create waste here are prepared to pay in Germany and France for the cost of disposing of their waste through collection, recycling and waste reduction at source.  The Minister should introduce strict regulations to off-load responsibility for waste management from the commercial sector.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Sustainable Development was told recently that waste contractors face an increase of approximately £14 in the cost of landfill.  Others claim the increase will be even higher.  As the economics of waste management is changing radically, the Minister must act quickly. Many aspects of waste management can be dealt with by regulation.  Why is the Minister afraid to bite the bullet and introduce regulations?  It is often said that politics is the art of the possible. When making sustainability a priority in policy making, politics should be the art of getting what is possible.  As we are not yet at a sustainable juncture, the Minister must move quickly or matters will get worse.</P>

      <P>REPAK, launched on 1 February 1996, is a company organised and <Col N="150" /> financed by industry to co-ordinate and finance the collection and recycling of packaging waste. The establishment of REPAK was a landmark development for waste management in Ireland.  It is an industry-led organisation which promises to make a substantial contribution towards the achievement of the Government's recycling objectives, especially the recycling targets for packaging waste.</P>
      <P>The EU directive on packaging and packaging waste lays down a target recovery rate of at least 25 per cent for packaging waste by 2001 for Ireland and we are on course to meet that target. This is confirmed by the report on the national waste database published by the Environmental Protection Agency last July.  The report indicates that the recycling rate for packaging waste in the household and commercial waste stream increased from 10.3 per cent in 1993 to almost 15.6 per cent in 1995.  This progress is due to the combined efforts to date of Government, local authorities, voluntary organisations, recycling agencies and industry and, of course, the support of consumers.  The process needs to be accelerated, however, and REPAK can make a substantial contribution to this.</P>
      <P>The establishment of REPAK marked the emergence of a new relationship between industry and Government in tackling environmental issues.  The Minister for the Environment has expressed strong support for REPAK and maintained close liaison with its development.  He has undertaken to provide appropriate statutory support to ensure that businesses, such as REPAK, which participate voluntarily in schemes are not put at a cost disadvantage by non-participants.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996 was brought into operation last July.  Work has been in progress in the Department of the Environment since, on the development of various regulations to give full effect to the Act.  The text of regulations the Minister will make to promote the collection and recovery of waste plastic from farms was published today.  The regulations will impose obligations on suppliers of farm plastics to collect and recycle the wastes involved.  It will be open to suppliers to comply with these obligations on an individual basis, or to participate in an approved scheme.  The regulations are fully supported by the Irish Farmers Association which is developing a voluntary scheme for the collection and recycling of farm plastics in association with plastic manufacturers and other industry interests.</P>
      <P>By mid-February the Minister will have published other similar regulations to promote the recovery of packaging waste generally.  Those regulations will impose obligations on suppliers of packaging materials, packaging and packaged goods.  The publication of those regulations will greatly facilitate the operation of the REPAK scheme and will further develop the partnership approach between Government and industry in dealing with waste issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those regulations will be a herald of things to <Col N="151" /> come.  Following publication of the regulations on recycling, the Minister will introduce other regulations in the next few months to drive forward the process of achieving higher standards and better performance in other areas.  Waste management remains high on the Minister's agenda and he intends to ensure that 1997 will be a year of significant progress in this field.  I hope the Deputy acknowledges that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time in the past three years I raised this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Due to intensive production of mushrooms and poultry in County Monaghan, and to a lesser extent in County Cavan, a serious problem has developed in disposing of poultry litter and mushroom waste.  Some waste is dumped in landfill sites, some is spread on land and more is used in mushroom compost.  In 1993 an INTERREG funded study indicated a dangerous high level of phosphates in the area which could have serious repercussions for waterways.  As a result, members of the county council travelled to England to see how Fibrowatt operated.  It is the world's first commercial power plant fuelled by poultry litter.  Following a great deal of negotiation a site was secured and Monopower, which was linked to Fibrowatt, was established in Monaghan. As the company was not prepared to pay 40 per cent corporation tax, through negotiation, it was agreed that 10 per cent would apply to the manufacture of electricity.</P>
      <P>In 1994, under a Fianna Fáil-led Government the Department of Energy introduced a scheme for non-fossil fuels, including recycled waste with a capacity to generate 75 megawatts of electricity. The scheme included biomass, wind farms, small hydro schemes and combined heat and power. Some 10 megawatts were set aside for farm waste which, following negotiations with the Department, was later increased to 15 megawatts.  One can imagine the disappointment, therefore, when in March 1995 this Government announced that farm waste of biomass would not be included in the scheme.  A competition was announced in December 1995 and projects were to be selected last October, but and official selection has not yet taken place.  I have heard through the grapevine that negotiations have taken place with groups outside Monaghan.  Because of bad weather last Christmas it was impossible to dispose of poultry litter and as a result the industry was unable to operate.  I am sure the Minister of State will reply that the proposals are still being examined and a decision has not been made.  He should come clean on the matter.  I believe negotiations are taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is for 30 megawatts and, if the worst comes to the worst, 15 megawatts would be adequate for the Monaghan project.  Monopower and Fibrowatt are specialists in the field and there <Col N="152" /> is no point in saying they are overpriced.  We examined the plant in England and it was an effective way of generating electricity and getting rid of waste.</P>
    <P>We do not wish to be told we have been unsuccessful. We are entitled to the project and there should be an even spread of the £7.5 million available. We will demand our share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's direct and real interest in this matter.  I have received and considered the recommendation of the independent assessor whom I appointed to assess the applications received under the second alternative energy requirement competition for electricity generation from biomass or waste.</P>
      <P>However, as stated in the competition information notes for generators, the allocation of European Regional Development Fund grant aid of up to 9.3 million ecu, approximately £7.5 million, to support the winning project is subject to certain conditions.  In particular, my Department is required to commission a socio-economic cost benefit analysis study of the recommended project. This study, which will begin this week and take about one month to complete, will be carried out by an independent consultant appointed by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to bring this competition to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  However, I am not in a position to announce the result of the competition in advance of completion of the study.  I assure the Deputy I will have no hand, act or part in selecting the winning competitor.  We have designed a system involving independent consultants who will tell me who is the winning competitor. I do not wish it to be said when the winner has been selected by that process that I influenced it.  I have no say in the matter.  It is right that an independent body should carry out the task.</P>
      <P>The consultants have reported to me.  I am now required to carry out the socio-economic cost benefit analysis.  When that is to hand and if it is satisfactory I will then announce the winner of the competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>For generations draft net fishermen in Cromane, along the Caragh River, the Laune River and the Maine River in County Kerry have finished for salmon from 17 January each year.  This has been the case for hundreds of years.  Normally, the licences for the season would issue to the fishermen a few days before the opening of the season.  That did not happen this year and the fishermen say they were simply ignored.  They were not told the season would not commence until 15 May 1997 until they made inquiries upon not having received their licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Cromane area approximately 100 fishermen and their families are almost entirely dependent <Col N="153" /> on draft net salmon fishing for their livelihoods. This means approximately 500 people in the area are directly adversely affected by the Minister for the Marine's decision.  Cromane, near Killorglin, is unique in that there are more draft net fishermen there than in any other part of the country.  They are involved in inshore fishing. While there may be draft net fishing in other areas it would be minuscule in scale compared to that which takes place in Cromane from 17 January to the end of July each year.</P>
    <P>The mid Kerry area is severely affected by this decision.  The salmon season in the region is best during the period from 17 January to approximately 1 May. the Minister of State proposes that the season would last from 15 May to the end of July rather than 17 January to the end of July.  In addition, the fishermen will only be allowed to fish four days a week &mdash; from 6 a.m. on Tuesday to 6 a.m. on Saturday.  This means people dependent on draft net salmon fishing will only be allowed fish for 30 days in the year.</P>
    <P>The effect of these proposals will be devastating for the families involved.  They will have no alternative but to abandon fishing and give up a way of life which they and their forbears have carried on for generations.  It can only mean economic deprivation and, ultimately, emigration. Suitable job opportunities in the area are limited and what vacancies there are would not be suited to those who have spent their lives at sea.</P>
    <P>Allowing the draft net fishermen in south Kerry to earn their livelihoods as heretofore will not have significant adverse effects on conservation. The area concerned is unique in that draft net fishing is not just a tradition but a way of life &mdash; a crucial supplement which allows people to earn a sufficient amount to keep their families. The diminution in their earnings which is now proposed has the capacity to denude the areas concerned of their populations.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister and Minister of State believe the conservation of salmon stocks is important.  However, in the context of the unique situation of these draft net fishermen, the conservation of people is at stake.  I call on the Minister of State to restore the livelihoods of the fishermen of Cromane, along the Caragh River, the Laune River and the Maine River.  The Minister of State knows the area well having worked there in the past.  I am also aware he would not intend that draft net fishermen, who are severely affected by this measure, would lose a crucial supplement to their livelihoods which, in effect, allows them to continue living in the areas where they were born.  Without that crucial supplement, they will have no alternative but to leave their homes.  I understand the need to conserve stocks. However, the conservation of people is of paramount importance.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donoghue for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> The new regulations for salmon conservation arise from the report of the Salmon Management Task Force.  I established the Salmon Management Task Force in late 1995 because of concern about the serious decline in salmon stocks.  The salmon catches in 1994 and 1995 were half what they were in 1985 and 1986 and the average catch in the years 1991 to 1995 was the lowest in value since 1964.  It is clear we are dealing with a declining resource.  That is one of the few views on salmon on which there is general agreement.  I had come to the view that a fresh approach was needed to the management strategy for Irish salmon. The mandate of the task force was to develop practical proposals for the management of wild salmon stocks, with full regard for the interests of those with legitimate rights in salmon exploitation.</P>
    <P>The task force undertook wide ranging consultation with all the relevant interests, holding six meetings at regional level, and received more than 230 submissions from the various sectors on the subject.  Its report confirmed the need for a rebalance of the salmon catch between the various sectors and the need for a new approach to salmon management.</P>
    <P>I received Government approval in September to progress the implementation of the main recommendations of the task force report, in consultation with the various interests in the fishery. This entails a package of measures designed to secure and augment salmon stocks, a move to management on a local catchment basis and the introduction of a quota system to ensure a fair share of the resource among the different legitimate interests.  The explicit policy is to allow sufficient salmon upstream to spawn, protect juvenile salmon in the rivers, protect the fishery from illegal fishing and poaching and protect the environment as it relates to fish life.</P>
    <P>Since publishing the report, I have returned to the regional centres visited by the task force.  In addition to these meetings, my officials and I met the key sectoral interests and listened to the different views on the practical arrangements necessary to put the policy decisions in place.  I have given careful consideration to the views expressed at these meetings and to the various observations offered.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended a package of measures to secure and augment salmon stocks and to conserve this unique natural resource for future generations.  Having consulted the various legitimate interests in the salmon sector, I recently introduced regulations which completed the first phase of implementing the recommendations of the task force.  The second phase will progress the implementation of a quota system and the introduction on a formal basis of local catchment management.  At home and abroad there has been general acceptance that the measures introduced for 1997 are necessary.  The measures entail gains as well as losses for the different sectors in the interest of optimising the resource.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> The main recommendations affecting the commercial salmon sector are as follows.  In the case of drift nets: a reduction in prescribed maximum number of licences which may be issued by the Regional Fisheries Boards from 847 to 773; a reduction in sea area in which salmon fishing is allowed from 12 to six nautical miles from the baselines; deferral of opening date of fishery to 1 June, the existing closing date remains unchanged; the weekend close period will be extended to three days &mdash; Friday to Sunday inclusive; the introduction of day only fishing between the hours 4 a.m. to 9 p.m.; the use of monofilament netting legalised in drift net fishery; and an increase in maximum depth of mesh permitted from 30 deep to 45.</P>
    <P>In the case of draft nets; a revision of the prescribed maximum number of licences which may be issued to 518 draft nets and 152 other engines; the opening date of fishery deferred to 15 May &mdash; the existing closing date remains unchanged; and <Col N="156" /> the weekend close period will be extended to three days &mdash; Saturday to Monday inclusive. Regarding the draft net fishery, it is important to point out that following consultation with that sector, I have decided not to apply the new regulations on fishing in daylight hours to draft nets. The serious restrictions on drift nets, particularly in respect of sea area and days fished will inevitably benefit draft net fishermen in that greater salmon stocks will reach the estuaries.</P>
    <P>Overall, the package of measures I have introduced is essential if salmon stock declines are to be halted and if this valuable resource is to be protected in the future.  I have already encouraged some estuarial fishermen, anglers and fisheries boards to draw up local catchment management plans which can address the specific area. Perhaps this approach would best address the concern raised by the Deputy in relation to this area.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 January 1997.</P>

      <P>I proposed to take Questions Nos. 21 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Deputies are referring to the dispute at the homeless unit of the Eastern Health Board which is located in Charles St. Health Centre, Dublin 1.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health announced at the <Col N="158" /> Adjournment of the Dáil on Thursday, 23 January 1997 that the proposals for the resolution of the dispute put forwards by the Eastern Health Board to the workers were accepted and services resumed at Charles Street the same afternoon.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the settlement proposals agreed between the Eastern Health Board and the staff will provide and enhanced level of service and the provision of a proper standard of accommodation for the unit.  While the dispute was in progress the board instituted an emergency referral service to ensure that the needs of service users continued to be met.</P>
    <P>Every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his-her needs or the needs of his-her dependants is entitled to payments under the suplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the eight regional health boards.</P>
    <P>All homeless persons have the same entitlements as any other Irish citizen under the social welfare system.  If they are unemployed but capable of and genuinely seeking work then they can apply for unemployment assistance.  While their application is being processed they will be paid interim supplementary welfare allowance.  They can also apply for rent supplementation and exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance system.</P>
    <P>As the supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides entitlement to persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, the presence of a refugee or asylum seeker in the State is sufficient to receive a payment regardless of the legality of status or whether a work permit is held.  These persons will have an entitlement to a basis social welfare payment and child benefit where appropriate, and the payment of supplements in relation to rent, clothing, and back to school clothing and footwear, where applicable.</P>
    <P>Each health board has a unit of designated community welfare officers to deal with the special needs of homeless persons.  This unit which provides emergency accommodation ensures that all homeless persons are properly housed, received the correct rate of rent supplementation, and the appropriate social welfare or health board payments together with medical care.</P>

Not all recipients of social welfare payments are entitled to a fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>Fuel allowance has not been paid to tenants of communally heated dwellings where subsidised heating at generous rates is provided.  As such local authority tenants are considered to be in a more favourable position than a person providing their own heating needs with the assistance of a free fuel allowance, they do not qualify for the allowance.</P>

      <P>The five working groups, composed of Departments, the social partners and the national anti-poverty networks, have in the case of each of the key themes of unemployment, educational disadvantage, income adequacy, rural poverty and disadvantaged urban areas finalised their reports and presented them to the inter-departmental policy committee.</P>
      <P>In addition, Departments have prepared strategic statements relating to their own individual activities and these have also been presented to the committee.  In this regard, my own Department has carried out a very substantial review of its activities from an anti-poverty policy perspective which is now complete.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Poverty is one of the most pressing social issues facing Irish society today.  I recognised some time ago that if we were to seriously tackle the problem, a co-ordinated multi-dimensional approach, embracing all areas of Government activity, would have to be developed.  A quick-fix style solution simply would not work.  It was for this reason that the Government began the process of developing a National Anti-Poverty Strategy, <Col N="160" /> a process which has received important and significant endorsement in the recently published Partnership 2000 agreement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 29, 39, 46, 49 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The CSO study was carried out to determine the reasons for the difference between the estimated level of unemployment as measured by the labour force survey and the number of persons on the live register.  The CSO has urged caution in drawing detailed inferences relating to fraud in the live register from the study.</P>
      <P>The study, however, gave rise to concerns regarding fraud and I responded quickly by introducing a more comprehensive programme of measures designed to tackle fraud and abuse, in particular, of unemployment payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme of measures includes a claim review exercise under which the continuing entitlement of all customers in receipt of either unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit is being examined.  To date, some 200,000 persons have been contacted in relation to the continuing entitlements.  This includes persons on the live register for over six months.  In addition, under the special programme announced in last year's budget, 18 and 19 year olds who are on the live register for more than six months and who are not registered with FÁS have been contacted <Col N="162" /> by my Department and advised to register with FÁS.  To date, under this programme my Department has contacted almost 2,500 young persons. Some 750 of these have registered with FÁS, 450 voluntarily signed off the live register and 1,300 are being further investigated by my Department. A more general programme of six monthly reviews will commence this month.  These reviews will focus in particular on the conditionality aspects of claims.  They will also be used to encourage claimants to pursue measures which will enhance their prospects of getting employment through involvement in educational opportunities, training, etc.  Initially these reviews will be carried out on a selective basis by using carefully defined risk criteria.</P>
    <P>Total savings on unemployment payment schemes amounted to £114.7 million in 1996 of which £55.7 million arose from additional control activity on the live register.</P>
    <P>The progressive measures already introduced have had a significant impact and during the last four months of 1996 the live register of unemployed persons fell by over 17,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis.  The indications so far this year are that the downward trend is continuing.</P>
    <P>I will also be arranging for a detailed examination with consultancy assistance to get more information on the level of social welfare abuse and an assessment of the effectiveness of the measures which my Department is currently putting in place to control such abuse.  The terms of reference of the study will be framed in the light of the experience gained from the application of the current programme.</P>
    <P>Additional resources are being deployed to support the intensified programme of control measures which I introduced.  To date, 27 additional specialist control staff have been assigned and further staff will be assigned shortly.</P>
    <P>Guidelines are issued regularly to local offices and inspectors on all aspects of their work, including issues relating to fraud and abuse. Revised guidelines reflecting the more rigorous approach now being taken to cases of possible abuse have been issued during recent months. The guidelines are reinforced on a regular basis during training courses.</P>
    <P>Estimates of expenditure are reviewed on an ongoing basis in the light of trends in the numbers qualifying for payment.  The measures which I have introduced are having a significant impact on the live register figures and consequently on expenditure on unemployment payments.  While final figures for 1996 are not yet available, it is estimated that expenditure savings of some £20 million in 1996 can be attributed to the control programme.  The impact of the measures has also been taken into account in drawing up the estimate of expenditure on unemployment payments in 1997.  Estimated expenditure on unemployment payments in 1997, taking account of the increases in the recent budget, is £984.8 million reflecting an anticipated average live register figure <Col N="163" /> of 262,000 for 1997.  It includes estimated savings of some £55 million.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to amend the Social Welfare Act, 1965, in view of the budget ignoring the plight of twins which are not recognised as multiple births under the Social Welfare Act, 1965, in child benefit payments.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2353/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Child benefit is currently payable in respect of all children up to age 16 and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally challenged.  Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the significant additional costs involved for parents of twins, I made provision in last year's budget for increasing the grant in respect of the birth of twins from £200 to £500 and for the introduction of a new grant of £500 which is payable on the twins reaching the ages of four and 12 years of age.  These improvements were backdated to apply to all twins born and those reaching the ages of four and 12 years respectively on or after 1 January 1996.  Over 1,400 families have benefited from these improvements at an annual cost of almost £700,000.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations contained in various reports, including the Expert Working Group on Integrating Tax and Social Welfare, the interim report of the Commission on the Family and the ESRI report on poverty in the 1990s, I have targeted this year's improvements in child income support to benefit low income families and, in particular, larger families.  This has been achieved by increasing the higher rate of child benefit, payable in respect of third and subsequent children by £5 and in addition, increasing the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first and second child by £1.  When taken together with the increases provided for in the 1995 and 1996 budgets, the new rates of £30 and £39 represent an increase of 50 per cent in the rate payable for the first two children and 56 per cent in the higher rate payable in respect of the third child onwards.</P>
      <P>In the context of reducing disincentives to work, priority is being given to FIS as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children.  Accordingly, FIS will be reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as at present.  This will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a first step towards meeting the commitment in Partnership 2000, this year's budget provides that FIS will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less PRSI contributions and levies, <Col N="164" /> with effect from June.  Pension contributions will also be deductible.  In addition, I have provided for an increase in the income thresholds governing entitlement to FIS by £10 at each point.</P>
    <P>My priorities for the immediate future in relation to the development of child income support involve continuing the process of removing any disincentive effects arising under the current arrangements and working towards a basic income for children.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>In calculating a person's means under the former lone parent's allowance, actual vouched child-minding and travelling to work expenses of a lone parent were excluded.  The records of the Department are not compiled in such a way that indicates the number of clients to whom this specific exclusion applied and therefore it was not possible in the time available to estimate the costs requested by the Deputy.  As soon as the information is compiled, it will be made available.</P>
      <P>Under the new one parent family payment introduced this month, the system for assessing means for one parent families has been changed. Specific disregards for child care costs etc. have been replaced by a flat earnings disregard of £115.38 a week &mdash; £6,000 a year &mdash; for a lone parent in employment.</P>
      <P>The policy is to facilitate a person parenting alone to take up employment and move away from dependency on social welfare income. Clearly, lone parents need support if they are to achieve this.  The adoption of a universal weekly earnings disregard should make it easier for a lone parent to understand the position and assess their financial situation in relation to taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The Department will closely monitor the operation of the new arrangements in the early stages and the merits of this approach to means assessment can be gauged, and reassessed if necessary.</P>

      <P>The total number of officers in my Department who have an involvement in the administration of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance is over 2,000.  This includes headquarters, regional and local office staff.  Many of the staff concerned also have an involvement with other social welfare schemes.</P>
      <P>From the beginning of September to the end of December 1996 there were some 128,000 movements of persons off the live register as compared with some 111,000 movements on to the live register, giving a net decrease of over 17,000 in the number of persons registered as unemployed. This compares with an increase of over 4,000 for the same period in 1995.  The total number registered as unemployed at the end of December 1996 was 270,146 which is some 15,000 less than in December 1995.</P>
      <P>Following substantial decreases in the numbers registered as unemployed in the months of September, October and November there was an increase of just under 7,000 in December 1996. However, this increase was due to seasonal factors and the seasonally adjusted figure for December fell by 1,700.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 30 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement (FIS) scheme, which provides assistance for low income families, differs in many respects from the family credit scheme which operates in the United Kingdom. For instance, the family credit scheme is based on net earnings and also applies to self-employed people.  In addition, the formulae for calculating benefit differ substantially, as do the various disregards provided for under each scheme.  For example, a young two child family with net weekly earnings of £150 would receive approximately £28 per week under the family credit scheme.  The same family would qualify for a FIS payment of £47 under the changes to FIS announced in this year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Expert Group on the Integration of Tax <Col N="166" /> and Social Welfare identified significant unemployment and poverty traps associated with the various child income support schemes.  In the context of reducing disincentives to work, Partnership 2000 contains a commitment that priority will be given to FIS as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children. Accordingly, FIS will be reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as at present.  This will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards meeting the commitment in Partnership 2000, this year's budget provides that FIS will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less any PRSI contributions and levies payable, with effect from June.  Pension contributions will also be deductible.  In addition, I have provided for an increase in the income thresholds governing entitlement to FIS by £10 at each point.</P>
    <P>These two measures will mean that virtually all current FIS recipients will get an increase of at least £6 in their weekly payment.  People in receipt of FIS who pay PRSI &mdash; those earning over £80 per week &mdash; and the levies &mdash; those on earnings over £198 per week &mdash; will receive extra increases.</P>
    <P>As my priority now is to complete the move to calculating FIS on a net income basis, i.e. net of tax, I have no plans at this stage to provide for the exemption of child care costs in the calculation of FIS.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of the two measures provided for in this year's budget is £4.38 million in 1997 and £7.85 million in a full year, of which £3.12 million in 1997 and £5.6 million in a full year represents the costs of the increased income thresholds.</P>

      <P>The 1997 Estimates for my Department provide for an allocation of £2,155,000 in respect of the National Social Service Board which includes operating costs.  As announced in last week's budget, an additional sum of £760,000 has been provided in 1997 to enable the board to continue a significant development programme which will expand and improve its level of services, including those provided through the network of citizens information centres; its recently launched computerised database of information on social services; and its support for the development of the independent information giving sector. This additional allocation brings the board's budget for 1997 to £2,915,000.</P>

      <P>I am concerned to ensure that social welfare beneficiaries receive their full entitlements. To that end, my Department is continuously examining options for improved targeting of information which will ensure that people are aware in time of their entitlements.  However, it must be emphasised that people generally have an obligation to acquaint themselves of their entitlements.  It would be unreasonable to expect the Department of Social Welfare to be responsible in all cases for people who fail for various reasons to make a claim.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I regard the current rules, which limit the payment of arrears on foot of late claims to a maximum of six months, as being unduly strict.  I am pleased to let the Deputy know, therefore, that this year's budget provides for the extension of the period during which arrears are paid in the case of late claims from six months to one year.  These revised arrangements, which will apply in the case of retirement pension, old age contributory pension, widow's and widower's contributory pension and orphan's contributory allowance, will be brought into effect shortly and will apply in relation to claims received on or after 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>While I understand that the Ombudsman's office is carrying out a formal investigation into the issue of late claims, this investigation has not been finalised as yet and his report is, accordingly, still awaited.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my earlier replies to Question No. 19, on Wednesday, 27 November, 1996 and Question No. 181 on Tuesday, 10 December, 1996 on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities contains a wide range of recommendations which are of relevance to my Department.  Some of these recommendations are specific to the services administered by my <Col N="168" /> Department, while others apply equally to all Departments.</P>
    <P>The main recommendations contained in the report in relation to the services for which I have specific responsibility are: the establishment of a non-means tested payment to compensate for loss of income due to an incapacity for full-time work, or work to full potential to be known as a disability pension.  This payment would replace the existing disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension and would be extended to cover people with disabilities who are living in part-time residential settings; the transfer of administration of the domiciliary care allowance and motorised transport grant schemes from the health boards to the Department of Social Welfare; changes in the financial supports available to carers, including an extension of the carer's allowance on a means-tested basis to all carers; the achievement of the payment rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare as a matter of priority; and specific regard should be given by the Government within any anti-poverty strategy to combating the disproportionate impact of poverty on people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the report contains many recommendations which apply to all Departments.  For instance, the report recommends that all Departments should review the definitions of disability in the legislation under their remit; each Department should carry out a physical access review and plan to ensure, within five years, that all their premises are accessible to people with disabilities; Departments and State agencies should provide disability awareness training for all staff; and people with disabilities should be directly represented on relevant boards.</P>
    <P>Arising from the findings contained in the report, the Government has decided to prepare a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities. The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has also been authorised to establish a monitoring committee will comprise organistation of the commission's recommendations.  The monitoring committee will comprise organisations representing people with disabilities, their families and carers and service providers.  The social partners and Departments, including my own Department, will also be represented on the monitoring committee.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has recently established an interdepartmental task force to prepare the Government's plan of action in response to the report.  The task force is due to report by the end of June.  As soon as the Government's plan has been agreed I will be in a position to indicate the steps which I will be taking to implement those recommendations for which my Department has responsibility.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I have provided for the introduction of a comprehensive package of measures in this year's budget to further assist people with disabilities, many of which are in line with the commission's recommendations.  These measures <Col N="169" /> include; special increases in social welfare rates over and above the rate of inflation, which bring invalidity pension up to the target rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare (CSW) and disability allowance, blind person's pension and disability benefit up from 95 per cent to 98 per cent of the CSW rate; a new part payment of disability allowance for those in part-time residential care; two personal rates to be paid to couples where one is getting disability allowance and the other either invalidity pension or old age pension, the disregard of earnings from rehabilitative employment is being increased to £36.30 a week in the case of disability allowance, blind person's pension and supplementary welfare allowance; an additional payment of 50 per cent is to be paid to recipients of carer's allowance providing care to more than one person; the full-time care and attention condition is being relaxed for carer's allowance purposes where the care recipient is attending a recognised rehabilitative course or day care centre; a new social assistance scheme &mdash; sickness allowance &mdash; is being introduced for those incapable of work and not entitled to disability benefit or not permanently incapacitated.  In parallel with this, disability benefit and invalidity pension are being respectively renamed sickness benefit and disability pension, in line with the commission's recommendations; constant attendance allowance is being extended to disablement pensioners who are also receiving another social insurance payment; survivor's benefit under the occupational injuries benefit scheme will be paid where disablement of 50 per cent or more has been assessed, regardless of the cause of death; the free travel companion pass is being extended to all registered blind persons and the conditions for entitlement to the free telephone rental allowance are being relaxed to allow other persons to reside with the recipient without affecting their entitlement; and 1,000 places are being reserved under the back to work allowance scheme for a pilot scheme for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>As can be seen therefore, I have already taken significant steps to further the position of people with disabilities, in advance of the Government's action plan being finalised.</P>

      <Quest>the reason his Department differentiates between single or married applicants and lone parents on community employment schemes; and the reason lone parents are allowed retain a portion of their social welfare entitlement whereas single or married people are not so entitled.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The contingencies of lone parenthood and unemployment are provided for in differing ways under the social welfare code.  The situation described by the Deputy, whereby a lone parent in receipt of the one parent family payment will have a higher net income than people who were previously in receipt of an unemployment payment in cases where community employment allowances represent the sole source of income, arises as a result of specific policy decisions taken to deal with these quite separate contingencies.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that the ESRI's report Lone Parents in the Republic of Ireland: Enumeration, Description and Implications for Social Security contains several references to the risks of poverty associated with lone parenthood.  Specifically, the report states that &ldquo;when the income data for households of different types are analysed to calculate relative risks of poverty, unmarried lone parents emerge as the highest risk category&rdquo;. Internationally, the report indicates that studies of lone parents in the United Kingdom, the USA and other countries report a pattern of poor socio-economic status, marginal attachment to the labour force and generally low standards of living.  The report concludes, &ldquo;There are reasons to hypothesise that lone parents in Ireland may also be susceptible to such patterns&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community employment provides part-time employment opportunities for unemployed people with a view to their reintegration into the labour market and also to provide a resource for local development and for the voluntary and community sectors.  While community employment participants are drawn predominantly from the unemployed, a limited number of places is <Col N="171" /> made available to lone parents in order to provide them with an avenue back to the active labour force and thereby reduce their dependency on the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Community employment participants who were previously unemployed receive a weekly allowance with increases for adult and child dependants where appropriate in lieu of their unemployment payment.  In addition, they are free to avail of other work opportunities which may arise in the non-community employment period.</P>
    <P>Lone parents, on the other hand, are not obliged to satisfy the availability for work condition required of unemployed people.  Their community employment allowance is treated in the same way as any other income they may have and is taken into account as part of their means for the purpose of determining the weekly rate of one parent family payment payable in their case.</P>
    <P>The one parent family payment is a payment for both men and women who, for a variety of reasons, are bringing up a child or children on their own.  No distinction is made between married and unmarried persons in this context.  It is available to a person who is unmarried, widowed, separated, a prisoner's spouse, or a person whose marriage has been annulled and who is no longer living with his or her spouse.  It is a means-tested payment which takes account of any income or earnings which the lone parent may have.  The nature of the payment acknowledges the particular difficulties faced by lone parents faced with rearing children on their own.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the different treatment by my Department of single or married people and lone parents on CE schemes does not discriminate against the former category.  Rather, it reflects the different nature of the contingencies of unemployment and lone parenthood.</P>

      <P>The value of free board and lodging enjoyed by an applicant is one of the items which falls to be taken into account in the assessment of means for the purposes of determining entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment in an individual case is determined by reference to the parental income i.e. after deductions for tax, PRSI, union subscriptions, rent or mortgage payments and a parental allowance.  This income is allocated equally among the non-earning members of the household and constitutes the assessment applied to any son or daughter who claims unemployment assistance.  The maximum assessment that can be applied to any applicant is limited to 17 per cent of net parental income.  In the absence of such a <Col N="172" /> limit, many applicants from families on average incomes with a low number of non-earners would not be entitled to any payment.  The Deputy will be aware that, in 1995, I increased the minimum weekly payment of unemployment assistance from £10 to £25 for people who are assessed with the benefit of board and lodgings.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important, in the context of a scheme like unemployment assistance as applied to young people, to strike a proper balance between using limited resources in the most effective way in order to address need and providing a reasonable degree of financial independence to young unemployed people living at home.  In that context, I do not believe that it would be the best use of resources to abolish the means-testing of all young people, living in the family home, who apply for unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>Under current provisions, disability allowance is not payable to persons who are resident in an institution or health care facility.  In recognition of the fact that people who are in residential care on a part-time basis incur additional expenses, I have provided in this year's budget that from April, disability allowance will be payable at half-rate directly to disabled persons who are in residential care for part of a week, but otherwise reside at home.  Full details of the new arrangements will be contained in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill, 1997, which I expect to publish before the end of February.</P>
      <P>Under existing provisions many people in part-time residential care are not entitled to any form of income support.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the new arrangements will provide these people with an income support payment in their own right.  In addition, entitlement to disability allowance acts as a passport to other benefits, such as free travel, and these benefits will now be available to people receiving half-rate disability allowance on the same basis as applies to disability allowance recipients generally.  Similarly, where disability allowance is assessable in relation to any other State service, then half-rate disability allowance will likewise be assessable.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of unemployment assistance a married couple with one child dependant earning a self-employed income of £6,000 per annum is entitled to; the amount of lone parent's allowance to which a lone parent with one child dependant earning a self-employed income of £6,000 per annum is entitled.</Quest>

      <P>Under the conditions of the recently introduced one parent family payment, a lone parent can earn £6,000 a year and retain title to the maximum rate of payment.  Thus, a lone parent with one child dependant and earnings from self-employment of £6,000 a year is currently entitled to a weekly rate of £79.70.  This will rise to £82.70 in June following the implementation of the increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>Where a couple is concerned, the maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable with no means for the claimant, spouse/partner and one child is £116.20 a week (to be increased to £120.70 in June).  The weekly amount of unemployment assistance payable is the maximum weekly rate less the weekly value of the means. The means would be calculated as the £6,000 earnings from self-employment with expenses (all work-related expenses, travel, PRSI, tax and medical insurance) being excluded.  As the expenses to be excluded from means assessment will obviously vary from case to case, it is not possible to determine the exact amount of unemployment assistance payable without this information. However, as an example, assuming the client's expenses to be disregarded were £4,000 a year, which would not be unusual, the means assessed would be £2,000, giving a weekly unemployment assistance rate of £78.20.</P>
      <P>I should point out that as part of the social welfare improvements announced in this year's budget, when a claimant's spouse is working, the adult dependant allowance will remain in payment, at a reducing rate, until the spouse's earnings exceed £90 a week, instead of being totally withdraw when earnings exceed £60 a week. This improvement will come into effect from October next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the two schemes &mdash; one parent family payment and unemployment assistance &mdash; are not directly comparable.  While entitlement to unemployment assistance is based on the claimant being unemployed, the one parent family payment addresses the contingency of lone parenthood and entitlement is not based on the employment status of the claimant.  Research has shown that one parent families are vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion, and the one parent family payment is designed as an income support mechanism to take into account the special needs and requirements of single parents raising children and maintaining a household on their own. <Col N="175" /> The one parent family payment is also aimed at facilitating lone parents' return to the workforce by providing positive support, so that over time, they can become less reliant on social welfare payments for their income needs.  This is the rationale behind disregarding a lone parent's earnings up to £6,000 for means purposes.</P>
    <P>The different methods of assessing earnings as between the various social assistance schemes reflect specific policies being pursued by the Department, which are aimed at targeting particular groups of recipients for special attention, and are designed to take account of the fact that different categories of social welfare recipients have differing needs.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over as well as to certain incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  The scheme provides eligible people with free travel on a range of services provided by the CIE group of companies as well as on the services provided by a large number of private transport operators.</P>

    <P>There are currently about 486,000 people who qualify for free travel but my Department does not have statistics on the number of eligible <Col N="176" /> people who avail of the facility.  The cost of the free travel scheme in 1997 will amount to an estimated £32.60 million.  There are currently 56 private transport operators participating in the free travel scheme.  These include eight bus operators, two ferry companies and one helicopter service which provides free travel services in County Donegal.  Since the beginning of 1994, a total of 26 private operators have been admitted to the free travel scheme.  These include six operators who provide free transport services in County Donegal.  My Department is willing to consider further applications from licensed transport operators in County Donegal and from other parts of the country who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>

      <P>Social Welfare legislation does not require a minimum period of residence in Ireland before a person may apply for unemployment assistance.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Task Force on the Travelling Community <Col N="178" /> identified a number of factors contributing to the low level of participation by traveller children in second level education, including the high cost involved for low income traveller families. In its report of July 1995, it recommended that in order to assist in reducing the financial burden imposed on traveller families at second level, child benefit levels should reflect and respond to times of particular financial difficulty in school life and a realistic school clothing and footwear grant and school books allowance should be provided for traveller pupils.  The recommendations of the task force have been examined by an interdepartmental working group on which my Department was represented.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is a universal scheme which is available to all families in the State.  The key principle of a universal scheme is that it should be available to all on the basis of shared circumstances or contingency; in this case the increased costs associated with the rearing of children.  As announced in last week's budget, child benefit is being increased from September next by £1 per child per month for the first two children and £5 per child per month for the third child and subsequent children.  The new monthly rates will be £30 each for the first two children and £39 for each child thereafter.  A family of three children will get £99 a month and a six child family will get £216 a month.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came to office, a three child family has got a 52 per cent increase in their child benefit and a five child family 54 per cent. In addition, the age limit up to which child benefit is paid for those in full-time education has been extended from 18 to 19 years and the grant of £200 payable on the birth of twins has been increased to £500 and a new grant of £500 payable on the twins reaching the age of four years and the age of 12 years has been introduced.</P>
      <P>In relation to the assistance available to families arising from school costs, my Department's back to school clothing and footwear allowance is specifically designed to help meet the extra costs that arise at the start of each school year. It is available to all families, including traveller families, who are in receipt of social welfare payments. The allowance currently payable is £43 per child attending primary school and £58 per child in second level education.  In addition, urgent needs payments are available from the community welfare officer under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>In December last I launched a national information programme on economic and monetary union and the changeover to the euro with the Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Tourism and Trade.  The programme will be in phases, designed to correspond with the phases of the changeover and to provide information in a timely way: as the Deputy will be aware, economic and monetary union will begin on 1 January 1999, when the single currency, the euro, will come into being, but euro notes and coins will not be introduced until 1 January 2002 at the latest, with the changeover to the euro being completed within six months of their introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of the national information programme will run to end 1997 and will focus mainly on provision of information to help businesses to prepare for the changeover.  Forfás is running a business awareness campaign to this end, working closely with business and professional associations.  An important feature of the business awareness campaign will be the compilation, from information supplied by organisations represented on the consultative committee for the campaign, of a calendar containing details of forthcoming economic and monetary union-related events such as information seminars.  This <Col N="182" /> calendar will be regularly updated and will be supplied to businesses via their business and professional associations.  The first such calendar is expected to be circulated shortly.</P>
    <P>Forfás has also engaged consultants to study how businesses, especially SMEs, should best plan for economic and monetary union and the changeover to the euro.  Their study is expected to be completed in March and following that, Forfás expects to hold some ten-15 information meetings in 1997, at which it would present the results of the study.</P>
    <P>The national information programme will be reviewed in the second half of 1997 when the question of broadening its focus will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>Capital acquisitions tax (CAT) does not arise when assets pass from the settlor into a discretionary trust since neither the trustees nor the beneficiaries are beneficially entitled to the assets while the assets are in the trust.  The beneficiaries become liable to CAT only when the trustees pass them the assets.  However, the assets held in certain discretionary trusts are subject to a 6 per cent once-off charge and a 1 per cent annual charge.  These taxes commence when the following two conditions are fulfilled: (a) the settlor dies; and (b) the youngest of the named beneficiaries reaches 21 years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 6 per cent once-off charge, a 3 per cent refund is available if the trust property is appointed absolutely to the beneficiaries within certain time limits.</P>
      <P>There are exemptions from the once-off and annual discretionary trust taxes where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the discretionary trust was created exclusively for one of the following purposes: (a) for public or charitable purposes in the State or Northern Ireland; (b) for the purposes of any statutory or approved superannuation scheme; (c) for the purposes of a registered unit trust scheme within the meaning of the Unit Trusts Act, 1972; (d) for the benefit of one or more named individuals and for the reason that such individual, or all such individuals, is or are, because of age or improvidence, or of physical, mental or legal incapacity, incapable of managing his/her or their affairs; (e) for the purpose of providing for the upkeep of heritage property referred to in section 39 of the Finance Act, 1978 subject to reasonable facilities for viewing the property being extended to the public; or (f) trust property which on termination of the trust, is comprised in a gift or inheritance taken by the State.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners advise that it would not be possible to put a cost in terms of revenue foregone from those trusts either not liable or exempt from discretionary trust tax. Statistics are not recorded in such a manner as would enable the information requested by the Deputy regarding the number of discretionary trusts which are not liable or are exempt from discretionary trust tax to be identified.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the yield from discretionary trust tax was £4.9 million.  The yield in 1996 was £10.4 million and the number of trusts which paid this tax was 186.</P>
      <P>Income received by a discretionary trust is taxed at the standard rate of income tax (26 per cent from 1997-98) and if the income is not distributed within 18 months and it exceeds the expenses of the trust, a 20 per cent surcharge applies for anti-avoidance reasons.  These rules apply to all trusts, including discretionary trusts. In addition, a distribution of trust assets by the trustees to the beneficiaries gives rise to a capital gains tax charge by reference to the gain over the period the assets were in the trust.</P>

Such information could not be obtained without undertaking inquiries which could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>
      <P>For reasons of confidentiality the Revenue Commissioners do not supply details about applicants for charitable exemption for tax purposes nor provide a list of organisations to which such exemption has been granted.  The Deputy will be aware however that the report of the advisory group on charities/fundraising legislation was recently presented to the Minister for Justice and is now before the Dáil Select Committee on Legislation and Security for its consideration prior to the finalisation of legislative proposals. That report includes a recommendation that organisations raising funds for charitable and other purposes will be required to register with a registration authority.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for repayment under the scheme, the scrapped vehicle must have been owned by the applicant for at least two years immediately prior to the scrapping of the vehicle. If, in the case referred to by the Deputy, the daughter became the registered owner of the vehicle in question in March 1996, this period falls short of the two year ownership requirement under the scheme.  Consequently, it would appear that the vehicle does not qualify for repayment under the scheme.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardhship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Assessment procedures are also a matter for the chief executive officers.  Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  Persons in receipt of social welfare assistance normally qualify for medical card entitlement based on these guidelines.</P>
      <P>In addition, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Every person who is in genuine need of a medical card must, of course, receive one and I am satisfied that the health boards give sympathetic consideration to applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, health boards are required to make available, without charge, a general practitioner medical and surgical service to persons with full eligibility &mdash; i.e. medical card holders.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Act, health boards enter into contracts with general practitioners for the provision of these services under the general medical services (GMS) scheme.  The terms of the general practitioners' contract, which includes a fee schedule for the services provided, are the subject of negotiation and agreement between the Department, the health boards and the Irish Medical Organisation. Fee payments to general practitioners under the GMS scheme comprehend the issuing of normal sickness certificates which are required by an adult &mdash; or by an infant-child who is a dependant of the adult &mdash; who is covered by the medical card scheme and those examinations carried out prior to the issue of the first and final social welfare certificates.  The issue of other certificates by a general practitioner, for example, those related to driving licences, insurance and assurance policies is not comprehended under the GMS doctors' fee schedule.</P>
      <P>Neither I nor the health boards have any function in relation to charges or services levied by general practitioners in relation to their treatment of persons &mdash; including infants or children &mdash; who are not covered by the GMS scheme &mdash; i.e. private patients of the general practitioner.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Entitlement to health services in Ireland is based on means.  Artificial limbs are not covered under the drugs refund scheme but, where required, are supplied free of charge to medical card holders.  Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  These guidelines are not set at higher levels for specific medical conditions.  However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and a person whose income exceeds the guidelines may <Col N="190" /> still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. The entitlement of people needing artificial limbs would be considered on this basis.</P>

      <P>A total of 343 residents are currently accommodated in St. Joseph's Mental Handicap Service on the campus of St. Ita's Hospital.  My Department has been working closely with the Eastern Health Board to implement the proposals of the board, as submitted to my Department in 1994, to transfer clients with a mental handicap to community settings, where appropriate, and to improve the accommodation and services available to those clients who need to be cared for in a more structured environment.</P>
      <P>In the period 1993-96 capital funding amounting to £750,000 for the upgrading of existing accommodation and revenue funding of £265,000 to increase staffing levels, to provide multi-disciplinary support and to enhance services to persons with a mental handicap who are also behaviourally disturbed, has been provided by my Department to St. Joseph's Mental Handicap Service, St. Ita's Hospital.  Capital funding of £500,000 and revenue funding amounting to £280,000 has also been provided in recent years to transfer persons off the hospital campus.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, additional funding of £12 million has been provided in 1997 for services to persons with a mental handicap and £2 million will be used to meet identified needs in existing services.  The remaining £10 million will be used to put in place new services.  This funding will be used to address a number of priority needs including the continuation of the ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding of £100,000 has also been provided for St. Joseph's Mental Handicap Service, St. Ita's Hospital in 1997 to assist the board to improve the staffing levels in the existing service.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department will shortly be discussing with the Eastern Health Board the measures which could be taken this year to continue the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from St. Ita's Hospital to more appropriate care settings now that the 1997 allocation for new developments is available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo; sets out the requirements for the development of services, including the services referred to by the Deputy.  The report has been circulated to health boards and officials of my Department are now in discussion with the boards regarding the process of implementing the report.  Also under discussion is the prioritising of services for funding under the additional £1 million provided this year for the development of new services for people with physical and sensory <Col N="192" /> disabilities.  This additional funding will be allocated by the health boards on the basis of the agreed priorities.  Consideration will be given in the context of these discussions to the development of respite care and personal assistance services. The Deputy will note that as well as the £1 million provided for development of new services this year, an additional £2.188 million was built into the health board allocations in 1997 to help put existing services on a more secure financial footing.  Of this £115,000 has been provided for respite services and £200,000 has been provided for personal assistance services.</P>
    <P>There are ongoing discussions between my Department, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the health boards about the <i>modus operandi</i> for the establishment of the co-ordinating committees. It is my intention to set up the committees as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 89 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was published on 18 November 1996.  The commission's report recommends <Col N="193" /> the development of a wide range of economic and social services for people with disabilities, including health, personal support services and employment for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Government decided, on publication of the report, to establish a monitoring committee comprising representatives of Government Departments, the social partners, organisations representing people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations, including the health care and employment recommendations which are the responsibility of my Department.  This is subject to the submission to Government, in the first instance, of a programme of measures to be implemented, which will be drawn up by an interdepartmental task force on which my Department will be represented. This task force is due to submit its detailed action plan by 30 June 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition to this report, Partnership 2000 contains a commitment for an additional 500 shelterd employment places to be targeted over the period of the partnership.  In the course of providing additional places, it is intended through the National Rehabilitation Board (NRB), to pilot new models of sheltered work and to develop minimum standards for all forms of sheltered work.  To that end I allocated £500,000 in 1997 for work places for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>Discussions are currently taking place with the NRB about how the new models will operate.  At this point it is not possible to identify how many places will be created but it is anticipated that it would be significant.  In addition, further places will be made available for persons with a mental handicap as a result of the additional £10 million expenditure which I recently announced.  This will be used to put in place additional services, including new day care and workshop services.  Further details of additional services to be provided from this funding will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> Capitation payments per person in community workshops are currently at £1,100 per person per annum.</P>
    <P>All aspects of sheltered employment are being considered by the national advisory committee on training and employment, established by the NRB due to report in the summer this year as well as the review of training and employment for people with disabilities being undertaken by my Department at present which will report later this year.</P>

      <P>I am aware of and support the initiatives being taken by my colleague, the Minister for Health, to improve services for people with an intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>My Department is in regular contact with the Department of Health in relation to the situation of people with disabilities and their families.  An officer from my Department was a member of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, whose report was published in December 1996.  The recommendations of the review group are being considered, in conjunction with the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, by the interdepartmental task force which I established to draw up a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities. I anticipate that the task force will have completed its work around the middle of the year.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department is represented on the committee established by the Minister for Health to review the pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>The promotion of access to public transport for people with disabilities who hold travel passes was one of the many recommendations made by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in its report which was published last November.

However, I have received representations from the ad-hoc establishment group, which was established to facilitate the setting up of the council, regarding the expected funding needs of the council.  The ad-hoc establishment group requested that circa £330,000 be made available in this regard in 1997.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the cost associated with disability, I am allocating £300,000 to fund the work of the council in 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 98 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has committed itself in the context of Partnership 2000 to the payment of a fair and proper level of compensation to those affected by the designation of special areas of conservation (SACs), having regard to the level and extent of restriction and all reasonable losses arising as a result of SAC designations, and to the difference between the value pre-designation for environmental purposes and subsequent value of the land consequent on designation as an SAC.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there will be between 10,000 and 15,000 farmers/landowners in the areas proposed for SAC status.  The amount and form of compensation that will be payable has for some months been the subject of discussions involving my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and farming organisations.  As these discussions are ongoing, it would be premature at this stage to comment on the terms likely to be finally agreed.  Until such agreement is reached, it is not possible to say what the cost will come to in 1997.  However, adequate provision has been made in subhead S of my Department's Vote for 1997 to meet any necessary expenditure on compensation.</P>

      <Quest>the area of lands in County Mayo described as sand dunes, sandy-banks and mochairs which will be designated as special areas of conservation; the approximate size of each such area; whether it will be permissible for current farming practices to continue to be carried on in such areas, to include the driving of tractors to bring feed to stock grazing in such areas in the winter period; and whether supplementary feeding of stock will be permissible during the winter period in such areas.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 101 together.  Special areas of conservation (SACs) will generally be selected from the areas already proposed for eventual natural heritage area (NHA) status, and will account for about 550,000 hectares at about 400 sites, or about 70 per cent of the proposed NHA areas.</P>
      <P>It is likely that proposed SACs will include approximately 25,000 ha. of sand dunes, with mochairs accounting for an additional 9,000 ha.</P>
      <P>At this point is it not possible to say precisely how much of each habitat type will be proposed for SAC status in County Mayo.  However, this information will very shortly be available to all those affected by designation proposals and to the general public.</P>
      <P>Where current farming practices are not damaging the ecology of the land, there will be no necessity for change.  However, where damage is occuring, change will be necessary.</P>
      <P>The conditions applicable to SACs will differ from area to area.  The likely impact of driving tractors over sand dunes and supplementary winter feeding of stock will be assessed having regard to the specific local circumstances applying.</P>
      <P>The conditions that will apply to areas of blanket bog, heaths, upland grassland and the Burren, which are proposed as SACs, will be identical to those already agreed for such land types by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry with Teagasc, farming organisations and private planners, in the context of the REP scheme.  These conditions, which have already been agreed for approximately two-thirds of the areas that will comprise terrestrial SACs, will apply whether an affected farmer participates in the REP scheme.  My Department is anxious to have similar discussions regarding other relevant habitat types.  In this context, restrictions will be kept to the minimum that is consistent with the protection of the areas concerned.</P>

      <P>I and my officials have had extensive consultations with groups which may be affected by the implementation in Ireland of the EU habitats directive.

      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware of the undertakings given to farming organisations regarding designation of special areas of conservation in the context of the Partnership 2000 agreement.</P>

      <P>The legal framework for local authority boundary alterations, as set out in Part V of the Local Government Act, 1991 and the associated regulations, enables all the issues in relation to a boundary alteration to be thoroughly considered by the local authorities involved in the first instance.  It includes provision for public advertisement and consultation with the other local authorities concerned.  Under the Act, an application for a boundary alteration cannot be made to the Minister for the Environment until this local process is completed.  The Act also includes provision which would allow for the establishment of an independent committee to report and make recommendations following receipt of such an application.</P>
      <P>I understand that New Ross Urban District Council is at present considering the question of making a proposal for a boundary extension but has not commenced formal boundary extension procedures.  Accordingly, I have no role in the matter at this stage.</P>
      <P>The report of the Lacey Commission, mentioned in the press report referred to, was published last June and the new statutory procedures governing local authority boundary alterations were notified to local authorities in July and in August 1996.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the operation and maintenance of all public water and sewerage schemes within their functional areas, including any group schemes taken over by them.</P>
      <P>As already announced, responsibility for the administration of the group water and sewerage scheme grant programme and the small water and sewerage schemes programme, and for water and sewerage capital projects costing less than £250,000, is being devolved to county councils and county borough corporations.  A provision of £15 million in block grant form is being made available in 1997 in respect of these devolved responsibilities.  This includes an additional £5 million to enable local authorities to undertake an accelerated programme of works with a view to the takeover of existing group schemes.</P>
      <P>As to regulation, the EC (Urban Waste Water Treatment) Regulations, 1994 and the EC (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 prescribe treatment and quality standards to be complied with by local authorities, subject to the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency. Responsibility for group water schemes, including compliance with the quality standards of the 1988 Regulations, is a matter for the trustees of these schemes.  Where quality problems are detected by monitoring undertaken by local authorities, the authorities are required to notify the trustees concerned of the measures that should be taken for the improvement of the water supply.  In this regard an advisory leaflet, entitled Private Water Supplies: Focus on Quality, prepared by my Department in 1991, has been distributed widely by local authorities; this highlights the vulnerability of smaller drinking water sources to pollution and advises consumers on the protection of private supplies and the implications for public health.</P>

      <P>I have asked the Higher Education Authority to undertake a general review of outreach centres of higher education institutions and to report and make recommendations thereon.  The authority has determined its own working procedures for the review and has appointed a technical working group.  It has consulted and sought submissions from interested groups.  Decisions on the future of the outreach centres established under the aegis of Carlow regional technical college, including Seville Lodge, Kilkenny, will be determined in the light of the recommendation from this review.</P>

      <P>Youthreach provides an integrated programme of education, training and work experience for unqualified early school leavers in the 15-18 year age group. The programme is funded by the Exchequer and assisted by the European Social Fund under the terms of the operational programme 1994-99.  At present 2,000 places are provided in the vocational education committee sector and an expansion of 450 extra is under way, and approximately 1,525 places are provided by FÁS.</P>
      <P>Agreement has been reached in principle for the Minister for Education to assume entire policy responsibility for early school leavers, with delivery of programmes continuing to be provided jointly by FÁS and the vocational education committees.  Following the launch of the report of the National Economic and Social Forum entitled Early School Leaving and Youth Unemployment, the Government has decided to establish an inter-departmental working group to examine the recommendations in the report speedily.</P>
      <P>While there will be continued need for programmes to cater for those who have left school early, it is a fundamental objective of the Government that retention rates to completion of senior cycle education be increased to 90 per cent by the end of the decade.  A range of strategies are in place to support this objective and address educational disadvantage and substantial progress is being made in improving retention rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a current opinion that some cases of inattention, impulsivity and over-activity among children and young people may be due to minimal <Col N="213" /> brain dysfunction.  The opinion is that there is a particular syndrome, often called attention deficit disorder (ADD), the diagnosis of which should be carried out by a multi-disciplinary team.  It should be noted that there is still discussion and debate about this matter, including definitions, presenting features and the basis of such syndrome. The degree of severity of behavioural problems and-or of learning difficulties thought to be associated with the syndrome appears to vary considerably between pupils.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the special educational arrangements which may be appropriate in relation to the presenting behavioural and learning problems must be decided in relation to each individual, and my Department will take the needs of such pupils into account when provision has to be made in schools and as cases are brought to attention.  With regard to exemptions from study of Irish, such exemptions may be considered by school managements on application by parents or guardians.  Apart from certain instances where pupils have been resident abroad, school authorities may grant exemptions from the study of Irish where pupils fail to attain adequate levels in basic language skills in the mother tongue and where there is evidence of serious intellectual impairment, that is mental handicap, or severe specific learning difficulty or serious sensory impairment.</P>
      <P>Evidence of disability has to be furnished by appropriate medical and-or psychological practitioners. A diagnosis of the presence of a certain degree of Attention Deficit Disorder is not in itself sufficient grounds to grant an exemption from the study of Irish.  However, where there is failure to attain adequate levels in basic language skills in the mother tongue, accompanied by evidence of general learning difficulty due to serious intellectual impairment or evidence of severe specific learning difficulty or of serious sensory impairment, students diagnosed as having the ADD syndrome may be eligible for consideration for exemption from the study of Irish.  The question of the study of languages other than Irish is a matter for decision by the school authorities in consultation with parents and students.  It is assumed that decisions on this matter take account of any difficulties students may have in acquiring basic language skills in the mother tongue, and the presence of particular disabilities affecting the acquisition of language skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme exists for making special arrangements in the State examinations in the case of students with specific learning difficulties or with physical or sensory disabilities.  A diagnosis of the presence of a degree of Attention Deficit Disorder is not in itself a ground for special arrangements. However, where there is evidence of the presence of a specific learning difficulty or of sensory impairment, such cases may be considered and dealt with by the examinations branch of my Department.  Where it is decided that special arrangements are warranted, these are related to the type and severity of disability and to the difficulties <Col N="214" /> experienced by the students.  Applications should be made by school authorities on behalf of students and should be accompanied by appropriate medical and-or psychological evidence.  In this connection I should say that application forms and explanatory information regarding the scheme of special examination arrangements are supplied to all schools each autumn.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the issue of drivers' licences by the Garda authorities for small public service vehicles and not the licensing of these vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Amendment Regulations 1995 (S.I. No. 136 of <Col N="216" /> 1995) which came into force on 1 September 1995, provided for the transfer of the function of licensing of these vehicles from the Garda authorities to local authorities.  The Garda authorities, however, retained the function of the licensing of the drivers of small public service vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that applications for such licences are processed by them in accordance with the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, as amended. Applications are not approved unless the applicant satisfies the Garda authorities that he is not engaged in any occupation which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is likely to impair his efficiency or to conflict with his responsibilities or to be incompatible with his employment as a driver of a small public service vehicle.</P>
    <P>Where an application is refused or an existing licence is revoked by the Garda authorities, an appeal against such a decision can be made to the District Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>The means tests used to determine entitlement to all social assistance schemes include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments which the applicant may have.  Different methods of assessment are applied in the various social assistance schemes.  For example, under current provision, in the case of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, the first £400 is assessed at 5 per cent and capital in excess of this amount is assessed at 10 per cent, while for old age pension purposes, an initial disregard of £200 is allowed, the next £375 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>There are about 430,000 people in receipt of a social assistance payment at present.  In view of the large number of recipients involved, it would not be feasible from an administrative point of view to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments as this would necessitate frequent reviews of the entitlement of a very significant number of recipients as rates fluctuate.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new one-parent family payment and disability allowance, which were provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996, provided me with the opportunity to commence the process of standardising the provisions for the assessment of capital across all the various social assistance payments.  Under the new provisions, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000, if any, is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am extending these revised capital assessment provisions in this year's budget to include the old age (non-contributory) pension, blind person's pension, pre-retirement allowance, carer's allowance, widow's and the new widower's (non-contributory) pension schemes, with effect from October.</P>
      <P>The substantial £2,000 initial disregard under the new arrangements will significantly reduce the effective interest rate for most recipients and will mean that claimants, in general, are not effectively assessed at 7.5 per cent until their level of capital approaches £25,000.  These new arrangements also mean that a non-contributory old age pension couple will now be able to have up to £12,320 in capital and still qualify for the maximum rate of pension, i.e. an increase of £6,345 on the existing provisions.</P>
      <P>As the means of all social assistance recipients with capital will have to be reviewed on the introduction of any changes in this area, the extension of these provisions to the remaining social assistance payments will be done progressively over a period of time in view of the significant administrative implications involved.</P>

      <Quest>whether it is intended to make survivor's benefits payable to dependants following the death of a person as a result of an accident at work or occupational disease so that they are treated the same as widows and widowers, in view of the commitments on equality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to let the Deputy know that, not only have I provided for equality of treatment as between men and women in the area of survivor's benefits payable under the occupational injuries benefits scheme in this year's budget, I have now completed, once and for all, the process of implementing equal treatment for men and women throughout the social welfare code.  This means two changes: (a) a new widower's (non-contributory) pension is being introduced from next October, which will be available to widowers on the same basis as currently applies to widows; and (b) the more restrictive conditions which <Col N="221" /> apply to the benefits available under the occupational injuries benefit scheme for both widows and widowers are being amended so as to apply on the same basis as currently apply to the schemes for widows and widowers generally.  In short, this involves the alignment of the qualifying conditions applying to the widow's and widower's pension schemes available under the occupational injuries benefit scheme with all other social welfare schemes for widows and widowers.  These changes will take effect from April next.</P>
      <P>Last year's budget also provided for the introduction of a new one-parent family payment, which came into effect earlier this month and has replaced the lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit schemes.  The new payment covers both men and women equally, irrespective of whether they are married, separated, widowed or divorced; or the reason for lone parenthood.  I am particularly pleased to have introduced equal treatment in this area and to have also removed the requirement to prove desertion, as this requirement was not only difficult and degrading for many women, but tended to perpetuate notions of victimisation and dependency that should belong to a long past era by now.</P>
      <P>These changes, coupled with the fact that we have cleared up the arrears of equal treatment payments owing to 70,000 married women amounting to £300 million, which arose from the late and faulty implementation of EC Directive 79/7 by previous administrations, clearly demonstrates the present Government's commitment in the area of equal treatment for men and women, irrespective of whether and when European law requires us to implement particular changes.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that senior citizens living in rural areas of County Dublin are subject to the same restrictions on travel time with Bus Átha Cliath as senior citizens in city areas and are therefore prevented from visiting hospitals as journey times are longer; and whether he will consider abolishing time restrictions for old age pensioners from the county areas in view of the fact that commuters generally use much earlier buses when travelling longer distances into Dublin city.</Quest>

      <P>The purpose of my Department's free travel scheme is to encourage elderly people to remain active in the community by giving them access to spare capacity on the various public transport systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception.  They are necessary on city and provincial bus routes because the transport services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with <Col N="222" /> the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply.  It should be noted, however, that time restrictions do not apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other disabled or blind people.</P>
    <P>Time restrictions apply generally from 7.00 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., Monday to Friday, inclusive, and on Bus Éireann long distance buses from 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. on Fridays for up to 20 miles out from Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  The removal of these restrictions would have significant cost implications for the transport companies involved who in turn would seek compensation from my Department.</P>
    <P>In relation specifically to Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann, I understand that neither company would be prepared to lift the current time restrictions, even if appropriate compensation was offered, because of the major passenger capacity constraints operating in their case at those peak times of the day.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I have no plans at present to alter the current time restrictions applying in the case of the free travel scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos. 154, 155 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>The policy direction of this Government has been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit and this has been continued in the 1997 budget package.  This approach involves increasing child benefit as part of a planned strategy of moving towards a more integrated child income support system.  However, it is recognised that there are substantial costs involved in moving towards a more universal system of income support for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, priority has been given in this year's budget to assisting low income families and in particular, larger families.  This has been achieved by increasing the higher rate of child benefit, payable in respect of third and subsequent children by £5 &mdash; 14.7 per cent &mdash; and in addition, increasing the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first and second child by £1 &mdash; 3.4 per cent.  When taken together with <Col N="223" /> the substantial increase of £7 for each child provided for in 1995 and £2 for each child provided for in 1996, this represents an increase of 50 per cent in the rate payable for the first two children and 56 per cent in the higher rate payable in respect of other children since this Government came to office.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the context of reducing disincentives to work, priority is being given to the family income supplement (FIS) as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children. Accordingly, FIS is being reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as at present.  This will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.  As a first step, this year's budget provides that FIS will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less any PRSI contributions and levies payable, with effect from June.  Pension contributions will also be deductible.  In addition, I have provided for an increase in the income thresholds governing entitlement to FIS by £10 at each point.</P>
    <P>Given the Government's stated policy direction, the child dependant allowances, payable with weekly social welfare payments, have not been increased.</P>

      <P>While precise figures are not available, it is estimated that up to 2,000 carer's allowance recipients may be caring for more than one person.</P>
      <P>As announced in the budget, an additional payment of 50 per cent of the existing personal rate is being made to recipients of the carer's allowance who are providing full-time care and attention to more than one person in recognition of the particular difficulties faced by carers in that situation.  A qualifying recipient will now receive a new maximum rate of £105.75 a week.</P>

      <P>The length of time taken to deal with supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appeals has improved as indicated from the following tables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The SWA system plays a very significant role in the overall income maintenance arrangements of the social welfare scheme.  I believe that the quality of the valuable service provided by the <Col N="224" /> various health boards across the country can only be improved through the existence of a demonstrably independent appeals system.  I have decided therefore that the Social Welfare Appeals Office will, in future, also take responsibility for SWA appeals.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1996 (Section 30) for an appeal to the Independent Appeals Office by any person dissatisfied with a determination by an appeals officer of a health board on a claim to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>The chief appeals officer has set up a working group with representatives of the health boards and the Department of Social Welfare to examine the administrative arrangements and other implications arising from this decision with a view to its implementation as soon as is practicable.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, there are to ensure that a person in receipt of a widow's benefit, who is not entitled to a contributory old age pension, is paid the same rate on attaining the age of 66 as a person in receipt of an old age contributory pension.</Quest>

      <P>The qualification conditions for a widow's and a widower's (contributory) pension are less onerous than those pertaining to old age (contributory) pension reflecting the different nature of the contingencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> To qualify for the old age (contributory) pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age. This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  A claimant must also satisfy a minimum yearly average condition from the date they first entered insurance.</P>
    <P>To qualify for a widow's or widower's (contributory) pension a person may use the full insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years to satisfy the yearly average condition.  Also a widow or widower can qualify on his-her own or their late spouse's record.</P>
    <P>The more onerous qualification conditions for old age (contributory) pension is reflected in a higher payment for this social insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>In relation to widow's-widower's (contributory) pension, last year the rate for this payment for the first time reached the Commission on Social Welfare's recommended main rate and this year the rate has increased to 103 per cent of the Commission's recommended rate.</P>
    <P>The weekly rate of dependent child allowance payable with a widow's-widower's (contributory) pension is £17 compared to £15.20 payable with old age (contributory) pension.</P>
    <P>The estimated full year cost of increasing the widow's-widower's (contributory) pension personal rate to that of the old age (contributory) pension rate is £23 million per annum and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>In recent years my Department has introduced a facility for the payment of a wide range of social welfare entitlements by electronic funds transfer to personal accounts at banks and other financial institutions, including An Post.</P>
      <P>This facility is now available to recipients of the following social welfare payment schemes &mdash; old age contributory and non-contributory, widow's-widower's and orphan's, retirement and invalidity pensions, long-term disability, death and child benefits and back-to-work and disability allowances. At present, about 108,000 customers have exercised this option.  As the next step in this process, the facility is now being extended to people receiving non-contributory widow's pensions.</P>
      <P>A household budgeting or bill-paying facility is available for unemployed customers who received their payments through An Post.  They may opt to have deductions made from their weekly payments and remitted on their behalf to a range of utilities.  Participating utilities include 48 local authorities and the St. Pancras Housing Association in respect of housing rents &mdash; Telecom Éireann &mdash; in respect of telephone charges &mdash; and the Electricity Supply Board and Bord Gais &mdash; in respect of energy charges.  At present a total of 11,000 unemployed customers avail of this service each week.  This facility is now being extended to the lone parent customer group.</P>
      <P>Social Welfare customers whose payments are transferred to accounts at banks and other financial institutions have access to the bill-paying services which are provided by those institutions.</P>
      <P>These developments are taking place within the context of my overall aim of ensuring that the most modern and the widest range of payment methods are available to social welfare customers. To this end, my Department is examining the new technologies and &ldquo;cashless&rdquo; money transmission facilities which are now coming on stream.  The aim is to further expand the range of electronic payment methods and facilities from which customers may choose according to their personal needs and circumstances.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my written reply of 19 December 1996 to a question from the Deputy, work associated with securing compliance with maintenance orders is an integral part of the administration of the relevant schemes which involves about 45 staff.  Six of these staff deal directly with the liability to maintain family provisions in the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>A new scheme, the one-parent family payment, which was introduced at the beginning of this month, replaces the separate schemes of deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's allowance, lone parent's allowance and prisoners' wives' allowance. The operation of the liability to maintain family provisions is under review in the context of this new scheme.  The staffing levels on this work will be re-assessed in the light of the work plans arising from the operational review and the implementation of the new scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for certain aspects of the implementation of the scheme, mainly the printing of the vouchers and their distribution to eligible beneficiaries.  The cost of the subsidy is borne by the European Commission. the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is responsible for the negotiation of the scheme at EU level and for the redemption of the vouchers and the recoupement of the sums involved from the European Union.</P>
      <P>Ireland is the only member state still operating the scheme which covers some 400,000 beneficiaries. The scheme was due to expire at the end of 1996.  In December, the Agriculture Ministers of the Council of the European Union agreed to the extension of the scheme for another two years with a reduced budget.  The reduction was proposed by the Commission due to the declining pattern in Irish butter consumption over the past number of years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>This measure is fully funded by the European Union without any national Exchequer contribution. Ireland is the only member state operating the scheme.  Following a recent review of the future of the scheme, the European Commission, in its report to the Council, concluded that, while the scheme should be extended for a further two years at an unchanged aid level, the monthly entitlement should be halved to reflect the general decline in butter consumption in Ireland.  Since 1980, per capita butter consumption in Ireland has fallen from 2lbs per month to under 1lb.  The Agriculture Council agreed in December to continue the scheme for a further two years on the basis of the Commission proposal.</P>
      <P>There have been no other reductions in the monthly entitlement in the years 1995 to date, while the value of each voucher, which stood at 51p at the beginning of 1995, was increased to 52p per 1b of butter from 1 July 1995 and currently remains at that value.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may recall a formal commitment to have compensatory headage payments independently evaluated was entered into by my Department as part of the negotiations in 1994 on the Structural Funds leading up to the approval of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.  The Commission's attitude was that the funds allocated to this measure represented too high a percentage (62 per cent) of the overall allocation to the structural improvement and rural development element of the Operational Programme.</P>
      <P>The consultants who carried out the evaluation came up with many recommendations including tackling the overgrazing problem.  Following consideration of the report, I made a number of proposals to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the headage schemes.  One of these amendments proposes to confine from 1998 onwards the payment of headage and ewe premia in areas designated as degraded under the rural environment protection scheme to farmers participating in REPS which is operated by my Department. In the context of Partnership 2000, the farm bodies have agreed to the implementation of this measure.</P>
      <P>In addition, I established a committee with a brief to agree a set of conservation conditions for blanket bogs, heaths and upland grasslands proposed as natural heritage areas under REPS.  This committee had representation from my Department, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and other agricultural and environmental interests.  Agreement was reached in October 1996 and provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the setting down of sustainable stocking levels by the approved REPS planning agencies.  My Department has recently commenced the training of REPS planning agencies in the application of this agreement at farm level.  Further planner training will be arranged in the near future.  I am confident that the application of this agreement will go a long way towards the establishment of sustainable stocking levels in these environmentally sensitive upland areas.</P>

      <P>The Protocol concluded with the Russian veterinary authorities in October 1996 sets out the main requirements for the importation of Irish beef into the Russian Federation.

In addition to these requirements, beef exported to Russia must comply with standard veterinary and sanitary requirements.</P>

    <P>While the addition of the five counties is regrettable, it is important that a formula for the lifting of the restrictions has been agreed.  In the cases of Limerick and Cavan &mdash; both of which had four cases in 1996 &mdash; the restriction will be lifted if no new case emerges in the period up to 1 May.  It has also been agreed that normal trading arrangements will be restored when there is evidence that the level of BSE has peaked in Ireland and the number of cases have declined.  Furthermore, the Russian authorities have indicated that they are committed to the continuation of the beef trade with Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the full Russian demand for Irish beef in 1997, which will be significant, will be met by counties not involved in the restrictions and that there will be no negative impact on cattle prices or on the beef export trade as a result.  I would also point out that there are no restrictions on the export of livestock or livestock products from the excluded counties to other markets supplied by this country.</P>

      <P>A total of £873 million in direct income payments was used by the Central Statistics Office in the calculation of its advance estimate of agricultural output, input and income which was published on 9 December 1996.  This represented just over 42 per cent of estimated farm income &mdash; income from self employment and other trading incomes &mdash; in 1996.</P>
      <P>An updated estimate of Agricultural Output, Input and Income is due to be published by the CSO on 6 February 1997.  This estimate will include a revised figure for direct income payments which will be in excess of £900 million.  This will affect the proportion of income represented by direct payments but until the revised income figure is released it is not possible, of course, to say to what extent it will be affected.</P>

      <P>Following consideration of the Kearney report, I put a number of proposals to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the headage schemes in 1997 and following years.  The intention was that two of the proposals (i) implementing a ceiling of £3,000 on payments to individual farmers and (ii) reducing the higher rate of grant for Friesian cows and incalf heifers would come into effect in 1997 and the remaining two in 1998 &mdash; (iii) disallowing headage payments to farmers over 66 in receipt of <Col N="234" /> a contributory retirement pension and (iv) paying headage to farmers in areas designated as degraded under the rural environment protection scheme (REPS) only if they were participating in REPS.  As part of Partnership 2000, the Government and the farm organisations agreed that the proposal at (i) and (ii) would not come into effect until 1998 and that in the meantime negotiations would take place with a view to reaching agreement this year on equitable alternatives within the current level of OPARDF resources to the proposal at (i)  The consequential costs involved &mdash; £4 million &mdash; as a result of postponing measures (i) and (ii) will be borne by the Exchequer.</P>

I also made a grant of £50,000 to the DSPCA in September 1995.  These grants will enable both organisations to continue the important work which they undertake in relation to the welfare and care of animals.  The grants to DSPCA recognise the value of the service it provides in the Dublin area, often in difficult circumstances, while the grant to the Blue Cross marks the centenary of the organisation which was established in England in 1897.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my most recent reply to this question of 3 October 1996 last.  Until such a time as the mid-term review of the operational programme for transport 1994 is finalised, I am not in a position to say whether there will be any capacity to part-fund the Baltimore development or indeed any other suitable port project which was not identified in the original indicative programme. The review is ongoing and will be completed later in the year.</P>
