      <Quest>if it is the policy of his Department to advertise various schemes administered by his Department in provincial newspapers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As my Department administers very few schemes, it does not place advertisements in newspapers on a regular basis.  Decisions concerning which advertisements will be placed in which newspapers are taken on a case by case basis, depending on the nature and scope of the subject matter.  Factors such as the target audience and cost effectiveness are taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: The Taoiseach did not really answer the question; he said it was done on a case by case basis.  For example, with regard to local development projects and services, which are administered by his Department, would advertisements be placed in provincial or in national newspapers or in a combination of both?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some advertisements concerning local development projects were placed in newspapers serving the regions covered by grants for local development when they were administered by my Department, although they have now moved.  My officials examine what target areas they are trying to reach and newspapers are picked on that basis.  According to the figures for last year, about 14 per cent of the total expenditure went to provincial papers.  If there is a reason for such advertisements to be placed in provincial papers, they are so placed if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Would the Taoiseach agree that the provincial papers are not getting their fair share of Government advertising? Given that the purpose of advertising is to communicate a message to the greatest possible audience, that the provincial press &mdash; or the regional press as they now like to style themselves &mdash; have a total readership of £1.5 million, that local papers are read by 75 per cent of the population and <Col N="1494" /> that they represent very good value for money, would the Taoiseach not agree that it should be standard practice that virtually all advertising across all Departments, including his own, should be channelled into the provincial press as well as the national press?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has a very good record but I am aware, from correspondence I have seen, that the issues raised by the Deputy with me and with previous Ministers from his own party have been a bone of contention over the past year or so.  Departments try to target the rural press in the region to which the advertisement relates.  Where Departments want to advertise broad based schemes they will sometimes advertise in the rural press, but always in the national press.  That is the criterion that has been followed by Departments for several years on the basis that they have to ensure that what they do is cost effective.  Placing advertisements in both national and provincial papers can lead to duplication and unnecessary expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that decisions on the placing of advertisements are taken on a case by case basis.  Who takes the decisions?  Of particular relevance to the recent referendum on Cabinet confidentiality, who makes the decision on the format and readability of an advertisement, given the very serious concerns about the last referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normally the officials or the section of the Department dealing with the advertisement, not necessarily the Minister.  In the case of the recent advertisement, the <i>ad hoc</i> commission made the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Taoiseach referred to the provincial press.  In the greater Dublin area where we do not have the benefit of local newspapers, does the Taoiseach take into consideration the free sheets<i>, Southside People, Northside People</i> etc., when placing advertisements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On some occasions, yes, but research indicates that it has not happened on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider them in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have the same interest as the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach and his Ministers take a decision today to be fair to local papers because it is those papers that cover local urban and county councils and give us as politicians all the coverage we need?  Advertising should be made available to them as it is in the national newspapers.  The Taoiseach may not have the same love for local papers as I have &mdash; there are probably no local papers in Dublin.  We have three in County Mayo and they should get the <Col N="1495" /> same crack of the whip as the others.  In what paper was the advertisement inviting applications for grants to the value of £6 million?  I looked in every local and in every national paper and did not see the application form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy made a statement to ensure it got some publicity in the local papers.  In the normal course of events Departments endeavour to do this.  I like local newspapers as I tour around the country and meet their representatives continuously.  While the Deputy makes this point, representatives of national newspapers are present to hear him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a three word reply to my question on readability.  Will the Taoiseach consider appointing an individual in each Department who would be responsible for ensuring the customer can read and understand the advertisement which has been placed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question which relates to a specific matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about formatting the advertisement, one cannot blame the newspaper for the system put in place following the Supreme Court decision.  It was stated that two members of the Bar Council had to put forward the advertisement. The newspaper can only publish what it is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with indications I gave in the House on September 30 that meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation would take place on an occasional basis, I said in the House last week that I hoped a meeting of the forum could be held early next month.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is envisaged that the forum will meet on 5 December next.</P>
      <P>While our primary focus must and will be on the multi-party talks and on generating the necessary momentum in them, the forum meeting can make a useful contribution in that endeavour and I very much look forward to participating in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that there will be a meeting of the forum on December 5.  What does the Taoiseach expect will be its agenda?  What is his response to the reported remarks of Mr. Francie Molloy on Sunday <Col N="1496" /> where there was a clear threat that if the negotiations in Belfast did not proceed the way the IRA wanted them to, it would return to what he referred to euphemistically as &ldquo;what we know best&ldquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that we will be able to keep the focus on making a useful contribution to the multi-party talks and sound out the parties on their views.  The chairperson will be doing likewise and we can help by keeping ourselves focused on what is going on, the contributions of the parties and where they are at.  Bilateral and multilateral talks will be held this week and next so the forum should meet at the plenary stage.</P>
      <P>I received a report on what Francie Molloy stated at the weekend and noted the comments he made yesterday in his clarification.  He stressed that Sinn Féin is involved in a peace process, in a strategy to bring about a lasting peace through negotiations leading to agreement and if the negotiations collapsed they would return to dialogue and negotiations.  I am glad of the clarification because falling back into armed conflict is no alternative and one that I totally reject as I have stated on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in pursuing this is to ensure there is full clarity in regard to the intentions of Sinn Féin who we are led to believe are surrogates for the IRA at the peace talks.  Otherwise the rationale for them is undermined. Can we take it that Francie Molloy, in clarifying the Sinn Féin position, was also clarifying that of the IRA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I was concerned when I heard his reported remarks.  I cannot say whether they were taken out of context but I saw the extended reports he gave yesterday.  I assume they are in line with what Sinn Féin said when it put forward its position on the Mitchell principles some time ago.  That is the crucial issue.  I hope those who support or have an involvement with Sinn Féin take a similar view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that one of the problems of the last ceasefire was that Sinn Féin said one thing to its grassroots and another to the politicians with whom it had meetings in the formal arena?  Will he also agree that Mr. Molloy's remarks about a struggle, a fist and going back &ldquo;to what we know best&rdquo;, delivered at a meeting where he did not think the press were present, may have represented his true opinion? Will he further agree it is very important that the republican movement in all its manifestations explains to its grassroots that compromises are required on all sides and it is not possible to maintain militaristic rhetoric at private party functions while talking peace on formal public occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that is what Sinn Féin people will do.  They have signed up to the Mitchell <Col N="1497" /> principles and said they will abide by them. That is their position as a political party.  There have been two or three occasions since September when that has not been the case and each time the matter has been raised in the House and we have sent a clear message.  I felt obliged to report what Mr. Molloy said yesterday when he was asked to clarify these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm the arrangements for the operation of the forum which will resume on 5 December will be the same as before?  In other words, it will have the same chairperson and the same composition in terms of representatives of the various political parties.  If, as I presume, his answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, will he outline how the agenda will unfold?  His reply to the question posed by Deputy De Rossa was not very clear and focused on a report of the talks as they are ongoing.  Given that the Government will be the leading contributor, to be followed by the SDLP &mdash; there are other parties represented in the speaking sequence which are not participants in the talks &mdash; will the Taoiseach reconsider his reply and clarify it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some parties, including the Deputy's party, have asked for the forum to be reconvened and for an opportunity to be provided to debate our position in the talks.  After the chairperson makes her remarks &mdash; I do not seek to influence these &mdash; it might be useful if the parties involved in the process, including the Government, were to outline their view of the present position and to move on from there.  It would also be useful if those people not present at the talks &mdash; I am represented at them on a daily basis but other members of the Government are not &mdash; were allowed to ask questions of those involved in the forum.  These people would like an opportunity outside the talks process to put forward their views and concerns and to deal with aspects they would like to see developed.  If this is in order it could be a useful day's work.  I am not ruling out any other issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Who has been invited to attend the forum and has the Taoiseach gone beyond the list of those who attended on the last occasion?  In terms of peace and reconciliation, will the Taoiseach agree the twin objectives we need to achieve are reconciliation of the principle of self-determination north and south of the Border and consent north of the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The usual parties have been invited to attend.  During the summer I agreed with the SDLP and Sinn Féin to meet the leaders of the Northern parties every few months.  That meeting will take place on Friday week.  We have asked all the political parties in the North to attend and a number have stated their intention to do so, although I am sure everybody will not attend on that occasion.  All the work of the <Col N="1498" /> forum, the preliminary report and the final report, was based on the principle of consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>On my question about Mr. Francie Molloy, the <i>Irish Independent</i> quotes Mr. Molloy, who has not denied the statement, as saying that we have to try to face the enemy and outwit it in every way possible, by every means possible, and negotiation is simply another phase in that struggle.  Will the Taoiseach seek assurance from the Sinn Féin leadership, of which Mr. Molloy is a senior member, that that does not represent the position of Sinn Féin generally, that it is fully committed to the Mitchell principles which it has signed and which oblige it to use only political means in pursuit of its aims?  Will he request that an early statement be made to that effect in view of the necessity for the current talks to move into a substantive phase where real progress can be made in finding a settlement to the conflicting allegiances in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised that issue yesterday morning but I did not receive a reply.  I have asked my colleagues to raise the issue in the bilateral talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach attach significance to the fact that he did not get a reply when he raised the matter of the serious speech by Mr. Molloy, an experienced Sinn Féin public representative, who was quoted in the papers as referring to the struggle and the IRA, Sinn Féin and prisoners as part of one unit facing the enemy?  Is the Taoiseach concerned at the rhetoric being used at the republican grassroots and does he believe that is the best preparation of the republican grassroots for the compromise that is necessary?  Has he information on the recent punishment shooting in Poleglass?  What is the significance of that and has he expressed a view on it? Will the Taoiseach agree that at this stage it is urgent that there are private negotiations between the parties in Belfast with a view to reaching agreement within the three strands? Will he agree there are risks in having public discussions where one side reports back to its own constituency in a public way, and that the meeting called for 5 December could be seen as reporting back to one side of the argument in a public way at the mid-point of discussion, resulting in a hardening or at least fundamentalising of positions when what is needed on all sides, Unionist as well as Nationalist, is a softening and compromising of positions to reach agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Other than the security reports on the issue, I have no information on the incident at Poleglass.  Needless to say, I utterly condemn all violence of whatever kind and I make that point at every opportunity when meeting people who are in any way associated with it.  In regard to Mr. Molloy, we utterly condemn any reference to a continuation of the armed struggle and I take every opportunity to make that point. <Col N="1499" /> The clarifications made yesterday were useful. We need to hold all types of meetings.  Bilateral meetings, multilateral talks, the ongoing talks process and private meetings &mdash; of which there are many &mdash; are important.  Deputy Bruton appears to be concerned that my meeting on Friday week might not be balanced.  The Women's Coalition, the Labour Party and all other parties have been asked to attend.  It is up to them whether they attend.  By the time that meeting is over I will have met all party leaders, except Dr. Paisley, who I am ready to meet whenever he is ready to meet me.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, is holding talks with Unionists today.  There are talks with all the parties concerned almost every week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I welcome the re-establishment of the forum.  Does the Taoiseach agree a special effort will be necessary during the lifetime of this forum to involve parties other than the usual ones?  Could the agenda be organised to allow time for the bilateral contacts to which he referred?  In the public's view, the last forum relied to a great extent on plenary sessions which involved set pieces and some useful questioning, but the most useful work was done at a bilateral level</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in that regard.  The bilateral discussions that took place during the lifetime of the last forum were useful and I know all parties from Northern Ireland supported them.  I will try to facilitate such talks on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the forum simply being reconvened and the reference to the &ldquo;last forum&rdquo; misleading? Will the operational procedures of the forum simply be reactivated?  Although we have facilitated and financed the forum, it is not a creature of this House.  Will the Taoiseach ensure the participants of the forum which last met are properly notified of the meeting on Friday week &mdash; I am not aware a subsequent meeting is envisaged &mdash; and that the co-ordinating committee that agrees the agenda has sufficient time to meet in advance to ensure issues are raised in a productive manner?  Unless such preparatory work is done, the forum will not be as productive as we would like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for welcoming the re-establishment of the forum.  The same process that applied previously, but which was not always satisfactory, will apply.  I often found out what happened at those committee meetings approximately an hour before the forum met.  As the leader of the largest parliamentary party in the House, I found that very unsatisfactory.  I will try to avoid meetings of the <Col N="1500" /> small administrative committee on the morning the forum meets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be useful if there had been more consultation before this decision was announced.  There was not substantive consultation with me about the matter.  While I will support any initiative taken by the Taoiseach to facilitate the process, I am not sure this initiative has been properly thought out.  Consultations should take place between us, Deputy Quinn, Deputy De Rossa and others in the next few days so that we get something worthwhile.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will keep an open mind on whether this is the best date to have the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with working out the arrangements.  We have been trying to get a suitable date for six weeks.  Neither I nor the Government picked the date; it was chosen by others and I facilitated it.  It does not suit me but I went along with the Northern parties and the chairperson.  I will try to make the arrangements Deputy Quinn suggests, but it is not totally in our hands.  The other parties are deeply engaged in another process, unlike the way they operated previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The Customer Services Action Plan for the Department of the Taoiseach, which I was pleased to launch on Wednesday, 12 November, has a number of key features.  It sets out clearly details of the services provided and the structures to deliver those services.  It specifies the standards which have been set and which will be achieved over the next two years for the delivery of these services.  It details the arrangements for getting in touch with my Department by telephone, letter and personal visit.  It explains the arrangements for consulting customers on the services being provided.  It outlines the arrangements for monitoring and review on a regular basis and for reporting on the achievement of targets.</P>
      <P>This action plan was developed in consultation with the staff of the Department of the Taoiseach. Everyone working in the Department recognises and is committed to their role in achieving the commitments in the plan.  Where necessary, changes to systems and structures, including allocation of resources, will be made in support of the delivery of a quality service.  There are no proposals to appoint additional staff to oversee the implementation of the plan.</P>
      <P>On 7 November 1997 I delivered the opening address to an IPA conference on governance and accountability in the public sector.  During my speech I mentioned a number of measures I would like to see advanced, including a package of measures on regulatory reform to remove the barriers for important economic sectors, such as small and medium enterprises, and to provide clarity and accessibility to ordinary citizens.  The SMI working group on regulatory reform has made recommendations in this area which are under consideration.  I hope a package of measures, drawing on these recommendations, can be brought forward next year for implementation. This will require consultation with Departments and offices.  Consideration must also be given to the timing of the introduction of these measures because of a number of ongoing initiatives under the SMI Partnership 2000 modernisation programme which Departments and offices must deal with in the coming months.</P>

      <P>During the Taoiseach's speech to the IPA conference he referred to a package of measures on regulatory reform.  To what type of regulatory reform did he refer?  He mentioned removing the barriers for important economic sectors, such as small and medium enterprises, and providing clarity and accessibility to ordinary citizens.  What regulations is he proposing to reform and do they only apply to the Department of the Taoiseach or to other Departments as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Taoiseach's view on the treatment of people who contact his Department as customers? <Col N="1502" /> Customers are generally understood to be people who avail of a service for which they pay.  However, we are not talking about that type of service.  Would it be better to frame this in the context of citizens availing of the services of the Department of the Taoiseach since we are not talking about a tangible product which is being bought and sold?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The titles have been taken from Delivering Better Government.  The then Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, held a conference at which these titles were agreed, following the deliberations of each Department and how they understood the initiative.  It was decided to give the title &ldquo;customer&rdquo; to all their callers; perhaps the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; would have been better.</P>
      <P>On regulatory reform and reducing red tape, Delivering Better Government set out 12 priorities. The working group looked at issues it thought worth tackling.  Some of those initiatives I referred to on 7 November have been mentioned by the Deputy.  It focused on people having a check list to decide whether the regulation was a good idea, whether there was another way round it, whether it should cease by a certain date and the clarity of the regulation.  It examined all the initiatives and believes its recommendations would be better and less bureaucratic than the present system where regulations tend to be complicated, cumbersome and continue forever.  The working group has now worked its way through the lengthy report and 12 priorities will be given immediate consideration.  It is a detailed report and will be worked on over time.  I do not believe this can be done in the short term.  The programme agreed last April will continue to next April and I have no doubt it will achieve the targets set out.  It wishes to improve the quality rather than the quantity of regulations issued; to eliminate unnecessary and inefficient regulations, including legislation; to simplify necessary regulations and relax procedures as much as possible; to lower the cost of regulatory compliance; to make regulations more accessible to the public and in each case protecting the public interest. Those are the benchmark points set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The SMI working group has also identified from the programme carried out some years ago on the small and medium sized industries its frustrations and the compliance costs to small industries of regulatory powers and asked that they be examined.  That process which is a detailed one is proceeding.  It states that apart from all new regulations which should commence from now the working group should try to look at all existing regulations.  That is a mammoth task.  The previous Attorney General did a useful exercise in putting all the legislation since the foundation of <Col N="1503" /> the State and before on computer.  Similarly, it should look at regulations but that is a longer process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the most tangible method available to the Government to compensate the SME sector for the bureaucracy and red tape is through the corporation tax regime?  If so, will he commit the Government to building on the progress made by the previous Government by introducing a tiered arrangement of corporation tax for the small business sector and further reduce the rate and increase the thresholds at which small companies pay at the lower rate?  While I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to look at the whole question of bureaucracy and red tape facing the SME sector can we have assurances, in our search to lift the burden from the sector, that there will be no discrimination against employees who are working for smaller companies, no diminution in health and safety regulations, holiday and pay entitlements or any other worker protection regulations in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any budgetary commitments today but I will pass on the Deputy's points on corporation tax and the thresholds for SMEs to the Minister for Finance.  On compliance costs, as the Deputy knows, the 1993-4 report made clear that the regulatory framework for SMEs is cumbersome and costly.  The SMI process on regulatory reform which has been ongoing for at least 12 months is a useful one. Because of time restrictions it is difficult however to get everyone to work together.  That is the reason launches and promotions are necessary. We can undo some of the regulations in place.</P>

      <P>What plans does the Taoiseach have to amend the legislation relating to the Ombudsman as promised in the speech to which Deputy Creed referred?  Who, in the Taoiseach's mind, are the customers of his Department and what means should he use to communicate with them to indicate the services available from his office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation relating to the Ombudsman is under examination.  It was stated in the programme for Government that a number of aspects would be looked at.  That is being done. As the Deputy is aware, the Ombudsman has made a lengthy submission in which he has indicated the areas where the Act should be amended.  The customers of the Department of the Taoiseach &mdash; and all other Departments &mdash; are those who contact it by telephone, letter or in person.  The SMI was the title given to the process under the Deputy's reign.  I do not disagree with it, the officials of the Department have found it a useful title to which to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinct philosophy underlying the theory that a person who approaches a Department is a customer who, by definition, does not have specific rights whereas a citizen does.  It is important to maintain within the public service an ethos of public service to citizens, not just those who lift a telephone to make an inquiry.  There are millions who will never contact the Department of the Taoiseach by telephone but who are entitled as citizens to a service.  Therefore the idea of treating someone as a customer has its limitations.  The notion of service to the citizen should be pre-eminent under the strategic management initiative.  Will the Taoiseach also draw a distinction in promoting the strategic management initiative between protecting the public interest and the rights and responsibilities of citizens?  The public interest can change depending on the context of a given issue whereas the rights and responsibilities of citizens continue regardless of the circumstances of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to enter into an argument on an interpretation of the difference between the terms &ldquo;customer&rdquo; and &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;.  We are now endeavouring to motivate staff into taking greater interest in and having greater understanding of problems encountered by members of the public rather than see a continuance of a public service once considered an overall bureaucracy.</P>

      <P>The service is good within its limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>While that is the concept, I accept those limitations.  Nonetheless, the overall issue should not be viewed from that aspect only. As the Deputy will know, the provisions of the Public Service (Management) Act have been implemented since 1 September last, the regulatory reform I have just mentioned to Deputy Creed &mdash; a much broader statement of strategy covering citizens' rights and a quality customer service &mdash; in addition to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, which is very citizen-orientated, will come into being on 1 April <Col N="1505" /> next.  From that date, all Departments, unless otherwise excluded, will have to provide members of the public with details of everything on record about them.  While there has been a huge surge forward on all of these issues, the real difficulty is in ensuring that all of those involved perceive their additional efforts as worthwhile &mdash; not involving new jobs, recruitment or promotions - and meaningful to the public generally. While it entails much extra work hopefully it will render State services generally more humane than has been the case for many decades past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the use of the word &ldquo;customer&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; may be of little comfort to citizens although perhaps of some comfort to non-citizens such as various asylum seekers awaiting the enactment of the Refugee Act, which is probably for another day.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach view this action plan as affording an opportunity to put in place a bi-lingual service, not simply for those fluent in one or other language but rather for those who speak English but who would wish to have English and Irish versions of documentation available?  This would be a new departure and recognise some people's wish to use Irish even though they may not be sufficiently fluent to use it to the exclusion of English?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is built into the action plan.  I know that there is a cross-departmental effort to deal with a number of difficulties, for example, in endeavouring to shorten the period within which letters are answered and have a departmental official communicate with a correspondent in the interim, dealing with regular arguments that arise about the use of names, addresses and so on, all constituting part of the overall service to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach will be overseeing the delivery of such services to consumers across all Departments, including that of the Environment and Local Government, will he guarantee that whenever a consumer establishes contact or corresponds with a Department or a local authority, he or she will be assured of a reply within a reasonable period, say, a fortnight to three weeks?  In addition, will he ensure that those who attend public offices to discuss very personal matters such as a history of bad health, personal means or whatever will be guaranteed a private hearing rather than having to discuss such affairs in front of a queue of others?  Does he agree that, if we could begin with those few but important issues, we shall have begun to provide an efficient vital service to the consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They are two fundamentals. I believe Departments have agreed on the criterion that replies to correspondence received must be issued within 15 days.  In addition, a number of Government offices have begun to provide proper, appropriate interview rooms.  It is our aim <Col N="1506" /> to make such provisions readily available across State offices and services.  I agree it is unsatisfactory that people should be forced to discuss very personal matters, even if not entirely in public, across counters, through grills or in front of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. E. O'Keeffe):</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, who is at a Council of Ministers' meeting in Brussels.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Coveney on his appointment as spokesperson on Agriculture.  He continues to track me both in private and public life. Twenty years ago we were both involved in the commercial world when he was president of the Cork Chamber of Commerce at a time of difficult urban-rural relations.  He, as an urban man, and I, as a rural person, proposed an initiative to bring urban and rural people together at business level.  We can look back on that as a great success. No doubt through working together he, my colleagues and I will improve the agricultural sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 1 November 1997, 323 brucellosis infected herds were restricted in accordance with the requirements of trading, Directive 64/432.  A number of other herds were restricted as a precautionary measure under national rules.  I have been concerned for a variety of reasons at the increased incidence of this disease.  Following consultation with the Animal Health Forum, I have taken a series of measures and initiatives to address the problem.  These include the following: undertaking milk ring testing on lactating cattle on a monthly basis as opposed to the previous arrangement whereby four tests were carried out at six weekly intervals in the period April to September; an awareness-education programme directed specifically at farmers, focused mainly on promoting effective herd management and health protection practices including prudent buying from reliable sources &mdash; an advice pack outlining the essential measures required to protect their herds was sent to all herd owners in September; detailed epidemiological investigations by my Department's veterinary inspectors into brucellosis <Col N="1507" /> breakdowns; and a major revamping of the compensation regime aimed at encouraging farmers to purchase eligible cattle from reliable sources, confine purchases to cattle which have passed brucellosis blood tests within the previous 60 days in the herds from which they are bought and test such cattle again within 30 days of purchase. Full details of the compensation changes were forwarded to each herd owner by post.</P>
    <P>In view of the continuing determination in this situation, I am satisfied further measures are now required to combat the disease.  I will meet farming and veterinary interests on Thursday next in the Animal Health Forum.  Following this, I will decide on any further measures to be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his opening statements.  We worked together before either of us entered public life but I am not sure whether we benefited from that.  In any event, I am happy to work with him again and I wish him well too.</P>
      <P>This question is of such importance I must press the Minister on it.  It was very specific.  It was whether Ireland's officially brucellosis free status is being endangered.  My only source of information is the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, last week's issue of which included a precise detailed county by county report which came up with a figure of 296 for net restricted herds.  This number is so close to the limit that by now, for all I know, it may have been exceeded.  I do not want to exaggerate the implications of that &mdash; the Minister knows them better than I.</P>
      <P>The question of the need to introduce unpopular measures, such as pre-movement testing, has arisen and I note the Minister will meet the interested parties on Thursday.  If that trend in restricted herds were to continue, it is almost unnecessary for me to tell the Minister that the consequences are so serious that unpopular measures would have to be taken.  We cannot allow our brucellosis free status to be eroded under any circumstances after all the cattle business has been through.  Will the Minister comment on the seriousness of the situation?  Are we at the point of endangering Ireland's brucellosis free status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no denying the fact that the situation is serious and deteriorating. That is the reason the Animal Health Forum is meeting next Thursday.  Prior to 1996, the incidence of brucellosis was relatively stable.  In 1995, just 189 herds were restricted.  In 1996, 313 herds were restricted at year end.  Approximately 57 of these herds had two or more clear tests but as a precaution they were held for further testing, leaving 256 herds restricted under EU legislation. As a sizeable number of herds had just one reactor, that position was not cause for concern.  The most recent data at 1 November indicates that approximately 323 herds are restricted under EU legislation.  New herd breakdowns are computed <Col N="1508" /> at 681.  A total of 224 herds have been depopulated to date in 1997.  The spend on brucellosis compensation is significant.  Approximately £8 million has been spent to the end of October 1997 compared to approximately £4.7 million in October 1996.  This equates to an increase of 66.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me a specific question about the pre-movement tests.  If it is necessary, and it appears it will be necessary but it is a matter for the Animal Health Forum, pre-movement tests of the order of 30 days will be put in place in addition to any other measures that are necessary. My Department and the Minister will not stand back from the problem as we realise the seriousness of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to introduce a further buy-out package.  A scheme operated as recently as 1993 whereby farmers could buy out their annuities at a discount of 50 per cent on the outstanding capital provided any arrears were also paid.</P>
      <P>Inspectors from my Department are currently visiting all farmers who have arrears of £2,000 and over with a view to assessing the reasons for non-payment.  If it is found that the annuity is excessive relative to the earning capacity of the farm and the family circumstances, it is intended to capitalise the arrears and to reduce the repayments to a more reasonable level which will result in an extension of the repayment period.  On the other hand, if it is found there is no good reason for non-payment, my Department will have to consider taking legal action on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely serious problem in the midlands and in the Minister of State's county.  A number of farmers did not avail of the <Col N="1509" /> 1993 scheme for various reasons; some farmers living on their own omitted to participate in the scheme.  A case can be made for the reintroduction of another buy-out scheme at attractive terms.  Will the Minister of State agree that many farmers would by now have discharged their capital commitments?  This type of payment puts an enormous strain on the resources of farmers.  The Minister of State will agree to restructure the payments but is it also correct that if farmers do not honour those restructured payments, the Department of Finance will deduct the payments from premiums and area aid?  Is that the position or will an appeals system be set up whereby people can make a case if they are experiencing particular difficulties?  Such an appeals system would give these people an opportunity to request an extension of the repayment period.  This problem is particularly acute in the midlands where the livestock industry, the bedrock of many farm families, has experienced a tough 12 months.  In light of the BSE crisis and the cut in export refunds, will the Minister of State agree to reconsider the possibility of introducing a new buy-out scheme? Will the Minister of State confirm how many farmers and what moneys are involved in the annuity system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 8,000 farmers have long-term annuity and rental commitments amounting to £1,895,279.  A breakdown of the amount in regard to land given to farmers by the Land Commission highlights the reasoning behind what we said.  A total of 4,595 farmers or 58 per cent of them have a commitment of £50 per annum; 1,109 farmers or 14 per cent have a commitment of between £50 and £100 per annum involving an annual amount of £155,427; 1,835 farmers or 23 per cent have a commitment of between £100 and £500 per annum; 358 farmers or 4 per cent have a commitment of between £500 and £1,000 per annum and 80 farmers have a commitment of £1,000 or more per annum.  That involves a total of 7,977 farmers.  Some 95 per cent of farmers have annuities of less than £500 and, irrespective of their farm size, that should not be a substantial burden.  I was involved in groups and delegations that looked for farms to be divided in the past.  They were enthusiastic about that, even when farm land was valued at £3,000 per acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 3,240 farmers owe arrears of £276,798 in respect of the May-June instalments; 4,738 farmers owe arrears of £4,255,857 in respect of May-June and earlier instalments; and 1,038 farmers owe arrears of £23l,251 in respect of earlier instalments. The majority of farmers have a commitment of under £50 per annum and 95 per cent have one of under £500 per annum.  Inspectors are inspecting and assessing the case of farmers with a problem in that regard.  Many farmers who called to the office in Castlebar to discuss their case got a hearing and have had their payments restructured.  Many are ignoring their arrears of <Col N="1510" /> payments in the hope that they will be abolished. However, this is taxpayers' money and it must be recouped as best as possible.  Those who can afford to pay should make every effort to do so over a period of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>A small number of producers of cereals and other crops were severely affected by weather-related crop losses this year.  Details of a scheme to provide assistance are being finalised in my Department and I hope to make an announcement in the very near future.</P>
      <P>In the case of cereal producers, my first priority was to expedite payment of EU area aid, which this year will amount to some £95 million.  I am pleased to indicate that 94 per cent of these payments had issued by the end of October.  More have issued since then and only a relatively small number remain to be paid.  I have also decided to increase the national element of compensation for agri-monetary losses to cereal producers from £0.8 million to £1.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I need hardly tell the Minister of State who was very vocal on this issue that the combination of a large price fall and dreadful weather in August has been disastrous for cereal growers, particularly those in the south and south east, especially in Wexford, Cork and Waterford. Will the Minister of State confirm if a sizeable compensation package will be available and, if so, can he indicate the amount of that package?</P>
      <P>There is widespread concern among cereal growers that the brief given to Teagasc confines it to looking only at cereal growers who have not harvested because of the condition of their crops. Many farmers tried to harvest in practicably impossible conditions.  Will these be allowed to make a case?  I am not seeking a decision on the final outcome of such cases, but people who tried to harvest their crops are facing real hardship. Their efforts seem to have precluded them from compensation because of the brief given to Teagasc.</P>
      <P>The Government has an opportunity to return money to grain growers who suffered by using the national green £ revaluation matching the EU funds.  This would amount to a maximum of £3 million and is within the discretion of the Government. I would like the Minister to say whether there will be a compensation package; how much will it amount to; whether the Teagasc brief will remain as restrictive as it appears and whether a green £ revaluation aid to the cereal sector will be considered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already referred to an increase from £0.08 million to £1.6 million regarding the green £.  The prolonged period of broken weather in August &mdash; and the Deputy must agree there was a very difficult period in the first days of August in the south east and that much damage was done to crops &mdash; resulted in the most difficult harvest period for many years.  Freak weather conditions in south Wexford, Waterford and south Cork caused severe damage to many crops, some of which were not capable of being harvested.  While national yield was the second highest since CAP reform at an estimated 1.9 million tonnes, quality in general was below normal with spring sown crops being worst affected.</P>
      <P>Approximately 15,000 applicants will be paid area aid and the average payment will be approximately £6,000.  Most of it has been paid. This is an average of £111 per acre.  The average price for barley, wheat and oats crops will be in excess of £75 per tonne according to the information available to us.  Wheat prices will probably be much higher than this while oats prices will be lower and barley prices will be in between.</P>
      <P>At present departmental approval is being sought for the compensation package.  The Deputy is aware a supplementary estimate will be brought forward in the House tomorrow.  We will then be in a position to detail the amount of money being made available to cereal producers. I know the Deputy will not be disappointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Teagasc report has been with the Department for some time.  Teagasc worked on the brief given it.  The Deputy is also aware that many meetings took place between the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and the banking institutions which were sympathetic.  Much support work has been done by the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Minister.  We are very committed to supporting cereal producers who form part of the economic fabric of agriculture.  It is vital they are successful. We have done everything we can.  The Teagasc report has been concluded.  It mainly concerned uncut crops of which there was a substantial number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reply. Effectively, he is saying those who were badly affected but did some harvesting will not be considered for compensation.  If this is the case then it is unfair and inequitable to exclude those who tried to harvest but failed to get a return.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows the farming business as well as I do.  Many crops were not fit for harvesting because of weather and ground conditions and the inability of farmers to work with machinery, even with double wheels.  People who experienced those kinds of harvesting problems <Col N="1512" /> will be looked after.  In other areas, I can only work from the information available to me. The figures I have provided state that the average price for the three major crops is in the region of £75 per tonne.  The price for wheat is higher than that figure and that for oats is lower.  We are satisfied that there was quite a good outcome to this harvest; practically all of the grain was harvested in wet conditions.  Teagasc has assessed each case where crops were uncut.  Reports have been made available and we must await tomorrow's outcome.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>the number of headage and cow suckler grants paid to farmers under the 1997 schemes on 31 October 1997; the number of farmers who remain to be paid; the reason farmers have not received their due payments as per the Charter of Rights; if he will intervene in the area aid section of his Department to allow payments to be made on evidence from the 1996 application year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19538/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that in the period since 1 January 1997, £630 million has been paid to farmers under the various EU livestock and arable aid schemes of which £378 million relates to payments made under the 1997 schemes.  The number of payments made to date in 1997 is 1,239,022 compared to a total of 1,010,029 payments made in the period 1 January to 31 December 1996.  Apart from the normal premia and headage scheme payments, my Department has made 400,000 extra payments to date this year valued at £65 million under the various BSE and agri-monetary compensation schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payments under the 1997 disadvantaged areas headage schemes commenced on 28 September 1997 and, to date, 60 per cent of applicants have been paid £67.6 million; 50,161 cases were paid at 31 October representing more than 40 per cent of the applicants, a position comparable to that achieved in 1996.  Payments under the 1997 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 October 1997 which is the earliest possible commencement date under EU regulations and £85 million was paid to 94 per cent of applicants within one week of commencement of payments.  The position is that £89 million has been paid to 99 per cent of arable aid applicants.  This compares with the position in 1996 when, at 23 October, one week after commencement of payment, only 2,000 applicants had been paid a total of £9.1 million.  Advance payments <Col N="1513" /> under the 1997 special beef premium and suckler cow schemes commenced on 1 and 3 November 1997 respectively.  The EU regulations governing payment under these schemes provide that payment cannot commence before 1 November and this year the regulations stipulate that only 60 per cent entitlement can be made by way of advance payment.  In 1996 the regulations allowed for an advance payment of 80 per cent entitlement.  To date, £79.6 million has been paid under the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes.</P>
    <P>A major factor contributing to the payment in both 1996 and this year is the EU requirement for the introduction of computerised land parcel identification systems, LPIS.  The original deadline for full implementation of the LPIS was 1 January 1996.  This was later changed to 1 January 1997 because of the difficulties being experienced in implementing the system in many member states.  The LPIS requires what is effectively a 100 per cent computerised check on all land parcels submitted by farmers on the area aid declarations. This ensures that farmers are not overclaiming on individual parcels of land or that two or more farmers are not claiming on the same land parcel.  In 1997, area aid applications were issued to farmers on which were pre-printed the details of all land parcels submitted by those farmers in 1996.  Maps showing the locations of the land parcels were also issued and farmers were advised to make whatever changes were required so that the information would reflect the position in 1997.  Of the 135,000 area aid applications which were issued, 50,000 were returned with changes to the 1996 data.  These changes have been re-digitised on the LPIS database.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that, this year, priority was accorded to making payments under the 1997 arable aid scheme in view of the very severe harvest conditions, to which Deputy Coveney referred, which affected some parts of the country. The prioritising of arable aid payments has had some impact on the delivery of payments under the 1997 disadvantaged areas headage schemes.</P>
    <P>In view of the volume and the value of these payments and the fact that the vast bulk of the money comes directly from the EU, it is imperative to ensure there are control systems in place which conform with EU and national audit requirements.  In 1995, the EU Commission published new regulations on the accreditation of paying agencies such as my Department.  The regulations set out clear criteria relating to the levels of checks and controls, including on-farm inspections and office checks which must be in place.  These controls must be capable of satisfying international audit standards and each paying agency's accounts are now audited by independent auditors on an annual basis before being submitted to the EU Commission for clearance. It would not be appropriate, therefore, for my Department to take any action which would jeopardise this accredited status.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> The Department is making every effort to clear all area aid applications other than a small minority of intractable cases by the end of this month so that payments can be made during the next two to three weeks.</P>

Can we expect the Department to validate the 22,000 other maps in a shorter time than the six months it took the Department to deal with <Col N="1515" /> 24,000 maps?  I stood in the rain outside a livestock mart in Tuam yesterday and farmers told me they are bitter that their income is not coming in the post.  One in two farmers did not receive anything, irrespective of the figures from the Department.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister of State or the Minister direct that the 1996 payment schedule be brought into operation to pay the outstanding amounts?  In six months the Department could claw back the other 40 per cent payment the farmers will not now get.  Can that be done?  It is only four weeks to Christmas and if something is not done this week at least 30,000 farmers will not get the cheque in the post and, despite the Minister of State's reply, thousands of them will not be paid by next January or February.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Connaughton that people are outraged about headage payments. Yesterday I met a man at the mart who said there will be no Santa Claus this year unless he gets his payment.  Deputy Connaughton proposed that payments should be made on last year's area aid forms.  If there is a problem, the money could be reclaimed next year.  There was a commitment made in the charter of rights that farmers would receive payments by 31 October but that has not happened.  A commitment was given in the programme for Government that farmers would receive headage payments on time.  Farmers in the west and elsewhere faced the same bad weather conditions as arable farmers in the south.  It is time to make this payment otherwise many farmers will not enjoy Christmas.</P>

It was vital to give priority to arable area aid because of the disastrous harvest this year and an allowance must be made for that.  The majority of payments will be made as quickly as possible.  We are looking at how we can improve the system and make it easier on the personnel involved so that they will not have to work in three shifts and work overtime at weekends to try to send out the payments.</P>

If a farmer inadvertently states it is a heifer rather than a male animal, it takes six to eight weeks for that problem to be solved.  Such a problem should be solved by return of post.  There should be a 48 hour appeals system.  The slowness of the system is causing angst among the farming community.

      <P>I would like to think it would be that simple, but both Deputy Penrose and I know several mistakes are made on application forms.  I would appreciate it if people double checked and triple checked them because their mistakes only serve to delay payments.  Unlike last year when the work was contracted out to a firm in Dundalk, it is being carried out this year by contractors in the area aid unit in the Department. That was recommended by the audit and was supposed to be an improvement.  The audit contains certain strictures and, if one reads this morning's papers, it will be seen why they exist.  Certain &ldquo;blips&rdquo; occur occasionally which damage our case for further aid in other areas.  Nonetheless, all area aid will be paid within the next two to three weeks.</P>

      <Quest>whether farmers whose lands are in environmentally sensitive areas will have to join the REP scheme to secure their headage and premia schemes; if so, the number of farmers who will be affected; the numbers affected for each county; the restrictions, if any, of this measure for farms exceeding the one hundred acre limit; and if he will give details of the improved REP scheme package being made available to farmers in 1998 for environmentally sensitive areas.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to special areas of conservation and overgrazed areas.  Under the terms of an agreement reached with the farm bodies in February this year, farmers with lands designated as special areas of conservation or overgrazed areas must farm in accordance with an approved agri-environmental plan.  Farmers will have the option of participating in either a REP scheme operated by my Department or a national scheme operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>The proposed package for SACs and overgrazed areas will provide for payment of ewe premia and headage to farmers in these areas dependent on their following an approved agri-environmental plan under either scheme.  The introduction of this requirement is conditional upon the satisfactory completion of current negotiations between my Department and the European Commission on the revised REPS package.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 10,000 farmers in the SACs and overgrazed areas combined.  The designation process for SACs is not yet complete and, therefore, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county.</P>
      <P>It is a condition of REPS that the participating farmer includes all his lands and carries out his/her farming activities in accordance with the agri-environmental plan and in compliance with the scheme conditions.</P>
      <P>The improved REPS package is under negotiation with the European Commission.  I will make an announcement as soon as agreement is reached on this package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister reached an agreement with the EU concerning farmers who lease commonage?  It is an ongoing problem and the largest percentage of unpaid farmers is in Mayo. Will it be compulsory for farmers in NHAs and SACs to be in a REP scheme to receive headage payments?  Will the people who have genuine commonage which has been in their name or their family name for generations receive their REPS payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone in a lease under the old system will continue to be paid.  The EU agreement is not yet finalised.  It will be compulsory to be in the REP and headage payments schemes. That is part of an agreement with the EU.  Europe is insisting on cross compliance and it has been agreed by member states.  It affects about 10,000 farmers, of whom 300 are already in the REP <Col N="1519" /> scheme.  The improved package will mean substantial payments to encourage farmers into cross compliance which will help in every area.  The Deputy's last question referred to leased commonage.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy. Unfortunately, an EU audit in August this year raised a question.  We have to look carefully at the situation.  It has to be recognised that the REP scheme alone will involve an increase of 43 per cent, from £101 million to £145 million.  This shows the trend.  This is supplemented by £11 million from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and a further £3 million in turbary rights on bogs.  A huge amount of money is coming in.  It is important that people are encouraged to enter cross compliance and that we get this money for them and for those areas for which there is no other source of income.  Hopefully, at the end of the REP scheme agreement we are finalising with the EU, there will be a good deal of detail and money for people going under cross compliance.  Environmentally it will be a perfect situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the new REP scheme stipulate that the amount of hill commonage a farmer is allowed to use against his lowland commonage will be 2:1?  Is the Minister of State aware that this would be very disadvantageous to hill sheep farmers, particularly those in Connemara and Mayo, who have a lot more hill than lowland commonage?  This can be as much as 5:1, 6:1 and even 10:1.  Where farmers are reducing their stock numbers on commonage, will the new scheme mean that the stocking base rate will be taken as an average of all those with shareholdings in a commonage whether or not they ever had stock on that commonage?  The present scheme stipulates that those with stock on the commonage can be allowed a stocking rate for the commonage and can reduce accordingly.  Are these changes <Col N="1520" /> proposed?  If they are proposed, is the Minister of State aware that they would have serious repercussions for the REP scheme in the overstocked areas of Connemara and Mayo?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>In refusing applicants entry to the REP scheme the Department of Agriculture and Food has used terms such as &ldquo;environmental gain&rdquo;, which refers to farming in commonage areas.  However, farming of any importance cannot take place, especially on the west coast, without the inclusion of such areas under a REP scheme.  How can the Department refuse applicants on the basis that no environmental gain will accrue?  What will an applicant have to do or refrain from doing to maintain environmental gain?  Is it a new cliché introduced by the Department to refuse payment to an applicant under the REP scheme?  The Minister of State may be familiar with the case in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Applicants will join the scheme on the basis that they will stop overgrazing in many areas that are being destroyed and will give plants and grass a chance to regenerate.  Last August the EU audit ascertained that, before money was provided under the REP scheme, nothing was being done in commonage areas because there were no water courses requiring protection and no stone walls, fences or ditches to be restored. In view of this, the best approach was to get into the SAC areas, where payments are made to bring down the animal population of the overgrazed areas.  Substantial payments have been made in compensation for not overgrazing in areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments made by the Minister of State regarding the environmental aspects of the case.  Some farmers in the designated regions under the agri-environmental <Col N="1521" /> scheme are worried about the rules and regulations, which, if fully implemented, would result in an environmentally friendly countryside without farmers.  This may have arisen because the Department of Agriculture and Food did not draw up these rules and regulations.  Will the Minister of State assure farmers they will be able to undertake their normal duties while complying with the provisions of this scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Both schemes are related, which is why money is being made available.  Some assume it is money for jam; it is not.  The money is made available to undertake work necessary to farm properly and to keep costs down.  Some of the money will be a help towards the incomes of applicants.  It is not applicable to those engaged in intensive farming but to those who need alternative enterprises, or who may not be able to afford to farm intensively because of the condition of their land.  It is a growing scheme.  There are currently 30,000 farmers in the REP scheme; we hope there will be 43,000 in the scheme by the end of 1999.  We are looking for a ten year extension for the scheme from Brussels, which will allow us develop a major plan.  There is no point in allowing people slip out of the system after five years &mdash; they should be paid for a further ten years.  It is well known that Commissioner Fischler is very enthusiastic about environmental farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the press report to which the Deputy refers.  While it is my general policy &mdash; for reasons I am sure the Deputy can appreciate &mdash; not to comment on individual investigations involving my Department, I can state that no such investigation has been carried out; neither has my Department been provided with any information which would be the basis of such an investigation.</P>
      <P>During the first ten months of 1997, 57 persons were convicted for offences relating to illegal growth promoters, including clenbuterol; the comparable figure for 1996 was 46.  These offences were committed some considerable time ago.</P>
      <P>Synthetic derivatives of the natural hormone oestradiol have been found to be used in combination with other substances, such as so-called &ldquo;hormone cocktails&rdquo;, for illegal growth promotion. This is not a new development.  The laboratory services available to the State routinely test for derivatives of oestradiol and a variety of anabolic agents in both tissues taken from animals and in medicinal products found during investigations.  In addition, the Government laboratories are in contact with their counterparts in other member states with a view to ensuring the most sensitive testing methods are available. These contacts include the community reference laboratories which have overall responsibility for monitoring trends in the area of residue surveillance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on evidence of the extensive residue <Col N="1523" /> testing carried out by my Department, there has been a consistent decline in the use of illegal growth promoters of all sorts.  In 1993, slightly over 4 per cent of samples tested were positive; this has declined every year since and in 1996 0.29 per cent of samples tested were positive for illegal growth promoters.  Preliminary results for the first nine months of 1997 indicate this trend is continuing &mdash; of 64,000 samples tested, 24, or 0.03 per cent, have been positive for the presence of illegal growth promoters.  No animals or carcases have tested positive for clenbuterol so far in 1997.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to reiterate my policy in this area that any person involved in abuses in the area of veterinary medicine will be pursued with the full rigours of the law.</P>

The Minister of State stated in his reply that no investigation was taking place and that no information had been made available to his Department on which to base such an investigation. Is he saying that the newspaper report is untrue?  That is a straight question and the record should be clear on this matter.  If the article is untrue and no investigation took place in the Department, has the Department written to the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> since 19 October or contacted that newspaper in any other way to correct the record?  This is a very serious report and must be causing considerable worry to the management and directors of the many marts in south Munster to which the Minister of State referred.

      <P>There are ongoing investigations within my Department at all times.  It is very vigilant in the area of investigations into animals and plants.  These are carried out under the Animal Remedies Act, 1993, which provides a <Col N="1524" /> comprehensive basis for the regulation of agricultural and animal remedies.  The Act provides that all animal remedies require specific individual authorisation and any remedy not so authorised is deemed to be prohibited, as is any animal remedy which is not used according to its authorisation. The powers are enforced under national and European provisions to prevent the use of growth promoters and concentrates in three key areas: supply and distribution, use on farms and place of detention and slaughter, or, in the case of live exports, port of embarkation.</P>
      <P>Investigating officers have extensive powers. They may enter and search lands, vehicles and premises, including meat processing plants, to take samples of any animal or substance to test for illegal substances.  They may retain any animal, plant or machine.  They may seize documents or any other evidence which may relate to a suspected offence, and they may require persons to give information relating to documents, animals or other matters.  They may search persons and seize any evidence found.  The Garda may arrest persons suspected of an offence without warrant. Animals found to have been treated with illegal substances are deemed unfit for human consumption. Such animals are permanently branded and are not allowed into the food chain.  Carcases obtained at point of slaughter are denatured and destroyed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>At a personal level, I was shocked and revolted at revelations of the appalling abuse suffered by a young girl, some details of which are now in the public domain.  It is a dreadful situation for any young person or for any family to find themselves in and, as a parent, I feel deeply for them.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to say anything which could add to the trauma experienced by the child and her family.  I do not, therefore, propose to respond in detail to the questions which have been addressed to me in the specific case.  I ask the House to accept that all our comments on this case should be characterised by a deep concern for the plight of the girl and her family.  We must also bear in mind that aspects of the case are today being considered <i>in camera</i> by the courts.</P>
      <P>However, I want to be as helpful as I can to the House having regard to these considerations. I assure the House the Eastern Health Board has taken all appropriate steps to ensure the girl's safety and well-being.  All of her medical and related needs are being provided for and, indeed, the board's professional and caring approach is fully acknowledged.  Certain of the questions which have been addressed to me are based on an assumption that a definitive decision has been taken on the pregnancy.  As of now, I am not so aware.  It is most important that the girl and her family be given the time and space to consider the complex issues involved and to avail of the best advice available to them.  I ask Deputies to be mindful of this.  I am anxious to avoid hypothetical speculation at this stage in view of decisions yet to be made by the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Deputy Shatter's question, guidelines have been issued by the Department of Health and Children on reporting, investigation and management of alleged cases of child abuse.  These guidelines due to be reviewed shortly by a group under the aegis of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, have been supplemented by detailed operational <Col N="1527" /> protocols prepared by health agencies for their staff.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raises the question as to whether we should issue additional guidelines to deal with situations where children who are taken into care have been raped and are pregnant.  We would need to think carefully before doing so.  I do not believe an immediate response by me would be helpful at this point.  I say this because any case of the kind described by the Deputy will be unique, with its own set of circumstances. However, health professionals have considerable experience of dealing with children who have been sexually assaulted, resulting in pregnancy in some instances.  All the resources that a health board needs to muster to deal with such difficult cases are available, including medical, legal, social and psychological expertise.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Quinn and Deputy McDowell's question on legislation to deal with the substantive issue and what, if any, instructions have been issued by me to draft a White Paper on the matter, I draw the Deputies' attention to the statement made in the House by the Taoiseach on 9 July 1997 on the release of the All Party Committee reports on the Constitution.  He stated his intention to commence the preparation of a Green Paper on the issue at an early date. In view of the level of debate on this issue the Government is satisfied that a Green Paper, setting out the various options, is required before definitive proposals can be framed.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the matter has been considered by me and my Department and I hope to be in a position in about two weeks' time to report back to Cabinet on the political direction to be taken in the preparation of the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>As is usual in a Green Paper, all options will be explored and I will seek submissions from all interested parties and members of the public at large to ensure this is done.  The Government will initiate public debate on the issue with the publication of this Green Paper and the intention is to refer the matter at that stage to the All Party Constitutional Review Group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's view that this is a tragic situation which must be dealt with sensitively by all Members of the House.  I appreciate and understand the Minister's constraints in dealing with the case, as it is before the courts.  Would the Minister not agree that specific guidelines are required to ensure that health boards deal uniformly with tragic cases such as this, and to avoid the necessity, when tragedies of this nature occur, for resort to the courts to clarify the legal position and the obligations and roles of health boards in these circumstances?  Will the Minister assure the House that the Eastern Health Board and all health boards faced with a tragedy such as this will take action to ensure that the constitutional rights of a rape victim and of <Col N="1528" /> the parents of that victim are fully protected and recognised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking what additional guidelines need to be invoked at this stage.  An operational review is taking place. However, regardless of policy directives, individual cases are unique and it is difficult to be prescriptive in a manner that will deal with every prospective case that might come before a court or a health authority.  It is clear that the Eastern Health Board has acquitted itself admirably in these circumstances and continues to do so.  I emphasise that there are decisions yet to be taken by the courts and by the family which constrain any comment by me.  I am anxious to avoid impinging in any way on the constitutional right to privacy that both the child concerned and her family are entitled to in these circumstances.  The operational review which will be undertaken by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will have to take into account the appalling circumstances we face here today and which are currently being considered by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that in tragedies such as this the role of the health board should be to ensure that full and comprehensive non-direct counselling is made available to the young child who has allegedly been raped and to her parents so that they are fully aware of the options available to them in dealing with the tragic circumstances in which they find themselves, and that no pressure should be put on either the child or the parents by a State body to make a decision in any particular direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act, 1995, and what was enacted by this House was found to be constitutional.  I assure the House that all appropriate and available guidance and help, legal, psychological, medical and otherwise, is being made available to this person in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that we should all have deep concern for the tragic case of a very young girl subject to violent abuse who now has to live with the subsequent pregnancy. This case has been in the public arena for a number of days and many people are commenting on it.  That requires us in this House, in our deep concern, to raise questions and to ensure that the young girl is protected as far as possible and enabled to exercise her rights as a citizen.  In the X case, parents took decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ensure that I put the question in a way that the Minister can respond. It is important to recognise that in the X case the parents of a young girl made decisions in good <Col N="1529" /> faith and were prevented from carrying out those decisions at the time because of State intervention. It is a concern for us now, that there may be a question of something happening in relation to a decision being made by a young girl, in very tragic circumstances, with her family.  Can the Minister assure us that the role of the health board is clear and that the health board can uphold this girl's right to travel if that is the choice that is made?  Can the health board uphold the right that she has as a citizen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I must caution the Deputy against the assumption that a decision has been taken by the family in this case.  I am constrained in answering in the particular.  In regard to what has entered the public domain, I will make the distinction between what is of public interest and what is in the public interest in this case.  They may be two different things based on where the case is at.</P>
      <P>Since the previous case came before the courts a number of years ago a constitutional referendum has been passed regarding the right to travel. I do not wish to preclude or pre-empt what, if anything, comes before the court in any given set of circumstances in regard to this case.  The proceedings are being held <i>in camera</i> and I am satisfied that any matter that comes before the courts will be dealt with by them.  I cannot say any more other than the right to travel for all citizens is not required to be upheld by any authority. It is a constitutional right available to all as a result of the passing of the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>When he says &ldquo;it&rdquo; is before the courts, is the Minister referring to the terms of the care order or the position of the health board in regard to a child in its care and her right to travel?  Is the right of a 13 year old the same whether she is in the care of the health board or her parents?  I understand court action has been taken in regard to the care order.  Will the Minister clarify this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is before the court relates to the care order, the children's court application.  I cannot pre-empt or predict if any other issue will come before this or any other court until such time as we see the outcome.  I cannot in any way suggest further matters will arise.  I can only deal with the situation as it factually is.</P>
      <P>Proceedings are being held in camera in regard to the renewal of an interim care order.  That issue and matters which the court requires to hear are being heard.  I do not wish to go any further in regard to it as I do not wish to add to the trauma the family is experiencing.  I also wish to respect the family's right to take time and space to decide what it wishes to do in these difficult circumstances.  I cannot be any more helpful to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I appreciate the need for the most extreme sensitivity in this very <Col N="1530" /> sad situation.  The personal aspects of this tragedy would be more properly dealt with in total privacy by the victim, her family and advisers.  It would not be appropriate to raise it in this manner except that it has come prominently into the public domain and public bodies are involved. Therefore, some key issues must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it would be unthinkable that the State would repeat its action of 1992 when it sought essentially to intern within its borders a 14 year old victim of rape, an action which caused enormous public outrage?  Does he further agree that if a child victim of rape &mdash; and he can speak in general terms &mdash; decides after proper counselling not to continue with the pregnancy the State has no business in interfering in any form with that decision?</P>
      <P>While accepting that the Minister does not want to speak on many aspects of this tragedy, will he nevertheless rule out that the Government and the State will in any way seek to interfere with any decision taken which would be totally proper?  If, on the other hand, the child decides to continue with the pregnancy, will he guarantee that every assistance, including material resources, will be provided to ensure a life of dignity and reasonable material comfort?  Will he agree the squalor in which this child's family lives is an indictment of the pathetically slow progress in providing proper accommodation for travelling people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The State <i>qua</i> State did not involve itself in interning a citizen of the State at that time.  I do not wish to become involved in any emotional or rhetorical oratory.  On that occasion it was the Attorney General, operating an original jurisdiction as a guardian of the Constitution, who decided it was in the public interest to seek to clarify the situation in those circumstances. The State was not involved.  The Attorney General cannot be politically directed in these matters. This original jurisdiction is available to an Attorney General if he feels it is required in the public interest.  The previous case arose prior to a referendum which was adopted by the people. It stated that nothing in Article 40.3.3, proscribed the right to travel of any citizen from this State to any other state.</P>
      <P>It is not my statutory responsibility to go into the history of accommodation of any family. Much work has been done by successive Government in improving the situation for the travelling community and more work will need to be done in the future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Will the Minister ensure the Eastern Health Board respects and facilitates whatever decision is arrived at after due consideration by the child and her advisers? Will he agree the terms of the Supreme Court judgment of 1992 might encompass the circumstances of this case and could come into play? Will he also agree this highlights the need to <Col N="1531" /> legislate urgently for this human situation under the terms of the Supreme Court judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy the health board will do everything it possibly can to support this child and her family.  It has done this since the case was brought to its attention and will continue to do so.  It has exercised its statutory responsibilities admirably.</P>
      <P>The Whitaker Commission Review Group points out in its report that the substantive issue relating to Article 40.3.3 remains to be addressed in some fashion and sets out five options for consideration. The Taoiseach said we will embark upon the difficult journey of building consensus on how to deal properly and adequately with this issue.  This can mean different things to different people.  I assure the Deputy I will bring to Government in a matter of weeks proposals on a consultation process which will include all interested parties and which will culminate in the preparation of a Green Paper which will be sent to an all-party committee, made up of representatives of the public as constituted in the Houses of the Oireachtas, which I hope will come up with a workable solution on how to deal with this matter. I will not pre-empt or preclude available options on how to deal with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Minister and other speakers that the circumstances of this case are particularly upsetting and that statements made in the House should in no way add to the upset of the family of the young girl concerned. What does the Minister intend to do about the so-called substantive issue, or what has been done about it since he took up office?  He seemed to imply nothing had been done in the five months since he took office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  Nonetheless, when in Opposition the Minister's party was vocal in saying it would prepare, to use the Minister's phrase, the political direction to be taken by the Green Paper.  In his response today, however, there is no indication of what that direction will be.  The Minister has an obligation to tell the House what the political direction for the Green Paper will be.  Will a particularly upsetting case of this nature be included as part of the political direction given by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an issue on which the people must have their say, on which they will be the final arbiters.  If the people are to be arbiters on Cabinet confidentiality and other matters regarded as of less importance, they should be the final arbiters on an issue such as this which exercises the minds of many people.  In Opposition we proposed, so the people would know our view on this matter, the holding of a constitutional <Col N="1532" /> referendum, accompanied by heads of legislation to be enacted if that was considered the best option subsequent to completion of the Green Paper process, as occurred, for example, in the case of the divorce referendum.  Alternatively, legislation passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas could be put before the people by way of a referendum, using the procedures set out in Article 27 of the Constitution.  That proposal was put by the Taoiseach when Leader of the Opposition as a possible option to be considered.  In the final analysis those are the possible options which could be used in trying to reach a conclusion on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rightly pointed out that the constitutional review group identified various possibilities, but for the first time he has made clear he is opting for one of those possibilities, the holding of a referendum.  Is that correct?</P>

I do not wish to divert from the specific issues we are dealing with, but many people spoke about the importance of consultation with the public on other issues, a point with which I agree, and on this issue too the people would like to be consulted.  If legislation is the sole route by which the matter will be decided, subsequent to it being considered by the all-party committee and the Green Paper process, we will invoke the Article 27 procedure so that the people will have a say in the matter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that if the Government ultimately decides to publish legislation on the substantive issue, having gone through the consultative process, the totality of the legislation will be presented to the people by way of a referendum?  If so, has he considered the difficulty of explaining the complexity of such legislation for the purpose of a referendum?  Has the Taoiseach considered the difficulties that arose regarding the recent referendum on Cabinet confidentiality which was an extraordinarily simple concept compared with the type of legislation that might be required in this case?  Having regard to the constraints put on Members and Governments by the Supreme Court, has he considered how Government would even explain the complexity of such legislation to the people?  Has he considered how a reasonable debate on such legislation could take place?  Would he acknowledge that to propose to deal with matters in this <Col N="1533" /> way is an abdication of legislative responsibility? As the Minister with responsibility for children, has he obtained the advice of the Attorney General on the position of the Eastern Health Board, or any other health board, in circumstances in which a child victim of rape is pregnant and in care and seeks to exercise the right to travel to another jurisdiction to terminate her pregnancy? Has he asked the Office of the Attorney General what role health boards should play in that context? If any such case should come before the courts, has he inquired if the Attorney General intends to appear on behalf of the State in such proceedings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that the heads of a Bill would be too complex for people to understand, but I do not share that view.  Draft heads of a Bill were in the public domain at the time of the divorce referendum and the people were aware of the type of legislation that would be enacted if the issue were passed.  Deputy Shatter claimed this is a complex way to deal with the matter.  As far back as May we stated the Article 27 procedure might be appropriate in certain circumstances. I do not wish to predict the outcome of a process not yet finalised.  I am merely stating a possible solution to the problem for the purposes of being candid with the House.  It is clear from the short discussion we are having on this question that there is not unanimity on the matter. There does not appear to be unanimity on any option.  Deputy McDowell asked me to outline the process that will take place.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to preclude or predict what, if any, other issues might arise in a court hearing on this case.  Issues are currently being held <i>in camera</i> before the court.  The privacy of the family concerned must be maintained and respected. These issues may not arise because an important decision has yet to be made by the family and they are entitled to time and space to make it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the courts will determine the outcome of these tragic circumstances?  Does that not raise a question about the rather vague approach he has put forward? When the 1992 amendment was put to the people, the Minister published the Heads of a Bill to show what might happen if people did not vote the way the Government wanted.  Is the Minister <Col N="1534" /> not conscious of the fact that this is not the only case likely to emerge during the time frame he mentioned?  The people have already spoken in a number of referenda.  The Minister's proposal to introduce a Bill is different from that adopted during the divorce referendum.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not clear about his approach or about the need for legislation arising from the Supreme Court decision.  There have been delays but we do not want any more.  We do not want to come back here in the future to discuss the life of a young person which has been damaged in this way.  No one wants to see the courts making decisions which we, as public representatives, have an obligation to make.</P>
      <P>The previous Government carried out extensive research on this issue.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate if that research has been published or is due to be published as it would give us an insight into this major problem in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply will be succinct because I do not want supplementary questions being asked which are not relevant to this private notice question.</P>
      <P>We are all acutely conscious of the predicament in which this family finds itself.  Successive Governments have been unable to progress this issue since the previous case came before the courts.  Time may be required to engage in consultation and I do not apologise for trying to achieve consensus on this issue.  I do not underestimate the difficulties but this is the only way to deal adequately and comprehensively with the matter.  A divisive approach is not the solution.  I do not have a solution in mind nor does anyone else in the country.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will initiate public debate on the issue with the publication of this Green Paper and the intention is to refer the matter <Col N="1536" /> at that stage to the All Party Constitutional Review Group.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister accept that referring the matter to the review group would seem to imply a desire on his part to seek a constitutional amendment? That flies in the face of the decision of the people in l992 where they refused to overturn the Supreme Court decision in the X case and at the same time accepted the right to travel and the right to information on abortion, which was put in place by the last Administration.  That decision was made in the context of the draft heads of a Bill which the Fianna Fáil Government almost threatened to put in place if the amendment it sought was not carried.  It is now incumbent on the Minister to bring forward that Bill and implement it.  That would be in line with the decision of the people in l992.</P>

    <Title>European Summit on Employment: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be unusual to have a debate of this nature in the House in advance of a European Council, but I was, however, very happy to accede to the request of Deputy De Rossa that we have such a debate.  It is entirely appropriate that the House should have such a special debate on the occasion of what is a unique European Council.  It is unique because this European Council will be solely devoted to the issue of employment and to the role of the European Union in tackling what is the primary concern of its citizens, namely, the creation of jobs.</P>
      <P>Employment is the primary challenge facing the European Union.  The need for firm and sustained action on this front has never been greater. European unemployment affects close to 18 million people.  The average unemployment rate among young people in the Union is over 20 per cent.  In 1996 more than 5 per cent of the European Union's labour force had been out of work for at least one year.</P>
      <P>These statistics of themselves cannot portray the corrosive effect which unemployment has on society and individuals.  Unemployment wastes the valuable contribution people can make to society.  It leads to poverty and social exclusion with its attendant misery and places social protection systems under financial strain.  It is an issue which goes to the heart of the concerns of citizens. The response of the European Union must, therefore, be clear and effective.  It must support to the fullest extent possible the efforts of member states to promote employment and minimise unemployment.</P>
      <P>It is my hope that this special European Council will send a strong signal that the EU is embarking on a more co-operative and co-ordinated approach to tackling unemployment.  The inclusion of a new chapter on employment in the Treaty of Amsterdam provides a legal basis for European-wide action in this area which must be built upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convergence criteria in the Maastricht Treaty for economic and monetary union have in many respects been the catalyst for the pursuit of <Col N="1547" /> sound macro-economic policies across all member states of the Union.  This co-ordinated approach to economic policy has delivered low inflation and macro-economic stability to the European Union, thereby creating the conditions essential for employment growth.  Member states should now resolve to harness the potential for a co-ordinated approach to employment policy.</P>
    <P>The European Council will consider the adoption of EU-wide employment guidelines and the establishment of annual surveillance of member states' employment action plans as the method to facilitate closer co-ordination of employment policy. Ireland supports this approach.  It is sufficiently flexible to allow for different approaches by member states according to their particular circumstances while facilitating better co-ordination in employment policy.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has prepared draft employment guidelines which have been considered both by the ECOFIN and the Social Affairs Council.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will deal with the Commission guidelines in more detail in her address.  I welcome the fact that the draft guidelines commit member states to focus their efforts under four key pillars of employment policy, namely, improving the employability of the unemployed; developing entrepreneurship; encouraging adaptability in businesses and in their employees; and strengthening equal opportunities for employment between men and women.</P>
    <P>To improve the employability of the unemployed we need, in particular, to tackle early school leaving and to improve the targeting of training schemes so as to ensure that the unemployed have an opportunity to acquire the skills that the market place demands.  The recent announcement by the Government of a £250 million information technology investment fund which will be used to develop technology education at all levels is a practical example of improving employability in the modern economy.</P>
    <P>Entrepreneurship is the lifeblood of employment creation in a market economy.  Therefore we must do all we can to make it easier to establish and develop a business, particularly through easing the administrative burden on small businesses. Action to reduce non-wage labour costs is also required under this heading.</P>
    <P>We can encourage adaptability by taking advantage of the opportunities for new types of jobs which modern society offers.  This requires considering developments such as flexible working hours and part-time working in consultation with the social partners.  Equality of opportunity must also be fostered with the aim of increasing the employment participation of women.</P>
    <P>The guidelines also set out specific objectives in a number of areas, notably, interventions to help the young unemployed and the long-term unemployed, increasing the level of training for <Col N="1548" /> the unemployed, fostering social partnership and tackling the unemployment gender gap.</P>
    <P>There are differing views among member states as to how specific the objectives in the guidelines should be.  This issue will no doubt be the subject of discussion at the special Council.  Ireland is generally positively disposed to the suggested approach.  I believe that conclusions which merely restate a general concern about European unemployment will not send a sufficiently strong message from the summit.</P>
    <P>The Council will also have before it a funding package to assist job creation involving funds from both the EU budget and the European Investment Bank.  Ireland welcomes this package which is particularly designed to stimulate employment creation in the small and medium sized enterprise sector, SME.  No one is suggesting that this special European Council will, of itself, be a panacea for Europe's employment ills. In accordance with the consensus among member states, employment policy will remain primarily a domestic competence.  The hope is, however, that the Council will see agreement on a structure to co-ordinate better member states' employment policies and on policy guidelines which will have sufficient flexibility to allow them to be tailored to individual member states' needs.</P>
    <P>Ireland will approach this special Council in a positive and constructive frame of mind.  We have achieved much on the employment front over the last decade but we continue to suffer from an unacceptably high level of unemployment.  I believe that Ireland's employment policy experience can be of assistance to our European partners. I am, therefore, circulating to my colleagues on the European Council, in advance of the special Council, a short paper setting out the Irish perspective on the issue.  I have arranged for copies of this paper to be placed in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>This paper sets out the successful Irish experience with regard to economic management and employment creation over the last decade.  This has been exemplified by the increase of approximately a quarter of a million people in employment, average economic growth of approximately 5 per cent and a reduction of more than 5 percentage points in the rate of unemployment, all achieved against a background of firm fiscal discipline and low inflation.</P>
    <P>The main employment gains have been achieved on foot of the consolidation of consistently sound economic fundamentals during the current economic boom, which began in 1993/4. There is no doubt that we are succeeding in creating jobs, and that we are even beginning to make inroads into long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>This performance has been underpinned by the social partnership agreements put in place over the last decade.  These agreements are based on a fundamental shared commitment by all social partners and Government to the pursuit of sound macro-economic policies.</P>
    <P>Orthodox macro-economic policies are not, <Col N="1549" /> however, sufficient on their own especially in the light of the unemployment challenge facing Ireland due to our demographic and labour market trends.  We have introduced many innovative measures designed to contain unemployment.  I have referred in the paper to be circulated to some of the more notable of these, especially the community employment scheme and the back to work allowance scheme.  These two schemes have a current take-up of more than 60,000.</P>
    <P>The paper also sets out the major continuing employment challenge facing the country.  There has been much recent international coverage of the economic progress which Ireland has made.</P>
    <P>We welcome the plaudits but we must also assert that, notwithstanding our recent strides, there is a considerable way to go.  Unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, remains unacceptably high.  The progress we have made must be built upon and put on a long-term sustainable footing.</P>
    <P>The persistence of high long-term unemployment, particularly in concentrated pockets of social deprivation, is a major manifestation of Ireland's relative underdevelopment <i>vis-a-vis</i> its more advanced EU partners.  The economic and social costs of high long-term unemployment in Ireland are set to remain a significant burden on the economy.  The re-integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market will remain a priority concern of economic policy.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland's island location, low population density, dispersed pattern of settlement and small domestic market emphasise our high degree of dependence on both internal and external transportation and communication networks. Poor infrastructural quality in Ireland imposes high competitiveness penalties, reflecting the economy's uniquely heavy dependence on international trade.  Considerable further investment will continue to be required in order to attain standards of physical infrastructure comparable to those of advanced EU economies.  This Government has also recognised the need to invest heavily in our higher education system over the next few years to have the skills needed by the marketplace.</P>
    <P>In some places we have labour shortages and in others there is high unemployment.  Since this Government took office we have been encouraging a more even spread of new jobs throughout the country although more must yet be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the international environment, enlargement of the European Union will benefit the centre comparatively more than peripheral economies such as Ireland.  Our lack of historic trading links with the countries of central and eastern Europe will leave us at a comparative disadvantage <i>vis-a -vis</i> our continental partners in the European Union.</P>
    <P>These continuing special needs regarding employment creation in Ireland must be clearly recognised.  Important negotiations are under way at European level on issues such as taxation, <Col N="1550" /> regional state aids and the next round of structural and cohesion funding.  The outcome of the negotiations will have the most profound implications for employment creation in Ireland over the medium to long term.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a successful example of the cohesion policy which has been so correctly adopted by the European Union.  I have no doubt that both the European Commission and other member states will wish to ensure that the cohesion policy is successful on a sustainable basis.  The Commission's recognition that there must be no abrupt withdrawal of Objective 1 status from those countries which have exceeded the 75 per cent GDP per capita ratio is a positive indicator in this regard. I am confident a similar constructive attitude prevails in the European Commission with regard to the issues of corporation tax and the regional state aids regime.  I therefore look forward to a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations on these issues and one which will be consistent with the EU's overriding objective of maximising employment in all parts of the Union.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I have expressed concern regarding the employment effect throughout Europe of the decision to abolish duty free facilities from 1999.  The Treaty of Amsterdam states that the objective of a high level of employment shall be taken into consideration in the formulation and implementation of community policies and activities.  It is accepted that duty free facilities will eventually be phased out.  What is at issue is the timing and the impact of implementation.  At a time when the European Union considers it important to present a citizen friendly image of the community to its people, it is difficult to see how the total and immediate abolition of duty free can be presented in a positive light.  I intend to use the opportunity offered by the employment summit to raise the issue.</P>
    <P>No doubt there will be those who will view the outcome of the special European Council as an insufficient response to Europe's employment problem.  It is true that no dramatically resourced EU initiative will be launched at the summit, nor should such be expected.  Preparations for economic and monetary union dictate tight fiscal regimes.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, if the Council can agree on the employment guidelines, the follow up surveillance procedure and the financial package, solid progress will have been made.  A foundation will have been laid to facilitate better co-operation and co-ordination of national employment policies which should, over time, yield significant benefits for employment in the EU as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>This summit is designed to set targets for job creation on a par with the targets for budgetary policy set in the Maastricht Treaty. As such it is making good on Europe's social and human dimension.  No doubt the setting of these targets will have significant moral and political force.  The existence of benchmarks for performance on the creation of jobs will bring the debate <Col N="1551" /> back to the unemployment issue, an issue which might be ignored during times of prosperity when the concerns of those who are already employed tend to dominate public debate.</P>
      <P>In a market economy job creation is the result of free individual decisions, not of Governments setting targets.  While there might be a consensus about objectives for employment in Europe, is there a consensus in Europe on how to achieve these objectives?  Not only is the overall level of unemployment in Europe too high, the burden is carried disproportionately by four groups: the long-term unemployed, the young, the unskilled and those living in depressed areas.  In practice, at the heart of the present European labour market lies the idea that it is acceptable to sacrifice the opportunities of the worst off to help those who are already in work.  What type of justice is that?</P>
      <P>The problem in most continental countries is that labour costs are too high.  Why can a consensus not be reached to reduce labour costs and so create jobs?  The answer lies in a profound political and intellectual failure.  While unemployment has risen in Germany it has fallen in the Netherlands, in part because Dutch social partnership agreements since 1982 have kept labour costs well below the German level.  This was a deliberate choice involving the trade unions then led by the present Netherlands Prime Minister, Wim Kok.</P>
      <P>Faced with the highest unemployment for decades, Germany and France have retreated down blind alleys which raise rather than lower costs of employment.  These Governments believe unemployment can be dealt with by job sharing, limits on the working week and even by reducing overtime. This approach is simply not viable in a global open market.  Europe's competitiveness cannot carry this type of burden on global markets. This will become obvious when we enter the proposed single currency area within which there are wide divergences in labour costs and which will cause real tensions when the single currency starts in earnest.  There will be a tendency for firms to move investments out of some countries and into others in the euro area on competitive grounds.</P>
      <P>According to Price Waterhouse, compensation per hour in manufacturing ranges from $30 per hour in Germany to $25 per hour in Belgium to $18 per hour in France to $13 per hour in Britain and Ireland to $5.20 per hour in Portugal.  While labour costs may represent no more than 20 per cent of total costs &mdash; productivity varies &mdash; variations of this size between Germany and Portugal or Germany and Ireland create a big difference which will be hard to hide when we begin to use the same money in all transactions.  There will be no exchange risk involved in moving a business from Germany to Ireland or from Ireland to Portugal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasing technology dissemination enables latecomers to catch up quickly with the technological front-runners with high earning capacity <Col N="1552" />&mdash; in other words, German technology can be very quickly transferred to Portuguese workers. That means the difference between $30 per hour in Germany and $5.20 per hour in Portugal is not viable in the long run.</P>
    <P>When monetary union comes into effect, local economic slowdowns will no longer be dealt with by local monetary policies and only in a limited way by local fiscal measures in national budgets. The brunt will be borne by the labour market which will mean more unemployment if it is not flexible enough.  If European Governments are to avoid the potentially disastrous consequences of that, they will need to start reforms now well in advance of the introduction of the euro and while the European social model stands a chance of being preserved.</P>
    <P>In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the euro, the main problem to be faced in Europe will be on the jobs market in Germany. Far from looking for strict criteria, Germany will be looking for lax criteria on unemployment grounds because of the competitive transfer of employment to other countries in the euro area, including Ireland, with lower employment costs and people who are as skilled as German workers.  We should bear in mind that the use of a single currency will make a huge difference in the transferability of business from one jurisdiction to another.  There will be an inevitable alignment on labour costs.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Ministers and Prime Ministers gathered around the table in Luxembourg realise that this summit is not a matter of making fine sounding declarations and being able to say to their local media that they had yet another meeting on employment.  Hard decisions will have to be taken on employment policy if employment levels in some of the high cost countries are to survive in the euro area, let alone the global market.  We must face the fact that lower taxation on labour, which everyone agrees should occur, means either higher taxes on something else or lower public spending.  A consensus on lower labour taxes means nothing unless one or other of those two inevitable consequences is faced up to.</P>
    <P>The European Union has a very poor record of agreeing to alternatives to labour taxes as seen in its inability to agree to a carbon tax which would have provided a useful alternative to labour taxation. Everyone, including interests in this country, opposed such a tax yet it is one of the few ideas on offer for reducing labour costs.  When I hear of another European declaration about the need for reductions in labour costs, I recall the failure of the same institution to agree to the one viable alternative to taxing labour of which I know, taxing energy.</P>
    <P>It should also be recognised that a rigid labour market penalises women more than men because women tend to take less regulated part-time job opportunities more readily.  Let us compare France and Britain.  The male unemployment rate in both countries is more or less the same, but the <Col N="1553" /> female unemployment rate in Britain is one-third that of France.  In Britain, women have taken up part-time jobs whereas in France with its more regulated labour market these part-time jobs have not been created and women have remained unemployed.  Unemployment is a gender issue.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been a spectacular economic success in contrast to continental Europe.  This is because since 1987 we have kept income increases below the rate of increase in productivity unlike our continental partners. Ireland's economic growth, as conventionally measured, has been three times the European average for most of the 1990s.  Irish growth exceeded the European average by a smaller margin in the 1980s and 1970s but was well below European rates of economic growth in the 15 years after World War II.  US foreign investment in Ireland is 50 per cent higher <i>per capita</i> than in the UK and six times higher <i>per capita</i> than in France and Germany.  If that is to continue, we must understand how we should measure success in economics &mdash; a matter upon which there is not complete consensus &mdash; why we have been successful and what long-term steps we must take to ensure we are successful in the future.</P>
    <P>How should we measure economic growth? Changes in output per person per year are not the best way to measure increases in either human welfare or creativity.  GNP and GDP take no account of the number of hours which must be worked to create a given amount of output, take no account of any work done outside the paid economy and take no account of the damage done by particular forms of economic growth to the environment.  The British national institute for economic and social research showed recently that, when the number of hours worked was taken account of in place of the usual simple annual output per person per year, the United States dropped from first to tenth place in the world in terms of GDP per person and Belgium emerged the most productive country in terms of output per person per hour.  We all know that because in America most people must have two jobs to make a decent income whereas in Europe one job will usually suffice.</P>
    <P>Important work is done which is not paid for and is therefore ignored as if it did not occur. When we talk about jobs, employment and welfare we should not forget that work is done for which no one is paid and without which we would not be able to lead a decent life.  For example, unpaid child care by parents, parents-in-law or grandparents is not measured in GDP whereas paid child care by non-family members is measured, even though parental or family care may be of a higher value to the child.  In such a case, a growth in GDP by substituting one form of care for another may result in a reduction in human welfare.  Is the task of looking after one's children a job or not?  I believe it is but it does not count as far as the measures of job creation used at the summit are concerned.</P>
    <P>The unpaid work of voluntary organisations <Col N="1554" /> does not count either as far as the summit is concerned. Some of the work created as a result of the policy measures announced at the summit may result in a reduction in unpaid work by voluntary organisations or one's immediate family. This could involve a reduction in welfare which is not going to be measured in any of the discussions.</P>
    <P>GDP growth which permanently depletes natural resources may not be an addition to human welfare.  Natural resources used up will not be available to future generations.  We do not measure this properly.  Jobs created destroying the environment do not add to human welfare.</P>
    <P>These issues of measurement; unpaid work, environmental damage and hours worked to obtain a given amount of income, are not mere philosophical whimsies.  In a world where facts exercise tyranny over reflection we could easily slip into the belief that the only thing worthwhile is that which can be measured in money and transmitted in figures through an Internet site. That is not the case.</P>
    <P>What lessons can we and Europe learn from Ireland's success?  The comparative youth of our population has been crucial to our recent success in job creation.  Younger people are less averse to risk and less prone to form pressure groups to defend vested interests because they do not have so many vested interests to defend.  Younger people are more likely to be at ease with computers, more willing to move house to get a better job, less conscious of their limitations and less likely to defend their job property rights by forming pressure groups.  When the Taoiseach explains why Ireland has been a success, he should explain that one of the reasons is that Ireland is young whereas many continental countries are comparatively old.</P>
    <P>It is important that Ireland recommends to Europe that measures be taken to ensure that the European workforce stays young in mentality if not, at least, in outlook. This requires a conscious investment in retraining, not just in new skills but in mental attitudes.  The concept of early retirement as an objective may be desirable in terms of giving people a chance to reorient themselves but psychologically it is a bad idea.  The idea that one's working life is over at age 55 is inappropriate to a continent like Europe or country like Ireland which has a huge bank of talent which needs to be rejuvenated at a certain point in life rather than put on the scrap heap.  I hope we will not see solutions to the jobs problem which involve putting those over a certain age on the scrap heap.  That is not a solution.  It is reducing our wealth creating capacity in a very arbitrary way and adding to our pensions liabilities which we may not easily be able to meet in the long-term. Once people have retired for a year or two it is too late to bring them back to work.  It would be too late to discover that we should have had a different policy two or three years after people have retired.  There must be continuity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> Educational institutions in this and other EU countries are not catering adequately to the need for people in mid-life to reorientate their careers to new forms of work.  The nine-to-five approach of higher education institutions is inappropriate to a workforce that needs to reorientate itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to hold the special summit on employment was made at the EU Council of Ministers meeting at Amsterdam at which I participated.  It was made against the background of the conclusions of the negotiations for the single currency.  I share the scepticism and views expressed by Prime Minister Juncker that we should not hold our breath with regard to what will emerge from the special summit by way of proposals and that it is not the end of the road with regard to thinking on the issue.</P>
      <P>Since July I have been a member of the Party for European Socialists' working group on employment policy.  The group, which represents the Socialist, Social Democratic and Labour parties within the PES, has met on a number of occasions and has developed ideas which I propose to put to the Taoiseach for further consideration. In this regard, I welcome the holding of this debate in advance of the summit.</P>
      <P>The European labour market is no longer working either efficiently or effectively.  In addition, the European model of social cohesion and solidarity, built substantially by the European Socialist movement over many years, is now under serious new pressures.  Liberal market forces by themselves have not and cannot resolve these problems.  New approaches must be developed by us all within the context of the application of the basic values regarding the European social model which are shared across the political spectrum in Europe, certainly by the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats.</P>
      <P>The completion of the internal market of the union is an essential component to our approach. The impact of globalisation upon the world's economy requires Europe to rationalise its domestic economy so as to provide new economies of scale and production and either become or remain effective.  However, the internalised debate within Europe and the introspective focus of so many political leaders, certainly within the PES, has ignored the process of competition that has resulted from globalisation.  It is a process we ignore at our peril.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The internal market cannot be completed without the introduction of the single currency, the euro.  It is essential that the euro commences on time and that the maximum number of member states participate at the earliest stage.  The logic <Col N="1556" /> of economic and monetary union is that all 15 member states should be participants as soon as possible and certainly in the early part of the next century.</P>
    <P>The completed internal market and single currency will enable new Keynesian type macro economic policies to be adopted without the distortions and difficulties of the past, an example of which was the French experience of 1980-81.  In particular, the EU Commission and the European Investment Bank must find new ways at community level of raising new capital for investment in infrastructural projects, such as research and development, TENS and venture capital funds for small and medium sized enterprises.  The issue of Euro bonds to finance this investment must be addressed.  I hope the Taoiseach will be able to have this issue raised as an item for further exploration at the summit.</P>
    <P>While preparations for EMU are now well advanced, there is an imbalance with regard to the detail and the clarity of the monetary side of EMU in contrast to the economic side.  The role of the European Central Bank and the operation of the stability and growth pact have been debated and clarified, yet the aspect of economic governance has not received the same degree of attention.  It is now necessary under Article 103 to set out clear structures for the operation of economic policy at community level for all member states.  In this regard, I look forward to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance clarifying the Government's attitude to its participation in the stability council.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the Commission, ECOFIN and the European Parliament must be developed and agreed in a formal manner, similar to the stability and growth pact.  In addition, the relationship of the European Central Bank to the rest of the Union's institutions must be clarified within the context of the treaty, while maintaining full respect for the independence of the European Central Bank and its areas of competence.  There is a serious imbalance between the clarity with which the monetary side of EMU will proceed and the relative lack of clarity with which the economic side will be pursued.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the stability programmes, which are under the agreed structures for EMU. The final structure of the stability programmes must contain explicit targets and sections on the operation of the labour market in member states and the overall levels of employment and unemployment. The inclusion of the employment chapter in the Amsterdam Treaty and the new employment committee will further strengthen the role of the Union in the area of employment, while leaving the implementation of employment policy a matter for member states themselves to pursue.  I do not see any conflict here with what Deputy John Bruton said in relation to the various ways in which employment can be generated. However, the measures and benchmarks should be common to all member states.  The stability programmes should include specific standards <Col N="1557" /> and benchmarks for the national labour market, just as they propose to do for other aspects of national economies.</P>
    <P>The Social Affairs Council should renew the initiative open to it to redefine the relationship between the operation of the labour markets in member states and the role of the Commission in setting standards.  Such new standards, either in the form of directives or resolutions, should not necessarily impose additional costs.  In some respects, the adoption of directives will assist the governments of member states in reforming the labour market part of the welfare state by setting common standards across the Union.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a need to move from passive income support payments to active income support payments, particularly among the long-term unemployed and young people entering the labour market.  Given the growing integration of the internal market, in particular, the labour market of the Union, it is very important that the emerging changes in welfare states across Europe are properly co-ordinated and, where desirable, standardised.</P>
    <P>The relationship between national parliaments and the European Parliament in all areas is weak. Having regard to the central importance of the functioning of the labour market and the credibility of the Union in the eyes of European citizens, there must be a more structured and productive relationship between the parliaments of the Union.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the significance of local development and regional government, the involvement of the Committee of the Regions should be incorporated into this new set of structures. The objective must be clear.  People are directly concerned about employment.  Democratic institutions, particularly democratic assemblies at European, national and regional level, should be seen by our citizens to be directly involved in resolving the problems of employment and unemployment.  For example, the operation of the area partnerships should have a more structured link with local authorities, unlike the present situation.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament must have specific hearings with each member state to review the operation of the stability programmes.  The employment committee must have a formal relationship with the Parliament to ensure the maximum amount of co-ordination.</P>
    <P>Continued integration and economic rationalisation combine to drive the internal market of the Union.  These pressures have also brought about standardisation in relation to many aspects of economic activity.  The same overall process should, in principle, be applied to the European labour market.  This is particularly relevant to the reform of the welfare state and its relationship to the labour market.</P>
    <P>As the world moves towards increased globalisation, it is clear the European social model will require its workforce to be better educated and trained in order to compete internationally and <Col N="1558" /> enhance its levels of productivity.  Europe should commit itself to basic standards for all workers.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to youth employment and how the labour market/social welfare interface could be reformed.  No young worker between the ages of 18 and 25 years should be able to register as unemployed after a period of six months and receive income support from their national welfare system.  Instead, they should be offered a range of labour market options with the appropriate level of income support: first, a return to full-time education; second, specific vocational training; third, work experience and placement in a commercial enterprise; and, fourth, community work in the third sector area of their choice &mdash; environmental protection, leisure, sport, education or health care.  Participation would not be compulsory.  The principle of freedom should prevail. However, there would be no automatic entitlement to income support for single people under the age of 25 who refuse to participate. This proposal featured in the Labour Party election manifesto under the social guarantee.  It did not receive much publicity, which is probably a reflection on us.  If it is to be successful, the quality of training involved will have be sufficiently high to hold out the prospect of a quick transition to employment.</P>
    <P>It is essential for that kind of initiative to be co-ordinated at European level.  The Taoiseach will find a certain consensus among my colleagues in the PES to get directives or resolutions from the Social Affairs Council which would set guidelines and standards within which national Governments could move to reform simultaneously, or within an agreed timeframe, the directive or resolution embodying those standards. Otherwise, we will have a situation with which the Taoiseach will be familiar in his own constituency and many others: young single people automatically going on the live register because of a poor level of training or family background. They get full entitlements as a consequence and that cycle must be broken in the manner I have suggested.</P>
    <P>The reduction of working time within the confines of a competitive European economy facing global competition must be addressed.  Overtime work, which is persistent in some sectors and industries, should be regulated to ensure a more equitable distribution of the available work among willing and qualified workers.  The curtailment of monetary payment for excessive overtime and its replacement with time-off vouchers could be a way forward.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, should examine this practice which will be familiar to us from sectors of our own economy, not least the public service.  Systematic overtime is being availed of because of the level of payment; there could be greater employment created if work was more equitably shared.  The practice of time-off vouchers is availed off in many private companies.  Time off can be allocated in lieu of time worked rather than continuous overtime payments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> I have no illusions about how complex and difficult the introduction of such changes would be. From the Irish perspective, the use of social dialogue and the social partnership is the forum within which such ideas could be explored and the details of implementation agreed.  We must build upon an emerging consensus within the PES, and, I suspect, the Christian Democrats, on common attitudes to aspects of the non-functioning of the European labour market.  We must then go back to the Social Affairs Council, which effectively had a veto on this as a result of the former United Kingdom Government's attitude to such measures.  We can then see if it is possible to get directives such as I have mentioned.  These would provide co-ordination and harmonisation in the approach to the reform of the interface between the labour market and the social welfare systems in our different countries.  There is an opportunity now that did not exist while the previous administrations in France and the UK were in office to use the virtual unanimity across the 15 member states on these issues, notwithstanding the present position of the German Government. I presume the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, will attend the employment summit in Luxembourg or be involved in its consequences. These issues must be explored.</P>
    <P>Focusing on long-term unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, means examining ways of changing the operation of the European social model.  That means co-ordinated change at Social Affairs Council level where the initiative can commence.  I wish the Government every success in the Luxembourg summit.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Quinn on his elevation to party leader.  I was away at a number of meetings dealing with this issue at the time of his election. I will not be at the summit as the treaty decided that Prime Ministers and Foreign Affairs Ministers should attend.  Like Deputy Quinn and others, I am interested in this area and we did much of the preparatory work.  On the proposals made by Deputy Quinn and Deputy John Bruton, no one has a monopoly on ideas on how to resolve the scourge of unemployment.  I acknowledge the work done by successive Governments and as Minister for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs, I am prepared to look at any suggestions and work with other Members of both Houses to address the issue, particularly in relation to youth and long-term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I greatly welcome this unique debate which was requested some weeks ago and to which the Taoiseach was responsive.  The imminent employment summit is an important opportunity and challenge for the Union.  It is an opportunity to address in a concrete and practical way the unemployment problem that exists in the Union where currently there are 18 million people unemployed, almost nine million of whom are long-term <Col N="1560" /> unemployed and of whom five million are young unemployed people.</P>
    <P>The challenge for us is to come up with effective policies to address the unemployment problem &mdash;to come up with responses that go beyond general recommendations and orientations that have tended to characterise the output of previous European summits in the employment area. We need concrete measures.  I believe the preparatory work that has been done for this summit is such as to ensure that we will have a successful and constructive outcome.  I have had the privilege of being at the heart of that preparatory work through my participation on the Labour and Social Affairs Council.  This council, together with ECOFIN, has been charged with responsibility for paving the way for the summit decisions.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already outlined the perspective which Finance Ministers have brought to the project, including the new lines of finance that are to be opened up to promote employment &mdash; the 150 million ECUs agreed in the budget and the financial line of credit to an amount of some 1 billion ECUs being made through the European Investment Bank.  The importance of getting the macro-economic condition right has also been emphasised.</P>
    <P>The main aspect with which the Labour and Social Affairs Council has been concerned is that of labour market policy.  There is a clear recognition that economic growth, although essential to jobs growth, will not on its own produce the rate of expansion of jobs which is needed to provide employment for the majority of the unemployed. There is a structural component to our unemployment problem which requires us to undertake reforms of our labour market policies and seeks to ensure that the labour market functions more effectively.</P>
    <P>Within the Union we now have a new instrument through which we can both encourage and co-ordinate such reforms.  I refer to the new employment chapter in the treaty, the implementation of which was mandated at the Amsterdam Council.  The relevant provisions of that chapter allow for the development each year of employment guidelines to be adopted by the council and to be implemented by the member states.  They also provide for a surveillance procedure which will monitor the performance of the member states in implementing the guidelines.  We will, in other words, be called upon to develop an action plan which will outline how we intend to give effect to the guidelines and we will be called to account each year as to our progress in implementing them.  This, I believe, is good, not least in terms of the moral pressure it creates to make us perform.</P>
    <P>Much of the focus of our work at the Labour and Social Affairs Council in recent weeks in preparation for the summit has been on the employment guidelines developed recently by the commission.  These will be a critical input to the summit later this week.  Deputies will be aware that these proposed guidelines are built on a four <Col N="1561" /> pillar framework comprising entrepreneurship, aimed in particular at promoting small and medium sized enterprises; employability, aimed at reintegrating the unemployed, particularly the young unemployed, into the labour market and preventing drift into long-term unemployment; adaptability, aimed at promoting social partnership down to the level of the firm and ensuring that employees can be responsive to the changing nature of work and work organisation though ongoing training and upskilling; and equal opportunities, aimed at maximising the opportunities for women to re-enter the labour market.</P>
    <P>Our objective within the framework of these guidelines is to come up with proposals and commitments which on the one hand are concrete, measurable and challenging, and at the same time are realistic and avoid creating false expectations. They must recognise the principle of subsidiarity, the fact that responsibility for employment policy rests primarily with the member states.  They must also be sufficiently responsive to the differing labour market conditions prevailing in the different member states.  Much positive work has been done towards meeting these objectives at the three council meetings which I have attended and which have been substantially devoted to consideration of the guidelines.</P>
    <P>We have been positively disposed to the overall thrust and direction of the proposed guidelines. They will serve to reinforce many of the policies we have already put in place at national level. Thus, for example, the objective under the entrepreneurship pillar is on promoting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.  The means advocated to do that include improving access to finance, reducing administrative burdens and reducing indirect labour costs &mdash; areas to which we have been giving attention for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The area of particular interest to me is the employability pillar.  Here our focus is very much on the long-term and young unemployed and on the efforts we must make to provide them with employment opportunities, or with progression pathways, which will get them back into the labour market.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the encouraging results from the recently published Labour Force Survey, which showed a drop of some 17,000 over the previous year in long-term unemployment, the number in that category, at 86,000, still remains unacceptably high.  Likewise, while our level of youth unemployment has shown a significant drop in the past number of years, from a rate of 25 per cent in 1993 to 16 per cent at present, the absolute number involved &mdash; 47,000 below the age of 25 &mdash; is equally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Apart from the waste of economic potential which these figures represent, we know the social costs which arise from such unemployment in terms of poverty generally, the potential it creates for social exclusion, the drift into crime and substance abuse.</P>
    <P>The proposed guidelines under this heading are <Col N="1562" /> a real challenge for us to redouble our efforts to get unemployed people back into work.  The guidelines, as initially drafted, concentrated very much on a preventative strategy aimed at preventing drift into long-term unemployment by calling on us to move towards a position where we will make a job offer or other employment enhancing intervention to all adult unemployed before they hit a 12 month unemployment threshold and, in the case of young people, before they hit a six month threshold.</P>
    <P>We recognise and accept the importance of the preventative strategy and this is a challenge which we will gladly take on.  We were, however, concerned that the guidelines did not give an explicit recognition to the position of those who are already long-term unemployed and of the need to ensure that they must also continue to receive priority.  I am glad to say that, as a consequence of our interventions at the Council, it is my belief that this dimension will be given recognition within the guidelines.</P>
    <P>The guidelines, under the employability pillar, also place strong emphasis on the need for investment in human resources so as to provide the skills necessary to meet the needs of the labour market.  We are all conscious of the relative success we have had in attracting high-tech enterprises and the acknowledgement that part of our attraction is the quality of the work force and, in particular, the young graduates we are producing to meet the needs of these enterprises.  Our intention to keep our comparative advantage in this area is manifested, for example, in the new £250 million technology fund announced in the past couple of weeks.  However, not all future jobs will be in those high-tech areas.  There remain many other skills-needs at different levels which can provide job opportunities for those, including the unemployed, who, perhaps, have not been fortunate enough to receive formal third level education or who have, for whatever reason, fallen out of the education system.  Thus, I welcome in the guidelines the focus on increasing the number of unemployed people who are to be given access to training opportunities.  The objective is to move to the level of best practice in the three best performing countries in the Union.</P>
    <P>Likewise there is an emphasis on reducing early school leaving as well as developing and expanding the opportunities for apprenticeships and traineeships.  These are directions towards which we are already committed as, for example, outlined in the previous Government's White Paper on Human Resource Development and as committed to in Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>Thus, one can see that many of the policies being advocated under the European process are already in place.  That is not to say that we can either be smug or complacent.  There are new challenges created by the European process.  In the context of developing our action plan, we will have to define new targets which will demonstrate that we are increasing our efforts in these <Col N="1563" /> areas and we will be subject to scrutiny, including recommendations, from Europe.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this employment summit is both a challenge and an opportunity.  It presents a real opportunity for the Union to demonstrate its relevance in a tangible way to the concerns of people and their families.  Deputies will recall that I previously served as Minister for European Affairs when I initiated and developed the concept of &ldquo;Communicating Europe&rdquo;, seeking ways and means of communicating to our public the relevance of the Union to people's daily lives.  Many of the areas to which the European Union has been giving attention over recent years, including monetary union, convergence policies, enlargement and institutional reform, are all extremely important in their own right but they have a certain remoteness for the ordinary man in the street.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, employment and a fear of unemployment, even in the good times, is a real concern to many of our citizens.  If we as politicians cannot demonstrate that the Union has a real role to play and contribution to make in this area, then our citizens may well increasingly call into question the relevance of the whole European project.  I am, however, optimistic about the likely outcome of the employment summit.  I am convinced it will bring real added value in regard to addressing the employment and unemployment problems that exist at European level.  From my own point of view it has been a privilege to have been intimately involved in the preparatory process and I believe our work will have paved the way for a successful outcome.</P>

      <P>What is required from this summit is a European action programme, not merely a political aspirational statement concerning the Europe-wide unemployment problem.  Unemployment in the EU has risen sharply in recent years and is now at a very high level.  Both national and regional rates vary widely around that mean.  European unemployment is, in the arithmetic sense, the aggregation of national unemployment rates, and national circumstances are highly important in explaining national levels of unemployment.  In addition, in Ireland endemic long-term unemployment is geographically clustered in a small number of urban unemployment black spots.  Any action programme must contain specific measures to tackle this phenomenon of generational unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For much of the EU there is at least one common factor at work, that is the business cycle. Most EU states &mdash; Ireland and Britain are marked exceptions &mdash; are at roughly a similar point in the business cycle, more or less at the bottom of it.  Ireland and Britain, on the other hand, are well advanced on the recovery phase and, in all probability, there are also deep structural growth factors at work in Ireland.  One important point about the business cycle is that as recovery strengthens and growth accelerates <Col N="1564" /> over the next few years, new jobs will be created and probably in large numbers, if history and the recent Irish experience are anything to judge by.</P>
    <P>EMU will also strengthen recovery.  A successful monetary union and single currency project will likely create a positive double whammy &mdash; cyclical recovery magnified by the positive effects of monetary union.  These positive effects are likely to include large capital inflows from the rest of the world, stable and low interest rates and low inflation.  The collapse of the project would, of course, spell serious trouble.  Furthermore, many existing jobs will be lost.  EMU will be a real force and factor in this regard also.</P>
    <P>The likelihood is that EMU will have an enormous impact on corporate Europe, much bigger than the Single Market programme.  Takeovers, mergers and acquisitions, restructuring and reorganisation will be of huge significance over the coming years.  Feeding into EMU in this respect and magnifying it, will be continuing globalisation, growth in competition and the progress of the second industrial revolution we are now living through.  Again, in recent weeks, we have seen indications of this including a huge wave of merger proposals &mdash; Guinness and Grand Met, BAT and Zurich Insurance, Redland and Lafarge in building materials, the manoeuvres of BT, and the saga of MCI.  We have also seen announcements from Pilkington and Kodak of huge job shedding plans.  All of this is probably a foretaste of things to come.</P>
    <P>At a conference last Thursday on this issue organised by Democratic Left, special emphasis was attached to campaigning for the following objectives: the development of an effective educational and training system in order to guarantee the right to education and training for all; the harmonisation and co-ordination of fiscal policies in order to avoid fiscal dumping &mdash; what is needed is a better regulation of financial flows, a more effective struggle against fiscal fraud and evasion, and the creation of new forms of taxation; the defence and reactivation of the public sector as a source of public goods and employment as well as a necessary instrument for the defence of inhabitants' rights, especially to protect the most vulnerable categories of the population; the rejection of compulsory &ldquo;workfare&rdquo; and unequal treatment for unemployed people and people on &ldquo;into work&rdquo; schemes; adequate equal protection and guaranteed minimum wage rates, including measures to protect self-employed &mdash; freelance or own account &mdash; workers.  Minimum wages is a current issue in Ireland &mdash; mention of freelance and self-employed workers in this context is important and tends to be forgotten.  The tax regime for this growing group of workers needs to be thought about.  In a wider context, notwithstanding what Deputy Bruton said, the length of the working week needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I lay great emphasis, from a long-term viewpoint, on education and training reform in Ireland and elsewhere in the Union in the context of pursuing the realisable objective of full <Col N="1565" /> employment.  In the context of structural change, corporate reorganisation, globalization and the second industrial revolution, substantial recasting of the education and training systems is a major demand to be vigorously pursued.</P>
    <P>Our education system is little connected with training.  This is in marked contrast with best practice in the EU, particularly in Germany and the Nordic countries.  The Irish education system emphasises attainment rather than aptitude.  In turn, attainment is defined and measured from the standpoint of the academic requirements and orientation of higher education &mdash; HE, the universities. Aptitude, on the other hand, is critical to technical education &mdash; it is still ignored in Ireland to too large a degree &mdash; and training, which is hugely under developed here within the national sphere and at company level.  Aptitude testing is also critical to a tier of education that we do not have in Ireland, further education or FE.  In short, we have a skewed system with too much emphasis on HE and too little on FE.</P>
    <P>Further education, including technical education and training, second chance education, retraining and lifelong learning, is critical to building a system and society that can cope with large-scale and ongoing structural and technical change in the economy.  Such change will be a marked feature of European and national economies over the coming years.  Irish universities play a central and critical role.  However, there is more to a proper, balanced and economically effective education and training system than putting everything into the university system and creating a climate in which the Regional Technical Colleges, for example, believe they must become universities.</P>
    <P>The European Union and Commission have a significant role to play in this.  Some additional own resources for the Union may be necessary. However, a switch in emphasis in the EU budget towards human capital and education and training policies as opposed to sustaining milk and wine lakes and meat mountains or even building motorways and bridges is far more critical.  I should not criticise the building of bridges.  The Community channels funds into education and training.  However, much of it is ineffective.  In addition, much EU funding goes into pilot projects, which is correct, but there are problems in having the results of successful pilot projects mainstreamed.  The difficulty in having good pilot projects, successful experiments, developed into being applied more widely is particularly acute in Ireland.  It may well be the same elsewhere in the EU.</P>
    <P>I quote one example from my own constituency &mdash; the Clondalkin Information Technology Initiative or CITI.  It is a small project that set out to show it was possible to turn young people with low formal educational attainment but who were proven to have an aptitude for computer programming, into qualified programmers obtaining well paid jobs in commercial electronics companies. CITI is working.  It turns out programmers <Col N="1566" /> who obtain jobs and the life chances of the young people going through the project and graduating are vastly improved.  They move from unemployment to work, from no qualifications to being skilled and qualified, and are set on career paths that will, if they pursue them, change their lives vastly for the better.  They have access to the growth dividend and to the fruits of technological change and economic development.  The problem is that EU funding runs out shortly.  I accept it cannot go on forever but the issue now is for the national authorities to pick up CITI, apply it more widely and mainstream it.  The world of work is changing rapidly.  Investment in human capital, people, through education and training is critical to the pursuit of full employment and the reduction of large scale unemployment in the EU.</P>
    <P>Tax dumping is a bone of contention between the Union, Commission and some member states, on the one hand, and Ireland, in particular, on the other.  The focus of the present discussions is the corporate tax regime to be put in place by Ireland beyond 2005 and 2010.  The Government is formally committed to a 10 per cent headline rate.  That could amount to tax dumping and it would appear that the proposal has been quietly dropped.  The rainbow Government's approach was different and had much to be said for it.  A rate of 12.5 per cent was agreed on.</P>
    <P>If a country engages in tax dumping it is attacking the capacity of other states to tax and maintain public services and pursue equitable tax policies. Tax dumping also induces competitive and protective responses.  I instanced the recently renegotiated double taxation treaty between this country and the United States.  All things being equal, tax dumping has to be paid for in some way in the state in which it is practised.  In other words, some taxpayers have to pay for the low rates of tax paid by others.  This is very much the case in Ireland and it is a real factor in the inequitable tax regime and the high burden of tax faced by workers, particularly low paid workers.</P>

      <P>The European Summit on Employment runs the risk of becoming a damp squib.  There has been much hype and expectation and many press conferences but no real work seems to have been done by individual countries to prepare for the summit.  There will be a high profile meeting of the leaders of EU countries who will repledge themselves to reduce unemployment. Mr. Jacques Santer wants to reduce unemployment from an EU average of 10.7 per cent to 5 per cent and to create 12 million new jobs over the next five years.  That may not seem a large figure when spread across 15 countries but it is a huge ambition.  Raising expectations in this way when individual countries have not faced up to the decisions which will have to be taken to create this number of jobs runs the risk of people becoming bored and disenchanted with the opportunities provided by the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expectation of getting a job is at the heart of all human endeavour.  Even ten year old school <Col N="1567" /> children expect to get a job when they leave school, whether as a fireman, ballet dancer, engineer or McDonald's employee.  The challenge facing Governments throughout Europe is to ensure that these expectations are fulfilled.  We should spell out at the summit on Thursday the measures we have taken to create our very high growth rates which are above the average achieved by our trading partners.  Our success in the 1990s gives us a greater hope of fulfilling the expectations of the ten year old school children to whom I referred.  In some areas of employment we are at the wall in terms of providing a sufficient number of people.  In order to ensure continued growth, we must analyse and understand the factors that brought us to this position.  That would assist us in considering future policies.</P>
    <P>The ESRI medium-term review 1997 to 2003 contains an assessment of what happened in Ireland since the deep recession of the mid-1980s and we should take cognisance of that.  The report states that the factors that led to the growth rates include the tightening of fiscal policy in the 1980s, the successive national pay agreements from 1987 onward, the devaluations of 1986 and 1993, the adherence to a strong currency policy from 1987, improvements in competitiveness, the increasing level of average educational qualifications and the inflow of Structural Funds.  Another factor was our capacity to attract multinational industries which, without the issues highlighted in the ESRI report, we would not have been in a position to do.</P>
    <P>The recession of the 1980s, when many of our young people left the country to find work elsewhere, many of them, fortunately, with a good education, was exacerbated by the profligacy of the 1977-81 spending policies of the then Government. At that time we were overcoming the oil crisis of the early 1970s and, far from spending, we should have been consolidating, tightening our belts and recognising that we needed to put money aside for the rainy day.</P>
    <P>There was at least a silver lining to the recession of the 1980s in that everybody, industrialists, trade unions and consumers, became frightened by the spectre of the World Bank coming into Ireland, a real possibility at the time, and people woke up to the high spending policies that were destroying the possibility of growth rates. The events of the 1980s led to a more enlightened era in politics, in the trade union movement and in industrial policy because, to quote the President, people saw the edge and decided they wanted to pull back from it.  The enlightened Tallaght strategy in 1987 also brought people to their senses because for the first time an Opposition party put the national interest at heart and adopted policies that allowed the country to turn the corner and create the growth rates of more than 5 per cent which our people have been enjoying.</P>
    <P>There must be continued emphasis on some of the issues highlighted in the ESRI report.  For <Col N="1568" /> example, many young graduates have returned to work in their own country, but we must be careful that, as we encourage a greater number of people into second and third level education, we provide appropriate education and training, without which there will be a reduction in the number of multinationals and other investors setting up here.  It is important a sufficient number of staff is available to those companies.  If they do not get the staff they require they may have to move elsewhere.  That is the challenge facing our education and training systems.  The millions of pounds being spent on FÁS training programmes must be targeted at the needs of the country.  If an industrialist requires a person to run a machine, to work on computers and to be able to speak a foreign language, we should not be training people to carry out door to door surveys. Training must be targeted at the needs of industry and that will require a great deal of discussion between entrepreneurs, business people and educators.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we continue to increase the quality of Irish products.  Some 66 per cent of our trade is with EU countries other than Great Britain, with which we trade 22 per cent of our tradable products.  We must continue to attract sales for our products.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline Government policy on corporation tax and the future of IDA grants? How does it propose to deal with the changes in Objective 1 and 2 status?  Until we know its policy in those areas and what it is saying to our European partners and the Commission, we will not be able to continue to attract inward investment and create employment.</P>

      <P>The employment question will be on top of the agenda in all European countries in the years ahead.  High levels of unemployment in all member states are a cause for major concern for governments.  We must pay continuing attention not only to the creation of more jobs but also to the geographic spread of new employment opportunities.  We must make a major drive to reduce unemployment levels and this is even more urgent in light of the recent census figure which shows an increase of 100,000 in the overall population since the last census.  In the year prior to the last census more than 40,000 people came to live here, almost half of whom came from the United Kingdom.  The Central Statistics Office projects that our population could increase by 10 per cent in the next ten years.  This poses a major challenge to Government and development agencies, if we are not to return to the former high levels of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA's success in attracting massive overseas investment and employment is very welcome. There is increasing evidence, however, of <Col N="1569" /> skill shortages in some of the high technology sectors, despite the contribution of universities, Regional Technical Colleges and the institutes of technology to meet industry needs in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that more resources are allocated to education and training to provide young people with the relevant skills to avail of good employment opportunities in the future. This should be viewed in the long-term and primary and secondary schools should be properly equipped and staffed to provide an appropriate introduction to computers and languages.  Breaking the cycle of poverty and missed opportunities, which affect many young people from deprived areas who leave school early, requires the provision of the best educational facilities and maximum resources to help children with special learning difficulties.  Skill shortages should not be considered only in the sphere of high technology and languages.  There are equally important job opportunities which require proper training skills, particularly in traditional crafts and trades, such as plastering, carpentry, bricklaying and the tourism and agriculture sectors.</P>
    <P>While employment creation is a national question, with overall future employment depending on a high standard of education and skills, there is also an important regional dimension.  Recent employment growth has not benefited all regions equally.  Media comment on the very few new job announcements north of the line from Galway to Dublin points to the serious employment needs in that area.</P>
    <P>The Fitzpatrick report on Structural Funds was recently quoted by the chairperson of the council for the west.  It showed that once more the west and Border regions performed worst during that period.  They started off from a relatively poor position and remained there in 1996.  It stated that 50,000 jobs were created in the Munster and Leinster regions compared to only 2,000 in Connacht and Ulster.  It is vital that regional imbalance is fully recognised when considering unemployment policies.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Perry for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>The Green Party regrets that the employment topics of the November summit on employment will not be discussed in an integrated way with those of the December summit, which will be centred on the co-ordination of economic, foreign exchange and tax policies in the EU.  EMU, without a parallel process of social and institutional legislation, is a seriously flawed concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Party criticises the stability pact in its present form which seeks to preclude any change in economic policy by aiming for massive deficit reduction in a period of mass unemployment. We demand a European pact on employment, solidarity and ecology with equally binding commitments to counterbalance the stability pact concluded in Amsterdam.  This European pact on employment, solidarity and ecology should combine <Col N="1570" /> employment targets with ecological sustainability. Full employment of a new type guaranteeing equal access for women and men to dignified, voluntary and decently paid work must become an aim in its own right for EU policy as well as a guaranteed right for all.  The social value of unpaid activity, voluntarily undertaken, should be recognised and supported.  Adequate legal frameworks to meet this end should be created.</P>
    <P>The Green Party demands an EU programme to support local economies against market centralisation with the aim of guaranteeing a greater diversity of economic activity, enhancing social and environmental responsibility and creating more jobs in each local area.  Co-ordinated steps, which involve the equitable redistribution of paid and unpaid work, must be taken to achieve radically shorter working hours.  Legal frameworks and fiscal incentives should facilitate the transition to a 30 hour week as a mid-term objective.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the introduction of European ECU taxes will be to boost social and ecological innovation, while conversion programmes, including retraining for workers in unsustainable industries, will have to create sustainable employment throughout Europe.  We must expand EU funds for ecological conversion and urban regeneration with a strong employment dimension by shifting savings into investment through the issue of Union bonds by the European Investment Bank.  We must take action to strengthen the third sector in the social welfare economy as a source of new, appropriate and socially protected jobs &mdash; for example, in the areas of social, ecological and cultural services.  We must mobilise the vast savings of the European Investment Bank and the European steel and coal community to encourage investments in ecological innovation, education, health and urban environments, especially in regions of high unemployment.</P>
    <P>We must link the training of long-term unemployed people to a guarantee that they will be given paid employment for at least a year following retraining.  We must give every person the right to receive two years' paid training after leaving full-time education.  Member states should translate their commitment to equality of opportunity into expanding the rate of women's participation in professional training and employment in all sectors and at all levels of seniority where it is less than 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>We must also introduce a European framework of national incentive systems for the reduction of working time through collective agreements. Companies which create new employment after reducing working time could be subsidised from the subsequent savings in public expenditure.  At the same time this would reduce the pressure to accept imposed part-time work.  We must implement a European legal framework to guarantee access to employment for people with disabilities.  We must implement also a social and environmental audit of all EU budgets, greening the EU budget, especially by reforming the Common <Col N="1571" /> Agricultural Policy but also by fundamentally revising the ecologically devastating Structural Funds.  The EU should cease to promote the trans-European networks and stimulate and support environmentally friendly transport modes. Conversion from nuclear energy and coal to energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energies is long overdue.</P>
    <P>We must co-ordinate efforts to prevent poverty and social exclusion by combining strategies for basic social security or income support with minimum wages or removing the tax burden for lower income groups as well as promoting social, cultural and political participation.  Regular social audits should monitor poverty and wealth.  For the Greens struggling to overcome unemployment in the EU is one element in a more comprehensive strategy for ecology, solidarity and democracy which does not stop at any frontiers. Therefore, we link these demands to the EU Commission with the demand for an adequate development of the social and employment dimension of the EU's accession strategy for central and Eastern European countries.  The European Green Parties are committed to creating a European space of economic regulation and common development for the whole of Europe, including Russia and the CIS area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  Unfortunately time did not allow more Members to participate.  Unemployment in the European Union but particularly in Ireland concerns every public representative.  Although our economy is the Celtic Tiger and there is a great success story to tell, our unemployment level at 10.3 per cent is not something about which we can be complacent. The challenge for all of us, and particularly for one with responsibility for employment, trade and enterprise, is to ensure we translate that high growth which the economy is experiencing into more job opportunities for the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed. That is the reason the Government has placed strong emphasis in the Estimates for 1998 on training of the employed and the unemployed. Training of the unemployed will increase by 21 per cent next year and of the employed by 95 per cent.  To sustain the jobs we have in Ireland our workers must be trained and retrained and must be flexible and adaptable to the changing circumstances in the global economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of unemployment in the EU, at somewhere between 18 million and 20 million people, depending on how it is measured, is the greatest single disaster of the economic union. The coming together of so many member states has brought huge social and economic benefits to all our citizens.  That we have had peace in Europe since the foundation of the European <Col N="1572" /> Economic Community is one of its greatest achievements and it has resulted in enormous benefits.  Where it has failed is in the area of employment.  That is why I am pleased that the heads of Government will meet later this week to discuss realistic options for tackling that high level of unemployment, at over 10 per cent of the workforce.  It is the equivalent of the population of three or four member states, depending on which member states we take.</P>
    <P>The guidelines which have been refined by the Luxembourg Presidency are realistic and are based on four main pillars: the development of the whole concept of entrepreneurship, adaptability, flexibility &mdash; which is extremely important if the European economy is to get a greater market share in the global economy &mdash; and employability. This is where the issues of training and education come to the fore.  Recently the Government announced a £250 million package for education and investment in education for the emerging jobs of the future.  We want to ensure our workers and our young people are equipped with the necessary skills for the fast changing world in which we have to operate.</P>
    <P>Recently a multinational company located close to here told me that within the next 15 months it will change not only its product range but its whole process.  To respond to that rapid change workers have to adapt, to be retrained and flexible.  The whole issue of training is extremely important.</P>
    <P>We have to look also at the issue of equality of opportunity, not just as between men and women but as between young, unskilled and experienced workers and as between the unemployed and those already in the world of work.  The four pillars which form the guidelines of the decision to be made by the heads of Government form the basis for something worthwhile in the area of employment.  That is extremely important.  Next year we will spend £750 million on schemes to encourage people to move from the world of welfare to the world of work.  We need to look realistically at how we can make it easy for people to make that transition.  I am having discussions with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs about this matter.  As a society, we must provide job opportunities for everybody who wishes to work.  As we all know, from unemployment comes marginalisation and isolation; a sense of a loss of dignity, self-value and self-worth; a greater dependency on drugs and alcohol; in the case of some young people, a greater tendency to drift into a life of crime; and the breakdown of family relationships. It is important for social and many other reasons, not just economic, to place the unemployment issue at the top of the agenda.  It is appropriate that next weekend the heads of Government should seek to address in a realistic way how member states can deal with this serious economic and social issue. <Col N="1573" /></P>

      <P>&mdash;finalise his submission to the Taoiseach in order to enable the report of the strategic management initiative on the Garda to be published, debated and implemented;</P>
      <P>&mdash;put an end to the costly and self-defeating revolving door system of token imprisonment;</P>
      <P>&mdash;adequately resource the overburdened Probation and Welfare Service in order to enable it to prevent and divert crime and guarantee supervision of convicted persons placed in its care;</P>
      <P>&mdash;introduce a comprehensive drug treatment and therapy programme for women prisoners who are drug addicts; and,</P>
      <P>&mdash;introduce effective prison programmes and post-release programmes for sex offenders, and, calls on the Minister to finalise within two weeks his submission on the strategic management initiative on the Garda, to guarantee that there will be no further closures of Garda stations or reduction in Garda hours or numbers and to place on record his policy objectives in crime reduction, the operation of the prison system, the resourcing of the Probation and Welfare Service and implementation of treatment programmes for drug and sex offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has now been almost five months in office.  One of its most notable features has been the total transformation of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who for two and a half years in Opposition, day in, day out, in the Dáil, the newspapers, on radio and television, railed against probably the finest Minister for Justice this country has seen.  Deputy Owen inherited a situation <Col N="1574" /> where criminals strutted their stuff with an arrogance and contempt for law and order; where the Garda Commissioner admitted that the general public had lost a fair degree of confidence in the Garda Síochána to do the job they were paid to do; where the laws of the land often protected the criminal rather than the innocent victims of their actions; where millions of pounds, the proceeds of crime, were either stashed away untouched in banks and financial institutions inside or outside the country or laundered untraced through a variety of legitimate and respectable business outlets and ventures; where the overflowing prison population had almost institutionalised the revolving door practice of here today, gone tomorrow. Thanks to the dogged determination and vision of the Minister's predecessor, in just two and a half years the largest, erstwhile, most untouchable criminal gangs are now behind bars, on the run, in exile or the subject of extradition proceedings, their empires crumbling in tatters. Thanks to the leadership and freshness of approach of the new Garda Commissioner appointed by the Rainbow Government, again on the recommendation of the Minister's predecessor, morale within the Garda has soared and, most importantly, public confidence in the force restored.</P>
    <P>The almost automatic right to bail, irrespective of the likelihood of reoffending, is now at an end. The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill 1996, introduced by the Minister's predecessor, means that the shield of the right to silence has been abolished allowing a court to make its deduction if a defendant refuses to answer legitimate questions.  The Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996, introduced by the same Rainbow Government has hit the managers of crime where it hurts most by seizing and impounding their assets.</P>
    <P>Five hundred new Garda were recruited in 1996, a new Garda Drugs Unit established and £5.5 million provided for the new helicopter and fixed wing 'plane promised by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Mr. Gerry Collins, in 1981. In addition, 200 civilians were recruited to undertake secretarial work to enable a corresponding number of desk-bound Garda to fight crime and an additional 24 judges appointed to the courts to speed up the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>Yet, while all those measures were being brought on stream, Deputy John O'Donoghue, then in Opposition, ranted and raved from the Opposition benches &mdash; every administrative hitch, every systems failure being laid firmly at the feet of the then Minister, Deputy Owen.  Virtually every bank raid, murder and assault was interpreted as a personal reflection on the politically culpable Minister for Justice.  The initiatives undertaken, legislative and administrative, which struck at the very heart of criminal activity, were ridiculed and derided by him.  Even the Courts and Court Officers Bill was wrong because, it was contended, its provisions would strip the Minister <Col N="1575" /> and her Department of their powers and functions.</P>
    <P>Where has this hot-gospeling Minister gone to? Where has the Deputy John O'Donoghue of yesteryear, the prophet of doom, gone?  Where has the reforming zealot, Deputy John O'Donoghue, gone to?  What has happened to the visionary who had all the answers when on this side of the House?  He appears to have lapsed into silence and become invisible since crossing the floor of the Chamber.  Where are the dynamic policy initiatives he promised would roll from his so-called reservoir of research as soon as he became Minister for Justice?</P>
    <P>The Minister's performance has been abysmal. Every item of legislation produced to date, or promised on the Minister's pre-Christmas legislative list, has been inherited from his predecessor, Deputy Owen, such as the Courts and Court Officers Bill, the Prisons Service Bill, the International Commercial Arbitration Bill, the Europol Bill, the Children Bill and the Child Pornography Bill.  Even the latest initiative announced this evening on the Criminal Justice Bill, long promised and overdue, on which he will be holding a press conference in due course, was flushed out because of this motion.</P>
    <P>I have availed of the opportunity to re-examine some of the clear commitments Deputy O'Donoghue undertook to honour and implement if and when he became Minister for Justice.  One of Fianna Fáil's first priorities would be the restructuring of the Garda.  Under the Rainbow Coalition Government's strategic management initiative a review group produced a detailed report recommending new laws covering the questioning and detention of suspects and a major overhaul and restructuring of the Garda Síochána, which has been with the Taoiseach for the past five months.  Yet, as he informed the House in the course of Question Time last week, it cannot be published, debated or implemented because the Minister for Justice and his Department have failed to complete their submissions on the issues that go to the core of his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister also promised there would be a specialist, organised crime unit established by Fianna Fáil in Government but, to date, there has been no such move.  In addition, the Minister promised the establishment of a specialist squad to investigate what he described as &ldquo;complicated murders&rdquo;, of which there has been no mention or action taken thereon to date.</P>
    <P>In an article published in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11 March 1997, the then Deputy John O'Donoghue was reported as saying that Fianna Fáil would suspend a pub licence for three months if drugs were sold on the premises and, if that happened on more than three occasions in five years, the licence would be forfeited unless the owner established that everything possible had been done to prevent the sale of drugs on the premises.  It was a modest, worthwhile, fundamental and yet commendable <Col N="1576" /> proposal and yet not a single syllable seems to have been spoken about it since.</P>
    <P>We were told that Fianna Fáil in Government would adopt a preventative approach to the drugs problem and create a drug court system to replace the revolving door, yet the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, in dealing with the problem recently in Galway while launching a very meritorious report, did not mention the long promised drug court system.  What is the current status of the proposal?  Is it to go ahead?  If so, when?</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats joint Programme for Government promised a custodial detention centre would be established for convicted addicts and remand prisoners who are addicted, with all other prisons to be drug free.  I cannot recall a single utterance from the Minister or any member of Government as to what is happening to this proposal.  Will the Minister clarify the position?  Is it to go ahead?  If so, when? Where is it to be constructed?  What will it cost? How many drug addicted prisoners will it accommodate?</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government is quite specific about another commitment &mdash; to enable gardaí to concentrate on crime control a community warden service will be recruited by local authorities to relieve their workload.  There is silence and no attempt to elaborate on a clear commitment penned a mere five months ago.  If the proposal is to go ahead, will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform tell us when it will go ahead?  What exactly will this community warden scheme do?  Have the local authorities been consulted about it or do they know anything about it?</P>
    <P>There was another clear commitment, that temporary accommodation would be provided immediately to deal with the immediate prison space crisis.  July, August, September and October have all come and gone and November has almost expired and yet not alone is there no sign of the promised immediate temporary spaces but 50 prisoners are released from Mountjoy Prison every day to make space for incoming prisoners.</P>
    <P>The Governor of Mountjoy Prison was hauled before the courts because he allowed to go free on 25 August a prisoner who was sentenced in April to 11 months for larceny and who received another 22 month sentence in June.  This made a mockery of the gardaí, whose vigilance and police efforts led to the arrest and charge, and the courts, which imposed the sentence.  The Governor, of course, was exonerated.  It is not Governor Lonergan's fault that the prisoners must sleep on mattresses in padded cells, the prison library and the recreational hall.  It is not his fault there are 60 women prisoners crowded into accommodation built for 40.  It is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and not Governor Lonergan who should have been in the dock because prisoners are released not on the say so of the Governor of Mountjoy Prison or any <Col N="1577" /> prison governor but on the specific sanction of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be in the dock and with him should be his colleagues in the Progressive Democrats who delivered zero prison spaces in the three and a half years they were in Government together between 1989 and 1992.  In the subsequent period from 1992 to 1994, a portion of which Deputy O'Donoghue spent as a Minister of State, Fianna Fáil delivered a grand total of 57 prison spaces.  Compare this to the additional 30 places at St. Patrick's institution, 38 at Mountjoy Prison health unit, 40 at Castlerea, 100 at the Curragh and 48 at Wheatfield Prison under the former Minister, Deputy Nora Owen.</P>
    <P>When the Rainbow Coalition left office construction was already well under way for 800 further prison places.  Meanwhile the door keeps revolving and the crisis continues.  There is no sign of the immediate temporary accommodation promised so unequivocally by Deputy O'Donoghue in Opposition just a few months ago.  Are we still talking about erecting emergency short-term accommodation?  Are we talking about leasing or utilising some State or privately owned available buildings?  Are we admitting that the scheme of emergency temporary accommodation has been abandoned?</P>
    <P>Of all the abandoned promises, the most widely heralded, the zero tolerance proposal, must certainly rank as the greatest confidence trick for many a long day.  Minister O'Donoghue's promise of a crime-free Utopia, with a blitz on all crimes both major and minor, was never a realisable proposition.  Even though the Garda Commissioner rightly warned that the imposition of a New York severe policing regime here would mean arresting and prosecuting every offender, result in mountains of paper work, the choking of our already overcrowded prisons and the rupture of the vital relationship between police and community, Minister O'Donoghue stuck to his guns. In Government it would be zero tolerance New York style or nothing.</P>
    <P>Mr. George Maybury, General Secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, warned that zero tolerance, if applied literally, would damage the advisory discretion of gardaí when dealing with juveniles as well as the juvenile liaison system which has saved many young people from a life of misery.  He warned that conviction at such a tender age would effectively end any chance of a public service job or a visa to enter the United States.  Yet Minister O'Donoghue ploughed ahead.  Even though he was warned time and again, he continued to insist on the zero tolerance philosophy he espoused in Opposition and which was proudly proclaimed in the joint programme for Government which states: &ldquo;We will adopt a zero tolerance policy towards crime, including white-collar crime&rdquo;. There were to be no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;, &ldquo;buts&rdquo; or &ldquo;maybes&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: When Minister O'Donoghue emerged from his summer sabbatical on 4 September, he seemed to have jettisoned zero tolerance except for the drug trafficking and serious criminal element.  That is superfluous because while we may have lacked the necessary legislative clout to deal with drug traffickers and others up to the time the legislative programme of former Minister, Deputy Owen, came into effect, including the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, there was never any question of tolerating the activities of drug traffickers, etc. The Minister seems to have piggybacked on the measures introduced by his predecessor while, at the same time, promises solemnly entered into when in Opposition a mere five months ago have been abandoned or allowed to languish.</P>
      <P>The past few years have seen a slight but welcome reduction in the number of murders after a spate of gangland murders in 1994 and 1995 in particular.  Unfortunately, murder is again on the increase as witnessed by the tragic happenings of the past three weeks.  One of the features of some of these murders was the use of legally held weapons. It is extraordinary that in order to qualify to drive a motor vehicle, one must be aged 17 years.  One must first obtain a provisional licence during which one develops, hopefully, the necessary driving skills.  One then applies, after a specified probationary period, to do a driving test before a full driving licence can issue, yet one can obtain a legal firearm at 16 years of age without any training requirement or test of competence.</P>
      <P>The Firearms Act, 1925, places an unfair burden on the State and on the Garda in that any refusal to issue a licence or a certificate must be accompanied by a reason for same.  That calls into question the justifiable negative instincts which tell a garda that he should not issue a licence.  It compromises the discretion of a garda to refuse a licence.  I urge the Minister to re-examine as a matter of urgency the Firearms Act, 1925, particularly section 8 which sets down the exclusions and one's disentitlement to hold a firearms certificate rather than the stipulations and qualifications which should be necessary.  Far tighter controls should operate on the issue of firearms. I urge the Minister to consider amending the legislation on the basis that henceforth licence holders should be bona fide members of gun clubs and should be sponsored by a minimum of two responsible people.  Licence holders should be obliged to produce a medical report every three years as to their fitness, mental stability and suitability to hold a firearms certificate.  Weapons should be rarely licensed for non-games purposes, except perhaps for vermin control confined to the precincts of one's land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position is that a major disaster is waiting to happen.  I do not want to send out unnecessary danger signals about a repeat of Dunblane, but all one need do is take account of <Col N="1579" /> the number of legally held firearms in circulation. For example, in l995 195,000 licences were issued, yet the National Association of Regional Game Councils has only 22,000 members.  Admittedly, some of them have more than one firearm, but even allowing for some members holding a second firearm somewhere in the region of 165,000 firearms are held by non-aligned persons. They are not members of an NARGC and the majority of them are not members of sporting clubs involved in target practice, clay pigeon shooting, etc.  We should seriously consider the need to introduce liability insurance for those issued with a firearms certificate.</P>
    <P>I alluded to the 265 additional prison spaces provided by the former Minister, Deputy Owen, and the 800 places under construction.  With a properly managed sentencing policy that provision should be more than adequate to deal with the problem of overcrowding in our prisons.  It should give the Minister vital time and space within which to reflect on whether additional prison spaces, other than the aforementioned, are necessary, if additional expenditure on prisons represents good value for money and if there are viable, workable alternatives to the existing prison regime.</P>
    <P>The prison programme is costing £46,140 per annum per prisoner and, according to the l997 Estimates, will cost approximately £105.3 million in l997.  I note the commitment to provide additional prison places at a capital cost of £220 million.  Instead of deterring or rehabilitating criminals our prisons have become universities of crime and, as someone said recently, they have become expensive ways of making bad people worse.  All one has to do is to consider the alarming recidivism rate of 70 per cent.  The prison system deals with a turnover of 10,000 inmates per annum at a whopping cost of £105.3 million, yet the probation and welfare service deals with an annual turnover of 5,000 offenders with a meagre budget of £12 million in l996 which was increased to £14 million in l997.  The Minister may say its budget has been increased by 22 to 25 per cent but that increase has been on the capital side and covers the opening of new offices and new welfare and probation outlets in the city.  Admittedly they are badly needed, but what additional money is being allocated for personnel to provide additional probation and welfare services?  The capital cost of a prisoner is £46,140 per annum while the capital cost of an offender under the probation and welfare service is £2,800.  Yet the probation and welfare service, which sets out in its agenda to prevent and divert crime, to intervene before crime becomes habitual and to rehabilitate and reintegrate offenders back into society, has become the Cinderella of the service.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of how under-resourced the service is, with a maximum of 200 probation and welfare officers dealing with 5,000 offenders? Is he aware that each probation officer deals with 20 reports and 60 offenders simultaneously, a <Col N="1580" /> workload which is double that of their UK counterparts, that because of their huge workload, offenders put into their care by the courts remain totally unsupervised in many cases and that because of the impossible burden placed upon them, vital background reports in respect of family law cases are no longer available to the courts from the probation and welfare service, leaving the judge and the competing solicitors to sort out family law difficulties without crucial and up to date assessments?</P>
    <P>There has been no proper analysis of crime or proper comparison between the efficacy of prison as against the success of the probation and welfare service.  We have never examined the crucial issue of what turns a ten year old into a hardened criminal two years before he leaves primary school.  Prison has a role and has to be an option for offences against the person and serious offences against property.  It should, however, be the last rather then the first or only option.  There has been no proper evaluation of whether the prison system works or whether capital punishment works.  There has been no proper assessment or co-ordination of the various statistics which emerge in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána, the prison service and the probation and welfare service.  High level technology and computerisation are used in producing three sets of statistics from three different arms of the criminal justice system and yet there is no liaison, interaction or co-ordination between them.</P>
    <P>I have examined, for example, the 1997 Estimate for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and from a budget of almost £1,000 million there is not a single pound allocated to criminal research.  There is no criminology department either inside or outside our universities. We simply plough blindly ahead pouring millions of pounds into so-called accepted solutions, the values and merits of which are open to serious question.</P>
    <P>Nobody seems to have addressed the fact that 80 per cent of offences are drug related and that this is where the proportionate concentration of effort and resources should go.  Nobody seems to have assessed the fact that the bulk of offenders, particularly those involved in drug related offences, come from a handful of identifiable communities where imaginative socio-economic programmes involving the probation and welfare service would have a major impact.  The Minister and Department seem oblivious to a major problem which is on their doorstep and which will shortly burst at the seams with a vengeance.</P>
    <P>There are 250 sex offenders in prison and the number increases daily.  Only ten are undergoing treatment programmes.  There is a nightmare scenario in prospect.  Hundreds of sex offenders, including paedophiles, will be released into society in due course having had no treatment, having been shunned by society, their families and employers, with no home to go to and, in most cases, with virtually no job prospects.  What <Col N="1581" /> arrangements are being put in place to cope with this inevitable mass exodus?</P>
    <P>Last week the various churches commemorated the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine.  Just as the Famine blighted our history in the 19th century and TB was the scourge of the first half of the 20th century, the drug epidemic will undoubtedly be remembered as the plague of the last decade of this century.  What was essentially a Dublin and Cork problem 15 years ago is now a sad reality in every town and almost every village. It is the subject of numerous surveys and studies in order to determine its causes, extent and consequences.  Major offensives were undertaken by the rainbow Government in order to seize assets and smash the drug cartels.</P>
    <P>I commend the National Drugs Unit for its success to date.  Seizures such as the £8 million cannabis haul two weeks ago and the £3 million haul last week are bound to have an impact.  Nevertheless, supplies continue to get through.  Former Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, chaired an interdepartmental group which produced a very fine report at the end of April entitled &ldquo;Dealing with the Nightmare of Drug Use and the Intervention in south inner city Dublin&rdquo;.  Its recommendations provided a clear blueprint for the incoming Government, yet no action followed.</P>
    <P>The Minister continues to talk about a co-ordinated approach to the problem involving the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Health and Children.  Has he consulted with his colleagues the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science in order to work out a co-ordinated, integrated strategy? This is the obvious road to go but will we travel it?  Unless a sustained, enlightened and properly resourced multifaceted approach is adopted the problem will continue to grow and the trail of destruction and misery will get longer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record as acknowledging, particularly during his time in Opposition, that our prisons are infested with drugs.  On 11 March this year he asked why there was a drugs-free unit in Mountjoy prison.  The reason he gave was that we were admitting we were unable to control the supply of drugs in a State institution.  In the same breath, the Minister promised a new drugs treatment unit when Fianna Fáil took up office.  Let us be frank and honest; the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, was responsible for introducing the first ever systematic drug treatment programme in Mountjoy prison.  Thanks to her initiative that drug-free zone now exists.  Unfortunately, there is no such group programme in the women's prison in which all the prisoners are drug addicts and there is only one welfare officer. I call on the Minister to respond to the desperate need for a drugs unit in the women's prison, not something piecemeal but a proper drugs therapy programme.  Such a programme is necessary in order that every drug addicted prisoner, without exception, can have access to it.  Is it not the sad reality that, having been supplied with drugs from <Col N="1582" /> outside the prison, women prisoners must pay for that supply as soon as they are released?  They end up re-offending almost on the day of their release to pay for the drug supplies and the vicious cycle begins all over again.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be aware that this is the time of year when the unfortunate splurge of attacks against elderly people in rural Ireland commences.  &ldquo;Operation Shannon&rdquo; and other police activities have had an impact in reducing the scale of such attacks.  However, many of the perpetrators of these foul deeds are still at large and may well be preparing to strike again.  There is no doubt that the policy of denuding rural Ireland of its network of Garda stations has left a vacuum which has been ruthlessly exploited by such criminals.</P>
    <P>I welcome greater Garda mobilisation.  It is good to see the Garda being provided with the necessary technology to do its job.  However, nothing can replace the physical presence of the Garda in an area where a member of the force knows the local community and vice versa.  That is crucial and fundamental to good policing.  On 4 February 1997 the Minister gave a commitment that, when in office, he would end what he described as efforts to &ldquo;close down some Garda stations by stealth&rdquo;.  He further committed Fianna Fáil to a policy which would end the closure of rural Garda stations while expanding rural policing through increased recruitment.  I call on the Minister to honour that pledge and inform the House this evening that there will be no further closures of rural Garda stations during his period in office.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate and to hearing the views of Members from all sides of the House. This debate is important at this juncture.  While the economic success of the Celtic tiger and the largesse it bestows has put us on the world map of successful economies, there exists a deeply corrosive crime issue which must be tackled in an enlightened and systematic way by building on the policies which proved so successful during the regime of the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Government from 1994 to 1997.  I look forward to hearing how exactly the Minister proposes to do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person irrespective of their age, gender or status can fall victim of a crime.  When that happens, people are entitled to be treated with sympathy and respect.  Our criminal justice system does not leave it to individuals to vindicate their rights; it is done on their behalf by the State.  This is where the initial problem often lies because, if this is not done efficiently and sympathetically, the victim can be left disillusioned with the system of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Victims should have the right to be treated with compassion and respect for their dignity at all times and should be provided with such services and necessities as might be reasonably required by them in restoring their dignity immediately after the commission of an offence and for a <Col N="1583" /> reasonable time thereafter.  To achieve this it is essential all agencies involved with victims take the necessary steps to minimise the trauma and hardship that may be involved.  This places a heavy burden of responsibility on the media, the Garda Síochána, the legal profession, the courts, the caring professions and other agencies.</P>
    <P>A victim of crime is defined as a person or persons who have suffered harm of any kind, including physical or mental injury, emotional suffering, economic loss or substantial impairment of their capacity to function within the community, through acts or omissions which are in breach of the criminal law.  It includes where appropriate the immediate family or dependants of such persons or any persons who suffer from harm in assisting such persons.</P>
    <P>The media should ensure the victim's privacy is not needlessly violated and the trauma is not increased by insensitive reporting of the circumstances of the crime.  They should always exercise proper restraint and consideration towards victims. Photographs should never be published without the permission of the victim or, if applicable, the family of the deceased.</P>
    <P>Prosecuting authorities should advise victims of the outcome of applications for bail and of the conditions attached thereto relevant to the victims. The courts should be allowed to refuse bail in circumstances where victims' witnesses are likely to be intimidated or who fear for their personal safety.  Victims are entitled to have their need or perceived need for physical protection considered during a hearing in respect of bail for the accused prior to, during or after the trial, where such need or perceived need has been brought to the attention of the prosecuting authorities. The elderly and the handicapped suffer more as a result of crime and are most vulnerable. Landlords, proprietors of homes, hostels or institutions and all persons working therein have a particular responsibility towards these people and should report any irregularity, injury or abuse coming to their notice.</P>
    <P>Crime was a major issue in the general election campaign but little or no attention was paid to businesses which were victims of crime.  A joint survey recently conducted by the Small Firms Association and the Irish security industry showed that 41 per cent of small companies had been victims of crime in the previous year.  The major sources of crime were vandalism and burglary of goods and cash.  The total annual cost of such crime was estimated at £124 million.  Even more worrying was the fact that each small company spent more than £2,000 on crime prevention, representing a cost to small businesses of £320 million.  In total, business crime cost small companies more than £400 million.  The Government must make the elimination of business crime a major priority.</P>
    <P>The present scheme for compensation of victims of crime is wholly inadequate.  No compensation is paid for pain and suffering, delays in <Col N="1584" /> dealing with claims under the scheme are unacceptable and the scheme is not user friendly. Simplified application forms could be made available in local Garda stations.  The present scheme should be expanded to permit some form of compensation for pain and suffering.  This could be funded from a central restitution fund which could be financed by revenue from court fines, moneys recovered from legal activities and moneys recovered from compensation orders made against convicted offenders.</P>
    <P>In all cases the courts should make compensation orders against offenders.  Even if the offenders have little or no means, they should be required to apply such means as they acquire at a later stage towards satisfaction of an outstanding compensation order.  Incentives to encourage compliance with compensation orders could be introduced, such as a percentage reduction for early payment.  Indeed, a similar incentive could be introduced to encourage early payment of fines and reduce the considerable amount of Garda time which is expended in this area.</P>

    <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to set out for the House in some detail the Government's programme to deal with crime.  This is a programme designed to address the root causes of crime, to bring about a meaningful, sustained and long-term reduction in the level of crime and to confront the habitual criminal head on.  It is not a knee-jerk response to the problem.  On the contrary, it is the result of a great deal of consideration about the nature of crime in Ireland today and of the factors that cause much of it.</P>
    <P>The programme recognises that the various State agencies involved in the fight against crime are part of the same apparatus.  They should be regarded as the engine of the criminal justice system &mdash;an integrated system in which it is my job to chart the overall direction and to ensure that each part dovetails with the next to provide an efficient, effective and focused service to the public.</P>
    <P>Put simply, it is for Government to lay down the broad lines of crime policy and it is for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that this policy is implemented in an effective and cohesive way.  In this regard, the implementation of an integrated crime policy requires first a clear and determined focus on tackling those engaged in criminal activity &mdash; that strategy is zero tolerance &mdash; second, a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime and that they will work with each other and with other relevant agencies in a cohesive manner, and third, a commitment to address the causes of crime so that yesterday's mistakes <Col N="1586" /> become the learning experience through which we can avoid tomorrow's problems.</P>
    <P>As I stated, the implementation of an integrated crime policy requires a clear and determined focus on tackling those engaged in criminal activity.  This is the zero tolerance strategy.  Let me assure the House the zero tolerance strategy has not been abandoned, much as Deputy Higgins would like people to believe that.  The strategy is being implemented.  The Government set out clearly what it intends to do to meet the challenge of crime.  Let us be clear about that and not pretend otherwise.  The programme comprises a mix of practical action and legislative change targeted specifically at criminal elements in the community, including those who seek to profit from the deadly trade in illegal drugs whether as financiers, importers, suppliers or pushers.  The programme is directed towards assisting the Garda Síochána with resources to strengthen its operational hand.  It will be accompanied by changes in legislation which will increase the State's statutory armoury to take on and put out of business those who organise themselves for the purpose of crime.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this House will agree that we cannot tolerate a state of affairs in which lives are destroyed and communities blighted by those who import, distribute and peddle drugs.  Zero tolerance is the only answer to such evil and, as such, deserves the full support of this House. Whatever about the full support of the House, it is getting the full support of the community.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the Government today approved the text of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, which I will publish tomorrow and on which I have been working throughout the summer.  The fact that this major criminal law reform measure is being introduced so early in the lifetime of this Government is clear practical evidence of the Government's policy of zero tolerance of crime, particularly but not exclusively drug trafficking.  The Bill contains a series of strong measures which are, regrettably, all too necessary as a response to those who inflict such harm on our community.  Given the obvious importance of this measure, it is appropriate in the course of this debate to give the House details of what the Bill will contain.  Under the main provisions of the Bill persons trafficking in drugs to the value of £10,000 or more will face mandatory minimum sentences of ten years.  That commitment was given prior to the election when in Opposition and will be lived up to.  Trials will take place more quickly through the abolition of preliminary examinations.  Courts will automatically initiate an inquiry into the assets of people convicted of drug trafficking offences with a view to confiscating those assets.  That was a commitment given in Opposition and during the election and is being lived up to.  Gardaí will have to spend less time in court through the extension of the type of evidence which can be given by certificate. I do not have to repeat what I have already said about commitments.  The rules relating to a <Col N="1587" /> court taking into account guilty pleas are being placed on a clear statutory basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of Deputy Jim Higgins's remarks about the initiatives of Deputy Owen, the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, was enacted by this House on my initiative as Opposition spokesperson. It enables the courts to freeze assets where they are satisfied they represent the proceeds of crime.  The most recent statistics available indicate that under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, the Criminal Assets Bureau has obtained 20 interim orders for assets in excess of £2 million and 12 interlocutory orders for assets in excess of £1.3 million.  Revenue officers of the bureau have investigated, assessed and made demands for payment of income tax with interest to the value of £8.2 million on persons suspected of criminal activity.  The bureau has also assessed social welfare overpayments of £150,000.  The bureau has proven in the short time it has been in place to be very effective in denying drug dealers and organised criminals the benefits of their activities and has seriously disrupted the activities of criminal gangs.  I welcome Deputy Jim Higgins's acknowledgement of that because the Criminal Assets Bureau was a consequence of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, without which the bureau would have been largely redundant.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of recent high profile cases reported in the media which have shown a ruthless level of criminal organisation, most notably in the areas of drug trafficking and money laundering.  These cases have demonstrated the need to have available, if required, a special system of witness security to enable prosecutions to be taken.  Therefore, I have authorised a formal witness security programme to be put in place by the Garda Síochána.  This is a powerful new tool in the fight against serious and organised crime.  It affords the criminal justice system the opportunity of obtaining the best evidence from first hand witnesses who are willing to testify in court.</P>
    <P>No crime policy can succeed if the Garda does not have the required resources in terms of personnel and equipment to do its job and the Government is delivering on those resources. During the term of office of the previous Minister, natural wastage outstripped recruitment in the force.  This meant there were fewer people in the Garda Síochána subsequent to the forced retirement of the previous Minister for Justice than there were when she came to office.  Those are the facts.</P>

      <P>Natural wastage outstripped recruitment in the force which led to a depletion <Col N="1588" /> in its numbers in the period of office of the previous Minister for Justice.  The programme for Government provides for additional recruitment over and above future recruitment levels agreed by the previous Government with a view to bringing the total strength to 12,000.  This additional recruitment will commence early in the new year with accelerated recruitment from the 1997 recruitment competition.</P>
      <P>These gardaí will have the very best equipment. Last week I had the privilege of launching into service nine Isuzu high powered, high specification four wheel drive vehicles.  They are the first in a batch of 20 such vehicles, the remainder of which will be delivered and brought into service in the next few weeks.  The total cost of supplying and equipping these vehicles is £500,000. The vehicles are equipped with a sophisticated array of equipment and each of them has communications facilities and roof markings to facilitate operations in conjunction with the Garda air support unit.  It is essential the Garda be equipped with the latest state of the art policing technology to meet the challenge of modern day crime head on and to face down the criminal elements in the community.  Technology does not come cheap and that the Book of Estimates for 1998 shows an unprecedented 10 per cent increase in the Justice, Equality and Law Reform Votes is proof, if any were required, of the Goverment's commitment in this area.</P>
      <P>I strongly refute any suggestion that this Government has been associated with or has an agenda for the closure of Garda stations or reducing policing services to the public.  The rural community policing programme has received some attention in the media as of late arising from a review of its operation being conducted by the Garda Commissioner.  Unfortunately, there has been some misunderstanding over the years concerning the objectives of this scheme.  Regrettably, the rural community policing scheme is synonymous in the minds of some with the closure of Garda stations.  It was never designed to close rural Garda stations.  It may have been the position under the last Minister that rural Garda stations were set to close but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Rural community policing is aimed at providing a better service by allowing gardaí spend more time on active operational duties in their districts including, in particular, visits to the elderly, while at the same time providing for station opening hours which actually suit local community needs.  The fact that there will be a considerable number of gardaí available <Col N="1589" /> following the completion of the recruitment programme will mean we will be able to ensure that there are more gardaí in rural communities.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been operating in 14 Garda districts since 1991.  The Garda Commissioner is evaluating the operation of the scheme and reviewing previous proposals for its extension.  He has recently indicated to me that he is considering certain modifications to the scheme with a view to enhancing its operational effectiveness. However, I would like to emphasise that no decisions concerning an extension of the scheme have been taken and no such decisions can be taken until proposals are received from the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>The Garda SMI report was submitted to the former Taoiseach and it has been accepted from the outset, and I accept, that it was to be brought to Government by the Taoiseach's Department. However, it would have been folly to bring forward a report of this kind to Government and seek to have it published and implemented without taking account of the reality that the Garda were seriously dissatisfied over pay.  It clearly made a considerable amount of sense to address pay and SMI implementation at the same time.  A basis has now been found for doing this.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced the appointment of a new Deputy State Pathologist who will take up her appointment on 5 January 1998.  That appointment represents a significant breakthrough in the provision of a properly resourced State pathology service which is an essential requirement for the Garda in investigating deaths which occur in suspicious circumstances.  I vigorously campaigned for such an appointment in Opposition and now, in Government, I am pleased to be in a position to deliver on this matter.</P>

      <P>The Government, recognising the urgent need for a significant increase in prison accommodation, is proceeding, as a matter of high priority and as rapidly as is feasible, with a major prison building programme.  The programme will have delivered in excess of 1,070 additional places within the first two years of this Government being in office.  In the slightly longer term the provision of a total of 2,000 additional places is planned within the five year term of this Government.  These planned additional places will represent an increase of, approximately, 45 per cent in the current prison accommodation level within the first two years of the life of the Government and a planned increase of, in excess of, 80 per cent over the full five year period from mid-1997.</P>

    <P>Construction of the new wing at Limerick Prison is now virtually complete and it will provide 55 additional places, together with the necessary range of prisoner support facilities.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will provide 137 prison places and is due to be opened in February next year.  The new remand prison beside Wheatfield, which will provide 400 places and the new female prison beside Mountjoy, which will have 80 places, are under construction and are due for completion later next year.  A major stand alone prison planned for Portlaoise will provide an additional 400 places, including 40 places in a special segregation unit.  Planning for this new prison, which is being procured on a client-led design, build and finance basis, is being advanced rapidly.  Invitations to tender will issue before the end of this year.  Construction is planned to commence in March 1998 and to be completed within 15 months.  Planning for the remaining places, to be provided under the Government's prison building programmes has now commenced.  The necessary capital funding for the building programme will be provided, commencing with a provision of more than £45 million for 1998. When Deputy Owen was Minister for Justice I predicted she would never be Minister to pay the bill for extra prison places.  Those words were prophetic.</P>
      <P>The Mountjoy drug treatment facility has been in operation for some time at the male prison's health care unit.  This facility provides for humane detoxification and a therapy programme.  The unit is the first of its kind in a prison environment in this State and it is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community.  While there is not a dedicated unit for drug treatment in Mountjoy Female Prison, detoxification programmes are available to appropriate prisoners.  In the female prison especially, detoxification programmes tend to be specifically tailored to meet the clinical needs of the individual prisoner.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining the feasibility of further expanding the range of treatment options available to prisoners, including those prisoners in Mountjoy Female Prison. Where inmates have completed the detoxification programme they can continue to serve their sentence in the general prison population or, if they are considered suitable, they can be granted temporary release to continue treatment with an outside agency or they can opt for a transfer to the drug free unit.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to female prisoners is unsatisfactory.  This is due, to a large extent, to the overcrowding in Mountjoy Female Prison. This issue is under continuous review between officials of my Department and the Eastern Health Board.  I hope interim solutions will emerge.  In any event I am satisfied this issue can be resolved in the context of the move to the new purpose built women's prison I mentioned earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently approximately 280 persons <Col N="1591" /> in custody for sex offences.  These offenders represent a growing proportion of the prison population. The increasing number of sex offenders has outstripped our ability to put effective programmes in place for them.</P>
    <P>There are currently two forms of therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the present system, both aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their offending behaviour.  The first is individual counselling from the Department's clinical psychology service or from the probation and welfare service. This service is available in all prisons with the temporary exception of the Curragh, which is awaiting the provision of both services.  The second is an intensive offence focused group work programme available only in Arbour Hill Prison.  Both forms of treatment are voluntary. Offenders are encouraged to avail of these services but they are neither compelled to attend, nor do they receive any extra concessions for attending.</P>
    <P>The first structured psychological treatment programme was established in Arbour Hill in 1994.  The aim of the programme is to reduce sexual victimisation in society.  The aim is not to effect a cure, but to reduce the probability of offenders re-offending on release.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important issues that need to be addressed if treatment programmes for sex offenders are to continue to develop. Approximately 60 sex offenders are released each year, a large number of whom would not be candidates for the treatment programme due to disinterest or because they are serving short sentences. However, the number of offenders being processed annually through the programme needs to be increased.  A significant first step would be to double the number of treatment places available annually from ten to 20, thus ensuring sufficient treatment places for about one third of sex offenders leaving the prison system annually.</P>
    <P>Now that the programme has been firmly established in Arbour Hill, it is imperative that a comprehensive research project is initiated to evaluate its efficacy and that of any future expansion of the programme, including its contribution, if any, to a reduction in recidivism.  Negotiations have reached an advanced stage with the Department of Psychology, University College, Dublin, to undertake such a study over a four year period and my Department will approach the Department of Finance for approval to commence this study later this year.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to introduce new and different programmes for offenders in both Arbour Hill and Cork prisons in the future.  These programmes will target offenders on protection, including sex offenders. They will be run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers.  Such structured interpersonal work with offenders represents a significant development of the role of the prison officer and a new and challenging development within <Col N="1592" /> the prison service.  These programmes will be up and running in early 1998.</P>
    <P>I will also be publishing a discussion document on sexual offences early in the new year which will address a range of issues relating to these heinous crimes, including the possibility of establishing a register of sex offenders.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to developing a balanced criminal justice system.  As I have already stated, we are making tremendous progress on developing the prisons system, as evidenced by the huge investment by the Government in providing more prison places and better facilities.  We must also look at the non custodial side of the system.  I take this opportunity to say the Government has now decided to establish an expert group to examine the Probation and Welfare Service. The group, which will be chaired by a distinguished businessman, will examine the role of that service having regard to recent and current developments, the needs of the service and its organisational status.  The membership of the group will be fairly broadly based and with relevant experience.  The group will make recommendations and report to me within four months.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Probation and Welfare Service is currently operating under great pressure and that the demands being placed on it are constantly increasing.  I look forward to receiving the group's report which I hope will make recommendations which will be a blueprint to guide the service into the new millennium.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am pleased to say I have been able to secure adequate financial allocation in the 1998 Estimates to enable the service develop three new probation centres next year.  I recently opened a new probation centre for the North Clondalkin Probation Project, which was built at a cost of approximately £700,000 and was funded by my Department.  I support and welcome the development of projects such as this which represent a joint approach by the official agencies and local communities in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>There must also be a commitment to address the causes of crime so that, as I have already said, yesterday's mistakes become the learning experience through which we can avoid tomorrow's problems.  I restate that this Government recognises the importance of examining, identifying and tackling the fundamental causes of crime.  It is an essential and vital part of the Government's approach to crime.</P>
    <P>It has long been recognised that the population of our prisons is not representative of all sections of society.  Many of the people who go to prison come from the same backgrounds, the same areas and, indeed, sometimes from the same families. We must intervene in the cycle that seems to condemn certain of our citizens to a life of crime and punishment.  This will not be easy.  However, I can state that this Government is determined to address the causes of social exclusion, which is one of the Taoiseach's priorities.  The establishment of the interdepartmental policy committee <Col N="1593" /> on local development is another tangible expression of the Government's sincerity in its approach to the problem of social exclusion.</P>
    <P>I have already made known my desire to encourage a greater contribution from the community to the public debate on crime.  There is a fundamental need for the community as a whole to contribute to the debate on the fight against crime.  In order to encourage and facilitate that debate, I have decided to set up a crime forum early next year.  What I have in mind is an open and public debate between all sectors of society &mdash; individuals and groups, including experts, from here and abroad &mdash; on the reality of crime, its causes and remedies.</P>
    <P>My hope is that the forum will assist the community in contributing to the formation of crime policy and the establishment of a permanent community based crime council.  Its deliberations will also be taken into account in the drafting of a White Paper on crime which I intend to publish in 1998.  I am confident that the community in general will not only welcome this opportunity but also make good use of it to influence the criminal justice system.  I will be making an announcement shortly concerning the composition of the forum and the details of venue etc.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised that the causes of crime and disorder in many urban areas today are multifaceted, requiring a solution which not only addresses the crime aspect of the problem but also a wide range of socio-economic issues.  It is not sufficient simply to rely on law enforcement to solve all problems.  I am also concerned with individual communities and earlier today I approved a grant of £80,000 for the ongoing funding of the KEY Project in west Tallaght which is aimed at diverting juveniles from crime.  It is the sort of measure which will improve the quality of life for those involved in the project and those living in the area where it operates.  It will also show long-term benefits in the years to come as a result of keeping &ldquo;at risk juveniles&rdquo; on the right side of the law.</P>
    <P>Particularly aware of the problems in inner city Dublin, I recently announced the setting up of the NICKOL &mdash; North Inner City Keeps on Learning &mdash; project and made available £50,000 to this end. This brings to 12 the number of community based, multiagency initiatives which my Department funds in areas of disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dundalk.  I am determined to develop and expand the network of these schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>When I took up office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I developed a clear strategy and a range of priority issues which I wanted to address.  With the publishing of the Criminal Justice Bill I will have taken another significant step in moving that strategy forward. There are a number of other developments moving forward, such as the launch of a freephone service to assist the public in reporting crime on a confidential and reward basis and the establishment <Col N="1594" /> of the formal witness security programme which I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have set out in detail what this Government is doing about crime.  It is an impressive, well thought out and focused programme by any standards &mdash;the implementation of zero tolerance, recruitment of more gardaí; more prison spaces to end the so-called revolving door in Irish jails; continued action against organised crime; tough legislation aimed at drug dealers; a process of public consultation through the crime forum; the setting up of a crime council; publication of a White Paper on crime and measures to tackle the causes of crime.  The programme can be summed up in one word: action.</P>
    <P>There is no substance to the Opposition motion.  I am implementing an effective and cohesive crime policy.  I have a clear and determined focus on tackling those who are engaged in criminal activity.  That strategy is zero tolerance.  I am determined that the law enforcement agencies will be properly structured, equipped and resourced to deal with crime, and that they will work with each other, and with other relevant agencies, in a cohesive manner.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to rebut the misstatements, misconceptions, and, regretfully, untruths which have been perpetrated here and elsewhere by the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a Minister who for two and a half years was up and down like a jack-in-the-box telling us what we should do and what legislation we should introduce.  Effectively, he has disappeared in the past four or five weeks.  As the crime figures began to spiral again and many of the problems which the Minister excoriated from the Opposition benches continued to fester, he was nowhere to be found.  I raised a question with the Taoiseach last week on the joyriding plague in my and Deputy Ardagh's constituency. I asked him why the Minister was not implementing the Road Traffic Act, 1994, in so <Col N="1596" /> far as it refers to his Department.  There was no answer.</P>
      <P>I would have liked the Minister close by yesterday when I emerged from my constituency clinic to discover my car had been broken into and valuables worth £300 taken.  Like many victims of crime, I was upset and annoyed because I spent the next three hours phoning insurance companies and garages so I could be mobile to continue my work.  I felt the fierce annoyance and anger of all victims of crime.  Since the Minister took office, the glib rhetoric we heard when he was in Opposition has not been translated into reality. So far he has been a failure in his Ministry.</P>
      <P>Over his two and a half years in Opposition, the Minister outlined what zero tolerance was supposed to mean.  The policing style of pursuing all transgressions used by the recently re-elected Mayor of New York, Mayor Giuliani, a forthcoming Presidential candidate of the Republican Party, was to be followed.  However, in a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, Fintan O'Toole wrote of the population in New York who no-one is too bothered about because they only come out at night.  So far they have been corralled in certain areas of the city.</P>
      <P>The Minister had a glib approach to this area when he was on the Opposition benches.  Since he went across the floor, as was highlighted in an interview he gave about two months ago, he has given himself complete discretion on the concept of zero tolerance, which was ill thought out and badly explained in the first place.  As a poll taken before the general election showed, crime remains one of the two areas people fear the most.  This has not changed.  In the outrageous neglect of many areas of my city and other urban areas, the Minister's party has contributed to the crimewave and its causes, especially in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>Our late, lamented colleague, Michael McDowell, conducted a major survey about a year ago which uncovered an explosion of crime in the southern suburbs of our city.  This has not changed dramatically, if at all, since the Minister took office.  The policy of my party, while I have been in public life, has been as expressed by the British Labour Party &mdash; tough on crime and the causes of crime.  The Labour Party councillors on Dublin City Council and the four county councils put together a policy document in that regard six or seven years ago because we felt that, for so many years the Minister's party and it has to be said, sometimes also the conservative party on this side of the floor, Fine Gael, grossly neglected the social and economic conditions of my city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Studies have shown again and again that there is a direct correlation &mdash; for example, the recent report from the research unit in the Garda college &mdash; between the victims of drug abuse and serious crime, and social deprivation <Col N="1597" /> and lack of educational attainment.  It is a massive area which the majority in this House has refused to face over the years.</P>
      <P>For many years, a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach represented my area.  Now, once again, we have a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach who sees himself as the embodiment of many of the best qualities of Dublin, particularly the north side.  Yet, at the same time, there has been an outrageous refusal to put resources into Dublin while taking a cheap way out with very poor public housing.  In areas of my constituency and in the north west area of the city, I am sure Deputy Carey will agree, we took a cheap and easy way of providing public housing without the slightest concern for the development of a civic society including schools, third level colleges and all the other resources needed.</P>
      <P>The correlation between deprivation and crime levels has been clearly demonstrated.  For example, the area in which I live, Dublin 17, together with Dublin 10, has the lowest levels of third level take up.  Over the years we have also had a significant crime problem.  I pay tribute to the former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, who began to target resources through the disadvantaged areas and early start programmes at children born into massive social deprivation.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gregory has said, the two large conservative parties in this House were content over the years to let the drug problem fester and grow. They allowed certain areas of the city to become almost no go areas for general policing up to the time of the rainbow Government.  It took Veronica Guerin's murder and the movement of the drug culture into middle class estates before the bulk of conservative Deputies began to give a damn about what was happening in many parts of our city.</P>
      <P>Over the years we have heard many pious words but getting to the root of the problem has been difficult.  In the mid 1980s when the crime wave in Dublin was equally bad, there was a refusal by Fine Gael, who proposed this motion, to enter into any kind of social partnership.  When we came up with community programmes on the north side of the city and sought action to deal with the scourge of joyriding, we did not get any support and neither did the trade union movement. I have always regarded so-called joyriding as a very serious crime.  Only a few months ago one of my constituents was ejected through the back window of a car on Raheny Road after being attacked by a gang of four criminals in a stolen car.  I pleaded with the Minister to have the Road Traffic Act, 1994 enforced.  On joyriding, senior members of the Garda Síochána constantly told us we needed new legislation.  However, I always felt the legislation was good enough but it was not being implemented.  Now it has to be implemented and the Minister is responsible for making sure it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the problem of wandering horses was not taken seriously by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. They were not prepared to put resources into <Col N="1598" /> genuine equestrian sports for young people, and it took four and a half years to put any serious legislation into place.  However, it is still not being implemented.  We are supposedly on the stocks, supposedly taking action, but vandalism and crime on open spaces and parks in Dublin has very often been related to people who have outrageously abused horses, and this has not been taken seriously by the conservative parties in this House.</P>
    <P>Worst of all has been the neglect of the horrendous drug problem.  Over the years Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have washed their hands of the problem because it did not affect them.  It was confined to very small areas of this city, and those areas were forgotten about.  My colleague, Deputy Tony Gregory, was right when he said it took action by the people themselves, the awful murder of a member of the Garda Síochána and of Veronica Guerin for this House to respond in any way.  Recent research by Sergeant Éamon Keogh of the Garda Research Unit indicates that, with 66 per cent of serious crime being committed in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, the connection between drug abuse and serious crime is obvious. At any time of the day 3,000 or 4,000 heroin addicts might be seeking money for their next fix. What happened to me yesterday was possibly related to that awful reality.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to colleagues who brought forward legislation in recent years on the partnership front, in education and in other areas to put resources into the more deprived areas of this city and take action which was utterly essential to deal with white collar crime.  Our new party leader, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, is to be congratulated for pursuing the Criminal Assets Bureau issue.  It must be remembered that it was not just politicians like those in the Deputy's party who were against this.  I remember being castigated two years ago by the editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> for my stand on hot money and dirty money.  It has now become acceptable to want accountability and transparency in major financial developments in this State, but only two years ago our leading journal seemed to be bitterly opposed to it. Things have changed.  Earlier today I tried to raise, by way of Priority Question, the issue of Mr. Carroll of Zoe Developments and the death of a worker on a building site in Dublin, but the Ceann Comhairle would not allow it.  Such a horrendous event sometimes does not seem to attract the requisite punishment in our current political system.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has had a consistent view on crime over the years.  We want to be tough on crime.  We have supported all the legislation.  I am pleased that at long last the Minister is bringing forward his Criminal Justice Bill.  At the same time we have to be tough on the causes of crime because, if we are not, this problem will go on year after year and people who live in the affected areas will continue to suffer.</P>
    <P>I refer to the rise in the rate of homicides.  I asked the Minister's predecessor about this and <Col N="1599" /> was not happy with the response I received as I felt the Garda and Department of Justice statisticians were to some extent massaging the figures to make it look as if the incredible rise in the number of murders over the past four or five years was something else.  The most disturbing aspect is the rise in the number of gangland killings and the fact that the conviction rate has been falling since the early 1990s.  Many people are disturbed by the rise in the number of young women who have been murdered in deplorable circumstances. I, and other Deputies, want the Minister to take decisive action in this area.</P>
    <P>I raised the Firearms Acts with the Taoiseach last week.  Will the Minister examine this matter? People are often astonished when they realise there are so many legally held guns in Ireland. Concerns have been raised at a number of Labour Party meetings in regard to the ease with which an individual can get his or her hands on a gun, particularly those with major psychological problems.</P>
    <P>I commend the element of the motion which calls for urgent early action on the report of the strategic management initiative on the Garda.  I support Fine Gael very much in that regard.  In general, the Garda has served us well over the years but resources at its disposal have often been poor.  I am always struck by the correlation between the number of gardaí in Dublin, approximately 4,000, and the high rate of crime, 60 to 70 per cent, in that region.  Has the Minister reflected on this since we spoke about it a number of years ago when he was in Opposition?  Why is the level of manpower not increased in more problematic areas?</P>
    <P>I commend the Garda and the outgoing Deputy Commissioner on Operation Dóchas and community policing.  It has worked extraordinarily well as the Garda has devoted itself to liaising closely with community groups, youth groups, football clubs, etc.  The big problem is manpower. When there is a crisis in a station, they are removed from such policing and assigned to the crisis of the day.  If there is an incident in Malahide, which is in my constituency, Coolock gardaí effectively disappear.  The efficiency and utilisation of the force needs to be examined.  For example, most of the crime in my area occurs between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m. Should the vast bulk of manpower be deployed at that time?  They probably should as the people of Dublin North-East could look after themselves between 3 a.m. and 5 p.m. Critical times, such as the early hours of darkness and closing time, need to be examined.</P>
    <P>I welcome the continuing improvements in Garda education and the role being played by the new air wing.  The new helicopter has made an impressive debut and contributed to cornering certain criminals who carried out vicious anti-social activities over recent weeks.  Although worries were expressed about it, the vast bulk of citizens find the presence of the Garda in the air <Col N="1600" /> as well as on the ground reassuring.  We want them on the streets and on motorbikes.  I was struck by the number of police in New York on motorbikes and horses.  Will the Minister look at this area?</P>
    <P>I welcome the extra resources for the prison service and pay tribute to the former Minister, Deputy Owen, in that regard.  We are a long way from the rehabilitative prison service required, as Deputy Shortall stated last week.  When I visit Mountjoy I am amazed at the overcrowding and other problems with which Governor Lonergan has to deal.  The prison is designed to cater for approximately 500 prisoners, yet between 5,000-6,000 prisoners pass through it each year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures being taken to improve the prison.  However, the benefits of the extra 80 places in the women's prison are overestimated as they will not improve conditions for the vast bulk of prisoners.  Everyone wants prisoners who have committed assaults and serious crimes to be seen to serve their sentence.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Shortall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this very important matter on the Adjournment for two reasons. First, as a result of the recent derailment of trains in counties Roscommon and Kerry people have become fearful about the train services provided by the State.  The common denominator in the accidents on the Dublin-Westport, Dublin-Killarney and Dublin-Sligo lines is that they occurred on the part of the track on old timber sleepers. The entire line should be made up of continuous welded track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason is the condition of the Dublin-Sligo line, specifically the Mullingar-Sligo section.  Earlier this year the Department of Public Enterprise announced that £12.5 million would be spent on the Dublin-Sligo rail line, with at least 50 per cent being expended on the Mullingar-Sligo section.  A commitment was also given that the passenger journey times on the Sligo-Dublin line would be reduced to two hours and 45 minutes by 1999.  Three weeks ago the general manager of the InterCity Passenger Service stated in a report in the <i>Sligo Champion</i> that Irish Rail did not have the resources to bring the Mullingar-Sligo section of the line up to standard and <Col N="1601" /> that the travel time targets would not be reached by 1999.</P>
    <P>The people of Sligo, Leitrim and Mullingar regard this as an amazing statement given the commitment that much money would be spent on improving the line between Mullingar and Sligo. People wonder why the money to upgrade the line mysteriously stopped at Mullingar.  The Minister for Public Enterprise represents Westmeath and perhaps the Pale has been extended from Kildare to Mullingar.  I hope a Minister has not tried to stop funding being allocated to the rest of the country for reasons of political expediency.</P>

Will she outline the action she proposes to take to supervise the spending of money on this stretch of the line to bring it up to the standard the people of these areas deserve?  Trains are often overcrowded at weekends.  There is an onus on the Minister to deal with this problem to ensure the people of Sligo, Leitrim and Longford have the service they deserve.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am operating on the basis of the Estimates negotiated by Deputy Dukes with the Department of Finance for the year 1997 and I do not accept Deputy Reynolds' accusation that I changed the way the money was to be spent. The budget for 1997 was negotiated by Deputy Dukes, who was a fine Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's statement that there is a clear comparison between the line at Knockcrockery <Col N="1602" /> and the Farranfore line is incorrect.  He said that in both cases there is a permanent track, but the line at Farranfore was relaid last year with a jointed track.  I accept the Deputy may not have known that and it is proper that I clarify it.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns of people who use railways further west from Athlone and Mullingar that that part of the rail system is not properly funded.  It is not correct to suggest EU funding is being used exclusively on the Dublin to Mullingar line.  I am delighted to have this opportunity to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>European funding for the second stage of infrastructure development on the rail network comes from the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund; the bulk of the funding on the Sligo line comes from the Cohesion Fund.  It is important to put this funding in context.  Prior to the negotiation of the current EU supported programme, financial constraints had led to significant under-investment. In 1993 the investment needs for the entire railway network were estimated at £800 million.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for transport recognised that railways required an integrated investment and development programme. Between 1994 and 1999 total investment in the mainline rail network will amount to £275 million. This investment will be focused on track renewal, signalling systems and rolling stock.  All major lines are included in the proposed investment programme.  The main part of the funding for the Dublin-Sligo line, for track and signalling upgrading work generally, comes from the Cohesion Fund.  The Dublin-Sligo line was successfully included as part of the trans-European network and in an EU co-financed investment programme £73 million was provided for the period 1996-9.  Of that amount £62 million has been allocated.  A sum of £14 million was allocated to the signalling system on four routes, including the Dublin-Sligo route.  This money is being used to replace the old mechanical system with a new, modern, cost effective and centralised control system.</P>
    <P>In regard to track work, investment has been concentrated on the Dublin to Mullingar section. The Deputy seems to think I have cast an evil eye on the matter and demanded that the money be provided for the Dublin to Mullingar section.  A stringent socio-economic cost benefit analysis must be undertaken before any investment proposals are approved by the EU.  That proposal was made by the previous Government.  In the case of the Dublin-Sligo line, independent consultants retained by the EU Commission recommended that EU co-financed investment should be undertaken on the Dublin-Mullingar section.</P>

I understand from the company that critical sections of the track between Mullingar and Sligo are to be improved.  There are fewer speed restrictions and the quality of service the company can provide has improved significantly.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned at the outset, it has already been acknowledged that £800 million investment is needed for the total network.  The 1994-99 programme of £275 million represents a tremendous start.  We must now look to the future.  I have asked CIE to prepare and prioritise investment plans for the mainline and suburban rail networks in the context of securing EU or other funding. The railways have served the country well over many years and through difficult times.  Like the previous Government, this Government is committed to continuing investment in the rail network.

      <P>The derailment of the Kerry-Dublin <Col N="1604" /> train this morning at Ballyhar, County Kerry, was the second of its kind in recent years.  This highlights the pressing need for immediate action on the state of our rail network.  It is the latest in a line of accidents that have occurred on the rail network in recent months, and it will not be the last unless recognition is given to the problems that exist and plans are put in place to address them.</P>
      <P>It is not a coincidence that this accident happened in the same week <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> led with a story &ldquo;Dangerous rail system on brink of disaster&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the contents of that article.  It highlighted that further accidents, which could lead to the deaths of many passengers, can be expected on the rail network.  This is a very worrying portent which, as shown again today, is likely to be realised if action is not taken by the Department.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the derailment of the Dublin-Westport train a number of weeks ago many people said we were fortunate no lives were lost. This has also been the case in the derailments which occurred in Ballyseedy, County Kerry, and at Glasnevin in Dublin where the train involved was carrying empty ammonia tankers.  We were all relieved the tankers were empty when the train derailed.</P>
      <P>The number and frequency of people travelling on our trains has increased in the past few years. This is borne out not only by statistics but by overcrowding on trains.  It is obvious that Iarnród Éireann is not able to cope with the number of passengers using its services, especially at weekends. Because of increasing pressures on its resources, many people are forced to stand in the isles or to sit in corridors between carriages. Iarnród Éireann deals with this unacceptable position by promising their customers a journey, but it cannot guarantee them seats.  This merely serves to exacerbate the problems already created by the dilapidated state of our rail network.</P>
      <P>The inability to cope with demands currently being put on CIE begs other questions: is its stock receiving the requisite care and attention? According to some, carriages and locomotives are being taken out of workshops before work is completed to deal with weekend demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is often said there are two rail systems in Ireland &mdash; the Dublin-Cork line and the rest of the country.  As someone who has travelled on both lines on many occasions, I know there is an element of truth in this anecdote.  As the aforementioned <i>Sunday Tribune</i> report notes, a twotier rail network has been created.  The lines from Dublin to Belfast, Cork, Limerick and halfway to Galway have continuous welded track while large sections of track on other lines are jointed.  The significance of this is highlighted by the fact that of the nine derailments in the past five years only one has occurred on welded track and that accident was due to a fault in the carriage.  The trains which operate on the rest of the country's lines seem to be travelling on a wing and a prayer and <Col N="1605" /> have led to what people call an accident waiting to happen.  It is imperative that the Government acts to ensure an accident does not happen.  It will be too late after someone has been seriously injured or even worse.</P>
    <P>An effective and efficient rail system is an integral part of our national, regional and local infrastructure.  While the significance of rail travel may have declined over the past number of decades, it still fulfils an important role in many aspects of contemporary Irish life.  Great numbers of the travelling public, including students, businessmen and businesswomen, shoppers and sports fans, avail of this service every week of the year.  Rail travel still remains the mode of transport for some of our industries.  In areas similar to County Kerry, where tourism is a big industry, the provision of a rail network is important.</P>
    <P>Responsibility rests with the Minister whom I know takes her work seriously.  I hope she comes before the House at an early date to ensure that steps are taken so that we do not have a more serious accident on the rail line.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Spring for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>I was a passenger on the 7.30 a.m. train from Tralee.  It was my first time travelling on this service for almost 18 months.  A major accident was avoided due to the efficiency and expertise of the driver, Mr. Billy Irwin, who brought the engine to a halt in seconds after a landslide.  I thank him sincerely for his actions.  I also compliment the checker, Mr. Jimmy Moloney, who helped the passengers suffering from shock, many of whom had appointments in Cork and Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also thank the guard, Mr. Ben O'Sullivan, who played a big part in quickly contacting Iarnród Éireann officials in Killarney.  As a result, a number of Iarnród Éireann workers were at the scene within minutes piping a drain at the side of the train.  It did not take them long to erect a road across the drain which enabled passengers to leave the train and board waiting buses which transported them to Killarney and on to Rathmore to connect with the Dublin Cork train. I congratulate and thank all the Iarnród Éireann workers who worked with such efficiency.  I also thank the catering staff on the train for providing meals free of charge to the passengers.</P>

      <P>Large scale flooding over the past few days must have contributed to this accident at Ballyhar, County Kerry.

      <P>The 7.30 a.m. passenger train from Tralee to Dublin was partially derailed this morning between Farranfore and Killarney on the Tralee to Mallow railway line.  I was in Farranfore and on that railway line last evening, there had been a very heavy rainfall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not getting up to mischief &mdash;as the Deputy said he was &mdash; and I do not cavil about it.  My Department was notified immediately about the accident.  The train comprised a modern 201 class locomotive and eight modern Mark III carriages.  The leading wheels of the locomotive derailed but all the carriages remained on the track.  There were 92 passengers on the train.  Following the accident, two passengers were taken to Tralee General Hospital but they have since been discharged.</P>
      <P>Indications suggest the accident was caused by a landslide which had partially blocked the track. The landslide occurred as a result of very heavy rain during the day and night before the accident, with 40 millimetres being recorded in the area. The track was undamaged.</P>
      <P>The line in question was relaid last year with jointed track and is considered by Iarnród Éireann to be in particularly good condition.  The rail carriages involved in the accident are the most up to date, apart from the enterprise trains.</P>
      <P>I concur with the need for vigilance as outlined by Deputy Spring.  It is interesting to look back on the incidence of rail accidents.  Thankfully we are second from the bottom in the European accident league table in not having fatalities.  The number of incidents during the past 12 months, long before I became responsible for this portfolio, has been disturbing.  I do not recall any great fuss being made of them here but there should have been given that there is now an accumulation of incidents.</P>
      <P>While safety is the day to day operational activity of Iarnród Éireann and of the CIE group of companies, it is of paramount importance.  If I have to continue to report on the safety of Iarnród Éireann something is gravely amiss.  To that end, the time is ripe for an external review of the company's rail safety policy and practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the recent rail accidents senior officials of my Department had already commenced preliminary work on such a review and they have had initial and detailed discussions with senior management of Iarnród Éireann.  I have now directed my Department to quickly prepare terms of reference for such a review.  We can learn from other countries.  Nobody can guarantee complete transport safety.  If one walks, travels by rail, car, air or sea one will, of necessity, encounter dangers. However, I am disturbed at the number of <Col N="1607" /> incidents which have taken place.  Certainly the incident at Knockcrockery, as I said to Deputy Naughten last week, could have been calamitous had it happened 100 yards further along the line. There are too many ifs in this whole scene for anyone to be content or happy about it.</P>
    <P>Deputies Spring, Foley, Healy-Rea and others have raised the matter with me and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue.  I believe the time is ripe for an external review of the company's rail safety policy.  The terms of reference will be drawn up within the next few weeks and I intend to make it public, as well as any incident that happens. One cannot guarantee there will not be another accident.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Farming must be treated as a business and no longer as a vocation with automatic transfer of land from father to son or daughter.  Financial margins are tighter.  A farmer almost needs to be an accountant to fill out application forms.  Farmers are being put under extreme pressure to make ends meet.  Young people are no longer becoming involved in the profession.</P>
      <P>One of the most serious issues on which the Minister has failed to act since his appointment is the suspension of installation aid for young farmers. Young people are given no encouragement to take up full-time employment in farming.  In 1996 the IDA grant aided 13,319 jobs at a cost of approximately £11,920 per job.  Yet the meagre grant of £5,600 to young farmers which was designed to encourage them to choose farming as a career option was cut.  How can the Minister for Agriculture and Food expect young people to choose a career in farming with its long hours, 365 days a year in all weathers, variable, unstable income and huge overheads over a stable and well paid Government supported industrial job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are reaching the stage where there will be shortages in the agricultural employment sector. This can be seen in rural areas where people are moving to towns and cities to take up well paid jobs leaving rural communities without their valuable young people to work the land.  A headline in one national newspaper last month read: &ldquo;Job Outlook Bright for Youth in Booming Economy&rdquo;. More young people are taking up third level courses, except for one &mdash; the certificate courses in farming in our agricultural colleges. <Col N="1608" /> For the first time in over ten years these colleges are unable to fill the places on offer because of the Minister's inability to display confidence in the industry and the young farmers through the provision of installation aid and proper support systems.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil stated in its election manifesto that in Government it would initiate a comprehensive programme of rural development.  Judging from the Minister's actions, it is a programme of rural destruction.  He will be remembered as the man who killed rural Ireland.  I ask him to deliver on his promise and that of Fianna Fáil candidates prior to the general election that installation aid would not be suspended.  Talk is cheap and the Minister now has an opportunity to deliver on the promise on which he reneged following the general election.  It would be a small step in bringing to an end discrimination against young farmers at the hands of previous Governments, but especially this one.  How can the Minister stand over a policy of funding one job to the tune of £11,920 and cutting grant aid for another?</P>
    <P>In 1995, 18 per cent of farmers were under 35 years of age, a drop of 2 per cent on the figure for 1993.  Teagasc needs to maintain better contact with its green certificate students following completion of the course; it must put a discount scheme in place. It is disgraceful that only £550 is available to a young person to draw up a REPS plan.  The enlargement clause in the farmer retirement scheme regulations inhibits young persons wishing to enter the agriculture industry.  Should a young person decide to go on to college the State will fund him or her to the tune of £10,000 to £12,000.  I appeal to the Minister to immediately reintroduce installation aid and bring forward a comprehensive package to support young farmers through grant aid, tax relief, the restructuring of the farmer retirement scheme and a proper subsidised service from Teagasc and other State agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. E. O'Keeffe):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this important matter this evening.</P>
      <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers was one of the sub-measures operated under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-99.  The programme had an indicative budget of £17 million for the scheme and was launched in December 1994 in which it was expected approximately 3,000 young farmers would participate. Due to the high level of demand the provisions of the scheme in respect of new applications was suspended with effect from 7 August 1997.</P>
      <P>By 7 November 1997 a total of 3,250 young farmers had been paid in excess of £18 million under the provisions of the scheme.  In addition, there are approximately 550 other applications at present being processed with a potential grant commitment of about £3.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> The Government is committed to supporting young farmers to set up in farming; a number of measures are already in operation to facilitate this objective.  Their needs are taken into account in the allocation of quota rights in the milk, suckler cow and sheep sectors and stamp duty relief for inheriting young farmers in addition to stock relief available for income tax purposes.</P>
    <P>The scheme of early retirement from farming has facilitated the early transfer of farms to young farmers.  At present 7,044 applications have been approved for payment of the pension since the scheme was announced, the average pension being £9,400 per annum.  Over 7,000 young farmers have been beneficiaries of the lands transferred as a consequence of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The farm retirement scheme contributed significantly to the general structural improvement of farms while simultaneously helping to maintain rural communities.  The scheme was approved for an initial five year period up to 1999 and we will be seeking to have it renewed for a further five years.  The annual financial contribution to the scheme by the national Exchequer and the European Union is now in excess of £60 million rising to over £75 million next year.</P>
    <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers has been another element of these supports, with £18 million having been paid to participating young farmers over the past three years.  All available funding for the scheme under the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry has been exhausted.  It was not possible to secure additional funding under the mid-term review of Structural Funds.  My Department is at present engaged in discussions with the Department of Finance on a full review of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter and I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, is here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised this issue over many years by way of parliamentary questions and Adjournment Debates in an effort to underline its importance. The provision of a new fire station at Dowra in north-west Cavan has been of considerable concern for years.  In January 1993 the then Minister for the Environment approved the provision of a new fire station.  Cavan County Council was requested to prepare and submit working drawings, plans and a bill of quantities.  In March 1994 Cavan County Council submitted the contract documents to the Department of the Environment. It is obvious that very little progress has been made in the meantime as those contract documents have not been approved, nor has the council been given permission to invite tenders for this much needed project.  That has been the information conveyed to me for some time past, again outlined by the Minister for the Environment <Col N="1610" /> and Local Government in a recent letter to me.</P>
    <P>Dowra is located in north-west Cavan and, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows well, is an area of beautiful but difficult terrain dominated by the Cuilcagh mountain range.  The nearest fire station in County Cavan is located at Ballyconnell, 22 miles away, the nearest in adjoining counties being at Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, almost 20 miles away and Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, 11 miles away.  In difficult weather conditions it would take a fire tender well in excess of one hour to travel from Ballyconnell to Dowra crossing the Cuilcagh Mountains.</P>
    <P>A huge afforestation programme has been taking place in that part of north-west Cavan over many years with the constant attendant threat of a major outbreak of fire adjacent to a populated area.  In 1995 there was a serious fire in a forest near the village of Dowra demonstrating to the local community in no uncertain terms the absolute need for an adequate and proper fire station and appropriate appliances in their village.  Large tracts of forestry have also been planted very close to isolated rural homes.  There is an aging population in this area.  Unfortunately, fires have taken lives and property all too often, particularly in the case of elderly people living on their own.</P>
    <P>The national primary route, the N16, an important north-west route, runs through part of this area.  Since the end of August 1994 there has been a remarkable and welcome increase in traffic on that route.  In the event of accidents or other emergencies adequate local fire services should be available to deal with them.  The existing fire station at Dowra, which is totally inadequate and antiquated, covers a large catchment area, comprising the Dowra, Glangevlin and Blacklion areas.  Situated near Blacklion is Loughan House with a large number of inmates. Such institutions may need to avail of those emergency services from time to time.  Adequate emergency services should be available in all regions. I believe that the factors I have outlined, which give a profile of the area, demonstrate clearly that the case for a new fire station at Dowra is most pressing and this new facility should be provided with the utmost speed.</P>
    <P>At a Cavan County Council meeting last September, Mr. Eddie Feeley, the councillor for that area, specifically raised this issue with Minister Dempsey.  He appealed to the Minister to advance this project and to have construction of the new fire station commenced in 1998.  He raised this issue again at yesterday's meeting of Cavan County Council and I wholeheartedly support his efforts.</P>
    <P>A new fire station would be a tremendous asset to an area where there has been very little State investment to date.  I appeal to the Minister of State to give my renewed representations favourable and urgent consideration.  I hope that the necessary tendering process can be set in motion immediately and that this facility can be provided without further delay.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for raising this matter this evening.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is unable to be present in the House this evening to reply to this debate and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The need for a new fire station in Dowra is accepted by the Department.  Approval in principle for the project issued to Cavan County Council in January 1993.  Subsequently, in March 1994, the council submitted contract documents for a new station.  The next step is approval for the council to proceed to the next stage in the development of this project, that is, the invitation of tenders for the construction of the fire station.</P>
      <P>The question of allowing the project to proceed to tender stage is currently under consideration in the Department.  Having regard to the funding available for the fire services capital programme and the competing demands for these funds, I am not in a position tonight to say when approval may issue to the council.</P>
      <P>Cavan County Council currently has four separate proposals before the Department for new fire stations at Bailieborough, Dowra, Virginia and Cootehill and all these proposals are under consideration in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the early 1980s, successive Governments showed a strong commitment to capital investment in the fire service.  Capital investment in the <Col N="1612" /> period 1981-97, inclusive, amounts to almost £90 million and this has resulted in major improvements on a comprehensive basis, such as the provision of new and refurbished fire stations, the purchase of modern fire appliances and equipment, improved training facilities and better mobilisation and communications systems.  The improvements are widespread and there for all to see.</P>
    <P>Cavan County Council has benefited also from this significant investment receiving approximately £2.5 million for capital investment over that period.  In 1987, a new headquarters station was completed in Cavan town.  New stations were also provided in Killeshandra and Ballyconnell.</P>
    <P>I understand the existing station in Dowra is of the Nissan hut variety and is very unsatisfactory. The case for replacing it with a modern fire station is fully accepted and this will be grant aided as soon as resources allow.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for the National Safety Council, which includes responsibility for fire safety, I thank the Deputy for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.  I assure him that careful consideration will be given to the needs of the Dowra area in regard to the provision of a fire station there when the 1998 fire services programme is being determined shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 November 1997.</P>

      <P>My Department through the rural environment protection scheme has a major role to play in the promotion of nutrient management planning.  The REP scheme aims to establish farming practices and controlled production methods which reflect the increasing concern for the environment.  One of its more important measures is the requirement to prepare a waste management, liming and fertilisation plan for the farm.  This measure is designed to protect and improve the quality of our water resources by minimising nutrient losses from agriculture.</P>
      <P>A code of good practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates was published jointly in July 1996 by my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  This code prescribes methods to prevent or minimise the pollution of waters from nitrates by adopting certain farm waste and nutrient management techniques in the storage of organic wastes, silage, dungstead and farmyard manure and soiled water.</P>
      <P>I welcome and support the current campaign by IFA and other bodies to promote nutrient management planning on farms.  I am happy that Teagasc was able to assist in drawing up a promotion leaflet on the subject.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of new outbreaks of brucellosis in <Col N="1614" /> herds up to 1 November 1997 was 681.  However the number of herds restricted for brucellosis under EU legislation at that date was 323.</P>
    <P>In relation to the current brucellosis situation following consultations with the bodies represented on the Animal Health Forum I recently introduced a number of measures to deal with the matter including the establishment of milk ring testing (MRT) on a monthly basis as opposed to the previous arrangement whereby four tests were carried out at six weekly intervals in the period April to September; an awareness/education programme directed specifically at farmers which will focus principally on promoting effective herd management and health protection practices including prudent buying-in from reliable sources &mdash; in this regard an advice pack outlining the essential measures required to protect their herds was sent to each herdowner in September; detailed epidemiological investigations by my Department's veterinary inspectors into brucellosis breakdowns; a major revamping of the compensation regime aimed at encouraging farmers to purchase eligible cattle from reliable sources, confine purchases to cattle which have passed brucellosis, blood tests within the previous 60 days in the herds from which they are bought and test such cattle again within 30 days of purchase.</P>
    <P>Detailed information on the foregoing has been sent to each herdowner by post.</P>
    <P>In view of the continuing deterioration, I am satisfied that further measures are now required to combat the disease.  I will be meeting farming and veterinary interests on Thursday next in the Animal Health Forum.  Following this, I will decide on any further measures to be introduced.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 36 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already announced, I am setting up four consultative groups, one each for beef, milk, cereals and rural development in order to ensure that a wide range of expertise will be available to me during the negotiations on the Agenda 2000 proposals.  The group on milk has been already established and the composition of the groups on beef and cereals and their terms of reference will be finalised very soon.  The intention is that the groups will include farmers, processors and others involved in the relevant sectors, including officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>A group representative of the dairy sector has been considering broad policy options for the future development of the sector since February 1996.  This group will now act as the consultative group on Agenda 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been increasing trade in agricultural produce between the EU and the ten central and eastern European countries (CEECs).  I propose to distribute two tables which set out the position in relation to such trade for 1994, 1995 and 1996 between the EU and the CEECs, and between Ireland and the CEECs over the same period.</P>
      <P>While imports of agricultural produce to the EU have grown by 21 per cent between 1994 and 1996, exports of identical produce have increased by 39 per cent over the same period.  Furthermore, the balance of trade between both (i.e. exports over imports) has increased from + 24.1 per cent in 1994 to + 42.2 per cent in 1996 in favour of the EU.</P>
      <P>In relation to trade in agri-food produce between Ireland and the CEECs, the position is that the balance of agri-food trade is heavily in favour of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Given the positive elements of current trading between Ireland, and the EU as a whole, and the CEECs, I am happy that Irish producers are benefiting rather than losing under present trading arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to supporting young farmers to set up in farming and a number of measures are in operation which facilitate this objective.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers has been another element of these supports and over the last three years over £18 million has been paid out to participating young farmers.  All available funding for the scheme in the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry has been exhausted and it was not possible to secure additional funding in the mid-term review of the Structural Funds.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the BSE related difficulties erupted over 20 months ago the cattle and beef industry has come through a very difficult period. However, due to a strong emphasis on secure controls, our major international export outlets have remained open, with the result that Irish beef exports to third countries are now substantially higher than in 1995.  In addition, our exporters are regaining market share on EU beef markets as consumption and market prices continue to recover to previous levels.  The availability of fairly flexible intervention arrangements, which have resulted in the removal of approximately 53,000 tonnes of beef from the market so far in 1997, has also helped to underpin market prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Irish cattle prices have fallen below those prevailing before the BSE crisis, the loss in farm income arising from the lower prices have been substantially offset by the payment of approximately £100 million in additional premiums to Irish producers under the two BSE compensation packages which were adopted by the European Union last year.  Furthermore, the impact of the revaluation of the Irish Green <Col N="1619" /> Pound on producers' incomes has been substantially mitigated by the various EU and nationally funded compensatory packages amounting to some £48 million, which were agreed earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties arising from BSE, cattle prices have remained above the cost of production.  In any event, cattle prices must be viewed in the context of the direct payments system which is designed to compensate producers for lower prices.  The Santer proposals are a continuation of this policy.  As far as these proposals are concerned, I will be seeking to ensure that producers are fully compensated for reductions in institutional prices while at the same time allowing the beef industry to exploit all possible markets develop to their full potential.  It is also my policy to ensure that the highest possible animal and public health standards apply in order that consumer confidence recovers to the maximum extent.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 29, 43 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Reported mart and factory prices show that average prices for hill lambs to date this year were significantly higher than in previous years. These higher prices substantially offset the reduction in the ewe premium for 1997.  When account is taken of the payment of the rural world premium and headage grants in the disadvantaged areas, the total return on hill lambs is equivalent to that available to producers of lowland lambs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the extensification premium is concerned, the European Commission has rejected requests for the introduction of this premium in the sheepmeat sector.  However, I will continue <Col N="1620" /> to press this issue with the Commission at every possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 30, 48, 54 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>With the Taoiseach, I met with the Western Development Commission on 14 October last.</P>
      <P>The meeting discussed the overall brief of the Western Development Commission which is to promote the development of the west by working with the State agencies and development organisations currently operating in the region.</P>
      <P>The rationale behind the recent strategic changes in departmental functions and in particular the addition of the western development function, which was formerly in the Department of the Taoiseach, to the rural development portfolio in my Department, was clarified.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to that meeting, I met with the chairman and chief executive officer of the commission to discuss in more detail their strategy for implementing its terms of reference and the progress made to date.  A number of strategic projects for the development of the region, which have been identified by the Western Development Commission as requiring priority attention were outlined.  I am contacting the relevant Ministers on these matters.  In addition, I have also arranged to meet with those Ministers who have constituencies in the western region to discuss how best the work of the Western Development Commission can be assisted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to meet these Ministers on a regular basis to discuss issues arising from the work of the commission.  I believe that the experience of this broad-based group of Ministers with constituency knowledge of the region will provide an <Col N="1621" /> additional political focus and support for the commission.</P>
    <P>I will be meeting again with the full board of the Western Development Commission in early December and I propose keeping in regular contact with them.</P>
    <P>I believe that my role as the responsible Minister for the Western and Rural Development portfolios combined with the additional expertise of individual Ministers and the personal commitment of the Taoiseach to its work, will provide the Western Development Commission with the necessary support to enable it to realise its primary objective which is the regeneration of the western region.</P>

      <P>A proposal to simplify the existing directive on cocoa and chocolate products for the purpose of facilitating completion of the internal market is being dealt with under the co-decision procedure with the European Parliament.  The present position is that the European Parliament has recently proposed a number of amendments to the text of the draft Council amending directive. A preliminary examination of the proposed amendments indicate that, while the suggested changes are unlikely to adversely affect employment in the Irish chocolate industry, some of them would not be in its overall best interests. However, I can assure the Deputy that those interests will be vigorously defended in the continuing negotiations on this directive. <Col N="1622" /></P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 34, 61 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The number of payments made to farmers by my Department to date in 1997 under the various headage and premium schemes is over 1.2 million and involves a sum of £630 million.  Under 1997 schemes alone some £378 million has been paid to farmers this year.  Different payment target dates apply for the various schemes under the Charter of Rights for Farmers.  Under the disadvantaged areas headage schemes the target is to make full payment in the year of application and to make payment in all eligible cases by 31 October.  Under the suckler cow premium scheme the target is to commence advance payments on 1 November and, where the retention period is completed by 30 November, to make all eligible advance payments by 31 December.  Under the special beef premium scheme the target is to commence advance payments on 1 November and, where the retention period is completed by 1 November, to make all eligible advance payments by 31 December.  Under the arable aid scheme the target is to commence payments on 16 October and to have all eligible applicants paid by 31 October.</P>
      <P>Apart from payments under the disadvantaged areas headage scheme my Department is on target to meet the payment deadlines set down in the Charter of Rights for Farmers.  Indeed, under the EU arable aid scheme, the target has been significantly surpassed.</P>
      <P>As regards the headage scheme payments, over 40 per cent of applicants were paid their grants by 31 October 1997, a position comparable to that achieved in 1996.  To date some 60 per cent of headage scheme applicants have been paid a total of £67.6 million under the 1997 schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" /> A special effort was made this year to ensure early payment of arable aid given the difficult harvest situation experienced by many farmers. The delivery of the commitment on this is evidenced by the fact that 94 per cent of arable aid applicants were paid £85 million by 23 October; about 12 per cent of 1996 arable aid applicants had been paid by 23 October 1996.  Now 99 per cent of 1997 arable aid applicants have been paid compared with 67 per cent of 1996 applicants paid at 18 November 1996.</P>
    <P>The prioritising of arable aid payments has had some impact on the delivery of payments under the 1997 disadvantaged areas headage schemes. At the same time considerable progress continues to be made on making livestock payments across all schemes including headage.  My Department is committed to clearing the maximum number of area aid applications by the end of this month so that payments can continue to be made under the various schemes during the next two to three weeks.</P>

      <P>A submission to establish a new category of extremely disadvantaged areas in Ireland was formally presented to the EU Commission on 9 October, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to the submission, the Commission raised the issues of conservation and overgrazing <Col N="1624" /> in connection with the REPS and special areas of conservation.  They are concerned to ensure that proposals affecting the extent and classification of land in the disadvantaged areas do not have an adverse affect on areas which are being targeted by the REPS and SACs as requiring special attention.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the Commission has made it clear that discussions relating to overgrazing and conservation must be concluded before proposals affecting disadvantaged areas can be finalised.  I am endeavouring to bring the question of overgrazing and conservation to as speedy a conclusion as possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the expressions of concern to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>There is not, in fact, any new EC Directive in relation to the use of unpasteurised milk in the manufacture of farmhouse cheese.  The standards to which raw-milk farmhouse cheese must conform are, by and large, set out in Directive 92/46/EEC which was transposed into Irish law by S.I. No. 9 of 1996.</P>

This was completed two weeks ago and a detailed proposal drawn up by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Livestock Exporters Association is now being forwarded to the Egyptian authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 62, 75, 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in the House on 7 October, I am aware of the very valuable work which the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals carries out in relation to the welfare of animals generally in the Dublin area.  The society is of course a voluntary organisation and any assistance which my Department may provide from time to time, supplements the funding which the society raises from other sources.  Grants totalling £100,000 have already been made to the society by my Department since September 1995 to assist its operations.  I will consider providing further financial assistance to the society this year if available resources permit.</P>
      <P>The society's operations do, of course, encompass cruelty involving horses.  My Department maintains contact with the society and many of its concerns and those of other bodies in relation to cruelty involving horses and problems caused by wandering horses were taken into account in the context of framing the Control of Horses Act, 1996.  Implementation of this Act is primarily for the local authorities, who have been given wide powers to designate control areas, as well as powers of detention, seizure, etc., with effect from 18 March 1997, when the Act was brought into operation.</P>
      <P>A provision was included in my Department's Estimates for 1997 to enable grants to be paid to local authorities to assist in implementing the Act.  My Department is currently examining applications for grants totalling some £900,000 from eight local authorities.  In one instance, grant assistance has already been cleared for payment and I anticipate that payments will be made in other cases also, once aspects of the applications have been satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards urban horse projects, my Department is willing to provide financial assistance to local authorities to enable them to support worthwhile individual projects, within the context of implementation by such local authorities of the <Col N="1629" /> Control of Horses Act, 1996.  I am aware that the Cherry Orchard project, which I consider to be very worthwhile is being supported by Dublin Corporation and, on the basis which I have just mentioned, my Department is prepared to grant assistance to the corporation in supporting this particular project and has so informed those concerned. No funding has yet been advanced but a claim from Dublin Corporation, which includes an element of support for the project, is currently being processed by my Department and I expect that payment will be cleared very shortly.</P>
    <P>A provision of £2.75 million has been included in the 1998 Estimates for the Department in connection with implementation of this Control of Horses Act, 1996.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problem referred to by the Deputy, however the scheme of early retirement from farming has proved very successful in assisting young farmers to take over holdings held by farmers of 55 and 66 years of age.  Over 7,000 younger farmers have benefited from the scheme to date and it is my intention to have the scheme continued in future years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the early retirement scheme from farming.  It is a requirement of Council Regulation 2079/92 under which the scheme of early retirement from farming is implemented that in each of the ten years prior to the date of the final transfer of all eligible land the applicant must have obtained at least 50 per cent of his/her income from, and spent 50 per cent of time on farming or a combination of farming, forestry, on-farm tourism and crafts.  In such cases farming must account for at least 25 per cent of the total income.</P>
      <P>Currently over 7,000 farmers have availed of the scheme, which is well ahead of the anticipated target at this stage.  It is clear that the full-time farming requirement has not had any significant impact on the uptake of the scheme.  However when the current scheme is being reviewed it is my intention that this matter will be raised with the European Commission.</P>

      <P>An examination of classification figures from 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 shows a drop in the percentage of better conformed, class &ldquo;U&rdquo; carcases and a corresponding increase in the poorer conformed &ldquo;O&rdquo; and &ldquo;P&rdquo; classes.  There has also been an increase in the percentage of animals in the upper fat classes, namely &ldquo;4H&rdquo; and &ldquo;5&rdquo; and a corresponding drop in the lower fat classes &ldquo;3&rdquo; and &ldquo;4L&rdquo;.  These developments are due in part to the decline in live exports and the pricing policy operated at meat plants.  My Department is in discussion with the industry on how best to improve overall quality of cattle.  The recently established Irish Cattle Breeding Federation will also focus on this issue.</P>

      <P>Motor vehicles and mobile equipment are excluded for funding under the Leader programme on the basis that such investments (a) are not normally eligible for aid under publicly funded schemes, (b) have multi-purpose uses which may not be related to the project being <Col N="1631" /> aided and (c) are easily disposed of outside of the project and the area in which aid may be offered.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I do not propose to amend the rules under which Leader groups operate to allow motor vehicles or mobile equipment to be grant aided.  As holiday caravans are considered to be mobile equipment they are ineligible for aid under Leader.  However, specialised machinery linked to a wider development project may qualify for aid and my Department is prepared to examine requests for funding from Leader groups on a case by case basis.</P>

      <P>Submissions have been received from a number of organisations and individuals on the issue of genetic engineering and I am aware, therefore, that there are diverging views on this matter.  As indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 130 on 4 November 1997, the regulation of the use of genetically modified organisms is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency.  Apart from the growing of a very small acreage of genetically modified sugar beet, which was licensed on an experimental basis, there have been no other instances where such products have been approved for use in Irish farming. While genetically modified organisms have been applied extensively in the production of food and food ingredients in some countries, their use is still the subject of ongoing research.  Pending the outcome of this, it would be premature to take a decision on their long-term use in agriculture in Ireland.  My overriding concern in this matter would be to ensure that developments in this area <Col N="1632" /> would not have adverse effects on human health, animal health or on the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The general aim of the sub-programme is to maximise the food industry's contribution to national wealth and employment.  With that in mind, it seeks to exploit the growth opportunities in the basic foodstuffs, consumer foods and food ingredients areas.  While the prescribed targets are ambitious ones, I am happy that satisfactory progress is being made towards their achievement. In the case of employment, it is estimated that, in the period 1994 to 1996, some 7,500 gross jobs were created as against an annual average target of 2,000.  At £4.7 billion, the value of overall exports in 1996 remained close to the previous year's level.  This apparent lack of progress reflects the decline in beef exports due to BSE problems and masks very substantial increases in the prepared consumer foods and ingredients sectors. The export trends to date in 1997 are encouraging and I am satisfied that significant progress will be made this year towards the attainment of the 1999 targeted figure of £7 billion.</P>
      <P>The food sub-programme was subject to a comprehensive appraisal as part of the recent mid-term review of structural funds.  That appraisal was based largely on an independent evaluation which confirmed the progress being made towards the attainment of the overall objectives. The relevant decisions taken on foot of the mid-term review process had, of course, also to take account of the priorities identified in the assessment undertaken on the general community support framework.  While the main effect of those decisions was the transfer of some £25.5 million in public funds from the capital investment element of the sub-programme, these moneys are being allocated to areas which will benefit the food industry either directly or indirectly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>At the end of October, 65 cases of BSE have been confirmed this year in herds in Ireland.  This resulted in the slaughter and destruction of 7,160 cattle in accordance with my Department's policy of depopulating herds in which a case of BSE has occurred.  During the examination of the brains which takes place as a matter of course in the case of adult cattle from depopulated herds and other animals slaughtered under the BSE policy, a further three brains out of 4,453 brains examined in respect of 1997 depopulations, have been found to be positive for BSE.  Almost £8.7 million has been spent to date in 1997 on BSE controls (other than staff costs) of which £6.8 million has been spent on compensation for herd depopulation. The remaining amount has been spent on the purchase of the cohorts and progeny of the positive animals, compensation for animals which have proved to be negative for the disease, the purchase of UK imports, and slaughtering, rendering and storage costs related to the disposal of the depopulated herds and other cattle.</P>
      <P>Stringent controls are in place in Ireland to ensure the safety of Irish beef which go beyond those recommended by the relevant international organisations.  In particular, there has been a requirement since February 1997 to have specified risk material removed from carcases after slaughter and disposed of under strict criteria.  I am confident that these controls remove any risk to the consumer as far as Irish beef is concerned.</P>

      <P>Within the European Economic Area (EEA-15 EU member states, Norway and Iceland), licensed EEA airlines are free to operate on any international route without Government or EU control.  Since 1 April 1997 such carriers are also free to provide internal air services within another EEA state (cabotage), subject to certain limited exceptions.  The question as to whether an airline wishes to exercise its right to operate on any particular route is, however, entirely a matter for the airline to decide on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> The regional airports are owned and operated by private undertakings and as such the development plans, traffic potential and viability of these airports are primarily matters for the individual airport companies.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that in order to improve access to the regions from abroad through the network of air services operating to and from Dublin, my Department has introduced a scheme of Exchequer subvented air services as provided for under EU Council Regulation 2408/92.  This programme, which commenced in January 1995, applies to services between four regional airports &mdash; Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Donegal &mdash; and Dublin, and is designed to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions.  The Government recently decided to extend the scheme in relation to Kerry, Galway and Sligo for a further three years when the existing contracts expire in January 1998.  The contract in relation to Donegal has a further two years to run.</P>
    <P>I would also advise the Deputy that, in order to assist the regional airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports, marketing grants were paid by my Department to the six regional airports during 1993 and 1995.  Furthermore, in 1996 the Government approved a strictly time limited scheme of Exchequer grants totalling £2.35 million over the four years 1996 to 1999 for the six regional airports to assist the airport companies in marketing and promoting their airports.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope to be in a position shortly to respond to requests from a number of regional airports for Exchequer capital grants to assist towards the cost of certain infrastructural improvements at the airports.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 130 on 4 November 1997, the use of genetically modified organisms in Ireland is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Apart from the growing of a very small acreage of genetically modified sugar beet, which was licensed on an experimental basis, there have been no other instances where such products have been approved for use in Irish farming.</P>
      <P>While genetically modified organisms have been applied extensively in the production of food and food ingredients in some countries, their use is still the subject of ongoing research.  Pending the outcome of this, it would be premature to anticipate the likely developments in this area in Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>My overriding concern in this matter would be to ensure that developments in this area would not have adverse effects on human health, animal health or the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the integrated administration and control system introduced by the EU in the context of the various CAP compensation payments, each member state is required from 1 January 1997 to have in place a computerised land parcel identification system (LPIS).  The LPIS requires what is effectively a 100 per cent computerised check on all land parcels submitted by farmers on the area aid declarations.  This ensures that farmers are not overclaiming on individual parcels of land or that two or more farmers are not claiming on the same land parcel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the area aid scheme for 1997 close to 135,000 applications were received in my Department. Some 50,000 were returned with changes from 1996 which required digitising on the LPIS <Col N="1645" /> database.  In addition several more thousand involved various errors and omissions.  A very significant level of processing has already been completed by my Department.  Every effort is being made to clear the maximum number of outstanding area aid applications by the end of this month so that payments can be completed in most cases within two to three weeks.</P>

      <P>A formal commitment to have compensatory headage payments independently evaluated was entered into by my Department as part of negotiations in 1994 with the European Commission on the Structural Funds leading up to the approval of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry (OPARDF).  The Commission's attitude was that the funds allocated to the measures represented too high a percentage (62 per cent) of the overall allocation to the structural improvement and rural development element of the operational programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants who carried out the evaluation came up with a number of broad recommendations, and following consideration of their report certain proposals were put to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the headage schemes, including the implementation of a £3,024 limit to individual farmers.  As part of Partnership 2000, it was provided that the proposals would come into effect from January 1998 and that the proposal to impose a ceiling on individual headage payments would also come into effect on that date unless the farming bodies could come up with an equitable alternative early in 1997 which could produce similar savings.  No such proposals have emerged and the formal negotiation process is now under way with the Commission. <Col N="1648" /></P>

      <P>In the ongoing discussions on the outline proposals set out in the Santer package on Agenda 2000, I have expressed support for increased flexibility in the operation of the milk quota system which would allow the EU to exploit the expected expansion in world dairy markets.  An A and B quota system is one such possibility.  Detailed Commission proposals for reform of the sector are not expected until early next year.</P>

    <P>I have asked a consultative group, consisting of representatives from all sectors of the dairy industry as well as from the academic world to consider in the context of Agenda 2000, the best options for the future of the Irish dairy sector. This group will examine, among other things, the future of the quota regime, including any changes to its operation which might be desirable from Ireland's point of view.  I have no doubt that the group will come up with useful ideas which will benefit Irish producers, including small scale producers and that these views will prove very useful <Col N="1652" /> to me when more detailed negotiations get under way.</P>

      <P>The establishment of the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) was planned on the basis that it would be an industry-led and largely industry funded co-operative organisation with a commitment from my Department to support it in its formative years.  This support is to be provided by way of grant assistance and through the provision of staff-facilities.  My Department's contribution is related to the contributions being made by the other stakeholders.</P>
      <P>On the above basis, my Department's estimated financial contribution for 1997 is approximately £200,000 based on a full year of operations. However, the ICBF was not formed until June 1997 and is not yet fully operational.  In view of this, expenditure has been slow and, as an interim arrangement, each organisation has agreed to provide 25 per cent of its committed amount to meet the revised estimated costs in 1997.  Hence my Department will be contributing £50,000 this year.  The type and size of contribution to be made by my Department in 1998 will be decided when the ICBF has finalised its plans for that year and the contributions of all the stakeholders have been agreed.</P>

      <P>Under the Abattoirs Act, 1988, statutory responsibility for the supervision of day-to-day operations at domestic abattoirs, including ante and post-mortem examination of meat, rests with the relevant local authority.  However, in December 1996, as a result of the unsatisfactory situation which had existed for some time in this regard, Government approval was secured for payment by my Department of financial assistance to local authorities in order to assist them in urgently rectifying this situation.  My understanding is that all of the local authorities have arranged for veterinary inspections of abattoirs.</P>

    <P>Of the 31 local authorities which have domestic abattoirs located within their functional areas, 19 have fully established their entitlement to the <Col N="1653" /> appropriate financial assistance on the basis that they are providing a full inspection service and performing their functions and payment has been, or is in the process of being made in such cases.

      <P>Monitoring carried out by my Department indicates that there has been a significant reduction in the use of clenbuterol, also known as angel dust, in the past few years.  In 1993, for example, 3.77 per cent of samples tested were positive for clenbuterol.  This level has declined each year since and in the first nine months of 1997 no samples analysed were found to be positive for clenbuterol.</P>
      <P>During the past year there have been 48 prosecutions for offences relating to the use of clenbuterol at earlier dates.  In 47 cases convictions were secured.  The courts have imposed fines in excess of £150,000.  Terms of imprisonment were imposed on 17 individuals, five of these terms were suspended.  A number of these sentences are under appeal.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that significant progress has been achieved, there can, of course, be no room for complacency in regard to this area.  My Department will continue to monitor the ongoing situation and where any abuses are detected, I am determined that the full rigours of the law will continue to be applied in the interests of consumer safety and the good name of the Irish food industry.</P>

Both concerns referred to in the question are registered separately in the register of milk purchasers maintained <Col N="1655" /> by my Department under regulation 17 of the European Communities Milk Quota Regulations, 1995 (S.I.

      <P>As there is no provision in the regulations for the transfer of unused quota between two separate milk purchasers, the co-operative mentioned, which incurred the super-levy liability, must, therefore, discharge it in full together with accrued interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 146 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>Irish beef is exported to over 60 markets worldwide. The level of our exports was adversely affected as a result of the fall-off in demand following the BSE crisis.  Due to the extremely low incidence of BSE in Ireland and the effectiveness of our controls it was possible, however, to provide the assurances to allow trade continue to most of our international markets.  The removal of any BSE related trade restrictions is, of course, a matter to which I accord utmost priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in direct contact at ministerial level with the more important markets.  I succeeded in concluding a protocol with the Russian authorities providing for the first easing of the restrictions imposed by Russia in November 1996 and I am hopeful that the process of lifting county restrictions will continue when the agreement with Russia comes up for review in January 1998. Qatar recently lifted its ban on Irish beef which means that all our markets in the Gulf are now reopened with the exception of Oman.  Following the visit of a technical delegation from my Department to that market, I would hope that it will also follow suit.  I recently visited Hungary and succeeded in having the ban on exports of beef to that market removed.  Contact with Iran has been renewed with a view to arranging a meeting at veterinary level to discuss the lifting <Col N="1656" /> of its prohibition.  Considerable progress has, therefore, been made in removing trade restrictions and no effort will be spared until remaining barriers are removed.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the balance in the beef market in the European Union has improved resulting from a combination of a recovery in beef consumption and a decline in beef production. The improved market creates opportunities within the EU and will relieve pressure on third country markets.  I will continue to seek that EU policy decisions establish the framework to allow the market develop and, in individual markets, will avail of all appropriate opportunities to emphasise the safety and quality of Irish beef.  It is, of course, a matter for the industry, supported by the promotional efforts of An Bord Bia to capitalise on the markets now reemerging.</P>

      <P>The position is that, in common with most agricultural services, veterinary services are taxed in Ireland at the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the reference to a tax clearance certificate is to a certificate of authorisation (C2) which is issued to subcontractors in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>To receive payment without deduction of tax for performance of construction operations, the subcontractor must produce the C2 and complete a joint application with the principal contractor for a relevant payments card (C47).  On receipt of the relevant payments card from the inspector of taxes, the principal contractor is allowed to make the payment without deduction of tax.</P>
      <P>The requirement to produce the original C2 has been recognised from Revenue experience as an essential security feature of the system.  It also protects the C2 holder from misuse of his C2 and resultant problems which might lead to its withdrawal. Where necessary, Revenue issues more than one C2 to a subcontractor so that the C2 can be produced by nominated employees to ease the burden on the subcontractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have pointed out that the supply of materials to the construction industry is not a construction operation for the purposes of the scheme.  Accordingly, a C2 is not required to be produced in order to receive payment <Col N="1659" /> without deduction of tax for the supply of materials.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any promises made by the Government in this regard.</P>
      <P>The position regarding VAT rates is governed by European VAT law with which Irish law must comply.  Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates.  As hurleys were not zero rated at that time, it is not now open to the Government to apply such a rate. Indeed, the introduction of new zero rates has been prohibited for some time.</P>
      <P>As regards a reduced rate, goods and services to which reduced rating may apply are listed in annex H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive.  In addition, items not on this list, but which were at a reduced rate on 1 January 1991, may, if a member state so decides, be placed at a &ldquo;parking rate&rdquo;, i.e., a rate not less than 12 per cent, for the duration of the transitional regime.  As hurleys are not listed in the directive, nor were they at a reduced rate on 1 January 1991, the standard rate, currently 21 per cent, must be applied.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that as far as possible, income from all sources, including benefits-in-kind &mdash;BIK &mdash; should be subject to taxation. Public transport tickets and passes are chargeable to tax under the general tax legislation dealing with BIK.  There are no grounds in terms of BIK legislation for an exemption.  To exempt one form of benefit, such as travel passes, from the scope of the BIK provisions would only lead to demands for other benefits to be similarly treated.  Furthermore, in the case of PAYE deductions, the statutory provisions and case law specifically exclude a deduction in respect of the cost of travelling to and from work.  To exempt public transport passes to employees would seriously undermine this principle.  This would lead to a substitution of untaxed benefits-in-kind for taxed cash remuneration.</P>

The benefits and problems of a carbon tax would obviously depend on the rates of tax, the coverage and whether such a measure was introduced in the EU alone, by Ireland unilaterally or more widely among developed states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the EU energy tax, which was presented in March 1997, discussions are ongoing <Col N="1662" /> by technical experts reporting to the ECOFIN Council.  My particular concern, as Minister for Finance, will be to ensure that any measure which is advanced to promote energy saving does not adversely affect Ireland's international competitiveness. I am, of course, concerned also about the effect the imposition of any such tax would have on the consumer price index and how the tax would impact on the less well off members of the community.</P>
    <P>It is also appropriate to emphasise that Ireland has relatively high taxes on energy use at present, particularly those that relate to motoring, including value-added tax and vehicle registration tax.</P>

Food poisoning &mdash; bacterial other than salmonella &mdash; is included on the list of specified diseases and E. coli 0157 comes within this category.</P>
      <P>My Department has recognised the potentially serious implications of the E. coli infection and has taken steps to increase awareness of it.  A report on the matter by the Food Safety Advisory Committee was circulated to all health boards in October 1994 with an instruction that it should be brought to the attention of all officers engaged in food control operations.</P>
      <P>A reminder to this effect was issued in July 1995.  A further reminder issued in December 1996, this time to directors of public health in the health boards.  The directors were asked to remind doctors and laboratories to be particularly vigilant in reporting cases of food poisoning, with a view to identifying any possible cases of E. coli infection.  Following advice from the Food Safety Advisory Board, the health promotion unit of my Department has prepared a leaflet for distribution to the general public on this matter.</P>
      <P>The proposed national disease surveillance unit will provide a comprehensive approach to the prevention of disease, including foodborne diseases. I hope to be in a position shortly to approve the establishment of this unit on an interim basis.</P>

      <P>I recently gave approval to the Eastern Health Board to proceed with a number of new initiatives for homeless children in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Included in the measures is a new emergency residential centre for children under the age of 12.  This centre will be operational on a 24 hour basis and will provide a workable alternative to social admissions to hospitals.  A residential centre for adolescents is to be established in Fairview in partnership with St. Jude's Trust.  Plans are also advancing for a day-and-night reception centre in Dublin city centre to allow young homeless people access to Eastern Health Board services.

      <P>The minimum educational requirements prescribed by An Bord Altranais for entry to student nurse training are grade C/C3 or higher in two higher level papers and grade D/D3 or higher in four ordinary or higher level papers in Irish, English, Mathematics, a science subject and two other subjects, accumulated over not more than two sittings of the leaving certificate.  These minimum requirements apply to any school of nursing not yet participating in the new nursing registration-diploma programme.  In practice, the individual schools of nursing have operated higher requirements due to the numbers of applicants applying for places.</P>
      <P>The educational requirements applying to the nursing registration-diploma programme are based on the An Bord Altranais minimum adapted to take account of third level requirements. These are a minimum grade C/C3 in higher level papers in any two of the following six subjects and a minimum of grade D/D3 in ordinary or higher level papers in the four other subjects &mdash;Irish, English, Mathematics, one other language, a laboratory science subject not including home economics &mdash; social and scientific &mdash; and one other subject which may include home economics &mdash; social and scientific &mdash; but may not include home economics &mdash; general.  These subjects and grades may be accumulated over not more than two sittings of the leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>The application-selection procedure for places on the nursing registration-diploma programme is handled by the Nursing Applications Centre.  This centre was established in 1995 on a pilot basis to provide a national and centralised applications and selection system for applicants seeking places on the programme.  The philosophy of equity and parity of treatment of all applicants underpinned this development.  The establishment of the Nursing Applications Centre has enabled those interested in a career in nursing to apply to all schools of nursing offering the nursing registration-diploma programme by way of a single application.  This has resulted in a streamlined system which has eliminated the need for multiplicity of applications to individual schools of nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> At this stage most of the schools of nursing have made the transition from the traditional model of training to the diploma based programme and I am committed to completing this process next year.  Price Waterhouse Management Consultants are currently carrying out an evaluation of the Nursing Applications Centre with the overall aim of ensuring that the most up to-date application and selection procedures are employed with maximum equity and effectiveness. One of the central issues that Price Waterhouse has been asked to address is the educational requirements for entry to the nursing registration-diploma programme.  As part of this evaluation Price Waterhouse project-managed the application-selection process for the 1997 intake of student nurses.  Certain modifications to the procedures employed in previous years were introduced this year with the objective of streamlining the application-selection process.  These included the replacement of the preliminary interview by a written assessment test.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse will shortly report to my Department on its evaluation of the Nursing Applications Centre.  Decisions as to the future operations of the Nursing Applications Centre and the procedures employed by it will be made in the light of the recommendations contained in the management consultants' report, which will be informed by their experience of project-managing this year's application-selection process.</P>

      <Col N="1669" /> The Rotunda has indicated that, while exact statistics for 1997 have not yet been collated, indications are that the figure will be similar to the 1996 figure of 43 such babies.  Statistics for each of the previous three years indicate that between ten and 14 drug addicted babies required special care treatment.</P>
    <P>The National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street has indicated that the number of babies born with drug addiction symptoms in 1996 was approximately ten.  The hospital has also indicated that it treats approximately ten such babies every year.</P>

With the aim of reducing waiting times, Saturday testing is being conducted and, in addition, a package of productivity measures is being negotiated which will also provide for the engagement of a number of testers on short-term contracts.</P>

      <P>Under the remedial works scheme, funding is provided to assist local authorities to carry out major essential works of a structural nature to houses in designated housing estates. Some £18 million has been paid to date to Dublin Corporation in respect of work to houses in Darndale Estate.  Work under phase 1 of the estate was completed in 1988.  Where the works proposed by a local authority in respect of a scheme or a phase of a scheme have been completed, funding under the RWS is not provided for the carrying out of further work at a later date and the corporation has been so advised.  It is a matter for a local authority to fund any extra work it wishes to have carried out from its own resources for the upkeep and management of its housing stock.  In relation to the funding of a social centre, communal facilities on a limited scale may be funded, as part of the overall refurbishment of a housing estate, under the remedial <Col N="1681" /> works scheme where the facilities are required to assist authorities in implementing improved management and maintenance arrangements in the estate, including increased levels of tenant participation. Funding would be confined to facilities owned and managed by the local authority.</P>

In addition, my Department has recently appointed consultants to, <i>inter alia,</i> review and update the findings of the strategy <Col N="1682" /> study in so far as they relate to the land spreading of treated sewage sludge.  The consultants work is expected to be completed by mid-1998.</P>

      <P>The question of electronic voting and counting at elections is kept under review in my Department in the light of technological developments.  At this stage, it is not evident that the advantges would outweigh the significant practical difficulties and costs involved which, in our case, would be magnified by the relative complexity of the single transferable vote system.</P>
      <P>As part of a package of measures designed to improve and modernise the counting process at elections, the Local Government Computer Services Board, at the request of my Department and in consultation with returning officers developed a computer programme to assist returning officers in conducting counts which was tested at the June general election.  This programme will be finalised for use at forthcoming elections and may be extended to cover other stages of the election process.  The computer programme used at the recent presidential election will also be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The Government has decided that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis, subject to a minimum adjustment of 3 per cent in their pensions, or 2 per cent in the case of those pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993, an essential repairs grant may be paid in respect of a house in any area subject to the following conditions: the occupier is approved for local authority housing; the house cannot be made fit for human habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost but the repairs proposed will prolong the useful life of the house; and there would be no continuing demand for local authority housing at the location of the house in respect of which the grant is sought.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I would expect that only a small number of cases in built-up areas could comply with the requirements of the regulations.  In circumstances where an essential repairs grant cannot be paid for a house because there is a continuing demand for local authority housing, it would be open to an authority to consider the use of the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, if the requirements of that scheme are fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the Government's programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, I am examining what options are available for a targeted house improvement grant scheme for low income households having regard to the range of measures <Col N="1684" /> currently available and the likely cost implications. The essential repairs grant scheme is one of the areas being examined in this context.</P>

      <P>Public library developments receive financial support on the basis of the contribution the development will make to the public library service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria used to assess this contribution are the impact of the project, the cost of the project, its location, its design, the existing level of library infrastructure, the priority placed on the project <Col N="1688" /> by the library authority, the level of service being proposed, and the relationship between the library development and other related services.</P>
    <P>A balance is also maintained, at national level, between developments in areas of different population size and between supporting fixed library infrastructure and library vehicles.</P>
    <P>Financial support is currently given by either payment of a subsidy on leased premises or by payment of a capital grant for the construction or purchase of library buildings, library equipment or library stock.  Some subsidy continues to be paid in respect of loans taken out by library authorities, before 1988, in respect of library developments. Since 1988, most of the support paid by my Department has been as capital grants.</P>
    <P>The following table sets out details of subsidy payments made to each library authority since 1988.</P>
    <P>As regards Mullingar library, revised proposals for the project were submitted by Westmeath County Council to my Department in January 1990.  The council requested financial support through a combination of lease subsidy and capital grant.</P>
    <P>In July 1990, while the proposals were being considered by my Department, it was learned that the library was already under construction.  The library opened in May 1991.</P>
    <P>The library was built without approval from my Department and without undergoing the normal appraisal process applicable to library proects. The project does not, therefore, qualify for financial support in the normal way.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently had discussions with Westmeath County Council to investigate if a basis exists for supporting the completed project. The matter is under consideration.</P>
    <P>Any decision that may be taken to provide support to Westmeath County Council for Mullingar library will be taken in line with the criteria outlined above and will take account of the council's failure to adhere to normal procedures.</P>

      <P>Housing rents are credited to the current revenue account of the housing authority concerned and there has been no charge in this arrangement in the last ten years.</P>
      <P>The use of housing capital receipts, including annuities, is subject to approval by the Minister in accordance with section 108 of the Housing Act, 1966, as substituted by section 22 of the Housing Act, 1988.  Local authorities are required to credit a proportion of receipts from pre-1993 tenant purchase schemes to capital purposes.  In the absence of alternative arrangements specifically approved on an individual authority basis, this proportion was 60 per cent in the financial years 1981 to 1996 and 80 per cent with effect from 1 January, 1997.  Local authorities are required to credit the full proceeds of sales under the 1993 and 1995 tenant purchase schemes to capital purposes.  These arrangements have been in place since the introduction of the schemes on 6 July 1993 and 1 May, 1995, respectively.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, the social housing programmes of local authorities including the provision of houses, remedial works etc, have been funded by way of a combination of Exchequer grants and internal capital receipts.  Prior to 1990, housing capital receipts were normally used to finance the making of house purchase and improvement loans and other capital purposes as approved by the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 208 and 214 together.</P>
      <P>An application form for the 1997 scheme of grants for voluntary organisations, issued to the organisation in question in March 1997.  However, the organisation did not return a completed form to my Department and, therefore, it was not possible to consider them for funding.</P>
      <P>The organisation wrote to my Department in September 1997 seeking inclusion in the family resource centre scheme.  The FRC scheme is a pilot scheme on an approach to providing support to families through the provision of resource centres at local level.  A review of the pilot has been carried out and my Department is currently examining proposals for extending the scheme. The organisation's application for inclusion in the FRC scheme will be reviewed when the examination is completed.</P>
      <P>In the meantime staff from my Department's regional office are meeting with representatives of the organisation to advise them regarding the submission of an application for funding under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations in 1998.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the anomaly whereby a person who has worked all his life and who unfortunately finds himself unfit for work and claims disability benefit will be informed that his previous earnings are no longer reckonable and that his earnings are based on his current rate of disability benefit if he is on disability benefit for over one year; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this will place the person in the weekly earnings bracket of £25 to £34.99 a week and he will only be entitled to £30.30 per week when he subsequently transfers to unemployment benefit in view of the fact that a person who never worked will get the full rate of unemployment assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment benefit is a weekly payment made to insured people who are out of work and who satisfy a number of qualifying conditions.  The rate of payment is graduated according to the earnings of the claimant in the relevant tax year &mdash; i.e. the last income tax year before the benefit year in which the claim is made.  If the claimant has earnings from employment in the relevant tax year, only those earnings will be used to determine the rate of payment.</P>
      <P>Graduated rates of benefit payments were introduced in order to ensure that disincentives to employment were not created following on the extension in 1991 of full social insurance coverage to workers earning in excess of £25 per week. (This income limit has since been increased to £30 per week).  In their absence, a situation would exist whereby many workers on low incomes would have access to weekly social welfare payments which could exceed their income from employment.</P>
      <P>I should point out that where a claimant who qualifies for a graduated rate of unemployment benefit has an underlying entitlement to unemployment assistance at a higher rate of payment, it is open to him/her to opt to receive unemployment assistance in lieu of unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, perhaps he would let me have the relevant details and I will arrange to have the position examined.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his Department will approve an application for the back to work allowance for a person (details supplied) in County Mayo in view of the fact that he did not realise he was entitled to apply before he commenced work.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to provide an incentive to long-term unemployed people to take up employment or self-employment.  The scheme has a limited number of places and is targeted at people who need the additional financial incentive <Col N="1692" /> which the scheme provides.  It is a requirement of the scheme that an applicant must apply for the allowance prior to taking up employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned took up employment on 7 August 1997 but did not apply for the allowance until 6 October 1997.  His application was refused on the grounds that his claim was late and that he was in a position to take up employment without recourse to the scheme.  The decision was strictly in accordance with the rules of the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if he will increase the current ceiling of maternity benefit which does not fairly reflect current income levels of workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Maternity benefit is paid to qualified insured women for a 14 week period, at least four of which must be taken before the baby is due and at least four weeks after the birth, subject to a minimum weekly payment of £82.30 and a maximum payment of £162.80 Over recent years the additional resources which have been provided for the maternity benefit scheme have been directed at enhancing the coverage of the scheme, so as to include the maximum number of working women, and enhancing the minimum level of payment under the scheme, so as to provide additional supports for women in low paid employment.</P>
      <P>The scope of the scheme has been extended significantly in recent years.  For example, the Social Welfare Act, 1991 extended full social insurance cover, including cover for maternity benefit, to part-time workers earning more than £25 a week; this limit has now been increased to £30 a week.  This extension was of particular benefit to women.  The Social Welfare Act, 1997, further extended the cover for maternity benefit to women in self-employment.</P>
      <P>The 1997 Act also provided for a 9 per cent increase in the minimum rate of maternity benefit, from £75.70 to £82.30. This increase will benefit some 6,500 claimants a year, approximately 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>Any increase in the maximum payment under the maternity benefit scheme, which would benefit women in higher paid employment, would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context, having regard to the available resources.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  The smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week was introduced to assist people living in designated smoke free zones to help them meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of extending the ban on bituminous <Col N="1694" /> coal is being considered by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The smokeless fuel allowance will be reviewed in that context.  However, there are no plans to make the allowance available to peopole who live outside designated smoke free zones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Social Welfare legislation provides that income received by an applicant from insurable earnings must be assessed as means for unemployment assistance purposes. Consequently, where a person is insurably employed on one, two or three days per week and claims unemployment assistance for the remaining days, his or her earnings are assessable as means.</P>
      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people who are unable to meet their housing needs from their own resources.  Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources.  In the calculation of the amount of rent supplement payable, the legislation enables the health board to set rent limits.</P>
      <P>The national programme Partnership 2000 recognised that the rent and mortgage supplements payable under the SWA scheme, can have a significant impact on the incentive for unemployed people to avail of work and training opportunities.  The programme contains a specific commitment to examine how this can be alleviated. As a first step towards this, my Department has engaged consultants to review the effects of secondary benefits on the incentive to take up and remain in employment and training and I expect that their report, which is intended to be available by year-end, will provide useful guidance to policy development in this area.</P>

      <P>The statutory position regarding broadcasting time on RTE services is that in accordance with section 19 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, amended by section <Col N="1697" /> 14(1)    of      the      Broadcasting        Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976, the total number of hours per year of broadcasting by the RTE Authority in providing its sound broadcasting service shall neither exceed a maximum nor be less than a minimum fixed by the Authority, with the approval of the Minister, for that service.</P>
      <P>At present RTE Cork Local Radio is subject to a maximum of 2,009 hours per year and a minimum of 1,929 hours per year.  The maximum was last increased on 30 June 1993 at the request of the RTE Authority.  I have no request from the RTE Authority to increase the hours of broadcasting by RTE Cork Local Radio to the level of the services operated by Cork 96 FM/County Sound 103 FM.  If the RTE Authority wishes to increase the maximum number of hours, it may request my approval under the legislation.  If such a request is received I will, of course, consider it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a local community group &ldquo;Canal Watch&rdquo; was recently formed to improve the stretch of the Royal Canal from Shandon Mills to Binns Bridge.  On 4 October 1997 this group organised a highly successful clean-up of the canal in their area with the assistance of the waterways service.  Normal maintenance works were also carried out by staff of the waterways service in the same area during October, this included the removal of substantial rubbish from canal property, the cutting of grass and overhanging bushes and the upgrading of fencing and towpath barriers.  The Deputy will appreciate that regular dumping of refuse and canal property is a major problem for the waterways service. However, I am sure she will agree that community interest and participation in the enhancement of the canal, as exemplified by the &ldquo;Canal Watch&rdquo; group, is an encouraging development for the future.</P>

      <P>The application was discussed by Clare County Council on 10 November 1997, and the council passed a resolution that a decision on the material contravention be deferred for a period of six months, subject to the consent of the applicant.

      <P>The former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht announced the establishment of a screen commission for Ireland on 4 June last.  The preferred method of funding was to be from recoupments on loans advanced by the Irish Film Board since 1994.  However, the reality was that these funds were not immediately at his disposal and that the screen commission could not, despite his announcement, be established, funded on this basis.</P>

    <P>Because the loans being provided by the Film Board are co-funded by the European Union under the Operational Programme for Industrial Development, any decision to use recoupments for the purpose of funding the screen commission <Col N="1701" /> required the express approval of the European Commission.  On 6 November last, at a meeting of the monitoring committee for the Operational Programme, at which the necessary technical decisions to allow the funding of the screen commission from this source were taken, my Department received oral approval from the Commission. I await the formal written confirmation of the Commission approval which, I understand, will not be operative until 1 January next.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am taking the opportunity to meet industry interests, RTE and the Irish Film Board to hear their views on their priorities, for the screen commission.  This process commenced on 13 November last, when I met Film Makers Ireland, and will continue with a meeting I have arranged with the Audiovisual Production Federation of IBEC tomorrow, 19 November 1997.</P>

      <P>I have had a number of meetings with members and officials of An Chomhairle Ealaíon since my appointment as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>The first occasion was shortly following my appointment when I visited many of the national cultural institutions and statutory agencies under the aegis of my Department, including An Chomhhairle Ealaíon.  More recently, on 28 October, I visited the Offices of An Chomhairle Ealaíon to launch three bilingual documents which have been recently published by an chomhairle, providing comprehensive information on how an comhairle operates and setting out guidelines for individuals and groups seeking grants.  I have also had the opportunity of meeting many members and officials of An Comhairle Ealaíon during the course of my work and the Director of an chomhairle accompanied me for part of a visit to the US in October to explore, <i>inter alia,</i> the growing participation in the arts by people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of recent road accidents for which wandering horses may have been partly responsible is not readily available.  This information could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.  The Garda supply details of all road accidents, including accidents involving animals, to the National Roads Authority which publishes an annual report entitled "Road Accident Facts", copies of which are available from that authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Control of Horses Act, 1996, which was enacted by the Minister for Agriculture, Food <Col N="1703" /> and Forestry, and the regulations made under the Act, give local authorities and the Garda powers to deal with the problem of wandering horses.  As the primary responsibility for the operation of the Act, which came into force last March, lies with the local authorities, I have brought the concerns of the Deputy to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the gardaí received reports of the suspicious deaths referred to by the Deputy at 3.20 p.m. on 8 November 1997.</P>
      <P>The State Pathologist was contacted by the Garda authorities at approximately 5.30 p.m. He arrived at Mullingar Garda station at approximately 10 p.m. and he commenced his preliminary examinations of the bodies at approximately 11 p.m. The examinations were completed at approximately 2 a.m. on 9 November 1997.  The bodies were then removed to Mullingar County Hospital, where the State Pathologist commenced the post mortem examinations at 11 a.m. and completed them at 11.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>The State pathologist cannot examine bodies at scenes of suspicious deaths until the Garda authorities have completed their preliminary inspections of the scene.  In this case, the Garda inspection was not completed until approximately 11 p.m. and it was only then that the State pathologist was free to commence his work.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there was no unwarranted delay by the State pathologist in attending at the scene of these deaths.</P>
      <P>I should remind the Deputy that, as I announced recently, a Deputy State Pathologist will be taking up duty early in January next. While the availability of a deputy would not have affected the timings involved in this case, the strengthening of the pathology service will be a decided advantage in the future, especially where suspicious deaths occur at the same time in different parts of the country and at times when the State Pathologist is not immediately available to respond to calls.</P>

When the station is closed a direct communications system, linked to the district headquarters at Wexford, which is open on a 24-hour basis, comes into operation.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the district patrol car at Wexford Garda station is utilised in patrolling the Castlebridge area and that these patrols are augmented by the detective branch and the divisional traffic corps patrols which also operate within the district.  In addition, checkpoints are carried out in the area as part of the regional anti-crime operation &ldquo;South East&rdquo;.  I understand that personnel from the district headquarters at Wexford are utilised, when required, to respond to calls in the area when the member at Castlebridge is unavailable for duty.

      <P>The only reference to my Department in the media report mentioned by the Deputy relates to the preparation by the Department of legislation on child pornography. This legislation is currently with the Parliamentary Draftsman and I hope to be in a position to bring it to Government shortly.  I would point out, however, that while this legislation is intended to embrace child pornography on computer systems, including the Internet, it does not purport to address the issue of controlling the Internet, through legislative instruments, as raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to the illegal and harmful use of the Internet are, however, being considered by a working group which was established by my Department earlier this year.  The group, which consists of representatives from both the private and public sectors, is expected to publish its interim report shortly.</P>

      <P>I have recently met representatives of Educate Together and discussed a number of issues with them, including the question of funding. The position is that my Department provides grant aid assistance to the respective primary school management bodies to defray costs incurred in the running of their organisations. These costs can include mail issues to boards of management, the organisation of seminars and meetings, the commissioning of research and other miscellaneous expenses.</P>
      <P>The grant aid is allocated on the basis of the number of schools that each management body represents.  In this regard, Educate Together, which represents 18 schools, received grant aid of £6,000 in 1997, an increase of £4,000 on its allocation in 1996.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the allocation of funding to the various school management bodies will be reviewed within my Department for the coming year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 and 270 together.</P>
      <P>The report of Sir Ron Dearing on the Future of Higher Education in the UK was published in July 1997.  Arising from this report, Mr. David Blunkett, the UK Secretary of State for Education and Employment announced that he planned to introduce an annual tuition fee of up to £1,000 depending on parental income, that tuition would continue to be free for students from lower income families and that maintenance grants would be replaced by student loans.  He further advised that a White Paper, which has yet to be published, will detail the new arrangements.</P>
      <P>At this stage, it is not possible, in advance of the publication of the White Paper, to fully assess the implications of the Dearing recommendations on the number of places in the higher education system or on students from the Republic who are attending college in Britain.  My officials have had preliminary discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Education in Northern Ireland and I have been in contact with the Secretary of State on this matter.  We are in the process of arranging a meeting to discuss it in conjunction with other matters.</P>

      <P>The terms of the scheme for early retirement <Col N="1714" /> are set out in Circular 25/97 which was issued to schools in June 1997, following consultation with the education partners.  The circular specifies that strand three may be availed of by teachers in posts which are surplus to requirements, from which they may not be redeployed readily and which will not be filled should they leave the posts.</P>
      <P>Whilst the circular makes no reference to career breaks it was intended that the provisions set out in the circuluar for early retirement were to be availed of by teachers in current teaching service.  The education partners have been fully aware of my Department's position in this regard at all times through their membership of the early retirement consultative council and the early retirement advisory committee.  I must add, however, that the teachers' unions have requested my Department to reconsider the policy and arrangements are being made for a meeting with them.  The teacher referred to by the Deputy, who is on a career break from teaching, applied for early retirement on 26 June 1997 under strand three of the early retirement scheme for teachers.  It is understood that she subsequently made contact by phone with my Department regarding her application.  The Department's formal decision on her application, stating that she was ineligible for early retirement, was, in accordance with the provisions of the circular, conveyed on 29 August to both the teacher and her school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the position of students entered for the examination as external candidates as distinct from those entered by the authorities of second level schools. The fee structure for external candidates is intended to facilitate students who wish to take one or more subjects at different sittings while at the same time ensuring that the fees paid by such students are consistent with those paid by a student who may repeat the examination while attending a second level school.  The structure is reviewed periodically and will be reviewed again for the 1999 examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of a particular case where the existing structure places an external student at a relative disadvantage my Department will be glad to consider the matter fully if provided with details of the case. <Col N="1715" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 and 273 together.</P>
      <P>One of the key priority areas in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, is the commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources, including the provision of remedial teachers and resources for special learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that it is my intention to honour this commitment in the years ahead.  As part of this process, I am reviewing provision across the entire special needs area, including the remedial area, to ensure that all resources which become available are utilised to maximum effect.</P>
      <P>As far as the distribution of any demographic dividend or other extra resources which become available in 1998 or 1999 is concerned, I assure the Deputy that I will be attaching priority to the special needs areas, including the remedial area. However, no decisions have been taken at this stage regarding such allocations.</P>
      <P>My Department has received an application for a remedial service from the schools mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend of the 1997-98 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial posts <Col N="1717" /> to primary schools with effect on September 1997. These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.  Unfortunately, the schools mentioned by the Deputy were not included on that occasion.  However, I assure the Deputy that the needs of these schools will be taken fully into account in the context of any additional resource allocations undertaken in the future.</P>

The tenth assistant teacher's post which was due to be suppressed at the end of the 1996-97 school year was retained in the school from 1 September 1997 because the school's enrolment in September 1997 was in breach of maximum class size guidelines.</P>

In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary shcools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1977-98 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.  Accordingly, I am not in a position at present to extend remedial services in the primary sector.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>In relation to the schools IT 2000 investment programme, the circumstances and the local needs of the individual schools will be fully taken into account.  Each school will also be supported in developing its own technology programme with a view to ensuring that the broader educational aims are incorporated into the schools educational plan.  The joint business education partnership forum will be widely representative at the highest levels of the business sector, the education sector, the trade unions, Government Departments and development agencies.  It will provide a forum where all the key interests can examine practical and strategic issues, both national and regional.</P>

      <P>In addition to moneys provided to course organisers in respect of meals, etc., for <Col N="1720" /> participants at approved courses, individual teachers may also claim payments for travel and subsistence, within limits, for attendance at certain courses.  In the case of remedial training courses, an overnight allowance, where necessary, of £19.91 may be claimed and in the case of certain post-primary courses generally provided by course organisers outside of normal school hours, an overnight contribution of £12.7 may be claimed.</P>
      <P>Travel expenses, where approved for the particular course or programme, are allowed on the basis that public transport is used wherever this is possible.  Where public transport is unavailable, a car mileage allowance of 21p per mile may be claimed, subject to certain conditions.  In all cases, course organisers are expected to organise courses as economically as possible.</P>

      <P>The school in question is one of a number of schools which have applied for disadvantaged status to my Department.  The disadvantaged areas scheme was last expanded in 1994 when an additional 54 schools were included for capitation purposes only.  As an alternative to a further widening of the scheme, and following indepth studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Education Research Centre and the Combat Poverty Agency, a new pilot project, breaking the cycle, was launched in May 1996.</P>
      <P>I am currently considering the range of special support services targeted on educational disadvantage. I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school in question will be considered in the context of any future developments in this area.</P>

      <P>The 100 per cent increase in the net total allocation contained in the Abridged Estimates Volume for 1998 for Vote 26: Office of the Minister for Education and Science is mainly due to the allocation of £100 million in subhead B.19 for the Education Technology Investment Fund.</P>
      <P>The provision of £1,444,000 in the miscellaneous subhead B.17 is for a programme related to tackling issues of educational disadvantage details of which I will announce shortly.</P>
