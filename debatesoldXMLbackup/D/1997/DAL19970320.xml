      <P>It is proposed to take the Report from the Select Committee on Social Affairs on the Equal Status Bill, 1997; No. 25a, motion re. ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; No. 2, Central Bank Bill, 1996 &mdash; amendments from the Seanad; No. 14, motion re.  Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) No. 25a should be decided without debate; (2) the amendments from the Seanad to No. 2 should be taken together and decided without debate by one question, which shall be put from the Chair; and (3) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 14: the opening speech of a Minister, Minister of State and main spokespersons for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats shall not exceed one hour in each case and the speech of each other Member called shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; Members may share time and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>There are three matters to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 25a agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 2 agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 14 agreed?</P>

      <P>On No. 14, yesterday during the Order of Business we sought to learn the Government's intentions on the payment of exemplary and aggravated damages to those affected by hepatitis C.  Late last night we were glad to learn this had been agreed by the Government as it accords with the spirit of our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a separate but related matter, it was put to the Tánaiste yesterday that the relevant Minister would answer questions and be accountable on the matter.  The Tánaiste said that health questions would be taken as a normal matter of course <Col N="1206" /> next Tuesday, thereby implying that suitable questions could be answered through that mechanism. We now understand that questions will not be allowed next Tuesday on this matter.  Therefore, we ask again that the Minister answer questions on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will debate the report of the tribunal set up on foot of a motion in this House.  During that tribunal, a variety of questions were rigorously put to a number of people, including the Ministers for Health and the Environment, Deputies Noonan and Howlin.  Both Ministers will speak in this debate and the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, will reply at the end of the debate.  In his reply he will deal comprehensively with the questions posed in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Government defend its position in not allowing a question and answer session at the end of this debate?  Who is the Government protecting?  It is not protecting the victims of the worst health scandal since the foundation of this State.  Why are they afraid to answer questions in here?  Are they afraid the truth will emerge in answers to them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>We want the Government to concede to what has become the normal practice in debates on matters such as this &mdash; a short question and answer session with the Minister <Col N="1210" /> involved.  We requested such an arrangement in relation to the Government's first proposal to have statements on the matter and it was refused. We also made the request when the Government agreed to our request to put a motion on the matter so that we might table an amendment.  The Government has not acceded to that request.  The Minister for Finance should allow a short question and answer session.</P>
      <P>I propose that there should be a question and answer session for a 45 minute period before the Minister for Health concludes the debate, as has been the practice in the past.  I move the following amendment: &ldquo;That the arrangements for No. 14 be amended to include a question and answer session to the Minister for Health for a period not exceeding 45 minutes.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> Before I deal with the terms of the motion it is incumbent on me to make a number of points of relevance.  I know I speak for everybody in this House and throughout the country, regardless of political affiliation, when I say it is almost impossible to come to terms with the enormity of the scandal surrounding the hepatitis C infection of the anti-D product and the blood supply.  Notwithstanding our best efforts to do so, it will take a considerable length of time for all of us to comprehend fully the horrendous effect which this scandal has had, and continues to have, on the health and everyday lives of innocent victims and their families.  I truly believe no words of mine can ever adequately apologise to the 1,600 women and men for the damage done to them by a system in which they had previously placed their fullest trust and confidence.</P>
    <P>Trauma and fear has been engendered in many innocent people by this experience.  There is some recompense in the recognition that grievous wrongs were committed.  There is some recompense too in the unequivocal allocation of responsibility for these wrongs by the tribunal of inquiry.  There is some minor recompense also in the monetary awards to the affected victims &mdash; awards which we can only hope alleviate the suffering and distress expressed so heartrendingly by the victims and their immediate families. Nothing, however, can ever fully or irrevocably compensate them for being infected with hepatitis C &mdash; a condition for which as yet, unfortunately, there is no cure.</P>
    <P>The formidable task of disentangling the complex facts of this tragedy, of putting order on them and setting them out plainly, in language which precisely and exactly conveys the awfulness of these events, was entrusted by this House to Mr. Justice Finlay, and has been discharged by him with unprecedented efficiency and expedition for which I wish to record my thanks, the thanks of the Government, and of the House.</P>
    <P>The end product of this House's decision to establish this tribunal is that there is now available for all who wish to avail of it &mdash; victims, participants, politicians, doctors, the public as a whole &mdash; a clear and coherent account of this matter, of who is responsible, and of what is now to be done.  The truth has now been laid bare, a number of recurrent controversies laid to rest, and responsibility allocated in a fair, just and impartial manner.</P>
    <P>It does not make happy reading.  No citizen, whether victim, participant in the events described, or mere concerned observer, can fail to be moved and humbled by the account of the distress and fortitude of those who have suffered and continue to suffer from the events described.</P>
    <P>The report gives us a coherent account of what has occurred and why, but it is considerably more than merely a history.  It is an unemotional indictment of past procedures at the BTSB, and is unequivocal in its apportionment of blame to certain named members of staff.</P>
    <P>It offers welcome and succinct illumination on <Col N="1219" /> a number of difficult legal issues, for example, the application of the Therapeutic Substances Act 1932; but it also looks to the future.  From the victim's point of view it sets out the factual basis upon which claims for compensation, either in court or before the tribunal will henceforth be based, and the State will not seek to repudiate or resile from any of the tribunal's findings in any such forum.  From the point of view of the blood supply it sets out a number of important recommendations, all of which are being accepted in full.  The exceptional command of the facts exhibited by Mr. Justice Finlay lends to his recommendations an authority and a widespread acceptance that ensures that the implementation of his recommendations in full will provide a sound basis for restoring full confidence to the blood supply.</P>
    <P>I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without commenting on the most recent incident involving the BTSB, namely contacting an infected victim with a view to obtaining blood.  Mistakes such as these, even when there is no risk to the blood supply, are simply unacceptable.  I have made my views known trenchantly to the chairman and chief executive of the BTSB and, while I accept that great strides have been made in reforming the operations of the BTSB, it must be fully recognised that this latest incident has added to the negative perception of that organisation which the current management has done so much to dispel.  Notwithstanding the real difficulty people may have in coming to terms with what has happened, the truth is that we need blood, our hospitals need blood, and it is grossly irresponsible to call for the closing down of the BTSB or for the sacking of a public servant who has devoted such an enormous amount of time, effort and dedication to resolving the problems of the BTSB.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, mistakes were made but I will not be satisfied until such time as we can with total confidence rule out even the most minor error, because each such error, no matter how small, can undermine confidence in the BTSB.</P>
    <P>Huge strides have been made to improve standards at the BTSB.  The work of Mr. Liam Dunbar and Professor Shaun McCann has been invaluable in reorganising the BTSB and in setting and implementing new standards and procedures which ensure that the mistakes of the past will not recur.  Management has drawn heavily on the recommendations of the Bain Consultancy report in forming a strategic plan, much of which is already implemented.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of recommendations in Mr. Justice Finlay's report will further improve standards at the BTSB.  I will deal with these recommendations in some detail.  I have already stated publicly that the Government accepts the recommendations of the report.  These recommendations will be implemented as quickly as possible. The report makes six significant recommendations on the future workings of the Blood Transfusion <Col N="1220" /> Service Board and the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>Those portions of the development plan for the BTSB for the period 1996-9 which have not yet been implemented will be implemented without delay.  I will ensure that the 1999 target date for completion will be met.  In particular, I have approved the relocation of Pelican House to the campus of St. James's Hospital, which will be the site for a new headquarters for the BTSB.  This new building will ensure that state-of-the-art laboratories, including all the necessary equipment and staff, can be put in place to ensure that our national blood service will have the required range of facilities to carry it through to the 21st century.  Likewise the renewal or replacement of the BTSB unit in Cork will be commenced immediately.  The estimated capital cost for the completion of the development plan is £20 million.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has made detailed recommendations in relation to the monitoring of the BTSB by the Irish Medicines Board.  In response to the expert group report of April 1995 I have given the Irish Medicines Board statutory responsibility for the inspection of the collection, screening, processing and quality control facilities and procedures in respect of blood, blood products and plasma derivatives with a view to ensuring their safety and quality.  The tribunal has recommended that the Irish Medicines Board should carry out at least two full inspections of the BTSB each year.  This has already been implemented in that the arrangement now is that the IMB carries out four inspections of the BTSB each year.</P>
    <P>My Department has commenced discussions with the Irish Medicines Board with a view to implementing a recommendation that it should be required to make an annual report to the Minister, for publication, on the outcome of these inspections and also on any reports received by the IMB of abnormal reactions to blood or blood products from any person or institution.  The tribunal, in what is a very important recommendation, has recommended that there should be a statutory obligation on medical and nursing personnel to report contemporaneously all abnormal reactions to blood or blood products to the IMB and the BTSB, and that the BTSB should also be obliged to report to the IMB on all abnormal reactions of which it becomes aware.  The tribunal also recommends that failure by any employee of the BTSB to report such abnormal reaction if committed intentionally or by gross negligence should be a criminal offence.  I am accepting this recommendation.  There are potentially difficult legal issues which will have to be teased out in the course of its implementation, and I have instructed my Department to proceed immediately with this work.</P>
    <P>A Blood Service Consumers' Council, including representation from those who regularly receive blood and those who regularly donate blood, will be set up in the immediate future.  This will make a major contribution to the maintenance <Col N="1221" /> of public confidence in the supply of blood and blood products.  It is vital that members of the general public should have an advisory role in the BTSB.</P>
    <P>The report of the tribunal is critical of the recall of the anti-D product undertaken by the BTSB in 1994 and has recommended that the BTSB should forthwith prepare a new standard operating procedure for a recall of any product the safety of which is suspected.  I have instructed my Department to commence the process of implementing this recommendation with the BTSB.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has also looked at the difficulty which could arise if it was again necessary to stop using a particular blood product at short notice, but there was no product authorisation in place for alternatives which could be imported quickly as an emergency replacement.  The tribunal points out that a commercial undertaking may not be concerned to undergo the trouble or expense to obtain a product authorisation on the off-chance that its supplies may be needed in an emergency. The tribunal has asked that a possible solution should be considered whereby the present regulations would be amended to provide for what it terms &ldquo;standby&rdquo; or &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; product authorisations to cover such situations.  This is a most worthwhile suggestion which I have instructed my Department to investigate without delay.  I am accepting the tribunal's recommendation that, if such a scheme is feasible, the BTSB should be required to make use of it so that &ldquo;standby&rdquo; authorisations will be in place for products such as anti-D and factor VIII.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the tribunal's recommendations will build on the work already carried out by the new management in the BTSB to ensure as far as possible the safety of blood and blood products into the future.  The necessary groundwork has been put in place by the new management of the BTSB in the past two years in respect of many of these matters.</P>
    <P>Hundreds and thousands of people in this country have over decades given freely millions of donations of their blood in order to maintain, sustain and extend life for those critically ill or critically injured.  Our blood supply system is among a small handful of unique voluntary blood supply systems.  I appeal to people on all sides of this House to approach the current debate on how best to protect and promote the integrity of the national blood supply with humility, with a sense of proportion and balance and with a real sense of responsibility for a public duty in its broadest meaning.  In the interests of the nation as a whole, Deputies on all sides of the House, while exercising their absolute right to scrutinise Government policy at all times, will accept that the voluntary blood supply is a national asset which should not be unfairly exposed to partisan politics, whatever about particular criticisms.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I met with representatives of Positive Action last evening in response to a letter it sent to me on 14 March last <Col N="1222" /> outlining its views arising from publication of the tribunal report.  Positive Action has requested a full reappraisal of the compensation tribunal.  The reappraisal which the Government is embarking upon is required principally because the state of knowledge has been altered drastically by the publication of this report.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to place the compensation scheme on a statutory basis but has resolved that the operation of the compensation tribunal should not be disrupted or delayed while the scheme is being prepared and the statute drafted and enacted.  The Government will give this work priority, but the House is well aware that even with full co-operation on all sides, legislation takes time, and I want the facility of the compensation tribunal to be in place continuing its work for the benefit of those who wish to process their claims through that tribunal.  As the terms of reference in the motion state, any advantage conferred by any reappraisal of the terms of the tribunal will also apply to those who have already had their cases processed by the tribunal or those who in the interim will seek to process claims through the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Considerable public attention has been given to the prohibition in the existing terms of reference of any award of aggravated or punitive damages. It has been pointed out that the option of awarding such damages is available to the High Court but not available to the tribunal, and that it would be preferable if the compensation tribunal had precisely the same freedom as the High Court in this regard.  Accordingly, I will be proposing that this restrictive provision be removed from the terms of reference of the tribunal, and that it will be free to award damages on exactly the same basis as the High Court.  It will be for the tribunal to decide whether such charges are appropriate and how they should be measured when that question arises.  In considering that question, the compensation tribunal will be informed that the Government accepts the findings of the tribunal of inquiry, and that the report's findings of fact should be accepted by the compensation tribunal.  I will proceed with the reappraisal of the compensation tribunal in full consultation with representatives of the victims. This is the Government's first response to this issue, but we intend to hold ongoing consultations to ensure that a satisfactory statutory scheme can be brought before the House.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Last night I informed the chairman of the compensation tribunal, Mr Justice Egan, of the Government's proposed changes and I propose to hold detailed discussions with him at the earliest possible date to ensure his experience, and that of his colleagues who sat on the tribunal, is available when <Col N="1223" /> decisions on improving the scheme are being made.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have also asked the BTSB to make known forthwith its position on liability on all outstanding cases in light of the report's findings.  I met the chairman and chief executive of the BTSB yesterday and requested them to let me know their position.  I will put that request in writing today and ask for the support of the House.  I am confident from my discussions yesterday that a favourable reply will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>In regard to the National Drugs Advisory Board the tribunal concluded that:</P>
      <P>In the period 1975 to 1994, successive Ministers for Health and the Department of Health failed adequately and appropriately to supervise the NDAB in the exercise of its functions concerning the licensing of the manufacture of products by the BTSB and the authorisation of products by the BTSB, in that they failed to provide to the NDAB the appropriate resources for carrying out those functions.</P>
      <P>The tribunal found that the levels of staff, particularly on the technical side, including inspectors, was inadequate.  Consequently, the NDAB did not carry out regular and adequate inspections of the BTSB.  While the tribunal found that such inspections would not have revealed the particular breaches which gave rise to the infection of anti-D, except by some form of chance, it states that:</P>
      <P>If those resources had been provided and if there had been appropriate inspections and investigations, it is possible that the reactions of the recipients of Anti-D in the period 1976 and 1977 to the contaminated product, would have been revealed and that the persons involved in the BTSB would have made further investigations than they did if they were aware of the likelihood of further inspection and interrogation.</P>
      <P>As a result of the steps I have taken in the past two years, the position is very different now.  On foot of the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, the NDAB has been replaced by the Irish Medicines Board.  Under statute all the statutory licensing functions previously held by the Minister for Health have been transferred to it to eliminate the unnecessary additional layer of administrative processes which contributed to the backlogs in the licensing system in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major management consultancy exercise was commissioned in 1995 to identify the staffing, systems and operational procedures which the new board would require to carry out its functions properly, and the previous organisation has been restructured in line with the recommendations which emerged.  In particular, the licensing fees <Col N="1224" /> charged to industry have been set at a more appropriate level to ensure the board has adequate resources to carry out its functions thoroughly, efficiently and without undue delay. The organisation is now driven by a streamlined board, with a management rather than a technical orientation.  It has also been relocated in new premises since those used by the old NDAB were inadequate and a hindrance to increasing the efficiency of the organisation.  In short, since coming into office I have addressed and resolved the organisational and resourcing problems which the tribunal found to have beset the NDAB for the previous 20 years.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the supervision of the BTSB by the Department of Health since February 1994.  Members will be aware that the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, and myself gave a full account of our supervision to the tribunal of inquiry.  In chapter 13, the report of the tribunal deals with my response and that of my Department and predecessor on the hepatitis C issue.  This response included the establishment of many programmes and schemes to support the victims of this terrible tragedy and to alleviate as far as possible the human suffering occasioned by the hepatitis C infection of the anti-D product and the blood supply.</P>
    <P>A national blood screening programme was announced by my predecessor, Minister Howlin, on 21 February 1994, to screen all women who had received the anti-D product to identify those who had been infected with hepatitis C.  For persons diagnosed positive for hepatitis C under the screening programme, acute hospital services were put in place in special units in six designated hospitals: Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and St. James's Hospital in Dublin, Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.  These services, provided under the Health Act, 1970, are free of charge and include access to both in-patient and out-patient treatment, as required. Special funding has been, and will continue to be, provided by the Department of Health for those services.  In 1996, a special sum of £2 million was provided and a similar sum will be allocated for 1997 in the near future.  The tribunal of inquiry has concluded that: &ldquo;The overall picture appears to be that treatment as far as treatment has been developed by the medical profession in general for this unfortunate disease was adequately provided in these units&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The special secondary health care services are included in the health care package agreed with the groups representing persons with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal in detail with most of the other examinations of decisions made by Minister Howlin or myself, but it is important to refer briefly to the report's conclusions on them. The tribunal of inquiry stated that the <i>ex-gratia</i> expenses scheme has apparently worked &ldquo;reasonably satisfactorily&rdquo;.  It also concluded that the decision of the then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, to set up an expert group was &ldquo;an <Col N="1225" /> adequate and appropriate response to the problem of trying to find out what actually happened in regard to this infection of anti-D&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, and I were accused of misleading the House on a number of occasions.  It was widely alleged both inside and outside this House that I engaged in a cover-up by failing to immediately set up a tribunal of inquiry in March 1996 when laboratory test request forms and quantitation reports, indicating the clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis discovered by the BTSB in the action being brought against them by the late Mrs. Brigid McCole, became public.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, and I informed the Dáil that these test request forms did not constitute any fundamental difference in the information available with regard to the wrongful use of patient X's plasma. Many Members claimed these quantitation reports were of fundamental importance and altered the entire position concerning the events of 1976 and 1977.  We were both trenchantly accused by many Members of deliberately misleading the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The tribunal concludes that the quantitation information &ldquo;did not constitute new, dominant or fundamental medical evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;did not form a foundation for any particular conclusion which would not have been reached without them in regard to the general wrongdoing in the use of the plasma for patient X&rdquo;.  It further concludes that my decision not to set up a tribunal of inquiry at that time &ldquo;was an adequate and appropriate reaction to the facts as they then were&rdquo;.  In addition, the tribunal indicated that &ldquo;the attitude taken by myself and Minister O'Shea in reply to the Dáil Questions in relation to this issue would appear to have been correct&rdquo;.  In fairness, I ask those Members who made those charges against me and Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, both inside and outside the House to withdraw them. The tribunal concluded from the evidence of the communications between the Department and the BTSB with regard to the targeted lookback programme that at all relevant times it would appear to indicate an adequate and appropriate reaction.</P>
    <P>I announced on 12 September 1995 the national optional testing programme.  This programme was introduced to ensure that all recipients of blood transfusions and blood products who might have become infected with hepatitis C through the receipt of transfusions or blood products were given the option of being tested free of charge.</P>
    <P>The health care package agreed with the representative groups includes primary health care services as provided for in the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996.  The tribunal concludes:</P>
    <P>On balance the position would appear to the tribunal to be that the health care package, when finally provided, was appropriate and that it was, when provided, adequate but that some element, although not a great one, in the delay in bringing such a package into statutory <Col N="1226" /> form was not an adequate response to the particular urgency which attached to that task.</P>
    <P>In relation to this conclusion, I would like to outline the timing of the various stages of the passage of the Bill in both Houses of the Oireachtas and the consultation and arrangements for its implementation which took place.  This is an important item because when a Bill comes to the Dáil it becomes the possession of the House and Deputies can judge for themselves whether the delay was undue.</P>
    <P>In November 1995 negotiations took place with Positive Action on the health care services and on 4 December 1995 the Government authorised the drafting of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995.  On 11 December 1995 I sought Government approval for the text of the Bill and on 12 December 1995 the Government approved the publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Second Stage debate on the Bill took place in this House on 27 and 28 February 1996.  During March and April further negotiations with Positive Action and other representative groups on amendments to the Bill took place.  On 8 May 1996 the Committee Stage debate took place in the Select Committee on Social Affairs and Report and Final Stages were taken in the Dáil on 30 May 1996.  The Second Stage debate in the Seanad was on 13 June 1996 and the Committee and Final Stages in the Seanad on 20 June 1996.</P>
    <P>In July and August 1996 negotiations took place, including negotiations regarding fees, with professional organisations, GPs and health boards on the implementation of the provisions of the Act.  Consultations with the representative groups on the design of application forms, health cards and arrangements for service delivery followed. On 28 August 1996 I signed the commencement order bringing the Act into effect on 23 September 1996.  I will leave it to the House to decide whether that was an undue delay but I have pointed out to the House the finding of the tribunal in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>On 17 December 1996 I informed the House of my intention to establish an optional HIV testing programme, offering screening to blood transfusion and blood product recipients who might be at risk, however small that risk might be.  Before commencing this programme, it is absolutely essential that the risk, if any, involved for recipients, according to the year they received the transfusion or blood product and depending on the risk, if any, of particular products, must be determined, as far as possible, so as to enable each recipient to make a fully informed decision, in consultation with his or her general practitioner, in relation to availing of screening.  I am hopeful that the preparations for the optional HIV screening programme, which are well advanced, will be completed in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the HIV targeted lookback is continuing.</P>
    <P>On 28 January 1997 I informed the House of the Government's intention to establish a tribunal of inquiry to examine specific urgent matters <Col N="1227" /> of public importance, first, the HIV infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB and, second, such further matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation in the light of the report of the hepatitis C tribunal.</P>
    <P>I informed the House it would not be possible to submit the terms of reference to both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval until the report of the tribunal of inquiry had been submitted to me, as it would not be possible to say what matters of urgent public importance would remain unaddressed. As Members are aware, the report was submitted to me on 6 March 1997 and the detailed terms of reference will be finalised, in consultation with the Irish Haemophilia Society, at an early date.  The success of the hepatitis C tribunal of inquiry can, in part, be ascribed to its very specific terms of reference.  Accordingly, great care will be taken to ensure the terms of reference of this proposed tribunal will be very tightly framed to address very specific issues.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, the Government has agreed at my request to refer the report of the tribunal of inquiry to the DPP.  This issue was argued before the tribunal of inquiry and the tribunal considered it would not be appropriate for the tribunal to make such a referral.  However, because of the enormity of the tragedy and the contents of the report I have, with the authority of the Government, referred the report to the DPP.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House who have served in Government must bear some responsibility for the events which have occurred.  The tribunal comments adversely on the failure of successive Ministers for Health to adequately fund the NDAB between 1975 and 1994.</P>
    <P>I am aware that no member of the Progressive Democrats has held office as Minister for Health. The Progressive Democratss, however, were in Government between 1989 and 1992 when some the most shocking events occurred, namely, the lack of action when the Middlesex letter clearly informed the BTSB that patient X had suffered from hepatitis C and the use of patient Y's plasma when she had tested positive.  They must also bear collective Cabinet responsibility for the inadequate funding of the NDAB during their period in office.  Spokespersons opposite should remember this before they launch political attacks on me and the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin.</P>
    <P>I welcome and invite contributions from all sides of the House regarding the management and delivery of the blood supply service.  What I would not welcome would be unfounded or ill-advised headline seeking or sweeping statements about matters requiring clear medical direction or medical expertise.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Finlay has produced a report of great clarity and candour.  It does not shirk any of the hard questions posed in the terms of reference, and it has thrown clear light and imposed <Col N="1228" /> order on medical, administrative and legal controversies which were previously shrouded in mystery and confusion.  I welcome it unreservedly.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that we will debate these issues again in this House.  I hope, however, that the acceptance of the motion in my name by this House when it votes on Tuesday will mark a significant step forward in dealing with these tragic events.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Board (BTSB)&rdquo; and insert the following:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;condemns the Minister for Health for failing, yet again, to make the victims a first priority, following the publication of the report;</P>
      <P>condemns the political handling of the scandal by Ministers Howlin and Noonan;</P>
      <P>condemns the refusal by Minister Noonan at the time of the establishment of the Judicial Inquiry to allow an investigation into how the State and State agencies acted when legal proceedings were instituted by the late Mrs. McCole;</P>
      <P>calls on the Government to give an unreserved apology to all victims of the Hepatitis C scandal;</P>
      <P>calls on the Government to make a full admission of liability to persons infected with Hepatitis C through the wrongdoing of the State and State agencies; and</P>
      <P>calls on the Government to amend the terms of reference of the <i>ad hoc</i> Compensation Tribunal to provide for</P>
      <P>(a)  awards of aggravated and/or exemplary damages;</P>
      <P>(b)  a right of appeal to the High Court; and</P>
      <P>(c)  a procedure whereby victims (including victims since deceased) who have accepted awards from the State can apply for aggravated and/or exemplary damages in addition to sums already awarded to them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in putting this amended motion to the House, has made a significant concession. It has conceded something which, as a matter of principle and policy, it refused to concede since this debacle happened under the stewardship of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated he has agreed to the setting up of a statutory tribunal. That is a major victory for the victims who have to suffer as a result of the criminal negligence of a State agency.  However, let it not be seen as a generous response proactively provided by this Government.  It is, in fact, a somersault of a huge magnitude, given the Minister's stated position and the policy of this Administration when he <Col N="1229" /> was questioned on this issue at the tribunal some weeks ago.</P>

      <P>On page 160 of the transcript of the tribunal report the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was asked by counsel:</P>
      <P>In relation to your dealings with Positive Action, could I ask you about the period in November 1995 when you were in negotiation with them?  Would you agree with me that at that point in time they were seeking a statutory basis for any compensation provision?</P>
      <P>The Minister replied that was correct; it was one of their requests.  In response to further questioning, he confirmed it had not been conceded and that it was his position, as a matter of policy, not to concede it.  When asked if he would agree that in his dealings with Positive Action he conveyed to them at all times that he was prepared to give them everything besides a statutory scheme of compensation, the Minister replied he did not think that was correct.  Asked if he had indicated to Positive Action that all issues in relation to compensation were negotiable, save the issue of a statute, the Minister replied that in the formal negotiations that took place between himself, the Department and Positive Action it was said that there were issues of principle which were not negotiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has now conceded the principle he claimed was not negotiable as a matter of policy by his Administration and during his tenure as Minister.  It has been dragged out of him by the courageous women who fought the valiant fight and won their battle this morning.  I salute them but I do not salute the Minister or the Government.  It is to the Minister's discredit that since November 1995, he denied them the right to have the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis where they could get an admission of liability <Col N="1230" /> by the State that they were fundamentally wronged and that they and their families have suffered a grave injustice.</P>
    <P>One year ago, during Private Members' time, my party sought the agreement of this House to a statutory compensation tribunal.  Those on the other side of the House, who are now trying to cover their chances, voted it down.  Let nobody tell this House, least of all the Minister or any supporter of the Government, that this amounts to a major breakthrough or concession by this Administration.  It was dragged out of it.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the tribunal circumscribed the ability of Mr. Justice Finlay to make any comment on issues relating to political accountability in this House or the primary responsibility of Ministers for Health to answer this House for the way they carried out their responsibilities during their tenure of office throughout this crisis.  He was circumscribed in his comments in terms of determining the adequacy or otherwise of those responses by reference to the strict terms of reference insisted upon by the Minister.  These included the circumstances in which anti-D was contaminated by hepatitis C; the circumstances of what the BTSB knew; the implications and adequacy of the action it took and the adequacy of its response to the letter dated 16 December 1991; when the NDAB supervisory role was properly carried out; whether supervision of the BTSB and NDAB was adequate and appropriate, given the responsibility of the Minister and any other relevant circumstance.</P>
    <P>However, the issues of what political actions were taken, what political strategies were devised, how they were implemented and who insisted that they be implemented were outside the terms of reference of the report.  Anybody who seeks to evade those political responsibilities will find no home in the report because it is this House that, having established the tribunal and received the report by Mr. Justice Finlay, will decide on the terms of political accountability. We will do so bearing in mind that the present Administration took up office on the basis that it would set higher standards of accountability than had prevailed in any previous Government since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The basis on which the tribunal was established was such as not to address the political accountability issue.  This was deliberately done by the Minister when he delimited the terms of reference of the tribunal to exclude Question 5 in the McCole family's letter of 8 October 1996, which got to the heart of the matter.  It stated:</P>
    <P>In their letter of 20th September 1996, the Blood Transfusion Service Board did two things, they admitted liability and apologised but only in the context of a threat that were she (Mrs. McCole) to proceed with a case for aggravated/exemplary damages and not to succeed, they would pursue her for costs.  What was the justification for this threat?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> This question was excluded from consideration by the tribunal.  What justification was given by the strategists who were devising the defence by the State in the Brigid McCole case?  What was the justification for threatening to pursue that dying woman for costs when she insisted on having her day in court?</P>
    <P>That question was not put to the tribunal and was not included in its terms of reference.  All on the other side of the House, the so-called political progressives who wished to ensure that the women's rights were vindicated, voted down an amendment moved by my party and supported by others that this question be included in the terms of reference.  It was excluded because it would have meant that Mr. Justice Finlay would have had to investigate deep in the labyrinth of the Department, the Minister's Office and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to ascertain who gave the political directions for that strategy to be devised and implemented?  This was the issue that heralded the public concern and outrage when people recognised that a dying citizen of the State, seeking to vindicate her rights, was being threatened with every bullyboy legal tactic that could be devised by those who claimed they had a defence when they knew that there was no defence, as is now admitted by the Minister in his proposal to establish a statutory compensation tribunal which will allow for the aggravated and/or exemplary damages which that woman sought in court and which she could not get at the compensation tribunal because the Minister ensured that such an issue could not come before it.</P>
    <P>The critical issue is in the question &ldquo;what was the justification for the threat&rdquo;?  It was raised because it asks who was the political person who knew that the BTSB had no defence yet still allowed it to pursue a legal strategy that included every bullyboy tactic in the book?</P>
    <P>The tribunal report is a largely technical one. It examines the logistics of how the affair happened and was allowed to happen.  It will be clear to those who bother to read the transcripts of the tribunal that Mr. Justice Finlay had to intervene on many occasions to say who was right or what was said in the Dáil or whatever was not within the remit of his consideration.  He was specifically prescribed and delimited by the nine terms of reference insisted upon by the Minister.  The issue of political accountability remains to be investigated and concluded upon.  I will make my contribution in so far as I have competence to do so on such matters.</P>
    <P>Regarding what the report has shown, what we know about the approach and behaviour of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in the McCole legal action, his insults to the victims which led them to walk out of the gallery of this House and his deliberate exclusion of Question No. 5 in the McCole family's letter, it should be a matter of personal honour now for him to go.  The limiting of the tribunal's remit to technical issues also explains why the Minister, Deputy Howlin, escapes the criticism <Col N="1232" /> he justly deserves.  Unless the terms of reference were narrowed, why would Mr. Justice Finlay have ignored the fact that the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, misled his Cabinet colleagues in an <i>aide mémoire</i> to the Government of 9 March 1994?  In a memo circulated to the Government the Minister, Deputy Howlin, failed to mention he had been informed two weeks previously that there was also a problem about anti-D infection in 1991.  I was at the meeting and to my certain recollection no oral evidence relating to that matter was given at it.  That was not mentioned in the memo which states &ldquo;a problem does exist for 1977 but indicates a low prevalence of antibody positive for hepatitis C among women who received anti-D in years other than 1977&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This evidence of the infection of the current batch of anti-D, which was a matter of major public importance, was also not included in the press releases issued by the Minister in February-March 1994.  Not only did the Minister, Deputy Howlin, mislead his Cabinet colleagues, he also withheld critical information from the victims, the public, the Dáil and the GPs.  The consequence of that withholding of information was that victims were questioned about their sexual behaviour and partners.  As a colleague of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and someone who was present that day, I regard it as an outrage that that information was withheld.  What the tribunal has revealed about its actions, exposing an unbelievable incompetence, merits his resignation also.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Howlin, is a member of a party that walked out of a previous Government on the basis that his party claimed the Dáil had been misled.  Now a Minister from his party has been shown to have misled the Government, the Dáil, the victims, the medical profession and the public and he expects to get commendation. The Tánaiste has demanded of others that there be accountability to this House.  He said that giving full information and truth is the essence of Government, yet a Minister of his party has been proved to have misled at every level of the State. The Minister, Deputy Howlin, should consider his position as a member of the Government in the light of these damning revelations.</P>
    <P>It is galling to hear the Tánaiste, the prefect of the high moral ground, claim such exoneration for his ministerial colleague, Deputy Howlin.  Political accountability is a matter for Dáil Éireann, and will remain so, and not for his whim.  Wishful thinking by the Tánaiste will not change the facts or excuse the failings of Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, in this abomination against the people.</P>
    <P>The claim by the Tánaiste during yesterday's Order of Business reflects the political arrogance of the rainbow coalition.  His arrogance is a perfect mirror of the institutional arrogance the BTSB displayed throughout this controversy. When the Government came to office it claimed to aspire to higher standards than any other Government in the history of the State.  It promised to offer the victims of this tragedy fair compensation. <Col N="1233" /> The then Taoiseach said on 16 November 1994: &ldquo;We need a new Government that will reform the institutions of this State to make every Member of this House who holds office truly accountable.&rdquo;  On the same day Deputy Spring said:</P>
    <P>If the House were to accept that a Minister would never be accountable to the Dáil without direct culpability on his or her part, the principles of accountability would wither away. Without accountability, the value of a parliamentary democracy would be fatally undermined.</P>
    <P>Where has the accountability of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, the leaders of our country, been throughout this affair?  Where has their concern been expressed?  What have they ever said publicly about the way this scandal has been handled? Where have they been throughout the political chaos of this crisis and scandal and what about the quality of leadership they promised?  The Taoiseach has displayed the same indifference as some of the chief culprits in the BTSB, otherwise how in the name of the people could scandalous tactics be used to try to browbeat the late Brigid McCole?  How else could there have been approval for an attempt to use the statute of limitations for a challenge to the date for an early hearing as she lay dying in her bed, a threat from the Chief State Solicitor that the case would be challenged all the way, the making of a lodgement to raise the threat of costs and an attempt to get the McColes to sign off any claims they might have to damages after their mother's death?  Such was the stonewalling, the barracking and the blocking.  That political decision was made by this administration from top to bottom and every one of its members is responsible for it.  How could the Government shore up the position of the BTSB in the full knowledge that it had no defence?  For that reason alone the Minister for Health should be considering his position.  The old maxim, that he who does not learn from history is doomed to repeat it, is an apt one for this Minister.</P>
    <P>As we debate this matter the newspapers report that the State is engaged in McCole Mark II.  Another victim of this awful scandal is being put through the wringer by the State despite everything that emerged in the tribunal report. Obviously, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has not learned anything from the McCole case and he persists in allowing offensive legal strategies to be pursued in the name of the State and, by extension, in the name of the people.  At least the Government had the sense last night to withdraw its offensive holding motion.  Fianna Fáil welcomes the U-turn by the Government as signalled by the new motion submitted by the Minister.  It follows our amendment calling on the Government to amend the scheme of compensation to provide for aggravated and/or exemplary damages. The original motion tabled by the Government was a disreputable credit seeking minimalist <Col N="1234" /> one and it was right to withdraw it.  However, we note the Government's new motion is vague and conditional and promises only to reappraise with a view to amending the scheme of compensation. The Minister has been more clear in his statement this morning than was apparent from the motion last night.  I have again stated and I will reiterate that was a principle upon which he said there would never be a concession.  He conceded this morning and it was dragged out of him like everything else that these extraordinary people have done in the course of this outrageous scandal.</P>
    <P>Our amendment, which we will be pressing, provides for the amendment of the scheme of compensation rather than aspirations in that regard.  We call for a full admission of liability by the Government rather than what is being attempted in this motion, to pass the buck to the BTSB as the Minister has done here.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, persists with this fiction of building Chinese walls between him and the BTSB.  Under the regulations establishing the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the Minister can take over any legal action being taken by the BTSB.  What he proposes in paragraph (e) of his motion is a cop-out, where he seeks to support the Minister's request to the BTSB to make known its position on liability in all outstanding cases in the light of the findings.  His attitude is to let the public know the BTSB is liable but to keep him out of the fray.  That seems to be what paragraph (e) is about, but it will not wash.  The blind spot remains.  When will he learn?  When will he accept his responsibility as Minister of a Department and a member of the Government in this mess?  The Government did not signal that it will give an unreserved apology to the victims.  Promises of reappraisal are no substitute for a fundamental change of attitude recognising the just cause of the victims' concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has been called on by the victims to give commitments rather than vague promises.  The victims and the Opposition are all too well aware that the Minister made many promises in the past &mdash; which have not been honoured &mdash; to the victims of hepatitis C.  The controversy surrounding the hepatitis C scandal has meant that the human suffering and misery caused by the scandal is often forgotten by those who are not victims.  Men, women and children have had their lives destroyed by the indifference, incompetence and recklessly criminal actions of a handful of experts at the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister, Deputy Noonan, begins any celebrations he should recall the pain and misery suffered by the victims.  More than 1,000 mothers caught hepatitis C from contaminated blood products.  Those mothers contracted a serious and potentially life threatening virus for which there is no effective cure.  Half of those women have the full virus, while more than one dozen children of the mothers and some partners have also been infected.  More than 500 others have been infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusions.  People who thought they <Col N="1235" /> were getting a new lease of life with a transfusion of blood were infected with a serious virus.  Those people include women at childbirth, transfusions administered to children, car accident victims, those who received transfusions during serious operations and those with rare blood diseases. Haemophiliacs and kidney dialysis patients have also been victims of this virus.</P>
    <P>According to the virus reference laboratory at University College Dublin, up to 75 per cent of those infected with hepatitis C developed chronic hepatitis.  Hepatitis C is a most uncertain disease and there is no known treatment available.  The type of hepatitis C which most of those infected through anti-D have is the least responsive to the standard Interferon treatment.  About one in five patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection develop cirrhosis of the liver.  Those with hepatitis C antibodies continue to undergo testing and it is not known how many of them have a hidden virus which current tests cannot discover.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis C infection is associated with several diseases not directly related to the liver.  Side effects experienced include rheumatoid arthritis, extreme fatigue, eye problems and auto-immune diseases.  Hepatitis C is often a silent disease and many patients do not know they are sick until they encounter irreversible liver damage.  Hepatitis C infection also almost universally recurs in a newly transplanted liver.</P>
    <P>Apart from the infection, victims have encountered many other problems, including difficulties in personal relationships.  Young people have had a particular difficulty and many victims have not told even their closest family of their infection. Work has also been a problem.  Some people have been forced to stop work or their partners have had to stop work to mind children.  This has forced people to resort to social welfare entitlements. Others have had difficulty applying for jobs as infected persons are significantly disadvantaged if there is a medical examination prior to engagement.  Promotions also go out the window as the person does not have the energy to compete.  Life assurance is impossible to get, mortgages are restricted and leave from work is unpaid.  The treatment of victims is by injection into the abdomen.  This is painful and causes serious side effects.  The presence of the injecting materials in the fridge of a victim's home is a constant reminder for families of the presence of the virus in their lives.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Health has finally acknowledged, the hepatitis C nightmare has been the worst in the history of the State.  It has been a nightmare because the health system caused the disease and infected healthy people.  As well as breaching the BTSB standards, these people ignored the warnings from tests and from GPs. There was recognition that a problem existed but there was a scandalous failure to act and people must be held politically responsible for that.  This is expected in a democracy worth its name.</P>
    <P>The most abhorrent fact to emerge from the judicial inquiry was that the BTSB was so aware of the problem in 1977 that somebody decided to keep a list of the destinations of the infected <Col N="1236" /> batch 238.  This list was to facilitate the recall because they knew there was a serious problem but nobody shouted `stop'.  Dr. Jack O'Riordan, Dr. Terry Walsh or Mrs. Cecily Cunningham did not shout `stop'.  In 1991, Dr. Emer Lawlor did not shout `stop' when the Middlesex letter arrived.  Dr. Lawlor told the tribunal: &ldquo;It just totally slipped my mind.&rdquo;  Approximately 30 people would not have the virus if that fax from Middlesex had been acted on.</P>
    <P>When the scandal emerged in 1994, and up to now, there has been a serious degree of failure in the Department of Health.  Yet there is little criticism in the tribunal report of the way the Ministers at the head of the Department dealt with the crisis once it broke.  There is a reason for this.  It is excluded from the terms of reference in the context of Mr. Justice Finlay's interpretation of them and his many interventions during the tribunal when counsel sought to broach that subject. It is not a document from which Ministers can claim political exoneration as the open, accountable and transparent Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs tried to arrogantly suggest on the Order of Business yesterday.  The tribunal is the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan's inquiry.  It was a good tribunal but the report is confined because the inquiry was established on very narrow terms.  The result is a largely technical report.</P>
    <P>The Minister's failure to learn from this scandal is also clear in this week's revelation in the catalogue of revelations about the incompetence of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Once again the necessity to restore confidence is highlighted. This confidence has been shattered by the continuing series of bungles which culminated in this week's revelation that a hepatitis C victim was called to donate blood.  This latest disclosure is most remarkable and it is complete nonsense to blame it solely on an antiquated computer system. Yet again, there is to be no accountability.</P>
    <P>There should be just one confidential master list which should indicate to BTSB officials the names of people who should and should not be donors.  There should not be five lists that need to be cross-checked against one another.  The confidentiality of victims must be maintained but it is possible to develop a fail-safe system and this must be done as a priority.  The inability of the BTSB and its supervisors, the Minister for Health and his Department, to manage something so simple is shocking.  It beggars belief.</P>
    <P>The blood bank and the Minister are trying to make it appear as if everything is fine now. However, it is only today, three months after the event, that the woman involved will get a letter of apology.  This episode and the way it has been handled leads one to believe the same defensiveness, the same arrogance and the same cavalier and outrageous conduct still applies at the blood bank.  Based on what the Minister for Health did yesterday at his meeting with the BTSB management, it appears he is still willing to condone it.</P>
    <P>This episode is not an isolated one that has occurred under the supposedly reformed blood bank.  Last year it emerged that the blood bank knew a Kilkenny nurse was infected with HIV <Col N="1237" /> from a contaminated blood transfusion in 1985 but failed to inform her.  She found out while she was in a foreign country on holiday.  The blood bank, in an attempt to trace the batches of HIV infected blood products that infected the nurse, wrote to hospitals but deliberately omitted to say that the problem related to HIV.  A separate tribunal of inquiry into this affair is to begin soon.</P>
    <P>There has been the revelation that the BTSB knows of people who received infected batches of blood or blood products who have not been contacted by the blood bank to attend for testing. A woman infected in the 1970s only discovered recently she had the hepatitis C virus when she went for testing.  It was discovered that the blood bank had on file the fact that she received a suspect batch, but had not bothered to trace her.</P>
    <P>I recently asked the Minister by way of a parliamentary question to indicate how many people have been identified who are still alive and who received potentially hepatitis C infected blood or blood products but have not been contacted. Despite the fact that the blood bank did major research for the tribunal of inquiry, the Minister told me the information was not available because the BTSB is still collating it.  Given everything that has happened, surely the Minister must ask such questions of the BTSB.  If the BTSB is aware there are more than 335 people who are now deceased who received potentially infected batches, surely it must have worked on those still living?</P>
    <P>As I said previously, and as was said by the victims and the BTSB at the tribunal of inquiry, although in a recent interview its chief executive did not appear to be aware of it, there is now a need for a national study to establish the true number infected.  However, there is a much deeper question; if the blood bank cannot be trusted to even get donor selection right, how can people have faith in its more complex operations? In its evidence to the tribunal, the BTSB made much of its new system for donor screening.  Yesterday we saw at first hand that this system is not fail safe.  The Minister needs to act quickly on the recommendations of the tribunal on establishing a new blood bank.  A new culture needs to be introduced and more staff should be recruited.  I understand the establishment of the BTSB at a new site is some time away due to the lease on Pelican House which lasts up to the end of the decade.  The transition needs to happen faster and the Minister must make it a priority.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, and his predecessor, Deputy Howlin, made much of the actions they took with regard to the BTSB. The tribunal supported the current Minister, for Health in his work in reforming the blood bank, using words such as &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; and &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to describe his actions.  In the context of this latest episode, apart from the other ones in the last year, this conclusion of the tribunal is not correct. I say this because the upshot of all the episodes is that the public does not, unfortunately, have confidence in the BTSB.  While, there are still many donors, &mdash; thankfully, citizens want to <Col N="1238" /> supply blood to ensure there is a blood supply for the health services &mdash; the real measure of confidence is that of the public and of recipients of blood and blood products.  These people are still nervous and the reason for that lies at the door of the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, and the Government.  People do not have confidence because there is no reason to have faith in the Minister for Health or the Government's ability to stem the haemorrhage of confidence in the BTSB.</P>
    <P>This time the Minister for Health cannot try to pass the buck and play the despicable political blame game he has tried so often.  All these episodes at the BTSB have occurred on the Minister, Deputy Noonan's watch.  He told us things have changed under the new management he put into Pelican House.  I hope that is the case.  Improvements have been made, but how could there not have been?  The Minister is accountable because these events happened during his tenure, his management and his supervision.</P>
    <P>Once the expert group report was published, the Government thought it had got away with it. It was the ultimate cover-up and it thought the escape was executed.</P>

      <P>It argued that the expert group had given the full information and there was no need for further inquiries or questions.  It was one of the most cynical acts of any Government in the history of the State.  That cynicism was apparent even in the original motion put before the House by the Government.  A Government seeking commendation for sending a computer disk to the printers is a new low.  Given the Minister's inability to supervise the BTSB, we should be grateful that the report arrived on the right day and without major cockup.  However, even when it was printed, the Minister, as our amendment points out, failed yet again to make the victims a first priority, giving just one copy to the executive committees of the victims' action groups.  There were boxes of copies in the Sycamore Room that day at the press conference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when the news management began and the spin doctors told us how well everybody had done in relation to this affair.  Victims waiting in a room in Dublin, who represented 1,200 victims, received one copy of the report delivered by a courier on a bike.  That is what is happening on the watch of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government motion was cynical in relation to the taking on board of the recommendations of the judicial inquiry, the most significant of which relates to moving the blood bank to new premises.  That proposal was first put to the Minister in February 1995 by the British Medicines Control Agency.  It was taken on board <Col N="1239" /> at that time but not highlighted.  Presumably this was done so that at some time in the future, such as now, when the Minister needed to appear positive he could announce the setting up of the blood bank on a new site.  That recommendation must be acted upon this time.</P>
    <P>The recommendation to establish the blood users consumer council cannot be implemented fast enough.  Haemophiliacs and other regular users of the blood supply must have had a grim day on Tuesday last when the latest BTSB cockup was announced.  Our amendment condemns the political handling of the scandal by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  While both Ministers gloated when the report was published it was soon recognised that the conclusions of the Finlay Tribunal, in relation to both Ministers, were limited and even where they exist will not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that Justice Finlay at one and the same time criticises the Ministers and yet finds they acted properly.  This can only be because he was not allowed to make findings on political accountability.  Since the publication of the report both Ministers have been keen to give the impression they have landed on their feet. Anyone who knows anything about this affair is aware that the political responses of the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, were chaotic and it is nonsense for them to claim otherwise.</P>
    <P>In Minister Howlin's case the tribunal notes serious failures on his part.  They were put in muted language but were nevertheless serious. His failures include the fact that he left the State response in the hands of those who caused it &mdash; a pretty basic error; he did not inform the Dáil, the Government, the GPs or the public that the 1991 infection had also occurred.  I disagree seriously with the tribunal on this point.  It is extraordinary there is no criticism of the Minister's failure to disclose such a central fact.  How could it have been adequate, as Justice Finlay has said, to withhold this information?  The President of the Irish Medical Organisation has said that if the Department of Health and the Minister had received information that raised a significant question about the safety of any products he would consider it wrong not to have informed the medical profession.  There is a persistent belief that only the 1977 infection occurred because this information was withheld at the start.  This may explain the reason there are still missing victims as people are not aware that in 1994 the current batch of anti-D was also infected.  The former Minister, Deputy Howlin, withheld this information even when questioned by victims about it in June 1994.  In the transcript he said: &ldquo;I may have given partial information&rdquo;.  This is from a Minister who had a reputation for being open, transparent, competent and willing.  When asked about it he did not answer.  Who will be accountable for that?  As a Cabinet colleague at the time <Col N="1240" /> I am disgusted the Minister was making top of the head decisions about a killer disease.</P>

      <P>So far as we are concerned it was wrong not to include that information about the 1991 infection in the <i>aide mémoire</i> in specific terms.  Neither did he mention it in the press release.  The Minister failed to step in when the victims were getting the run around from the BTSB about circulating other people with hepatitis C.  The Minister should have stepped in to sort out the matter.  He failed to respond adequately to the approach by liver specialists in relation to their concerns and the treatment the victims were receiving.  He failed to kick start the lookback programme which did not commence until 1995, and even then was limited, even though he had information from Dr. Boothman in the Department of Health, within weeks of the screening programme beginning, that one would have to go beyond the cohort of anti-D recipients between 1970 and 1994.  The medical evidence in his Department confirmed that and no lookback programme commenced under the tenure of the former Minister, Deputy Howlin.</P>
      <P>The Minister failed to make considered judgments on the advice he was getting especially in relation to independent counselling for the victims. The explanations he has given on that issue do not amount to much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A botched job was made of the recall of the anti-D products.  The former Minister, Deputy Howlin, did not check on it at any time and did not ask if it had been recalled successively.  Ten doses of the infected product were administered during this time with one of these still not traced. He is criticised strongly for this in the report of the tribunal.  Both he and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, are criticised in relation to the speed at which the health care package was put in place. He knew the BTSB was not co-operating with the expert group but he did nothing about it.  His antennae never raised when the BTSB gave him wrong information on the FDA licence for the replacement of anti-D products.  His concern for himself rather than the victims was clear during the famous absolutely shafted conversation we heard from the tribunal.  None of these scandalous failings of the Minister would have come to light but for the tribunal.  It has been said in this saga that the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, <Col N="1241" /> has shown the moral fibre of a second-hand car salesman, although that is probably doing an injustice to second-hand car salesmen.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the extraordinary testimony of the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, at the tribunal outlining his approach during his tenure to this &ldquo;unprecedented scandal&rdquo;&mdash; to use his own words.  He became Minister for Health on 12 January 1993.  He was over a year in the job when the famous letter of 17 February 1994 arrived in the Department from the BTSB.  The question is what happened after that date?  The former Minister, Deputy Howlin, agreed with Mr. Nugent, counsel for the tribunal, about what he had to do as Minister to deal with the situation.  He had to ensure there was no further infection; find a replacement anti-D product and ensure it was obtained; establish who already had been infected; sustain confidence in the blood bank and blood supplies; arrange treatment, counselling and help for the victims; establish what had happened and deal with the manifest problems in the BTSB.</P>
    <P>Let us take them one by one.  The way to ensure there was no further infection was to withdraw the product.  The former Minister, Deputy Howlin, said on 18 February &ldquo;it was one of the gravest issues that had arisen in recent times&rdquo;.  He allowed the BTSB to arrange for the withdrawal of the product but the Department did not oversee this operation nor did it instigate any cross-checking procedures to ensure it was withdrawn properly.  He initiated a publicity campaign directed towards alerting people to an infection in 1977 even though he admits that from the very beginning, during that first weekend, there was at least a suspicion that contaminated anti-D products made in subsequent years were still in circulation.</P>
    <P>Subsequently he did not inform the public that, as of July 1994, eight women had been treated with pre-February 1994 products supposed to have been withdrawn.  Who is to be accountable for that?  Remarkably, he states he had no knowledge of this fact until after the expert group had published its report in April 1995, some 14 months later.  His first priority was to withdraw the product, yet he did not know for 14 months subsequently that there were eight people who had been contaminated by pre-1994 products which he understood had been withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The Minister allowed the BTSB to arrange to withdraw the product but the Department did not oversee this operation nor did it instigate any cross-checking procedures.  In <Col N="1242" /> addition, he initiated the publicity campaign straight away.</P>
      <P>Remarkably the former Minister states he had no knowledge of this fact until after the report of the expert group was published in April 1995. Had he known he would have asked for a review of every single component or issue of anti-D to ensure it was completely withdrawn.  He did not know of this fact during his tenure because he did not put in place any information system between his office and the BTSB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in Government at the time and will draw a comparison, not a very good one because here we are talking about people whose lives have been put at risk.  It would be like saying to me, as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications during the crisis in Aer Lingus that there would not be any communication between me and the chairman of Aer Lingus, Mr. Bernie Cahill. Is anyone seriously suggesting to me that a Minister's responsibility is met when he is not prepared to confront those who have been involved &mdash; on his own admission on 25 February &mdash; in covering up a scandal unprecedented in the history of the State?  He admitted that he did not have any direct contact with the BTSB from the time the problem entered the public domain in February 1994 until he left the Department in December 1994.  That is some statement.  He admits that the letter of 25 February &mdash; one week after the initial problem had been brought to this attention, written by the then chief executive of the BTSB to the Secretary of his Department, Mr. Hurley &mdash; was brought to his direct attention. That letter of 25 February confirmed the further admission that the BTSB had broken all its own protocols by taking blood from patient X who had jaundice.  On receiving that letter Mr. Hurley described its contents to the tribunal as &ldquo;the single most significant event in his career as a civil servant&rdquo;.  Knowing all of that, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, did not see it as his responsibility then, or throughout the remainder of his period in office, to satisfy himself that the contaminated product had been withdrawn from the market.  From his direct evidence to the tribunal it was his view that the BTSB could be relied upon to do that important job to prevent any further infection, even though as early as 25 February he had been told by the Secretary of his Department that the crisis in the BTSB had escalated into an unprecedented scandal.  In his direct evidence, the former Minister admitted there was reticence on the part of the BTSB to furnish the information his officials sought on his behalf; yet no alarm bells rang.  The Minister was still prepared to rely on that discredited organisation to organise the withdrawal of a product when it had displayed not just lack of competence but potential criminal negligence.  Departmental officials surmised that things were very much more serious than had been indicated initially by the BTSB to the Department.  Without delving any further into his extraordinary testimony, that in itself, is a grave act of omission on the part of <Col N="1243" /> a Minister in whom was placed the public trust to avoid any further infection.  Given that he was aware of the gravity of the problem from day one, he failed abysmally in that primary and immediate responsibility to stop further infection, having failed to have implemented his first decision to withdraw all anti-D products up to and including 17 February 1994.</P>
    <P>From the very beginning it is a litany of failure. His first decision was to withdraw the product; that failed, yet he did not acknowledge there was a problem in withdrawing that product even though he knew that was the way to prevent further infection.  On his own admission he did not even check to ascertain whether his first decision had been properly implemented.  In everything he did he allowed the BTSB to remain centrally involved throughout the remainder of his tenure.</P>
    <P>The second question the former Minister agreed he had to address to deal with the issue confronting him was: what could be done to ensure a replacement anti-D product was obtained in substitution for the contaminated product which it was his direct responsibility to ensure was withdrawn?  The former Minister's evidence in that respect was that he accepted the BTSB view that the WinRho product was the best available.  It is important to note that, in accepting the BTSB view, the Minister did not meet any BTSB official.  On the Minister's admission the Secretary of his Department, Mr. Hurley, and the Assistant Secretary, Mr. Devitt, had no inherent medical qualifications though obviously competent in their administrative posts.  It appears they were the conduit in communicating the BTSB view to the Minister.  It should be remembered that there was an admitted crisis in the BTSB over that first weekend.  It was about to escalate into an unprecedented scandal through the letter of 25 February, the following Friday. Yet it appears the last people to whom the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, wanted to talk, in regard to what the replacement product should be, were the personnel in the BTSB, even though he admitted they were the only people with a medical input in deciding what that replacement product should be.</P>
    <P>He took a deliberate policy decision from day one to be at arm's length from the BTSB.  There was no direct contact by the former Minister with that organisation at any time during his tenure of office.  I find that extraordinary.  If someone is trying to tell me he fulfilled his political responsibilities then his definition of accountability is very strange indeed, particularly given pronouncements before and on coming into office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin's direct evidence to the tribunal was that the chief medical officer of the Department may also have been involved but he just did not know.  Neither did he inquire.  He admitted there was difficulty obtaining information from the BTSB over that weekend but, despite that reticence, no alarm bells rang for the <Col N="1244" /> Minister.  Mr. Nugent, Senior Counsel, put it to the former Minister that, if his officials were not getting answers and if, as he admits, there was a crisis, why did he not call in the chairman of the BTSB and demand answers without prevarication? In the circumstances one would have thought that a fairly reasonable action but the former Minister did not contact the chairman of the BTSB at any time about anything.</P>
    <P>Extraordinarily, the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, suggested that a more thorough and effective route &mdash; given that he was trying to find a replacement product for something being withdrawn immediately &mdash; would have been to &ldquo;fairly expeditiously have an independent and thorough review of the whole functioning of the BTSB to get to the bottom of the matter&rdquo;.  This was over the first weekend when a vital anti-D blood product had to be withdrawn immediately and a new, alternative and safe blood product found in its place.</P>
    <P>The former Minister's mind immediately worked overtime on how to put this scandal at arm's length from himself.  Even in the first days of this crisis, he did not take the practical steps to confront those with the medical expertise in the BTSB, and its chairman, to ensure that this second decision to get proper replacement products was implemented effectively.  This was a grave crisis of unprecedented proportions, but blissfully ignorant, he did nothing.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that the former Minister when he discovered this replacement product had been obtained could not recall that the National Drugs Advisory Board had not even agreed to its importation; he did not know that either.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Howlin, relied on the BTSB to get the replacement product and never knew that the National Drugs Advisory Board had to give prior authorisation for it to be imported.  The BTSB had told him over the weekend that the product they were replacing the contaminated anti-D with had been agreed by the NDAB but he never went to the primary source and did not contact the NDAB about their supervisory function and their opinion of the Canadian product.  He then said in his testimony that he was informed by Senator Mary Henry, luckily an interested spectator, that FDA approval for this product had not been granted.  The Minister's response to this was that he was &ldquo;deeply annoyed&rdquo; but accepted the views of &ldquo;those who knew better&rdquo; that FDA approval was pending.</P>
    <P>Therefore confidence was to be restored by withdrawing contaminated product, and the Minister did not check to ensure that the replacement product was properly imported or had prior approval for use in its country of origin and manufacture.  No arrangements were made by the Minister to communicate with the NDAB on the serious situation concerning the replacement product.  One is entitled to ask what the chairman of a State board is for.  For the Minister they were <Col N="1245" /> a species with whom contact was to be avoided, particularly when there was a crisis.</P>
    <P>After that stout defence of his position, we move to his third priority in dealing with the matter &mdash; finding out who had been infected.  He referred to the setting up of a screening programme for anti-D recipients only and for the period 1977-84.  This went well, he stated, although Dr. Boothman of the Department said in evidence that from the start the problem extended beyond the direct recipients of anti-D product because some of the women had come back as blood donors and, accordingly, recipients of blood transfusions and other blood products were then probably infected also.  In other words, the official advice in his Department within weeks of the screening programme beginning, had he wanted to find out, was that the screening would have to extend beyond the category of people to whom he was allowing access to the programme.  This would have been an important matter if the Minister had wanted his third priority competently and comprehensively dealt with.  Having set up a screening programme, the medical evidence indicated broadening the cohort of people allowed to have access to it but nothing happened.  The Minister could not remember when this was pointed out to him.</P>
    <P>Mr. Nugent put it to him that it was clear a targeted look back programme was needed within weeks of the screening programme beginning. The Minister agreed with that but Mr. Nugent said no such programme was up and running when the Minister left the Department of Health in November 1994.  The Minister said he was satisfied and that it was many months down the road, that he wanted to ensure that all potentially infected people were reached.  In other words, the Minister was not interested in putting in an immediate screening programme open to every infected person; it was only available to the direct recipients of anti-D, despite Dr. Boothman, a senior official in the Department, saying it had to be broadened.  The Minister said he did not recall when he was told that: &ldquo;discussions on a targeted look back... I do not recall that being discussed in my time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That contradicts his earlier evidence, when he said there was a need for a targeted look back programme at the time Dr. Boothman made her observations.  Which is it?  Did the Minister know or not?  The evidence points to the Minister not wanting to know.  A passage in the transcript shows the Minister's state of mind.  He was asked if he was aware that in September 1994 the Department of Health wrote to the BTSB to find out how the targeted look back programme was progressing, only to find that it had not even started.  The Minister answered that he did not recall that being brought to his attention.  He was asked if he had any recollection of inquiring as to the number of anti-D women infected and if he recollected inquiring as to what steps were being taken to learn how much further the infection had gone.  The Minister answered that he had <Col N="1246" /> obviously been periodically updated on these matters but had no recollection of that himself, saying that the specifics of the meetings would have been regular but he did not recall.  The Minister was asked if papers would have been made available to him in order to improve his recollection if he had asked for them.  He answered that he was sure he could have had anything he wanted in terms of papers, but he did not by choice rehearse every document that might have been germane to the case, saying he had current responsibilities and was kept busy 24 hours a day. Is that how a Minister treats a tribunal of inquiry regarding his tenure?  That says a lot about his state of mind.</P>
    <P>His fourth priority was to maintain confidence in the blood supply.  Thankfully, people continued to supply blood but not because of the Minister's reasons.  It is to the public's credit that they continued to donate blood and to recognise the importance of the blood supply to the country. The Minister's fifth priority referred to what he did as Minister for those who were infected.</P>
    <P>Two months into the crisis, Anne Taylor, of the Council for the Status of Women, contacted the Minister and asked him to persuade the BTSB to allow Jane O'Brien's letter to be circulated to other victims.  The Minister's policy was to have no contact with the BTSB officials but no reason is given for that.  He had overall responsibility for handling the crisis but would not tell the chairman of the BTSB that he felt, for example, that these women should be facilitated in contacting each other.  The BTSB was refusing to get involved in this at the time.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that any support possible should be given but was not so strongly of the view that he was prepared to see it happen. Regarding Ms Taylor's request, he said that he presumed that it was conveyed to the BTSB who would make the ultimate decision and that he was not going to make directions of that nature in the middle of this crisis.  The Minister was solemnly declaring that the BTSB was a statutory based agency with its own legal entity.  Even in the relatively minor matter of directing the BTSB to facilitate contact between the victims to help them deal with the trauma, confusion and distress that had suddenly invaded their lives and their families' lives, Minister Howlin turns a blind eye. Instead of acting on Ms Taylor's request, he gets up on his high horse and rides away.  He would have preferred if the BTSB had circulated the letter. He was asked three times if, in his personal opinion and knowing what we know, whether it was unreasonable of the BTSB to refuse to circulate that letter.  On each occasion he refused to acknowledge that it was unreasonable not to direct the BTSB to do the decent thing.  Save us from such political progressives.</P>
    <P>The Minister's refusal to acknowledge the unreasonablness of the BTSB in this matter speaks volumes about his concerns in addressing the devastation and isolation of these women who were floundering in a sea of doubt, fear and outrage. <Col N="1247" /> It shows how little he realises that the coming together of the anti-D women has been a source of support and strength to them.  He had the power and position at the time to demand that the BTSB circulate the letter, but his best effort under cross-examination was that it would have been preferable to have done so at the time. What does that tell us about his attitude to Positive Action?  He said they were an extremely important group of people who had presented a reasonable document whose contents he was prepared, by and large, to accept at face value.  The document gave the victims' view of the BTSB as being coldhearted and grossly insensitive in their dealings with the victims.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Howlin concludes &ldquo;... we felt they were best placed in terms of information to give the counselling and we made that decision&rdquo;.  He goes on to say &ldquo;It was certainly my view, in supporting the establishment of the counselling services we wanted to put in place immediately, that the people with the greatest degree of information could give the greatest degree of consolation.&rdquo; That is an extraordinary justification for leaving the counselling of the women to the BTSB.  They had the information but the problem was that they did not give it to anybody.  A characteristic of their information is that it was evasive and inaccurate.  Far from giving the greatest degree of consolation to victims we have heard the testimony of many victims in the media since the publication of this report which confirms the humiliating nature of the encounters the victims had with BTSB personnel when they sought the information to which they were entitled and which was at the disposal of the BTSB at the time.  Far from giving them the greatest degree of consolation, the BTSB actively exacerbated the problem by trying to explain away anti-D post-1977 infection on the grounds of sexual behaviour or intravenous drug use. Knowing that, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was still prepared to go to the tribunal a few weeks ago and seek to justify what was clearly a wrong decision by suggesting that there was consolation to be found in the offices of the BTSB as it sought to actively shift the blame elsewhere and especially on to the victims.</P>

      <P>The Minister, Deputy Howlin, also brought forward an <i>ex gratia</i> expenses scheme for victims.  He was told in September 1994 that the expenses scheme was not meeting the needs of victims.  He indicated they should consult their community welfare officers.  He was surprised when these officers told the victims they could do nothing for them.  The Minister explained that &ldquo; ... it was a suggestion that was made if you like, on the top of the head at the time ... &ldquo;.  No general alert was given to the community welfare officers who worked under him in the Department of Health when the officers' reaction to the victims was brought to his attention.  However, he assures us that anyone who came to his clinic or wrote to him was followed through by the Department. Who says the politics of clientelism are dead and gone or are with Michael O'Leary in his political grave?</P>
      <P>With regard to what he did for the victims during his tenure, the question of a compensation scheme had not been addressed by him nine months after the scandal first broke.  He contended that the bulk of the screening process had to be completed first.  He was not quite saying that until the last victim is known, the first victim cannot be compensated, but he was coming as close to it as makes no difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to finding out what happened, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, agreed with counsel that it was vitally important that what went wrong would not go wrong again.  He admits he was aware from the very beginning of the crisis that the chief medical consultant had got a letter in December 1991 which should have alterted him to this problem and that Dr. Walsh did nothing about it.  By 25 February we had scandal on our hands and in addition to the 1991 letter, it transpired that blood had been taken from a woman who had jaundice.  He turned his attention to finding out what had happened on the Monday 21 February.  He decided to set up an expert group to find out as a matter of urgency what happened.  He consulted just three people &mdash; the Secretary and Assistant Secretary of the Department and his adviser, Mr. Collins.  He was told in June 1994 &mdash; such was the urgency involved in finding out what had happened &mdash; that the BTSB <Col N="1249" /> was not co-operating.  He could not compel witnesses or demand that documents be given to the expert group which had been asked by him to find out what had happened as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Having been told in June about the non-cooperation, a most serious matter, he did not respond until September.  Once again, he did not call in anyone from the BTSB and demand answers without equivocation or prevarication. He did not sack anyone in the management of the BTSB refusing to acknowledge his authority. He simply appointed a new chairman in September 1994, three months after having been told the expert group was not getting co-operation. We had to wait for Deputy Noonan to become Minister for Health in the current Administration which had come to power insisting on accountability. Far from sacking anybody the new Minister for Health arranged for a golden handshake to be paid to the chief medical consultant whose responsibility it was as far back as 1991 when he got the necessary information, to act on it.  So much for accountability.</P>
    <P>Finally, there was the problem of the BTSB and the Minister, Deputy Howlin's approach to it.  He claimed the expert group would speedily address the issue but admitted that he did not give it a time frame within which to work.  In other words, he told it to deal with the matter urgently but to take as long as it liked.  A week after the news broke the Minister had a scandal and cover-up on his hands.  When asked if he felt it was wise in retrospect, given that there was a serious problem in the BTSB, to wait nearly a year for the expert group's report, he replied tellingly &ldquo;I was well gone in a year.&rdquo;  The failure of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to meet his responsibilities as Minister for Health in the face of the greatest scandal in the history of the State revolves around the simple salient fact that having recognised that there was a scandal in the BTSB he involved them in every step in seeking to resolve it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health's failings are more considerable.  It is because of him there had to be a judicial inquiry.  Although he was the first Minister to have all the information, he refused to give it to the Dáil.  The tribunal had to get it out of him and the State agencies under his aegis. He knew the BTSB had no defence for a legal action but he aided and abetted it in the cover-up in the McCole case.  He established an <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal despite the opposition of victims and the promise of the coalition Government to pay fair compensation.  He unilaterally announced the scheme of compensation while still in negotiation with the victims.  When he announced it he did not mention health care which was a primary consideration of the victims. The Minister continues to believe this is all about money and lawyers.  This is a flawed belief which explains to a large degree his mishandling of the affairs.  The compensation scheme continues to fail the fairness test on many counts but, despite <Col N="1250" /> numerous calls in this House and from the victims, the Minister refused to make any substantive changes until this morning.</P>
    <P>The tribunal findings in the 1976 file make no sense.  Mr. Justice Finlay is saying at the same time that the Minister's critics were right and that the Minister acted properly.  The tribunal finds that the Minister's critics were right to contend that the expert group did not have all the relevant facts but that the Minister was right to insist that the tribunal of inquiry was unnecessary.  Mr. Justice Finlay accepts that there was a great deal of detail which was not known to the expert group, which was our contention once the 1976 file was revealed.  It was the basis on which we sought the judicial inquiry.  The inquiry finds that the expert group was not told that patient X's plasma was used without her knowledge or consent; that it did not know of the existence of documents showing that she had been diagnosed as having infective hepatitis in 1976; that it gave a misleading impression of the role the Department of Health played in issuing licences and that it dealt inadequately with the role of donor Y.</P>
    <P>The critical question relating to the 1976 file was put to the Minister by Mr. Rogers.  He considered the critical question to be whether the expert group knew whether the BTSB knew in 1976 and the Minister agreed with him.  During a further half an hour of cross examination the Minister studiously avoided answering it.  He seeks refuge in the fact that no new medical information came as a result of the discovery of the 1976 file. However, that was not the Opposition's contention. Our contention is that the importance of the 1976 file was that it showed the state of mind of the BTSB as far back as 1976.  Once it was produced in the discovery documents in the McCole case the State's case collapsed.  It showed unequivocally that the State had no defence, although it pursued a legal strategy which brought the woman involved to her death bed and threatened her with costs if she dared seek her rights in court.  The 1976 file is not significant for the circular argument in which the Minister engaged at the tribunal, seeking to talk about the fact that there was no new medical evidence. Although it was arguable, it was not contended that that was the fundamental point whether or not the infective hepatitis breached their Protocols in terms of not allowing that donor to continue donating.</P>
    <P>The critical issue is that the McCole case was won when the discovery documents, including the 1976 file, were produced.  The reason there are aggravated damages is that the defence of the claim by the State is such that justice demands that aggravated damages be paid in all those cases.</P>

      <P>This is why the Minister should resign.  Because of the legal strategy adopted in <Col N="1251" /> the McCole case taxpayers will have to pay out much money.  However, so be it if justice is seen to be done.  The Minister made the political decision and is responsible for that strategy. However, this strategy fell apart when the 1976 file was produced and this is why we had a tribunal. The Minister's contention was that there was nothing new in the 1976 file.  If there was nothing new in the 1976 file in April why was a tribunal set up in November?  What happened in the interim was the McCole case and the tragedy which unfolded in front of our eyes.  Everyone was appalled by the bully-boy tactics adopted by the legal team under the direction of the Minister who was a defendant in the case.  It is incorrect to suggest that this matter was at arm's length from the Minister.  People do not go into court and defend the position of the State without taking instructions from the State.</P>
      <P>The tribunal stated that the documents which emerged in the McCole case were not new, dominant or fundamental medical evidence.  Only one of the four demands made by the victims have been fulfilled by the Minister, Deputy Noonan. These demands are truth, an admission of liability, an apology and a statutory tribunal.  The Minister has not fulfilled the fairness test set by the victims for the compensation scheme and whether he does so now remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>The Minister attacked anyone who said that the controversy gave grounds for criminal negligence. He oversaw the legal strategy in the Brigid McCole case and refused to allow the tribunal to investigate the issue by claiming the Oireachtas could not enter the territory of the courts.  What we wanted was an inquiry into how the State and its agencies acted when legal proceedings were instituted by the late Mrs. McCole.  However, the Minister precluded this from consideration by the Finlay tribunal.  Even after Mrs. McCole's death the Minister allowed the BTSB to seek to get the McCole family to waive their legal rights to an action for damages.  When the Minister published the Health Care Bill he broke the commitment to consult the groups representing victims prior to publication.  He did not disclose in his reply to a parliamentary question that Mr. O'Riordan had not been interviewed by the expert group.  Yet, the tribunal identified him as the man holding most responsibility for the affair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the release of the tribunal report the Minister adopted a false humility.  However, I am afraid that the real Michael Noonan remains self-satisfied. He looked for commendation in the original motion and told the tribunal that the things he did right in this controversy far out-weighed the things he did wrong.  However, I fundamentally disagree with him.  When will he make an apology for the handling of the Brigid McCole case?  When will be own up and say he regrets the way the State and the BTSB threatened this frail woman?  No one stands over the lack of effectiveness of the Department of Health at any time. However, there is a significant distinction <Col N="1252" /> between failing to properly put in place the means to identify a problem and failing to properly deal with it when it has been identified and comes to a head.  It is in the latter regard that Ministers Howlin and Noonan are found to be clearly deficient.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has referred the judicial inquiry report to the Garda Commissioner who has begun a criminal investigation.  I call on the Government to do the same.  Compensation is a matter of immediate significance for at least 26 victims who have less than three weeks to decide if they will accept their current awards from the compensation tribunal.  This matter has to be resolved in time for them to make that decision.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this is an outrageous wrongdoing by the State and its agencies.  It requires full accountability.  The administrative accountability has been dealt with under the terms of reference of the Finlay tribunal and it will be further dealt with by reference to the DPP and the Garda Commissioner.  However, the question of political accountability still remains to be dealt with.  I have outlined in some detail the major questions regarding the way in which this matter was handled by the people concerned. Rather than calling for the resignations of Ministers which will not be forthcoming, the tribunal of public opinion should decide this matter.  We should ask the public if this is the way it expects its State to deal with its most vulnerable citizens.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <P>Notwithstanding the spin doctoring which has gone on since the motion was drafted yesterday evening, the motion is only a considerable, not complete, U-turn.  This is apparent from the reports in the media this morning that the Government has agreed to pay aggravated damages. However, this is not reflected in the language contained in the motion which is equivocal and conditional; any scrutiny of it reveals a conditional change of heart by the Minister and the Government.  It refers to supporting the Government's intention to amend the scheme of compensation, including its establishment on a statutory basis following consultation and consideration of any necessary legal advice.  If ever there was a kick to touch this is it.  The Minister clarified the position to some extent but I am still concerned that the terms under which aggravated damages will be paid will be conditional.  I will deal with this point in detail later.</P>
    <P>The Government will present this motion as a generous concession to the victims.  Like all the other concessions in this saga, it has been wrenched from this brutal Administration at the eleventh hour while it was in full flight from the people.  What is Government policy today was not Government policy at the end of last week when the original motion was tabled.  As Deputy Cowen said, the motion is a U-turn on the position which the Minister confirmed during his evidence to the tribunal was the policy of the Government in relation to aggravated damages. This is the political calamity stage.  The Government was faced with voting down Opposition amendments to its motion which called on the Government to provide for aggravated damages and a range of other measures.  It has agreed to some of those demands.  For the first time the <Col N="1254" /> Government has indicated it will consider putting the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis, but only after consultation, examination of all the legal advice, etc.  It also faced the prospect of having to face down some of its own backbench Deputies who were unable to stomach the original motion.</P>
    <P>It has been a feature of this Administration that we have not seen one generous, self-motivated act which derived from the Government's own sense of responsibility, moral or legal, to the victims.  Every single concession, be it medical treatment or the terms of establishment of the compensation tribunal, had to be wrenched from the Government.  We have not yet had a generous act from the Government, even by the terms of this motion.  The Government has not made an absolute, unequivocal apology to all the victims.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said this morning he was ashamed about this whole affair.  He should be ashamed because this Administration presided over much of the grievance generated among the women concerned.  Central to their claim for aggravated damages is the manner in which this Administration treated them when they tried to pursue their claim and search for justice either through the courts or in the compensation tribunal.</P>
    <P>This Administration has trampled on women. Even when it knew a State agency was involved, it continued to bully these women.  This Administration has political responsibility for driving the truly abhorrent legal strategy, the only motivation for which was to intimidate the women into going to the compensation tribunal.  They did not want to go to the tribunal.  They were suspicious of it because it was not based on statute.  They knew if they went to the compensation tribunal the issue of liability would be skirted.  They were right to be suspicious.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in the motion of responsibility for that legal strategy, a major contributor to the grievance and hurt caused to these women. It was deliberately excluded by this Administration from the report's terms of reference. Because it was so excluded, the chairman of the tribunal could use words such as &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; in relation to the actions of the two Ministers who gave evidence.  Had the tribunal been seized of the scandal of the legal strategy, the judge's findings would have been scathing in relation to the people who authorised the strategy.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that this State, which regularly goes into convulsions about the respective rights of mothers and their unborn babies &mdash; we regularly get ourselves into a complete tailspin about this &mdash; can be so callous to hundreds of women who, in their childbearing years and in the act of giving birth, were damaged by a State board.  The constitutional rights of those women are being trampled upon by the very State which holds responsibility for that damage.</P>
    <P>This has been a pitched battle with the State on one side and women on the other.  Women were the victims, plaintiffs, applicants, negotiators <Col N="1255" /> and fighters throughout this battle.  Similar to the battle other women had to fight on equality payments, the State held out to the bitter end and adopted the attitude that the women would put up with this because they were a large group without economic power.  If this tragedy had affected men to the extent it has devastated so many women, the damages payable would be much greater.  Would the battle have been so long and hard won?</P>
    <P>Yesterday we had further revelations of more human and computer error in the donor selection process.  Blood board officials railed in anger at our party's call for the board's disbandment. They alleged such comments were outrageous and irresponsible and would undermine confidence in the blood supply.  Do they not see even now that that defensive mind-set is the classic genesis for the original cover-up?  It was that absolute paranoia about undermining confidence in the blood supply which drove the health and BTSB officials, successive Ministers, to be in denial for so long.  They could not face up to this scandal.  It was an appalling vista.  They hoped it would go away, but it did not.  They wanted to shoot the messenger because the message, they alleged, undermined the blood supply.</P>
    <P>Confidence in the blood supply is only warranted if it is justified.  It is a matter of public interest if serious inadequacies remain in the donor selection process, and if many people have qualms about the administrations organising blood transfusions and the supply of blood products. That public interest is greater than the public interest the State believes must be covered up and protected.  That same mind-set was adopted in relation to the people who made allegations about malpractice in the beef industry.  There was talk of national sabotage.  That mind-set is the genesis of the cover-up we are now discussing, which formed the basis of the tribunal's inquiries.</P>
    <P>I want to deal in some detail with the legal strategy adopted by the State, which is important. It was foolish of us to imagine the tribunal of inquiry would be a vehicle for political accountability of Ministers.  We were sold a pup.  We imagined there would be some analysis of the manner in which the Ministers dealt with the matter in this House.  I had the innocent notion that teams of lawyers would scrutinise the Official Report of debates on this matter, parsing the minimalist replies to parliamentary questions and examining the questions tabled to but not answered by the Minister because they were ruled out or changed.  I thought there would be scrutiny of the manner in which the Minister for Health and his predecessor responded, or failed to respond, to questions in this House on the status of events in this scandal.  No in-depth analysis took place because this House is the only place that can be done.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Cowen on challenging statements made, as well as conflicting statements subsequently made in the tribunal.  That is what <Col N="1256" /> should have been done.  What was the team supposedly representing the public interest doing at the tribunal?  I would like to have a schedule of the arguments it made and the questions raised. How many challenges were made to the evidence of the Ministers?  Who instructed the counsel representing the public interest?  The person who should have represented the public interest in this matter from the outset was the Minister for Health.  This is the Chamber where that accountability is tested, but it was because of the failure of this Dáil that we had to establish the tribunal in the first place.</P>
    <P>One of the most remarkable features of the tribunal of inquiry was the delicate political surgery which excised the issue of how the State had defended cases brought against it in the courts by persons infected with hepatitis C.  Even what was written by the family of the late Brigid McCole in their open letter of October 1996 was carefully pared down so as to be relevant only to the questions posed by it in relation to other terms of reference of the tribunal.  There was good reason for this.  There was an imperative on the Minister for Health not to have the manner in which he defended the case examined by the tribunal.  That is probably one of his most shameful episodes and it was an evasion of ministerial responsibility that he saw to it that his role in leading and authorising and having responsibility for that legal strategy was not subjected to scrutiny and analysis by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The House will recall what the Minister said in relation to Brigid McCole in a carefully scripted statement to the House which undoubtedly represented his own thinking and the carefully throught out strategy of those closest to him who were advising him.  Not out of political cruelty but to put it on the record again, let me remind the House what the Minister said in relation to the late Brigid McCole &mdash; Official Report, 16 October; Volumn 470. column 430:</P>
    <P>On reflection, would not the solicitors for the plaintiff have served their client better if they had advised her to go to the compensation tribunal early this year?  Is it not accepted in the legal profession that the tribunal is working well and that Mrs. McCole could have received a significantly higher award by going before it? She would not have had to face the enormous stress of court proceedings.  Could her solicitors not, in selecting a test case from the hundreds of hepatitis C cases on their books, have selected a plaintiff in a better condition to sustain the stress of a High Court case?  Was it in the interest of their client to attempt to run her case not only in the High Court, but also in the media and the Dáil simultaneously?</P>
    <P>At that point Deputy McDaid, who was sitting close to me, said &ldquo;That is dreadful&rdquo;.  The Minister continued: &ldquo;If we are to review the conduct of the case by the State, have not the solicitors for the plaintiff a case to answer also?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> Those words, for which the Minister later gave a half-hearted apology, and only under severe stress, convey the true coldness which lay behind the State's attitude not merely to Brigid McCole but to all the hepatitis C sufferers.  In that single passage the Minister completely and deliberately ignored the patent truth that he would never have set up a tribunal of inquiry were it not for the death of Brigid McCole.  If, as the Minister clearly wished, a healthier woman had chosen to fight the Minister through the courts, there would have been no tribunal, no admission of liability and no political embarrassment for the current Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, or the former Minister, Deputy Howlin.  Everything would have been swept under the carpet.  That is why the Minister asked why Mrs. McCole's solicitors, in selecting from the hundreds of hepatitis C cases on their books, did not select a person in better condition to sustain the stresses of a High Court case.  Was the Minister implying that Brigid McCole did not want to be a plaintiff in the High Court proceedings?  Was he suggesting that she was used by others?  Was he suggesting that taking the High Court proceedings had shortened her life?  Of course he was, and that was a deeply dishonest, irresponsible suggestion.  Here was an angry man, corncered, hardhearted and desperately trying to cover up his own embarrassment at being forced by others at the Cabinet to concede a tribunal of inquiry which he and his Department were most loath to concede.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question posed by the Minister: &ldquo;Was it in the interest of their client to attempt to run her case not only in the High Court, but also in the media and the Dáil simultaneously?&rdquo; What was the meaning of that question? Was the Minister suggesting that somebody who had suffered a major injustice at the hands of his Department and who was confronted with an administrative cock-up of unprecedented proportions should sit meekly as a silent plaintiff in High Court proceedings while her life ebbed away without going public about what the Minister was doing to her?  These words were calculated by a desperate Minister to spread the blame as he saw it that night when he was eating humble pie, establishing a tribunal.  Those words underlined with an emphasis that no Opposition speaker could match just how wrong-minded the Minister's approach to that case had been.</P>
    <P>We were never intended to review the role of the State in the conduct of that case.  The Minister and his colleagues prevented the tribunal from reviewing the conduct of that case.  They did so because it would have become abundantly clear that they attempted to bully, blackmail, frighten, intimidate, wear down and take advantage of a dying woman in order to cover up their own political embarrassment.</P>
    <P>Lately the Minister has protested to RTÉ because they broadcast the true and stated feeling of some hepatitis C victims about him.  Again he is shooting the messenger.  Again he wants to suppress the truth, to suppress free speech.  He wants <Col N="1258" /> the nation to think well of him, to think that he is a high-minded Minister who did his job.  We know that he nothing of the sort in relation to this matter in this House.  At every hand's turn obstacles were placed by the team representing the State, representing you and me &mdash; it is mortifying to think that that action was taken on behalf of the people, that, representing the people, the State obstructed an early hearing of this woman's case when she was so ill by contradicting medical evidence that she needed an early hearing, by denying her anonymity.  We all know how bad that case was, and it goes to the heart of the claim for aggravated damages.</P>
    <P>The State and the Minister were in no position to allow the BTSB to be sued by all the women in question.  If they had been sued, the bill would have been colossal.  Worse, the truth would have emerged, and the absence of supervision by the Department of Health would have been made clear.  In so far as that has been examined by the tribunal, it is welcome, but had we not had a tribunal the Department of Health would have emerged unscathed.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the mandarins advising him took the view that setting up a compensation tribunal without inquiring into the facts was the best way to avoid accountability on this matter.  That was the favoured option, the option the Minister advertised so widely.  It was the option he wanted women to adopt.  Any fair-minded observer would conclude from the statements made by the Minister for Health in this House on 16 October 1996 that he deeply resented and bitterly opposed the fact that Brigid McCole had forced his hand, and he transferred that bitterness against the law-years of the late Brigid McCole.</P>
    <P>We can say with certainly that there would never have been a tribunal of inquiry had the women who embarked on High Court litigation not stuck to their guns.  Indeed they continue to stick to their guns in one case that has only recently been given a date for hearing.  The same blackmail has gone on, the same haranguing of the plaintiff, the same obstruction.  Everything we were made aware of in relation to the Brigid McCole case is still going on in relation to another plaintiff before the courts.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Government motion contain nothing about aggravated damages applying to the compensation tribunal or to cases before the courts.  I would like the Minister to respond to that point.  It says nothing about cases pending before the courts, although it is still the constitutional right of any person who wants to seek justice before the courts to do so and not be cajoled into thinking that this new option is the real option.  The words of this motion are cryptic and will need a lot of parsing, and I am distrustful of this Minister's words.</P>
    <P>It was the realisation that this grand expensive strategy of suppression of truth had come unstuck that prompted the Minister to come to the House and attack the lawyers for Brigid McCole in the appalling way that he did.  It was the political <Col N="1259" /> humiliation of having to establish a tribunal of inquiry because other members of the Cabinet forced him to do it that he resented most.  Even to this day he blames others for his own problems. He blames RTE for broadcasting women's true feelings about him.  The Minister cannot accept that he, personally, politically and legally, is the one who should take full responsibility for what he has done.  He must accept that.  The way in which he behaved falls far short of the way the people would expect any elected Minister to behave.  All Ministers are elected by the democratic process.  That unique aspect should ensure that at all times the interests of individual members of society are to the fore in their minds. They should not behave like cold-hearted defendants, as the Minister for Health has done.</P>
    <P>When he became a defendant in the case, the Minister became emotionally bankrupt.  He cut off his mind to the reality of the effects of the adoption of the strategy.  He closed his mind to his parliamentary responsibility to all Members when challenged here on matters relating to the scandal during his term of office.  He felt constrained in what he could say because he was a defendant in the action, but that is nonsense.  The fact that the State is a defendant in an action does not mean the Minister for Health should preside over inappropriate behaviour and malpractice. That is nonsense and it would be a dangerous precedent to adopt.</P>
    <P>The priority of all Ministers for Health should be the public interest, not the self-preservation of the Department or the Government, or the cover-up of mistakes and negligence of officials in State boards.  Why did one of the people at the centre of the negligence in this whole affair receive a golden handshake which amounted to more than the damages paid to some of the women involved?  That is a scandal and it could only happen in the event of a misplaced notion of the public interest.  The Minister has failed in his statutory responsibility to be truly a Minister for public health, to be custodian of the public health. He is not there to protect his Department against claims by the public; he is there to protect the public.  If any lesson is to be learned, it will come not from the tribunal but from our knowledge and experience of debating this issue.  One lesson that must be learned is that Ministers must put the public first rather than their Department or the Government.</P>
    <P>The Ministers involved, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, did not want the truth to come out during their term of office.  The compensation tribunal was set up so that the issue of liability would be skirted, that gross criminal negligence would be set aside.  Basically, the compensation tribunal is a cash dispensing mechanism where people tell their story, they do not have to prove anything, their bills are simply examined.  I read one of the proceedings of the compensation tribunal and there was haranguing and nit-picking, with embarrassing challenging of women about <Col N="1260" /> their pharmacy bills, looking for receipts and so on, but the whole issue of liability was skirted. Whenever the issue of liability arose the chairman shied away from it and said that the tribunal was not allowed to discuss punitive damages or refer to possible negligent acts, that it was not its job to deal with liability but to pay out money on the basis of what the women were able to prove. They did not, however, have to prove any of the detail that would have been necessary in a High Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to save himself from the embarrassment of being in office when this matter was revealed, but the issue blew up in his face because Brigid McCole died.  That is what awakened the public to this matter, which was complicated and which they previously did not understand. There were so many women involved that somehow it took away from the issue.  The individual story told in court in the Brigid McCole case and discovered in the documents turned on the light for thousands of people.  Suddenly what Deputies tracking this event had known to be a huge scandal was brought home to the wider population.  They realised this was an enormous tragedy, too awful to contemplate.  When they saw the way Mrs. McCole was harried and bullied by the State until the day she died they were rightly appalled.  That is what forced the Minister to act.</P>
    <P>The tribunal report, while it has many good points, is incomplete.  I dislike the way it is written, in very cold, objective language, the language of a lawyer.  There is much more to this scandal than issues of law.  It is a political issue in the deepest sense.  It is a legal issue of public importance which is the responsibility of our political masters, and the political master in this instance is the Minister for Health.  The report is constrained by its own terms of reference which were craftily designed to exclude from the tribunal's remit any issue relating to the legal strategy and political responsibility.</P>
    <P>The tribunal which was proffered as the answer to all public and political concerns raised in the Dáil and the media and by the victims of State negligence has merely confirmed what many of us already suspected but could not prove.  The Dáil was forced to set up the tribunal, which speaks volumes about our failure in a parliamentary democracy to hold to account the Government of the day.  All the facts revealed in the tribunal under cross-examination and by discovery of documents were in the possession of the State from the beginning.  We had to go to great lengths over three or four years to find out what was going on, who was responsible, what the Minister and officials did and what the Department of Health knew.  Even though all that information was in the possession of the State legal team, we had to set up a tribunal to extract the facts, reveal them in a public forum and to draw conclusions on the matter.</P>
    <P>Why was this information revealed in a tribunal as distinct from Dáil Éireann?  The answer is that <Col N="1261" /> the Dáil failed because it was misled by Ministers who, in turn, were misled by State authorities. The Dáil failed in one of its primary functions, to hold the Government of the day accountable for its stewardship of State authorities, and that is very dangerous.</P>
    <P>Now that the full extent of the State's culpability has been exposed by the tribunal, the two Ministers involved are still in full flight from parliamentary accountability.  They home in on the phrase, which probably originated from a Government press release, that the report exonerates them.  They rejoice in the fact that the report centres its criticisms on the medical players and dwells, as if only in passing, on the roles of the two Ministers.  It conveniently refers to the two Ministers together with previous Ministers in terms of the statutory supervisory role over the NDAB.</P>
    <P>The report is framed in measured and emotionally bankrupt language.  It uses words such as &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;, &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo;, &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; to describe the most appalling actions of the major players, technical, medical and political.  The reckless criminal incompetence which led to the catastrophe are described by the judge as resulting from &ldquo;undue emphasis&rdquo;, &ldquo;undue and unsupported belief&rdquo; and &ldquo;reluctance to admit the possibility of&rdquo;.  A lay person could be forgiven for not knowing we are talking about a series of unforgivable acts and omissions by persons with responsibility which cost lives, significantly shortened others and deprived at least 1,600 people of their future plans.  This was a harrowing experience for the women concerned at what should have been a joyous time in their life. Through the reckless fault of the State, these women were infected with a virus and deprived of their future happiness.  Those who conspired in these acts and who wrongfully conspired to cover them up over many years have paid the mere price of public exposure.  That is the extent of the penalty this Administration and State is willing to impose on the people who not only made many mistakes but compounded the original tort by trying to cover them up.  This should not happen again.  As part of the cover up some of these people were given golden handshakes before all the facts were uncovered.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that we have a Civil Service culture of minimum disclosure and blame.  Is that what we want? Is that the open Government to which this Administration is so committed? To establish the crucial facts of liability and responsibility in this case, the Dáil had to defer to a tribunal to get at the truth of this matter.  There is no doubt previous Ministers for Health failed to establish procedures for the Department of Health to adequately supervise the National Drugs Advisory Board.  However, the two Ministers who currently sit at the Cabinet table presided over this matter when it became public knowledge.  How could we be expected to respond to something that was not in the public <Col N="1262" /> domain? That would be an impossible test of accountability.</P>
    <P>The comments in the Finlay report on the saga of the expert group are interesting and titled in the same unusual language, &ldquo;Information not available to the expert group&rdquo;.  The phrase &ldquo;not available&rdquo; is well known by civil servents and politicians from all sides of the House in the context of parliamentary replies.  It is usually used as a way to avoid giving formation.  This chapter should be titled &ldquo;Lies told to the expert group&rdquo;. It is obvious the BTSB gave evidence to the expert group knowing there was proof that doctors treating the six women infected with hepatitis C from plasma made from donor X in 1977 had immediately informed it of the connection with anti-D.  The BTSB lied to the expert group.  It is not a question of information not being available.</P>
    <P>Brigid McCole should be alive today because before she received her lethal dose the BTSB was notified of a link between the blood given to the six women and the anti-D they had received. Those women developed symptoms within six weeks.  Some women are terminally ill and others are living in a medical limbo of uncertainty. These women had to battle with the State and its agencies in an indecent fashion.</P>
    <P>The next bridge to cross is that of aggravated damages as distinct from ordinary compensatory damages.  A terrible game of obstruction was played out by the Minister for Health and the agencies concerned with those fatigued blameless women who seek only justice and truth.  We now have the truth because of the heroic actions of the women who refused to give in to the bullying of the State.</P>
    <P>On page 23 the report refers to the six women who developed clinical jaundice some weeks after receiving anti-D in 1977.  It states:</P>
    <P>We were told that these cases were fully investigated at the time... and that the jaundice in these women was, according to the B.T.S.B., attributed to environmental factors.</P>
    <P>That was a lie and cannot be squared with the connection established by doctors in 1977 between that infection and anti-D.  On page 31 the report states, &ldquo;No immediate action was taken as the index cases were originally reported as having fully recovered...&rdquo;.  They had not recovered, they are still sick.  That was another lie told by the BTSB to the expert group.  The report also states, &ldquo;All patients had reverted to normal after 28 days&rdquo;.  That is also a lie.  The BTSB did not contact the women after their doctors had told the BTSB of their suspicions about the link.</P>
    <P>We know that numerous lies were told later. Lies were told to the Minister for Health on 22 February 1994 when the motion of anti-D immunisation was taken here.  Referring to the six cases of hepatitis C in 1977, the Minister stated that, &ldquo;No cause for the jaundice had been found&rdquo;. That is a lie.  The cause had been linked.  His script opened with the statement that &ldquo;Evidence <Col N="1263" /> had emerged of a possible link between the product anti D and hepatitis C&rdquo;.  That was also a lie. The Minister was told lies by his officials and the BTSB.</P>
    <P>In retrospect, the speech of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, makes pathetic reading. He praised the BTSB that night stating &ldquo;the board has been magnificently proactive... we have a blood transfusion service that is the envy of Europe... fine reputation...&rdquo; and so on.  The statutory authorities knew in 1977 of a medical diagnosis of a link between hepatitis C and anti-D, which was confirmed in the Middlesex letter of 1991.</P>
    <P>The question of political accountability has not been dealt with adequately, but I hope to deal with it in more detail at a future date.  I understand Fianna Fáil will give me the time I have lost at another time.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to speak on this debate without referring to the emotions of sadness and anger I always feel when the matter is discussed in the House.  We are discussing one of the greatest medical scandals in the history of the State.  Innocent people are suffering enormous trauma and tragedy as a result of negligence by the BTSB.</P>
      <P>However, from listening to this debate one would think there were no human victims - there is just a search for a political victim.  I find it extraordinarily difficult to listen to some of the contributions today.  One would be inclined to think there were no sick women or that there were no families without an active and well parent as a result of that tragedy.  I have failed to find any emotion of compassion, sympathy or understanding in the contributions by the Opposition. They are here today to use this scandal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As a result of that, I was a constant traveller with Positive Action.  I negotiated many human issues on its behalf with the Minister for Health.  In every discussion I had on this in which Deputy O'Donnell was a participant, all she wanted, as did her Leader on <i>Morn ing Ireland</i>, was a political victim &mdash;&ldquo;Give me a politician's head on a plate and this scandal will have been justified&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not apologise for my emotion today because I have played my part.  I kept in constant contact with Positive Action.  I listened with understanding and supported many of its demands and requests.  I spoke with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, who accommodated many of the requests we made.  This is not a story of which any of us can be proud or want to recall when there are so many victims.</P>
      <P>I walked out of the House today as Deputy Cowen gave his first speech on the anti-D-hepatitis C scandal.  This has been on the political agenda since 23 February 1994.  Last night I read every contribution on this matter from 23 February 1994 to 28 January 1997.  Deputy Cowen did not make one contribution in those three years. There was no compassion, sympathy or human element in his contribution today.  He was trying to settle old scores with the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  That is an insult to those of us who could have been victims, but a greater insult to the women who have hepatitis C as a result of this.  It is an enormous tragedy that they have to listen in this House to this tone of debate.</P>
      <P>I know from working with Positive Action what they wanted from day one.  They wanted the truth and the facts.  Thank God, the tribunal of inquiry has established those facts.  They wanted someone to apologise &mdash; I am sorry.  They wanted fair compensation and medical support for their illnesses. This motion and the medical package introduced by the Minister will provide what they seek.  They also wanted to ensure that such a tragedy would never happen again.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, and this Government have a deep passion to ensure such a tragedy will not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the contributions today will do nothing for the sad victims of this enormous scandal.  They are not interested in having political victims but in ensuring that no other person in this State will suffer such drastic consequences as a result of negligence within any section of our medical service.  They are determined all the resources of the State should be <Col N="1265" /> used to ensure they have the best possible quality of life at this stage.  They are also determined they should receive aggravated damages, which I believe they should.</P>
    <P>This has been an enormous tragedy.  I was shocked yesterday morning when I heard a senior Member of this House say to the nation on <i>Morning Ireland</i> that she would hesitate before taking a blood transfusion.  Our responsibility extends not only to the victims of this scandal but to maintaining confidence in our blood service.  If somebody in a hospital bed listening to <i>Morning Ireland</i> was about to receive a blood transfusion and took the advice of a senior Member of this House with tragic consequences, who would be to blame?  As politicians, we must be very careful about what we say on this very serious issue.  We must be responsible and our two priorities at all times must be to look after the victims and to ensure a safe blood supply and confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  I would not do any service to anybody if my contribution did not help to achieve those two basic objectives.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in political gain and no one should use this serious issue for mean political debate.  I had to leave the Chamber this morning because I found it very hard to digest what was being said, particularly by somebody who never said a word in this House or issued a public statement on this issue in the last three years.  Positive Action and the victims know who their supporters were during this tragic time.  They need only look at the Dáil record to see the same names appearing time after time.  It is very easy to conclude who took a passionate interest in this tragic saga.  I suppose there is a temptation to get in at this stage.</P>
    <P>It is not a happy story but we must go forward from here.  We must do everything possible not to add further tragedy to an existing tragedy.  The expressions in this House should be words of consolation and hope to the victims and words of confidence and assurance to those who will need blood transfusions in the future.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I welcome, with some relief, the redrafted motion by the Government which, in contrast with the analysis of the two Opposition speakers who preceded Deputy Ahearn, is a generous and wholehearted attempt to meet in full the remaining demands of Positive Action.  The Minister met Positive Action yesterday and, as in the days since the tribunal report was made available, considered the report's implications and the situation arising out of its findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In redrafting its motion the Government made a genuine attempt to meet generously the remaining concerns of Positive Action. Those of us who have been campaigning with Positive Action received a summary last night of its remaining demands.  It asks that the issues of the <i>ad hoc</i> non <Col N="1266" /> statutory and <i>ex gratia</i> nature of the scheme be addressed.  This has been resolved by the Minister's indication that he will put the compensatory tribunal on a statutory footing.  It also asks that the absence of an admission of liability to the affected anti-D mothers be addressed.  Again, this issue has been resolved, although perhaps not as fully as it might wish, with a full admission of liability from the State.  Nevertheless, the BTSB has been asked to make its position clear.  It also seeks an assurance that the Government will not resile from any implications of the findings of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The absence of a right of appeal from the compensation tribunal to the High Court has not been resolved.  Is it the Minister's intention that this right will be included in the reformed compensation tribunal?  The issue of the payment of aggravated and exemplary damages is dealt with but it needs further clarification.  Deputy O'Donnell interpreted the remit here in the narrowest possible sense.  I hope the Minister will clarify that issue.  He indicated he will remove the limitation of the tribunal and allow it the same powers as the High Court.  Will he confirm that this is an adequate response?  He has dealt with the remaining major demand of Positive Action, that victims, including the deceased, who accepted awards at a time when the true facts regarding the activities and behaviour of the State were concealed from them, would be open to seek aggravated and other damages, including renewed damages from the Sate <i>via</i> any tribunal which will be established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The Government must honour the spirit of the motion in full and concede the demands of Positive Action fully and generously.  The analysis by the Opposition of the frustration shared by many, including Government backbenchers, such as Deputy Theresa Ahearn and me, at the cautious decisions made by Ministers and the inevitably conservative Civil Service advice proffered to them is correct.  I also hope that the Minister will maintain substantive contact with Positive Action with regard to the deliberations of the new tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen made a strong and aggressive speech which analysed all the issues.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to the treatment of another large group of women on a separate occasion by another Government, where Ministers resisted demands through legal action and refused to outline legal advice to the Dáil.  Deputy Cowen's party was the major party to that Government and I was one of the Deputies who regularly put down parliamentary questions seeking clarification. Given this, it was interesting to listen to his speech today, made with the benefit of the tribunal report and hindsight.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it is almost impossible to come to terms with the enormity of the scandal surrounding the hepatitis C infection of the anti-D bodies in the blood supply.  The tribunal analysed the situation and concluded that, given the information available to Ministers at the time, <Col N="1267" /> their responses in setting up the expert group and the health care package were reasonable. However, the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is unsatisfactory. I hope the substantive concessions indicated in the motion will be fully honoured and that there will be no more need to debate this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated he believes that no words of his can adequately apologise to the 1,600 women and men for the damage done to them by a system in which they had previously placed their trust and confidence.  I regret that as a Government backbencher, my words and efforts did not lead to a speedier response and that in times of crisis we did not get the kind of response provided by this motion.  However, people acted to the best of their knowledge at the time.</P>
    <P>I was saddened that the two main Opposition speakers did not account for the period when their parties were in Government.  The neglect by the BTSB went on for a long time and many Ministers were responsible.  While it is appropriate that the Ministers, Deputy Howlin and Deputy Noonan, are called to account for what they did and how they dealt with matters when they came to light, the problems have been there for a long time.</P>
    <P>The recent incident again throws the issue of the ongoing reassurance regarding the quality of the blood supplies into chaos.  While the proposal by the Progressive Democrats to abolish the BTSB is inadequate, fundamental questions remain.  The Minister addressed the issue, but there is need for an ongoing analysis of the operaction of the BTSB and the study of best world practices.  Radical approaches, such as the American practice of supplying one's own blood, should not be ruled out given that so many people depend on these products.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment by the Minister to establish a further tribunal to investigate those infected with HIV and especially the situation regarding haemophiliacs, which arose during the court case and this tribunal.  I hope he will expand further on the Government's commitment to concede in full the five remaining substantive demands of Positive Action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahearn made a vigorous attack on my party spokesperson, Deputy Cowen. While I understand her strong feelings on this issue, Deputy Cowen, who has been just appointed health spokesperson, has mastered his brief very well.  It is not fair to rebuke a spokesperson for the Opposition and to allege he or she is morally defective because of not having made a previous contribution on a particular subject.  It is the responsibility of those who are appointed spokespersons to take charge of their briefs and to make the best case they can in respect of them. In many ways this problem requires a fresh mind and approach.  I was delighted to hear Deputy Cowen's earlier observations which brought a fresh approach to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> I share with Deputy Flaherty the sentiment that I hope this will be the last debate we will have on this subject in the House.  It is unfortunate and frustrating for Members that so many motions had to be introduced and special applications made from this side of the House to expedite this matter through the taking of various crucial steps.  I welcome the Minister's outline of the various steps taken on foot of the report to implement its recommendations.  I also welcome the Minister's acceptance that the victims of this great scandal should have included in the scale of compensation payable to them compensation on the basis of aggravated or exemplary damages.</P>
    <P>The general approach of the courts in this jurisdiction has always been only to award aggravated or exemplary damages in the most unusual circumstances, generally where there is behaviour that amounts to unconstitutional, high-handed or contumelious conduct on the part of the defendant. The decision by the Government that compensation will be payable on an aggravated or exemplary basis to the victims is a clear acceptance by it that the conduct of the State agencies involved was contumelious and high-handed, if not unconstitutional, and was of an order and of a very serious character in relation to the proper administration of the State.  That prompts certain reflections here on this day of days when we are in receipt of the report of the former Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>I compliment him on the manner in which he discharged his task.  From time to time we hear strong criticism of how tribunals of inquiry are conducted but this tribunal was conducted with great expedition and efficiency.  Its example should be a warning of the danger of constituting ourselves into tribunals of inquiry, a notion canvassed in some quarters of this House from time to time.  Where facts are in dispute an independent objective person needs to consider the circumstances, examine and evaluate the facts and make findings.  It has been canvassed a good deal in this House in recent years that we should establish committees of inquiry.  As the Minister of State is aware, legislation has passed several stages in the House to provide for Members conducting inquiries and compelling witnesses to come before them.  In terms of what happened in this tribunal, one can see the fundamental undesirability of that approach.  It would mean that Members would have to sit in judgment on disputed facts.  That would put them in a difficult position, having regard to their political responsibilities and the different political parties to which they belong.  Provided we can get the terms of reference right, it is far better to entrust that task to a judicial figure who can come back to us with a report.</P>
    <P>As we pointed out some months ago, the terms of reference of this tribunal of inquiry were rather cunningly drafted in that questions of political responsibility were put to one side.  One area of political responsibility, to which Deputy Cowen referred, is the conduct of the State in the defence <Col N="1269" /> of the litigation.  We never established the full facts of how political responsibility was exercised in relation to the conduct of the State defence of the hepatitis C claims.  That was not within the scope of the inquiry conducted by the former Chief Justice and we will never know the full story where that is concerned.  Given what the victims were put through, the approach taken by the State towards the litigation was appalling.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Flaherty said, one outstanding issue is the right of appeal, and that is a reasonable request.  The State would not be exposing itself unduly in relation to liability in conceding a right of appeal.  The Minister indicated this matter must be put on a statutory basis.  That was another matter raised at an earlier stage from our side of the House.  I am glad the Minister agreed he will consider that.  If he is considering putting the scheme on a statutory basis, one would assume he would attend to the provision of a right to appeal.  It is normal in a statutory provision of this type dealing with a scheme of compensation that a person who is aggrieved at a determination would have a right of appeal.  If there was a right of appeal for the victims, in justice there would have to be one for the Minister. If a right of appeal were to be provided from the initial determination, it would have to work both ways.</P>
    <P>With an election imminent, questions of politics have loomed somewhat larger in our discussions today than perhaps they should.  It is a pity that this matter has been resolved only on the eve of an election because a great deal of it should have been resolved at an earlier stage. Deputy Flaherty hinted that as politicians we must ask ourselves if our political structures are adequate to respond to a crisis of this magnitude. The establishment of a tribunal of inquiry appears to have expedited matters a great deal, but it should have happened much earlier.</P>
    <P>This report calls into question the basis of our public administration in this State.  The reports related to the recent introduction by the Government of the Public Service Management Bill and the strategic management initiative introduced last year point to the conventional wisdom that we need more delegation of authority, to devolve responsibility and to ensure performance is consumer driven.  Yet on reading this report one notes the type of administrative incompetence that was allowed in a State agency that was at one remove from a Minister for a long time and one begins to wonder about the wisdom of the policy we have been pursuing in this House.  That policy was in place before I was elected but it was implemented in recent years with the constant establishment of new agencies, boards and authorities, all resplendent with their boards of appointees and all removed from the political control of this House.  That policy has been pursued for some time by all sides of the House.  It means that a humble backbencher like myself cannot ask a parliamentary question about the activities of these entities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> Although there is not a representative of the Labour Party in the House, it more than any other party seems to have invested some political capital in the creation of all these entities.  I do not see the point of all this.  Either there is accountability through the courts in regard to civil obligations and criminal matters or there is accountability on the floor of this House.  If we will not have that type of accountability, we need to reconsider the structures of the House in terms of the committee system and powers of investigation to examine what is happening in these agencies.  The Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies must proceed at a reasonably leisurely pace given the enormous scale of the commercial operations of some of the bodies.  It takes a long time to carry out a comprehensive examination of even one of them. However, much more critical scrutiny must be devoted to this area.  Ultimately, taxpayers look to the House to manage the vast public sector in a manner which ensures they get value for money.</P>
    <P>It is not clear the procedures are tailored to ensure that level of accountability because the lack of accountability in the BTSB and the various matters which were allowed to obtain there for many years are a deplorable public scandal.  It has now been brought to light, but, unfortunately, it is too late for many of the victims.  The question the House must collectively address is our responsibilities in terms of monitoring and evaluating this area in the future.  I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy McDaid.</P>

      <P>This is the fifth time I have contributed to a debate on hepatitis C.  While many of the points may be repetitive, it demonstrates the ongoing problems associated with this matter. In the past I exempted the current Minister, Deputy Noonan and his predecessor, Deputy Howlin, from responsibility for the cause of hepatitis C.  However, the Minister has finally reached a conclusion today which would have been reached a year ago if he had listened to this side and had not dug his heels in so vehemently.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, 8 October 1996 the Minister moved an amendment to a motion on this issue. This was when I began to have doubts about his actions. The amendment stated:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann commends the Minister for Health for the comprehensive series of measures which he has taken in discharging his responsibilities in dealing with the consequences of the hepatitis C infection and in particular confirms its approval to: (1) the Scheme of Compensation published by the Minister for Health on 1 December 1995 which will continue indefinitely as an alternative to court proceedings for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from human immunoglobulin anti-D, blood transfusion or other products;</P>
      <P>The amendment continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> (ii) the proposals set out in the health care document published by the Minister for Health on 1 December 1995 in relation to the long-term health care needs of persons diagnosed positive for hepatitis C which provides statutory guarantees in respect of the future provision of health care services; and (iii) welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Health of the decision of the Government to move a motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas establishing a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921,...</P>
    <P>The Minister said he rejected totally the allegations and condemnations contained in the motion before the House that night.  He said that since he became Minister in December 1994, he had fully accepted his responsibilities as Minister for Health in dealing with the consequences of a human tragedy which had its genesis in events which occurred 20 years previously.  He said he had devoted more time to this problem than any other Minister in the past.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister tried to apportion blame to other sides of the House.  However, nobody said the Minister caused the hepatitis C infection, but he and former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, had responsibility.  Following all the convoluted preparations in recent months, we have now reached a position which would have been reached a year ago if the motions put down by this side on the issue had been accepted.</P>
    <P>Over 1,600 people have been infected with the hepatitis C virus.  Apart from the 1,000 women infected through anti-D, a large number of other people contracted the virus as result of blood transfusions, transplants and surgery.  Haemophiliacs infected with the virus have been totally ignored.  These aspects should be taken on board to avoid the need for another debate in relation to the Transfusion Positive group.  This matter should be dealt with once and for all today.  This debate would not have been necessary if the Minister had listened to the views expressed by this side on many occasions.</P>
    <P>The people involved in Transfusion Positive, particularly those who received transplants, are at a total disadvantage in comparison to women who contracted the virus from anti-D.  They can receive treatment with Interferon but people who received transplants cannot use the drug.  This issue will again arise unless it is considered now and the Government makes a positive decision about how it should be handled, once and for all.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of hepatitis C is one of the recurring nightmares of people who have anything to do with practising medicine.  Like most areas, medicine has been greatly enhanced by high technology and its resources.  Perhaps some of the problems arise because we are inclined to apply the technology of today to the problems of 1976 and 1977.  The technology available now was not applicable then.  However, the series of events the BTSB overlooked without the benefit of technology <Col N="1272" /> cannot be excused because simple procedures were in place.  I qualified in 1974 and I was told then that if a person has jaundice, their blood should not be used for transfusions.  Such matters are obvious without technology.  Medicine is a science which increasingly depends on the application of human resources.  Therefore, it is also subject to human error.  Something which might appear to be a small error, either in the performance of physical duties or in the correct keeping of records, can start a chain reaction. This happened in relation to hepatitis C and created this tragedy.</P>
    <P>I intend to outline where the current Minister and his predecessor acted irresponsibly on this issue.  Three patients have died, two of whom were from County Donegal, as a result of this tragedy.  When this issue is debated the Minister is a different person from the competent individual we know.  Given his actions in recent days, he exhibits the signs of some of the people who suffer from hepatitis C.  The Minister actually knows the resultant problems that have arisen and one can see how irate and angry he feels that this whole scandal has led to us finding ourselves in this position.</P>

      <P>The conditions and procedures for joining economic and monetary union &mdash; European Monetary Union &mdash; are set out in the Maastricht Treaty which was ratified in Ireland by a constitutional referendum. Just under 70 per cent of those who voted in that referendum voted in favour of the Maastricht Treaty and, consequently, for Ireland's participation in economic and monetary union in accordance with its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure which the treaty sets out for deciding which member states qualify for economic and monetary union is as follows: First, the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute will report on the achievement of a high degree of convergence by reference to the fulfilment by member states of the convergence criteria specified in the treaty.  These reports will also take account of the compatibility of member states' legislation with the treaty requirement for Central Bank independence, the development of the ecu, the results of integration of the markets, the situation and development of the balance of <Col N="1273" /> payments on current account and an examination of the development of unit labour costs.</P>
    <P>Second, the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, will decide, on the basis of ECOFIN recommendations, taking due account of these reports and the opinion of the European Parliament, which member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency.  The decision of Council will be taken in the spring of 1998 and will be based on the most recent and reliable data for 1997.</P>
    <P>The German and French Governments have stated quite clearly their determination to participate in economic and monetary union from 1 January 1999, the due starting date.  At its meeting in Brussels on Monday last the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers welcomed both the commitment given by the German authorities to take all necessary measures to avoid an overshooting of the 1997 deficit target and the commitment by France to take additional measures, if necessary, to achieve its 1997 budgetary objectives.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to speculate on the French and German Governments' economic forecasts for 1997.  However, I am confident that, with the political commitment among member states to the European Monetary Union timetable, sufficient convergence will be achieved to ensure it will be met in a way which will underpin the economic strength and stability of the euro area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister said he did not want to speculate on the position of the French or Germans but I might point out that that did not deter people in Germany in the past from commenting on the Irish position or criteria. However, I agree with the Minister that it is not his job to speculate on the German position since the same policy could be adopted by some of their spokespersons.</P>
      <P>This question really relates to whether the timescale or criteria are the more important in this regard.  With increasing evidence within European economies that neither Germany nor France may qualify &mdash; on an interpretation of the criteria relating to this and other matters when the Council meets in 1998 &mdash; is it now the Irish position that we have decided to join economic and monetary union, willy nilly, regardless of whether other member states meet the relevant criteria?  Is it the case that we have concluded our debate on the subject because, until recently, I understood our stance was relatively open whereas a statement by the Taoiseach on 4 March gave the impression we had concluded our debate and would join come what may?  Has the Irish Government taken that decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect the people took that decision when they voted in the referendum &mdash; that if Ireland meets the qualifying criteria we would join.  The Deputy's party was then in Government and we did not seek an opt-out clause on that occasion.  The outcome of that referendum <Col N="1274" /> commits us legally to alter our Constitution to participate.  We do not have an opt-out clause.  I am advised legally that we would not have the right in domestic law, without reference to the people, to unilaterally vary that timetable.</P>
      <P>I anticipate the decision to form the euro zone will be taken by the Heads of State or Government some time in late spring 1998.  It is clear that Ireland will qualify to join the Single Currency. In that respect I pay tribute to successive Governments on ensuring that, at the outset, we would meet the relevant criteria.  It is the intention of this Government, in accordance with our treaty obligations, to be among the first group of countries to participate in economic and monetary union.  That is not to say that the debate on the implications of our participation, that the necessity to prepare properly for its consequences has ended, or indeed that we should have regard to the possibility that one of our major trading partners, the United Kingdom, may choose to exercise its opt-out and not join on the commencement date of 1 January, 1999.</P>
      <P>We have conducted a major study through the ESRI, a copy of which report was sent to every Member, pointing out some of the exposures in certain sets of circumstances.  In answer to the Deputy's question whether our debate on the implications of joining European Monetary Union has ended, my answer is: no, and I would welcome continued debate.  However, the debate on our intention to join ended effectively with the successful outcome of the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.</P>

      <P>We have already had a debate on the legal position resulting from the people's decision in the referendum.  Does the Minister consider that economic and monetary union can last and succeed as the criteria for joining has been so watered down in recent years?  Can an economic and monetary union based on very flexible criteria &mdash; which will be interpreted very flexibly &mdash; succeed?  Bearing in mind that Ireland is talking from a position of strength &mdash; I anticipate we will meet the relevant criteria however they are interpreted &mdash; is it the Minister's view that an economic and monetary union can succeed and last if the economic criteria on which it is based have been so watered down?  Does he consider that such an economic and monetary union should be proceeded with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no watering down or change in the criteria.  At a meeting in Brussels on Monday last ECOFIN Ministers were given a report on the convergence programme in respect of the German and French economies.  Categorical assurances were given by the Minister for the German Federal Republic, Herr Weigel and for the French Republic, Monsieur Jean Arthuis, that it was their declared intention to meet the criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty.  Specifically in regard to the German economy, where there is some speculation as to whether the critical criterion <Col N="1275" /> of the budget deficit 3 per cent ratio will be met, they have revised their figures from 2.5 per cent, as set out in the programme, to 2.9 per cent.  Both Herr Weigel and Herr Jurgen Stark made it very clear that, if their expenditure profile throughout the year indicated that they would breach the 2.9 per cent deficit, they would take whatever expenditure decisions were necessary to comply with the criteria.  There is no watering down of the criteria.  In today's edition of the <i>Financial Times</i> the incoming President of the European Monetary Institute and the incoming President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Wim Duisenberg, from the Netherlands, has clearly stated it is essential that this project be soundly based.  I share that view.  Monetary Union must rest on sound fundamental principles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At the various ECOFIN councils I have attended and in the informal discussions that have taken place in the margins of those councils there has been no suggestion that anybody wants to water down the criteria.  The criteria have not been watered down.  The project will go ahead on 1 January, a critical mass of countries will qualify to participate on 1 January 1999 and Ireland will be among them.  As the Taoiseach said on 4 March it is the intention of this country to participate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making assertions about the outcome of negotiations which have not yet commenced.  Apart from being misleading, such assertions are not helpful as the Government is preparing its approach for the forthcoming negotiations on the Structural Funds post-1999.  As I stated on several occasions, the Government's objective will be to ensure that Ireland's interests are vigorously and effectively pursued and that the economic achievements which have led to the improvement in our relative position within the European Union are further maintained and continued.</P>
      <P>The current round of Structural and Cohesion funding expires at the end of 1999.  Negotiations on the future financing of the European Union will commence when the intergovernmental conference concludes, probably in mid 1997. Detailed negotiations on the Structural Funds will follow and are likely to be protracted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> The Government is developing its strategy for these negotiations to ensure the best possible outcome for Ireland, which has made very good use of Structural Funds, a fact recognised throughout the Community.  However, we still have some way to go before we attain the level of development of the more prosperous regions of the Community. In our negotiations with the Commission and the member states we will strive to ensure that Structural Funds continue to play an important part in achieving the economic and social cohesion which the Treaty requires and in consolidating the progress already made.</P>
    <P>As regards any change in the level of funding post 1999, I have already stated in reply to a question from Deputy Andrews on 13 February 1996 that it is the Government's intention to ensure that Ireland will adjust to the post-1999 situation with minimum budgetary dislocation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we can whistle by the graveyard and say nothing will change in 1999. Any realistic assessment of the figures would indicate we will have to develop a strategy to make up the shortfall which will inevitably happen at the end of this round of funds for the 1993-99 programme.  This was more or less signalled by the Taoiseach during a recent visit to Brussels when he said there would be an uphill fight. While I commend the Minister for not giving in at this stage we should be planning now for the future.  Has a strategy been developed and has an assessment been made of what amount of Exchequer funding will be required to make up the shortfall to continue to fund many infrastructural projects which will be needed post-1999? The Minister is correct in saying we have not completed our development and will need more funding for a wide range of capital projects.  No politician would predict that, when EU funds had been diminished, some projects will be abandoned. Has an assessment been made of the amount of Exchequer funding which the Irish tax-payer will have to put forward post-1999?  That is the least the Administration should do at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the spirit in which the Deputy posed the question and I understand and share some of his concerns.  The mid-term review of the existing national plan &mdash; Structural and Cohesion Funds programme which expires in 1999 &mdash; is under review.  A series of evaluation reports have been commissioned by the Commission. An overall evaluation, on behalf of the Commission, will take place and there will be discussions between ourselves and the Commission. That review process will take us into the months of July and possibly September.  The final timetable is not completed as much depends on the actual progress.  It will then set the balance for the final part of the period 1997-9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioner with responsibility for the Cohesion and Structural Funds &mdash; the regional component &mdash; Monika Wulf-Mathies has said on <Col N="1277" /> numerous occasion that Ireland has been the golden performer in terms of the utilisation of existing funds, that the funds, particularly the Cohesion Funds, have achieved in Ireland the purpose for which they were intended at the Council in Edinburgh and there will be no sudden or abrupt change in the flow of funding.  As to what precise change there will be in the overall funding, after 1999 &mdash; I am not being evasive &mdash; it is too early to say.  There is an assumption that the existing structure and composition of the funds will continue.  That assumption may not necessarily be valid.  There is clarity regarding the total overall European Union budget which is set at own resources of 1.27 per cent within which Structural Funds in their entirety will command 0.46 per cent &mdash; subject to confirmation.  Within those two fixed elements there is an enormous array of options.  The Government is adopting a negotiating position which will unfold irrespective of which combination of parties forms the next Administration.  We need to ensure we maximise our position.  We are in the process of preparing the ground in a way which will impress the Deputy although he will appreciate I am not in a position to outline in any great detail what that might be.  I assure the House we are doing good preparatory planning in relation to all these matters with the declared objective of ensuring Ireland maximises its entitlement and consequent drawdown of the funds we will still require to complete our development as an economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister about putting the best case forward and I appreciate that much planning has gone into it.  Will the Minister confirm if the figure for the total EU budget, as a percentage, has been agreed for the period 1999-2005?  Has the Commission made any decision at this stage?  If we know the total size of the pot we could start to pitch our demands at that end of the market?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="(Mr. Quinn) (Mr. Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>(Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The position of the Irish Government on participation in economic and monetary union is clear.  Ireland, unlike the UK, did not seek an opt-out from the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty related to economic and monetary union (EMU). Thus, the outcome of the 1992 referendum, when just under 70 per cent voted in favour of the Maastricht Treaty, was an endorsement of participation in EMU, regardless of whether the UK takes part at the outset.  Therefore, if we are judged to qualify, we have an obligation under the Treaty to join EMU at the outset.</P>
      <P>We are determined to qualify for EMU by fulfilling the Maastricht convergence criteria.  The track record of the Irish economy against the Maastricht criteria has been excellent.  We have been judged to have fulfilled the budgetary criteria in each of the years that the excessive deficit procedure has operated, our inflation and interest rates have remained within the parameters set down in the treaty and our currency continues to trade within the exchange rate mechanism.  The decision on EMU participation will be taken early next year in accordance with a procedure set out in the Treaty.</P>
      <P>First, the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute will report on the achievement of a high degree of convergence by reference to the fulfilment by member states of the convergence criteria specified in the treaty. These reports will also take account of the compatibility of member states' legislation with the treaty requirement for Central Bank independence, the development of the ECU, the results of integration of the markets, the situation and development of the balance of payments on current account and an examination of the development of unit labour costs.</P>
      <P>Second, the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government will decide, on the basis of ECOFIN recommendations, and taking due account of these reports, and the opinion of the European Parliament, which member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency.  The decision will be based on the most recent and reliable data for 1997.</P>
      <P>Of course, the question of whether the UK joins EMU at the outset is an important one for Ireland.  The UK Government has indicated that the question of whether the UK will participate in EMU from 1 January 1999 will not be decided until closer to that date.  It has not indicated that the UK will never enter economic and monetary union, nor even that it will not enter in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To understand better the overall economic implications for Ireland of EMU, including the implications if the UK decides not to enter.  I commissioned the ESRI last year, on the basis of a tender process, to conduct a study on the <Col N="1279" /> implications of economic and monetary union for Ireland.  The resulting report, <i>The Implications for Ireland of Economic and Monetary Union,</i> is a comprehensive analysis of the impact of EMU on the Irish economy.  This report has been published and has received a considerable amount of attention in the media, and generated a great deal of discussion of the implications for Ireland of economic and monetary union, even if the UK remained out.  A copy of the report was sent to every Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The main conclusion of the ESRI report was that membership of EMU for Ireland would, on balance, be economically advantageous even if the UK remain out and with allowance made for possible sterling-euro exchange rate turbulence. This conclusion was reinforced by the ESRI's view that the unquantifiable implications of EMU membership for Ireland &mdash; including the convenience of a common currency, the positive effect of Ireland's commitment to Europe on business confidence and investment, as well as wider intangible political factors &mdash; were also likely to be positive.</P>
    <P>However, the ESRI report makes clear that, while the overall impact of economic and monetary union membership would be positive for Ireland even if the UK remained outside, a sharp fall in sterling against the euro would give rise to significantly greater problems in some sectors of the economy than in others.  The challenge to all concerned, including the Government, is to continue working to minimise the exposure of the sectors concerned.  The ESRI report provides an excellent framework within which the challenge of EMU can be discussed.  Its publication reflects the importance which the Government attaches to stimulating and informing debate on the implications of EMU and the necessity for preparing for it.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of information available in respect of economic and monetary union.  In addition to the ESRI report, there is the national information programme which I launched last December, with the Minister for Employment and Enterprise and the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  The business information programme run by Forfás is part of this programme. The programme information documents have been circulated widely among businesses, and copies sent to every Member of the Oireachtas.  On a day to day basis, members of the Government have spoken in depth about the implications of EMU within their areas of responsibility.  The National Economic and Social Council has also undertaken work in this area, and will publish a study covering EU issues, including EMU, in the near future.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government will continue to give priority to communicating information on economic and monetary union and to stimulating a wide discussion on it and the preparations required for its 1 January 1999 start date.</P>
    <Col N="1280" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the point that Ireland voted to approve the Maastricht Treaty, which included a commitment to join economic and monetary union.  When that vote took place, there did not seem to be a prospect of Britain not joining EMU.  The attitude in Britain to this has changed dramatically.  Is the Minister aware that a general election campaign is beginning in Britain and that the two major parties are using their lack of willingness to join EMU as a major part of their campaigns? The Minister said the British Government has not stated it will not join EMU in 1999; how can he say that in the light of repeated statements by senior members of the British Cabinet who are trying to convey clearly to the public that they have no wish to do so?</P>
      <P>Given those circumstances and particularly the vulnerable nature of much of our trade with Britain, does the Minister not realise the serious risks involved and keep an open mind on this matter, as the British say? That might be preferable to committing us to a situation which could conceivably have catastrophic consequences if we lose our right to devalue and the British devalue significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was a member of the Cabinet at the time of the referendum in 1992. The Irish Government did not seek an opt-out at the time and it was clear from the outset that the British Conservative Party had a &ldquo;Eurosceptic&rdquo; position.  Mrs Thatcher's views on all things European are well known.  Mr. Major's difficulties are a matter of public record and those have intensified but it was clear at the time that the British Government was looking for an opt-out.  The Deputy's comments were interesting but would have been more effective if he had voiced them in the Cabinet in 1992, when negotiations were taking place and the opt-out could have been achieved.</P>
      <P>That said, the British Government position on all things European, from the Coal and Steel Treaty to the present, has been one of initial reluctance followed by an appraisal of the <i>realpolitik</i> of the situation, including a cost-benefit analysis of the benefits of such European matters to Britain.  At every point when it had to choose between further participation in Europe, it decided to participate, as happened recently with ERM.  We know what happened on 16 September 1992, when Britain was ejected from the ERM, because, many would argue, of an unrealistic exchange rate it sought with the Deutschmark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy O'Malley's description of catastrophic effects for the economy if we joined and Britain stayed out, I understand the Deputy's concern and do not deny many people share it. However, I draw his attention to the studies done on this matter, specifically that done by the ESRI. That report constructed a scenario where we joined, as we intend to do, Britain stayed out, and consequently sterling did not maintain a static value relationship with the euro but plunged rapidly <Col N="1281" /> in value by an unprecedented 20 per cent &mdash; sterling devalued by 10 per cent after Black Wednesday.  Against that background, the ESRI concluded that 28,000 jobs in the Irish economy would be lost.  No professional economist has denigrated the study's methodology.</P>
    <P>There are currently 1.3 million people at work, approximately 1,000 jobs per week are being created and redundancy figures are at an all-time low. Because of work done between September 1992 and late spring and summer 1993, we have a database through the Market Development Fund of just under 1,000 companies who fall into that vulnerable category. We have a profile of their areas of vulnerability if there were such a massive shift in sterling's value. Since then, a series of budgetary measures, variations in PRSI rates, reductions in corporation tax for small companies and an effective corporation tax rate of 28 per cent of the first £50,000 in profits have been among the steps we have taken to reduce their exposure.</P>
    <P>The ESRI postulated a fall of 20 per cent in sterling against the euro.  We are in the course of trying to construct a new study because what has happened is that sterling has risen in value against the basket of currencies.  If it were in the ERM at present it would be at a point close to 6.7 per cent in the ERM grid on the positive side.  Rather than postulate that sterling will fall, its perceived market link to the dollar has meant that it has risen in value.  I repudiate the Deputy's assertion that there will be &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; economic consequences if Ireland joins and Britain stays out.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy would agree that 20 per cent would represent the limit of a large range.  If the methodology of the study was wrong I would be the first to correct it but nobody has questioned the methodology.  In a range of constructed scenarios with a 20 per cent fall at one end, our exposure is 28,000 against an employment figure of 1.3 million.  With information we have to date we know that many of those jobs are in industries that are of low profitability, a mature age profile and possibly vulnerable in any circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the UK were to join economic and monetary union in the first round there would be no question of Ireland staying out. There is flexibility with regard to the stage two convergence criteria &mdash; I agree with the Minister's interpretation.  The more countries that can join in the first round the better from an Irish point of view.  If the UK and a larger group of countries remained outside &mdash; Italy and Spain, in particular &mdash; that would create a sizeable rump which might encourage others to remain outside. Would the Minister agree that from an Irish perspective at ECOFIN discussions the convergence criteria should be met but should be interpreted for what they are to ensure that as many countries as possible would meet the first round criteria? If the UK remains outside it is likely that it will join sooner rather than later in that scenario.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1282" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly agree with the Deputy's proposition.  The qualification for participation in economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999 as determined in spring 1998 should not be seen as a beauty contest.  It is important that the countries which qualify remain qualified.  The five criteria in the Maastricht Treaty are an attempt to quantify sustained and sustainable convergence for the participating member states.  It is more important that having qualified countries remain qualified.  This is the basis of the fears in some quarters about some of the Mediterranean countries which are attempting to qualify in a last dash.  Time will tell and the decision will be made in the late spring of 1998.</P>
      <P>It would be preferable if the UK were to join in the first round.  I concur with Deputy O'Malley's observation that it is most unlikely, whatever the outcome of the British general election &mdash; my preferences in that regard would be well known. I do not think it would be the decision of a new British Labour Party Government to join the first wave.  The British have not yet firmly indicated one way or the other and I do not think we can expect a firm declaration of any kind between now and polling day.  The debate in Britain is not so much about the merits of a single currency as the merits of residual British sovereignty.  That is an issue Britain must address.  As a neighbour and a fellow EU member state we must respect the manner in which they conduct that debate.</P>
      <P>It is preferable that the maximum number of countries should qualify initially because the larger the euro zone the more dominant and stable the currency will become and the more probable it will be that sterling outside the euro zone in the short-term will track the euro and remain in a stable relationship.  If it stays in a stable relationship to the punt, which would at that point be an integral part of the euro, the fears Deputy O'Malley has articulated would be considerably minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his detailed reply.  No other issue has a greater bearing on the economic welfare of the country. The Minister misquotes me as saying that it would be catastrophic if we joined EMU and Britain did not.  It would be catastrophic if we joined and Britain devalued not having joined. One of the findings of the ESRI study, by which the Minister puts much store, is that on the best case scenario joining EMU would increase the numbers employed in the Irish economy by approximately 25,000 within the first five years. Given that the numbers at work have increased by 150,000 between 1991 and 1996, a time of great exchange rate turbulence, it does not seem that the certainty of economic and monetary union will provide a great bonanza.</P>

    <P>The 1,000 or more vulnerable firms, on which the Minister says we have a profile as a result of <Col N="1283" /> the events of late 1992 and early 1993, in particular from the market development fund which I set up, were not saved by the market development fund but by the devaluation of 10 per cent at the end of January 1993.  The advice received by the Government from all quarters in the four months leading up to that was wrong.  Similar sources are giving advice on this issue now.  It was the devaluation which saved our economy in the period since early 1993.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the volume of our trade with the UK is greater than the combined volume of our trade with the prospective first wave members of EMU, namely France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria?  Can the Minister not take account of the risks we will take and the vulnerability of the industries referred to?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Deputy's supplementary questions.  I also welcome this debate and I notice the Chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs is in the Chamber.  We will publish an updated document shortly which will advance the debate further.  I hope it will facilitate discussion such as this in a mannered and measured way.</P>
      <P>The ESRI was rather sanguine about the net benefits in employment creation on the factor of the single currency <i>qua</i> the single currency.  I welcomed its modesty with the figures because it did not hype the matter one way or another.  There are some intangibles which are hard to quantify into net job additions.  The ESRI has addressed them without having put any quantitative figures on them.  There is no doubt that, particularly for small and medium sized enterprises, the benefits of a single currency will be considerable in terms of the savings on bank charges.  I had breakfast with a number of business people this morning and they indicated a related operating cost of between 2 and 3 per cent from transactions in various currencies.  These were businesses employing 50 to 150 people and exporting between 75 and 90 per cent of what they produce, to European markets mainly.  A 3 per cent margin on the bottom line is considerable.  There are benefits purely from an operational point of view.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if I misquoted the Deputy who referred to the catastrophic consequences subsequent to Britain choosing to devalue sterling in an opportune way.  We are not in a fixed exchange rate position any more and any attempt to devalue sterling, which is not in the ERM but is a floating currency, below what the markets pertain to be its realistic value would be a futile exercise as the markets would simply drive up its value again to an appropriate level.  This has happened in recent times.</P>

      <P>There was concern among British exporters who saw their market share beginning to disappear because of the rise in the value of sterling.  I am not an economist and am open to correction but my understanding is that sterling does not have the possibility for a strategic devaluation of the kind we saw on previous occasions.  If an attempt is made to devalue sterling it will have an impact on interest rates in the first instance and a consequent impact on inflation rates.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's last point is valid.  The advice he received when in Government, and which I subsequently received when I took up office, was that devaluation would bring about a very rapid increase in inflation in the short-term.  This was the fear which informed the professional economists inside and outside the Government.  The shared body of orthodox economic analysis said that devaluation would lead in the short-term to inflation.  However, this was not the experience in the United Kingdom or here.</P>
      <P>Economists are beginning to revisit this whole area and to ask why devaluation did not lead to the levels of inflation brought about by previous devaluations.  Having posed the same question as the Deputy the explanation given to me &mdash; I am not professionally competent to stand over it and give it for what it is worth &mdash; is that international global competition is much stronger now than it was five, seven or ten years ago.  The existence of the social partnership and the various pay agreements ensured there was no labour cost inflation in the short-term and the external inflationary pressures which one would have assumed would have come into the Irish economy from outside as a result of devaluation did not materialise.  This went against all the orthodox analysis by conventional economists.  We still have not got an authoritative reason for this being the case but the sincere advice given to the Government of which Deputy McCreevy and I became members was well intentioned and well informed on the basis of what was available at the time.  However, this did not accord with the outcome.</P>

      <P>No one would deny the fundamental importance of this matter to the economy. When talking about the United Kingdom one must take into account the huge advantage we should gain from lower interest rates within the EMU.  This must be factored in in terms of the effect.  When difficulties arose previously we used <Col N="1285" /> the marketing fund, but I think we are disallowed from again going down that road.  The two problems in regard to the United Kingdom is that it is mainly indigenous Irish companies which deal with this market and they account for a higher proportion of employment than other companies. It may be possible for a few large companies to engage in financial currency planning but this may prove difficult for smaller companies.  Has the Department had discussions on the possibility of setting up a group which would be representative of companies which would be directly affected as a result of the UK not joining economic and monetary union?  Such a group could plan ahead for currency fluctuations and the prospect of devaluation, thereby ensuring they did not have the same enormous impact.  I agree with the Minister that it is not as easy for the UK to devalue its currency as its employment costs could increase considerably as a result.  The Government may not be able to participate fully in this area but it could act as a driving force in setting up such a group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that membership of EMU will give us lower interest rates.  One presumes that our interest rates will converage closer to the present German and French rates, thereby giving a reduction of 2 per cent plus in the SDF.  The prospect is that this would be a medium term gain, by which I mean four, five or six years and beyond.</P>
      <P>On the question of hedging or forward planning, this is expensive and the smaller the company the less prospect there is of doing this.  We do not have any proposals in this area at present. However, we are looking at all the implications, of which this is one.  One of the four associated banks &mdash; not one of the two larger ones &mdash; carried out a study two years ago on the number of companies in this sector which had made provision for currency hedging and forward planning.  I think approximately 30 per cent of these companies had made such provision.  Perhaps the Central Bank and the associated banks should consider offering this service to companies &mdash; they know their customers better than any Government could possibly know them &mdash; and, if appropriate, group companies together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The market development fund was indulged by the Commission in 1992-3 because of the extraordinary circumstances at that time.  However, this was clearly seen as being in breach of the text of the treaty, if not its spirit.  Nevertheless it was provided for because of the circumstances which pertained at that time.  This would not be allowed now as it would be seen as a State aid and anti-competitive. As I outlined in my reply to Deputy O'Malley, since 1992 we have addressed many of the cost structures which made some of those 1,000 companies vulnerable but there is still much to be done.  The rate of corporation tax paid on <Col N="1286" /> profits has been reduced, while labour costs have been reduced through exempting the first £80 from PRSI.  Many of the companies trading into the UK have high labour costs and are vulnerable on that front.  More needs to be done in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the debate about entry to EMU has been obscured to some extent by our relationship with sterling?  It has certainly obscured other concerns about this very fundamental matter.  Most of us were Members of the House in 1979 when we broke with sterling.  Almost every prediction made at that time about our future relationship with sterling following that break did not come true.  For example, we did not revalue and the value of the punt decreased by approximately 22 per cent at one stage.</P>
      <P>My concern relates not to sterling but rather to a possible conflict between the criteria and the timetable.  Today's newspapers predict that the German GDP-debt ratio will be as much as 2 or 3 per cent greater than 60 per cent.  If we do not meet this criterion will we simply fudge it and, if so, will this weaken the new currency?  What provision has been made for a future possible asymmetric shock throughout the zone or in one of its larger countries?  What steps are being taken to enhance parliamentary accountability in this jurisdiction to ensure that we live comfortably and perform well within the fiscal constraints which are part and parcel of this proposal?  What are the implications for labour costs and rigidities? These are issues we must address and cannot push under the carpet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy posed four questions. In respect of the German debt to GDP ratio, which is rising rather than falling as is the case in most other countries, the point was made last Monday at the ECOFIN Council, with considerable validity, that in its absorption of the former German Democratic Republic and the debts associated with companies in that country, Germany added approximately 13 percentage points to its debt to GDP ratio in a single transaction. That was a once off absorption.  Germany is continuing to add to its overall national debt because of the extraordinary cost of the absorption of the former East German lander.  One could argue in retrospect that the one for one policy enunciated by Chancellor Kohl was economically unsound, whatever about its political motivation, but the Germans have said as recently as last Monday that in respect of that particular criteria, there are unique, historical once off factors that must be taken into account.  The debt to GDP ratio would have posed a problem anyway because Belgium's debt is 120 plus percentage points relative to GDP, but since that debt is denominated virtually entirely in Belgian francs and owned by Belgian citizens, it does not have the same degree of exposure as the composition of national debt in <Col N="1287" /> other countries.  In respect of that particular criterion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a formula will be found because it would be inconceivable to have a euro currency which could not be used in Brussels.  The Belgian current budget deficit is being brought under control, but it will take some time to bring its national debt to GDP ratio under control.</P>
      <P>With regard to when the asymmetrical shock to the European Union as a whole will occur, the biggest asymmetrical shocks we have absorbed in this country were self-imposed.  They include the equal treatment payments; the Army deafness compensation claims will have to be dealt with; and the total cost of the hepatitis C compensation payments over a three year period, which nobody is suggesting should not be paid &mdash; I do not want to convey that impression &mdash; will be approximately £180 million, if not more.  The biggest asymmetrical shocks this economy has experienced in recent times, with the exception of BSE which was far less than originally anticipated, were generated from within.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy there should be more parliamentary accountability, in this House and between the institutions of the European Union and the Parliament and the European Central Bank, when it is established, and the Council of Ministers.  I am among those who argue for a greater degree of accountability between the ECOFIN Council and the Parliament on the one hand, and the ECOFIN Council and national parliaments on the other, but that is a matter for another debate.</P>
      <P>With regard to labour costs, the Irish economy, as a result of Partnership 2000, is probably better placed than any other in the European Union to address this issue.  I refer the Deputy to paragraph 2.1 of the programme which specifically states that all the undertakings with regard to the reduction in tax on the one hand and pay increases on the other are conditional on us continuing to meet the criteria for participation in Maastricht.  In the event of a crisis those commitments would have to be revisited.  We have anticipated the question posed by the Deputy.  In relation to Irish labour costs, we have sought a formal mechanism, which hopefully we will never have to use, that could be invoked in the event of such a cirsis.  It would be subject to negotiation, but it has been anticipated and written into the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank is responsible for the day-to-day operation of monetary policy, which has as its objective the achievement of price stability.  Essentially price stability means low inflation, which has been a cornerstone of Ireland's economic success in recent years.  As Minister for Finance, I am concerned about the possible emergence of inflationary pressures, including pressures in the housing market, in the context of the impact of inflation on the performance of the economy.  The Deputy can be assured that my concerns in relation to inflationary pressures are conveyed, as appropriate, to the Governor and board of the Central Bank by the Secretary of my Department, who sits on the board of the Bank.  At an operational level, I assure the Deputy also that officials of my Department and of the Central Bank exchange information on inflationary developments in the economy.</P>
      <P>In its spring bulletin released last week, the Central Bank expressed concerns about the possible emergence of inflationary pressures in the economy, citing in particular the situation in the domestic housing market.  While sharing the Central Bank's concerns in this regard, my Department forecasts a continuation of moderate inflation in 1997, with the consumer price index forecast to rise by just over 2 per cent for the year as a whole.  This forecast is based on a number of factors.  On the external front, the strength of the pound on a trade-weighted basis, combined with subdued international inflation, should exert a downward influence on Irish inflation.  Domestically, the new national agreement, Partnership 2000, should ensure wage moderation over the next three years.  A heightened level of competition in many areas of retailing, such as health insurance, mobile telephony and consumer electronics, should also prove helpful, as will the Government's commitment to a vigorous competition policy, as shown by the reconstitution, with new powers and greater resources, of the Competition Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of house price inflation, which is currently considerably higher than the general inflation rate, partly reflects the remarkable progress of the economy in recent years.  Lower interest rates, changing demographics, increased incomes and unprecedented employment growth can all be related to the trend in house prices. Nevertheless, there are clear grounds for concern that persistent high house price inflation may generate inflationary pressures indirectly in other areas of the economy, perhaps mediated through what economists call a &ldquo;wealth effect&rdquo;.  Such a development would be detrimental to the interests of borrowers and lenders alike, the construction industry and the economy generally, and so the trend over the near term future will require close attention.  I should add that the <Col N="1289" /> monthly statistics for inflation, which we are required to publish from this year, are available today for the month of February, and the figure is 1.5 per cent.  The harmonised index of consumer price inflation for the whole of the European Union is 1.7 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expressed some concern about inflationary pressures in the housing market, as has the Governor of the Central Bank and many others.  Has the Department of Finance given any consideration to introducing measures to reduce inflation in this regard?  We do not have to look too far to realise the way people's lives can be adversely affected if there is a downturn in the market or interest rates rise. Has consideration been given to introducing some measures in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about this matter. Notwithstanding the fact that much of the demand in the housing sector is additional demand and, therefore, quite healthy, there appears to be a great deal of evidence, confirmed last Friday in the business section of <i>The Irish Times,</i> of some lending institutions breaking the conventional criteria of lending prudence, the 2.5 per cent ratio of the first income and 95 per cent of the purchase price of the house.  That is an imprudent process, perhaps being undertaken by some lending institutions because of the strong competitive pressures in the lending market.  In some cases, if the borrower is facilitated in excess of what prudence would otherwise recommend, any change in that borrower's circumstances could create difficulties.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the outrageous way in which the British housing market was run, largely driven by banks and brokers, in the mid 1980s when multiples of four times a person's income could be obtained.</P>
      <P>In some cases two strangers, not a married couple or a couple living together, but two strangers not romantically involved were able to get separate mortgages on the same property and thus were locked into the ownership of the property. If, as happened from time to time, one of them got into difficulties, there were problems in exiting the contract because of the fall in the housing market.  As to what we can do about it, I was criticised by a number of people when I increased stamp duty from 6 per cent to 9 per cent on second-hand residential property valued over £150,000.  One would have thought, given classical economics, that raising the access price or putting a levy on it would have damped down prices.  It does not appear to have done that, but I do not think the Deputy is recommending that I increase it.</P>

I will be having further talks with the Governor of the Central Bank and others to see if there are other measures we can take.  One does not want to interfere with a healthy demand.  Nor should the lending institutions fuel this process by lending more than is prudent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of today's announcement that inflation is at 1.5 per cent, and I concur with the view that the figures are remarkable.  In the past six or seven months, on the occasions we had the Governor of the Central Bank before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, it was anticipated on the markets, with good reason, that inflation should be higher than indicated by the figures now coming out.  That is not to say that I am unhappy with the figures; I am delighted with them, but they leave me with some questions.  Given difficulties we had in the past, is the Minister entirely satisfied with the criteria used in arriving at those figures, and can he stand over them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the criteria and methodology for compiling the figures because, in effect, they are compiled in consultation with Eurostat, the European Union body which is similar to our Central Statistics Office and which compiles the component elements that go to make up the basket of consumption against which the consumer price index is measured.  The Irish domestic CPI on a year to year basis is up to 1.5 per cent against a projected annual average of 2 per cent.  If one were to take the European basket, which is different from the domestic basket, the CPI would be up by 1.7 per cent, the reason being that the European basket does not include mortgage repayments which are low in the Irish context.  Nor does it include third level fees, because in the rest of the European Union third level fees do not exist in the main, although private colleges obviously do have fees.  The composition of the basket, the European and the Irish, is a matter for professional statisticians.  I have no problem with that.  It comes back to the impact of devaluation on inflation.  There has been a shift in the world's economies to which we have not yet fully adjusted.  The effect of global competition on European products and producers is much greater than many people had anticipated. The concern being expressed in recent times in Belgium and in other countries about unfair competition from one quarter to another is missing the main point, which is that Europe is now part of a much more in integrated global market and there are very strong competitive downward price pressures coming into the European market from which we, as consumers, benefit.  We are losing jobs in some sectors as a result, but that is a separate debate on which the European Union has to focus increasingly.  I had sight of the <Col N="1291" /> figures just before I came into the House.  Our food and clothing prices are down more than was anticipated, having regard to conventional performance. My conclusion is that something fundamental is happening in the global economy that is having a greater impact in downward prices and, consequently, on inflation than conventional analysis would have given us reason to expect. That is a preliminary reply, not necessarily a comprehensive or complete one.</P>

      <P>My question related to the inflationary aspects of the housing market.  There is a certain unreality about the consumer price index in this regard.  Because it is a consumer price index, it does not measure inflation in the price of housing.  If mortgage interest rates went up they would be reflected in the consumer price index.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchase price of a house is not reflected in the CPI.  Therefore, this question is irrelevant to the CPI as it relates to inflationary pressures in the housing market.  Furthermore, there is inflation in the housing market to the extent that wages have gone up.  It is almost impossible to employ tradesmen in Dublin or in any other part of Ireland and one pays an extraordinary price for them.  We have what most people see as inflation in the rising cost of housing and in the wages of people working in the industry.  That is not reflected in the consumer price index, nor could it be because the consumer price index has little relevance to inflation in the housing market where inflation is occurring.  In the event of a downturn in the economy or a rise in interest rates some people will be in serious difficulty.  Currently there is no better way of measuring inflation.  However, the consumer price index does not reflect the real inflation that is occurring in the construction sector of the economy. Another way of measuring it will have to be found.  Otherwise we will apparently have very low inflation, but when the whole thing falls apart we will be wondering what happened, even though we know there is inflation in the sector we are concerned about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer price index is essentially the current account, comparing annual current outgoings rather than capital acquisitions. The Department of the Environment, in conjunction with the Construction Industry Federation, <Col N="1292" /> does publish figures relating to construction data, of which labour unit costs would be one.  The last forecast that I saw from one of the private analysts was of labour unit cost inflation for last year of approximately 8 per cent against a background of 2 per cent &mdash; that would reflect what the Deputy is saying.  It is also what we are all hearing. One only has to go outside this building to see the many tall cranes against the skyline. While that is very welcome, it creates its own pressures.  We can respond to this in a variety of ways.  As a number of building society chief executives have said, there are now far more people at work with salaries that can command mortgages who want to buy houses.  Nobody should stand in the way of that aspiration, but the lag time in meeting the demand by way of additional supply is quite long because it takes time to get houses on stream.  One of the ways to address this issue is to ensure that there is an increase in the amount of serviced land available. That is a matter for local authorities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell and I served our apprenticeship on Dublin Corporation and the Deputy will well remember that in the period 1974 and beyond when Dublin Corporation wanted to build houses at a higher density than ten to the acre in what was then County Dublin, it was prevented from doing so because Dublin County Council adopted what was called a suburban attitude to housing.  The unit cost of servicing an acre of land on which only ten houses were built was obviously much higher than in areas of comparable density such as Ranelagh or Phibsboro where 20 to 25 houses were built to the acre.  Getting a higher density per acre would be one way of increasing supply without increasing the capital infrastructure involved, but all these things take time.</P>
      <P>There has undoubtedly been an increase in profits by builders since the demand has increased.  From our own analysis, we are aware that houses that were intended to sell at a retail price of about £150,000 increased to £170,000 or £180,000 on the day because the demand is there. Some of that money will come back in corporation tax and there will be recycling involved, but the housing market is immensely complex.  My concern is that, as a society in which lending institutions have a key role to play, we do not repeat the disastrous mistakes that occurred in the United Kingdom under a Conservative Chancellor in the 1980s, fuelled by a very irresponsible policy of lending institutions of that time.  The lessons of that disaster are there for all of us to analyse.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the ruling of the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice that civil servants on job-sharing schemes should receive incremental credit based on their calendar years of service, rather than hours worked; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to express my views on what is essentially a legal matter of interpretation, particularly as the matter is still before the European Court of Justice. I will, however, take the opportunity to clarify a number of apparent misunderstandings which are reflected in the Deputy's question: first, the Advocate General has delivered an opinion rather than a ruling and, second, the case relates to civil servants moving from job-sharing to whole-time working rather than to civil servants who are actually job-sharing.</P>
      <P>The opinion of Advocate General La Pergola, which was delivered last month in Luxembourg, is under consideration in consultation with the Attorney General's office, pending the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point of the opinion &mdash; it is an opinion rather than a ruling; the court makes the ruling &mdash; is that the same credit should be given for calendar years of job-sharing as are given for full time calendar years.  Does that seem unfair, incongruous and unnecessarily expensive? Is the Minister aware that in the great majority of cases the opinion of the Advocate General tends to be accepted by the court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second part of the Deputy's question, it is normal practice to work on the basis that an opinion will be upheld by judgement of the court.  The Deputy is more learned in these matters than I am, but that is my understanding. Within the Civil Service it is standard practice to reckon only actual paid service so that a person working part time for the full year as against a person working full time for the whole year would be <i>ipso facto</i> entitled to 50 per cent of pension. It is based not on the calendar year but on the time given on the job.  I do not wish to comment further until a formal judgment is made, and we will have to consider the consequences at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a little like the case where those who came to work in the vineyard in the ninth hour received the same wage as those who had arrived before the heat of the day.  While in one capacity I must accept the validity of that ruling, it would be fairer if the European Court <Col N="1294" /> of Justice did not follow that precedent in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The decision of the Advocate General is extraordinary.  If the ruling is adhered to by the court what will be the estimated cost to the Exchequer?  I would not like the Minister for Finance to be forced to abolish the job-sharing scheme because of the cost involved.  Perhaps the trade union that brought the case to the European Court will bear that in mind.  That would be one alternative to cut down on the cost, but I do not think that will be done, nor would I advocate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The total number employed in the public service on 1 January 1997 was 218,967 compared to a figure of 204,394 on 1 January 1992.  The corresponding figures for the Civil Service were 29,237 on 1 January 1997 and 27,030 on 1 January 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> The evolution of these figures is set out in the following table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Public services are, of their nature, labour intensive.  New or expanded services have inevitable consequences for staffing levels.  In recent years, there has been an increase in staff numbers reflecting improved services arising from successive Government programmes.  The growth in public service numbers since 1992 mainly reflects improvements in services provided in the health and education sectors.  In the health sector, this has been due to a wide range of improvements in hospital and other services, in particular, acute hospitals, nurse education and training, mental handicap and child care.  In education, increased staffing levels have resulted from Government policy to improve retention rates at second level and in response to increased student numbers at second and third level.  The commitment to improve the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level has also maintained staffing levels in cases of falling enrolments.</P>
    <P>In the Civil Service, successive Governments have responded to demands for the improvement of existing services or the introduction of new ones.  The growth has mainly occurred in Justice &mdash; in areas such as the prison service, support staff for the gardaí and the courts &mdash; and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Recognising the need to ensure that the increase in public service numbers does not place too great a burden on the economy, the Government has introduced measures to control growth <Col N="1296" /> in various sectors, taking account of economic and social needs.  There is a consistent policy to contain overall public service numbers, to agree to increases only where there is a compelling social, economic or administrative case for doing so, and to reduce numbers where feasible.  Upper limits have been set on the level of recruitment to the health and education sectors as part of the process of settling the annual expenditure estimates.</P>
    <P>In the Civil Service an embargo was introduced in mid-1995 on the creation of new posts, as well as a one-in-three restriction on the filling of vacancies. This was superseded in mid-1996 by a new approach whereby the Government set a core manpower target for each Department or office, to be achieved by 1 July 1997.  In many cases, this will involve actual reductions in numbers.</P>
    <P>Departments have been reminded recently of their requirement to meet these targets.  Specific Government sanction is required before an additional post can be created.  As a result of these measures, non-industrial Civil Service numbers, which had peaked at 29,491 on 1 January 1996, dropped to 29,237 on 1 January 1997, a decrease of 254 over that 12 month period.</P>
    <P>In the public service overall, there was an increase of more than 14,500 posts between 1 January 1992 and 1 January 1997.  However, the Government's policy is making an impact.  In recent years the growth in numbers has slowed considerably.  The increase in numbers in 1996 was just over 600, which compares favourably with increases of approximately 3,000 and 4,500 in the preceding two.</P>

      <P>The figures quoted by the Minister are at variance with official figures published by the CSO in February 1997 which are higher by several percentage points.  At the end of 1995 total public sector employment had increased to 281,000.  Is the continuing upward trend not regrettable, particularly with the advent of computerisation on a wide scale and bearing in mind the expensive efforts in the late 1980s to reduce numbers?  They were back to their original level within a relatively short period in the 1990s?</P>

      <P>I will clarify the discrepancy the Deputy has brought to my attention and we can examine the figures later.  I share the Deputy's concern.  My Cabinet colleagues are acutely aware of my concern in this regard.  There have been repeated demands from parties on all sides for an improvement in services, such as child care and prison facilities, all of which are labour intensive. The SMI is an attempt to introduce over a period structural change in the operation and performance of the public service, particularly the Civil Service.  We will mimic what has happened in some areas of the private sector where productivity has increased with similar, and in some cases smaller numbers, because of the advent of new technology and changed working practices, but that will take time.  In the meantime, we have capped the number in the Civil Service with particular reference to Health and Education.  That is not to say, however, there is not a constant demand for improvement in services from Members on all sides of the House.  Because of economic constraints, this and successive Administrations will have to improve the quality of services while at the same time not increasing on a <i>pro rata</i> basis the number of people employed.</P>

      <P>The report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board contains the truth about the worst scandal in the history of the State in terms of our health service. It documents in detail, with chilling clarity, the damage that has been done to the lives of many hundreds of our citizens by the negligent actions of senior people with responsibility for the safety of the blood supply from 1970 to the early 1990s. It will serve as a permanent reminder of the terrible harm which can be done when a vital component of the health services loses sight of the fundamental objective of preserving and enhancing human health.  Such is the extent of the tragedy that it has touched almost every community. Since the facts of the tragedy first emerged most of us have witnessed the personal and deep harm visited by the infection of anti-D on many women and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health for the nine month period from February to November 1994, following revelation of the infection of anti-D, I had the privilege of meeting many of the women who were infected both individually and, from May of <Col N="1300" /> that year, through their representative organisation, Positive Action.  I was struck then &mdash; I still am &mdash; by the magnanimity and lack of bitterness that exists among those women.  All they wanted were answers and assurances that nothing like this would happen again.</P>
    <P>We have arrived at the end of a long process of examination begun by the expert group which I, as Minister, set up on 4 March 1994, and now completed by the publication of the report of the tribunal of inquiry.  The reports of the expert group and the tribunal have provided the answers to the questions which were posed.  Many of the actions which have been identified as central to the anti-D infection are, quite frankly, hard to understand.</P>
    <P>On the day the report of the tribunal was published, the Government referred it to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  His decision on the contents of the report is a matter exclusively for himself and his statutory independent role.</P>
    <P>In relation to the role of the Department of Health in 1994 and myself as Minister of the day, the report is both balanced and fair.  A number of criticisms have been levelled at my handling of this crisis both during the tribunal proceedings and in the media over recent months.  These relate to the setting up of an expert group rather than a tribunal of investigation to investigate the infection of anti-D in the first instance; the choice of the BTSB as the agency best suited to carry out the screening programme; and the recall of the anti-D product and what information was given regarding the 1989 infection.</P>
    <P>Following four hours of evidence, cross-examination by five senior counsel and a detailed discussion of all the issues by Mr. Justice Finlay in his report, the handling of the crisis by the Department of Health and myself, as Minister of the day, have been found to be deficient on three specific points.  These relate to the recall of the product, the advice of the group of hepatologists to the BTSB regarding referral criteria and the delay in putting independent counselling in position. While I accept these are valid criticisms, I would like to make a number of points.</P>
    <P>Regarding the recall of the product, the Department of Health was informed on 17 February 1994 by the BTSB that it had commenced a recall of anti-D by telephone.  This was followed up by letters which confirmed the product was withdrawn and that unused stocks should be returned.  This recall procedure compares to similar procedures in other countries.  Physical recall is not, to my knowledge, part of the recall procedure in any country.  I was appalled when I heard the recall had been incomplete and, while none of the women who were administered the product were infected, it is not a matter which I take lightly.  I must make it clear that the recall was one of a number of decisions which I had to make at the time.  I was informed it was being done.  There is no excuse for it not having been done.</P>
    <P>The criticism of the Department and myself <Col N="1301" /> regarding the advice of the hepatologists relates to a difference of opinion at a medical and scientific level.  The medical advice of my Department and the BTSB differed from that of the group of hepatologists on the issue of at what stage women should be referred for liver biopsy and further tests.  It is not an issue on which I personally adjudicated; clearly, I had no expertise to make that medical decision.  However, as Minister of the day, I accept the criticism.</P>
    <P>The third issue related to the provision of independent counselling.  On 19 May 1994 Positive Action informed the Department that some of its members were unhappy with the counselling service which was being provided by the BTSB and requested that an independent service be made available.  From the previous March an independent counselling service had been provided in Cork by the Southern Health Board, and from that May an independent counselling service was provided in Dublin through the Well Woman Centre.  Finding suitable counsellors was a matter of ongoing difficulty, both for the BTSB and other agencies involved in providing the service. However, I accept there was a delay of some months before such independent services became widely available throughout the country.</P>
    <P>These are the criticisms levelled at me as the Minister of the day and the Department by the report of the tribunal of inquiry which is before the House.  They relate to three matters which could, and should, have been done better.  It is a matter of public record, both in the report of the tribunal and that of the expert group, that none of these delays or shortcomings resulted in a single person being infected by hepatitis C.  It is a matter of public record that from the day the Department and I were made aware of the crisis no person was infected with hepatitis C through the anti-D product.</P>
    <P>It is little comfort to me that the report of the tribunal has endorsed my actions as Minister at the time.  Vindication is not something for which I waited expectantly the day the report was forwarded to the Government.  This was, simply put, the most difficult issue I have had to deal with in my political career to date.  I dealt with this issue from mid-February to the end of November 1994. During that period, the senior Department officials handling the issue did little else.  Even before this tribunal sat and heard the many weeks of evidence, I was certain everyone associated with this issue at senior level had given it 100 per cent.  They did their best, as did I.  I do not believe any Minister or set of officials, faced with the rapidly changing circumstances and the poor state of scientific knowledge of the disease, could have handled in a perfect manner every aspect of the crisis as it unfolded.</P>
    <P>The report of the tribunal sets out in chapter 13 the background against which my officials and I were obliged to work.  The report states:</P>
    <P>They were dealing with what had been properly described by some of the witnesses as the most devastating calamity of a public health <Col N="1302" /> nature which had occurred since the foundation of the State.  They were also dealing with a particular form of calamity, namely a major infection of a nationally distributed blood product of which not only had there been no previous experience in Ireland and, therefore, no pattern of conduct or reaction created in Ireland but which had not been experienced in any other European country either.</P>
    <P>It was against this background and in this context that this major national crisis unfolded and a series of actions took place at a number of different levels.  It is important to put on the record how well most of the things we were required to do were done.  It is important to do so for all those who worked day and night dealing with this crisis through the months which followed.</P>
    <P>The report of the tribunal lists at least 14 separate actions which were found to have been correct. These include having the BTSB carry out the national screening programme, informing the general practitioners at the same time the screening programme was announced and the setting up of an expert group.  All of these actions have met with criticism in recent months.</P>
    <P>The report set out seven headings under which my actions and those of the Department of Health were to be judged.  These headings included ensuring no further infection could have possibly occurred; ensuring that an anti-D product free from infection replaced the existing one and was immediately available; finding out who was already infected; maintaining, as far as possible, confidence in the BTSB and the blood supply; arranging treatment, counselling and help for the victims of the infection; finding out what had happened to cause the infection of the anti-D and dealing with the problems within the BTSB and its organisations.  A series of important actions, many of which were uncontroversial, and which, therefore, did not feature in the discussions of the tribunal, were undertaken under each of these headings.  Only three specific actions attracted criticisms after the most thorough evaluation of every aspect of our actions of the time.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the report of the tribunal, a number of commentators and some Members of this House have attempted to second guess the tribunal's findings and report.  In a particularly &mdash; but characteristically nasty &mdash;contribution, Deputy Cowen went much further.  He set himself up as his own personal tribunal, reweighed the evidence and came to his own set of partisan, biased and untrue conclusions.  I propose to deal with the charges I can disentangle from his unique political bile.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen charges that I misled the Cabinet, the Dáil and the victims of this awful tragedy. On 17 February 1994, when the infection of the anti-D product was brought to the attention of the Department of Health and to me as Minister, there was definite evidence of infection for the year 1977.  There was no firm evidence of infection for any other year.  Over that weekend, during discussion with officials in my Department at <Col N="1303" /> the time and the BTSB, it emerged the board had suspicions about product made from donations in 1989.  Tests were being undertaken but no firm evidence was available.  As a result of that information, a decision was made that every woman who had received anti-D since its introduction up to the date of withdrawal of the product should be tested.</P>
    <P>Neither my officials nor I had any confidence in the anti-D product in its entirety and we did not believe we could have confidence that the product was safe in any other year.  The suspicion of an infection related to a 1989 donation reinforced my opinion that we could have been dealing with any number of separate incidents of infection.</P>
    <P>The screening campaign and the public announcement related to it were specifically designed to ensure that all women who had received anti-D were screened, and the vast majority were.  By 9 March 1994, approximately two weeks after the screening process began, almost 31,000 women had been tested by the BTSB.  This figure rose to 52,000 by May of that year and by 17 January 1995, it had reached a figure of 56,000.  It is estimated that up to 60,000 could have potentially been infected.</P>
    <P>All the public statements which I made at the time as Minister, both inside and outside this House, emphasised that every woman who had received the product should come forward for testing.  There was an understandable focus on women who received anti-D in the 1977 period, and the figures which emerge from the screening programme bore out the correctness of that approach.  The number of women infected in that period was greater by a factor of up to ten for any other period.  The emphasis was correct.</P>
    <P>However, I made it clear at the outset that all anti-D was potentially infected and all the media campaigns reinforced that message.  I invite people to revisit the campaigns of the time.  There is no mention of any specific year in the advertisements that were placed in every newspaper. They call on all women who received anti-D to come forward for testing.</P>
    <P>According to the Official Report, 22 February 1994, Vol. 439, col. 300 and col. 301, I told the Dáil:</P>
    <P>When this matter was brought to my attention, my immediate concerns were: (i)  the protection of all future recipients of anti-D immunoglobulin and (ii)  the identification of any risk, however small, for any mothers who received the anti-D immunoglobulin in the past. ... Because we cannot be sure that the problem is confined to 1977, the Blood Transfusion Service Board is advising any woman who received anti-D to be tested.</P>
    <P>In an <i>aide memoire</i> to Government on 9 March 1994, I set out the state of knowledge of the BTSB as it was given to me on that day regarding the initial screening results.  It was thought at that <Col N="1304" /> time, a matter of two weeks into the screening, that there was a low prevalence of antibody positive tests among women who received anti-D in years other than 1977.  I stated in the <i>aide memoire</i> that &ldquo;the board maintains that, thus far, there is no definitive evidence to suggest that women from years other than '77 have the antibodies through the administration of anti-D&rdquo;.  It was only when a large number of women had come forward for testing and those tests were statistically analysed that a group of women who had been infected in the 1991 period from the 1989 donor emerged.  I kept my Government colleagues apprised of the progress of the screening programme throughout my period as Minister.</P>
    <P>The second charge levelled at me by Deputy Cowen is that I left the State response in the hands of those who caused it.  Other than the issue I have already dealt with, the following actions were taken: There was a major public announcement and press conference by the BTSB on Monday, 21 February 1994, the first working day after I was told and after we had worked through the weekend to put the screening process in place.  A major media campaign in national and local newspapers was immediately initiated, calling on all women who had received anti-D to be screened for hepatitis C and an information pack was sent to all GPs so that they too would be fully briefed.</P>
    <P>A national screening programme of unprecedented scale was put in place.  Is Deputy Cowen or anybody suggesting that the BTSB was not the most suitable body to undertake this programme? No expert or administrator has so far suggested that it was not the appropriate body and the tribunal has independently decided on this matter. The BTSB had received anti-D and of course it was the most efficient body to undertake the screening.</P>
    <P>The contaminated anti-D produce was replaced by a virally inactivated product from Canada. Again, my handling of this replacement was judged to have been the correct course of action. For persons who were diagnosed positive for hepatitis C under the screening programme, acute hospital services were negotiated and put in place in special units in six designated hospitals, in Beaumont, the Mater, St. Vincent's and St. James's hospitals in Dublin and in Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.  Again, the tribunal found that the services provided were adequate and appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ex gratia</i> payments were made available from the beginning of the screening programme for women in financial need.  A total of 563 women availed of these and the total sum disbursed amounted to £665,000.  The tribunal again found these arrangements to be adequate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen made political charges which were untrue.  He stated that eight people were contaminated subsequent to the withdrawal of the product in February 1994.  In fact, no woman was infected by anti-D subsequent to my being informed of the problem in that month.  That is <Col N="1305" /> an unprecedented mistake for the Deputy to have made in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowen charges me with establishing an information system from the beginning of the crisis which focused on 1977 batches of anti-D.  I invite the House to sample the advertisements which were carried in all the national and local newspapers at the time.  They make no mention of 1977 but called on all women who had received anti-D to be screened.  He charged me with having a lack of concern for the affected women.  Ms Pollard, a representative of Positive Action, in an interview on RTE on 5 January 1995 said Positive Action was delighted, that Deputy Howlin when he was Minister for Health treated them very sympathetically and that they were delighted Deputy Noonan had taken it on so speedily.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowen complained that I did not sack anybody in the BTSB.  I set up an expert group to get at the full truth.  Should I have sacked people first and then set up the investigation? This tragedy began more than 20 years ago, but it has only come to light in our time.  I have held ministerial office for more than four years.  In each issue that has arisen or confronted me over that period I have always been open and direct, and I believe that will be attested by Members on both sides of this House.  Few, if any, officeholders in this country's history have faced and been required to deal with such a tragedy.  Few, if any, officeholders subsequent to dealing with such a tragedy have had such a thorough, detailed, line by line, hour by hour examination of his or her stewardship.  The fair and impartial result of that scrutiny is there for all to see &mdash; all those who are not blinded by political prejudice. I did not do everything right, no human being ever will, but by independent judgment and analysis, the findings of which are before this House, I and those around me at the time got most of our decisions right.</P>
      <P>I do not give tuppence for political vindication. In the shadow of such terrible suffering, the political posturing we witnessed this morning is shallow and empty.  I leave it to others to examine my total record and for them to decide then who they would like to have in charge in times of crisis.  Of much greater moment and concern is the need to ensure in so far as human beings can, and we are all mortal, that no such tragedy will ever again be visited upon our people and that those who are suffering and will continue to suffer will get the best possible support this State can provide.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate now that the tribunal of inquiry has finished its work and completed its report.  I welcome the Government's decision last night to award additional damages to victims of the hepatitis C scandal.  The funding will not repair the damage that has been <Col N="1306" /> done, but the award is a recognition of the great anguish and the distress experienced by victims and their families.  In the words of the chairman of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Thomas Finlay, the tribunal was a deeply distressing and a very emotive experience.  No amount of money or awards can repair the damage caused by the distribution and use of infected blood products, but we must begin by acknowledging the level of pain in the community as a result of this affair.  The Labour Party and the Government fully accept the recommendations and conclusions of the tribunal of inquiry into the BTSB.  We must learn from this experience and ensure it is never allowed to happen again.</P>
      <P>Our health service is a crucial part of our welfare service and the Government must ensure that the public can confidently put their faith in such a vital social service.  In the past two days comments were made by the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney, which have the potential to undermine public confidence in the blood supply.  While frustration and anger is a natural reaction to the recent mistakes at the BTSB, we in this House have a broader duty to react in an appropriate manner.  People who do not have medical expertise should not begin to give advice to people who may face life threatening situations.  I was very ill for a year and a half and faced theatre on five occasions.  This matter had come to light at the time and I was very frightened, but I had confidence in the medical people who looked after me and I did not care what people who did not have a medical qualification said.  The only effect their comments had was to frighten me.  I send a message from this House this evening to those who are waiting to go into theatre that we must have confidence in the blood patients will be given this evening, tomorrow or the day after, otherwise people like myself who faced that ordeal will not have confidence that they will get better.</P>
      <P>The security and integrity of the blood supply is of primary importance to our health system. Any scaremongering or loose talk serves only to cause further unnecessary panic and anxiety to those who are already sick.  As Senator Henry rightly pointed out during the Order of Business in the Seanad yesterday, the availability of blood products and transfusions has benefited enormously the lives of many women.  We must ensure they continue to do so and that women can avail of these services without fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report only serves to further compound the sense of regret about this affair.  Great hurt and suffering has been caused to many women and their families.  As my party leader, Deputy Spring, said at the Labour Party regional conference in Portlaoise last October before the work of the tribunal began, we are all damaged by our inability to say we are sorry.  He said that of course there are legal constraints, but there are also human imperatives.  He also said we are a community, each dependent on the other.  He further said that as a community we have seen <Col N="1307" /> hurt and suffering where it should not exist.  He added that we should be able to express regret for that in a human way.  I wholeheartedly agree with his sentiments expressed on that occasion. All Members must acknowledge the pain and suffering caused as a result of this affair.  The Government's decision to amend the scheme of compensation and its terms of reference are sound.  It is only right that those who have already settled their claims at the tribunal should be entitled to have their cases reopened.  With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to say that the tribunal should have been put on a statutory footing from the outset.  Everything is wonderful in hindsight, but we are all human beings.</P>
    <P>The Government established the Finlay tribunal and its readiness to accept the findings in full is in stark contrast with how the Fianna Fáil Party handled the beef tribunal report.  This debate should be marked by humility on all sides of the House.  One of the most interesting articles I read on this issue was in this morning's <i>Irish Independent.</i> That article makes clear that partial responsibility for this problem lies with almost every party in this House.  It notes that between 1975 and 1994, the period over which the Finlay report adjudicates, insufficient resources were given to the National Drugs Advisory Board to supervise the activities of the BTSB.  He further adjudicates that this failure is one of the many contributory factors to the current position.</P>
    <P>The articles notes that my party has apologised for its role in this aspect of the crisis.  My party leader, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, made that clear last October and his comments were reiterated this week by party spokespersons.  What is the position of the current Opposition parties which, as today's article adequately illustrated, contributed to the development of the problem in the first place?  The motion acknowledges the hurt caused by the Government's action to all the families involved.  Will Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats do the same?  For example, will the Progressive Democrats acknowledge the danger of undermining vital State agencies through underfunding?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's readiness to accept the report in full, particularly during the further court proceedings at the tribunal itself. One aspect is apparent; there were too many legal niceties during this crisis.  However, it is also clear that the Opposition wants it two ways.  It does not like the fact that the report does not scapegoat either former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, or current Minister, Deputy Noonan.  It is seeking to reserve the right to second guess the report for its own political purposes. That will not wash.</P>
    <P>My party colleague, Deputy Howlin, was widely acknowledged as one of the best Ministers for Health in the history of the State.  Despite all the innuendo and supposition in which the Opposition has engaged about his role in this affair, <Col N="1308" /> the tribunal found that he acted in an appropriate fashion in all but three areas.  However, Deputy Howlin has accepted the validity of these criticisms. He, as much as anybody else, regrets what happened in this affair.  I would much rather have Deputy Howlin or Deputy Noonan, who have proved themselves capable and caring Ministers for Health, dealing with this type of problem than many Opposition Members.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Finlay should be congratulated on producing a comprehensive and balanced report in a reasonable time span.  Our job as legislators now is to put matters right and ensure that events such as those described in the report never happen again.  The Government said it accepts the findings and recommendations of the tribunal report.  The Department of Health will make resources available to put in place the necessary systems and procedures to ensure a similar scandal never happens again.  I welcome the decision that a new site and building equipment for a Dublin unit of the BTSB, which will be located near a teaching hospital, will be undertaken.  The Government will establish a blood services consumer council which will be regularly informed about relevant matters concerning the blood supply. The council will comprise representatives of people who expect to be recipients of blood products.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Government's decision to put in place standard procedures for the recall of unsafe products and procedures which will allow the BTSB to replace the entire stock of blood product should the supply become defective.  This work will now begin and I am confident the Government will put the necessary reforms in place immediately so we can learn from this tragic episode in Ireland's medical history.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with all the women who suffered as a result of this issue and particularly with the family of the late Mrs. Brigid McCole.  I pay tribute to the women who fought the campaign on this matter.  I was very ill at the time and I was unable to participate.  However, I put my trust in medical people and I hope people who are sick in the future will have faith in blood products and medical personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to the motion moved by my party's health spokesperson, Deputy Cowen.  I recognise the limitations of the report, given its terms of reference, particularly in relation to question No. 5 of the McCole family, liability for the hepatitis C issue and political accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Victims rather than politicians should have been given priority.  An admission of liability should have been forthcoming when it was obvious that the BTSB was in the wrong.  The terms of reference of the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal should be changed in view of the recent findings of the judicial tribunal to allow for the payment of aggravated or exemplary damages. People who already accepted settlements should <Col N="1309" /> be entitled to further consideration with regard to such damages.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government, even at this late stage, has acceded to aggravated damages, although this aspect is clouded in equivocal legal terminology.  It worries me that it is not straightforward. It is very equivocal and there is no mention of appeals.  This must be clarified because this is not a time for equivocation with regard to procedure.  The Government should not be allowed to get off the hook with semantics.</P>
    <P>It is surprising the Government cannot come clean on this issue because there is no such equivocation when Ministers are lauding themselves for their great work on this issue.  However, my objective is not to castigate Ministers or former Ministers but to ensure the Government acknowledges that a wrong was done by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the National Drugs Advisory Board, the Department of Health, its advisers and consequently the Minister <i>in loco</i> when the full implications of this episode became known and the worst public health scandal in the history of this country came to light. Apologies to the victims of hepatitis C and adequate compensation, which includes aggravated and exemplary damages as the courts deem proper, should be made to those affected by the virus.</P>
    <P>The report of the tribunal of inquiry highlights many issues which were not touched on in the report of the expert group.  This is not surprising in view of the terms of reference of that group. There was obviously a certain amount of economy of information to the group and this is why Fianna Fáil repeatedly requested a tribunal of inquiry.  We were fully justified in our search for the full truth on this issue as were Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, haemophiliacs and people who received transplants.  We were right to persist in our quest to get to the bottom of this issue and secure the truth.  The demands for a tribunal of inquiry were justified.</P>
    <P>The report of the tribunal of inquiry is wide ranging and contains 17 chapters, covering aspects such as how hepatitis C came into this country and how it first originated.  Ireland prided itself on its voluntary blood transfusion service. We thought we had one of the best services in the world.  It is a small country and the people who donated blood were generally not infected with any known disease at that time.  We were happy that the product was good until this problem arose.  Then we were confronted with the problem of hepatitis C in regard to the anti-D product and transfusions, resulting in a total mess.  Unfortunately, the Blood Transfusion Service Board refused to recognise the information before their eyes.</P>
    <P>The consequences of these infections are graphically illustrated in the case histories of those who presented at the Tribunal of Inquiry into the BTSB.  We have heard that many women did not know why they were in bad health, suffered from loss of energy, had many depressive <Col N="1310" /> symptoms, arthritis or other aches or pains. Neither could their doctors diagnose the cause in many cases because, initially, the public generally had not been advised of the risks posed by hepatitis C.  Hepatologists have clearly described the consequences for those patients who have been infected with hepatitis C, particularly those who will need liver transplants.</P>
    <P>We are confronted not alone by the infection itself but its effect on patients.  Some manifest thyroid or hyper-thyroid problems, others have aches and pains and some suffer fulminant or chronic liver failure.  A whole gamut of symptoms can affect anyone with hepatitis C.  Dr. Hegarty has graphically demonstrated the percentage of those who may progress from fulminant hepatitis to chronic hepatitis and those who may not manifest grave symptoms for some ten or 15 years.  We have not heard the last of hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Then there is the problem of people with co-infection, those who may have HIV who are not amenable to the present treatment which may exacerbate their condition.  There are also implications for those who may have had a renal transplant; if they have co-existent hepatitis C they too will not be amenable to the present treatment for hepatitis C.  That treatment is not great.  Only about 30 per cent of patients respond.  The treatment itself is very severe and produces side effects such as aches and pains, dryness of mouth, eyes and other symptoms, sometimes even leading to other infections at injection sites and so on.  There are many problems associated with this overall issue.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Duty Free Facilities.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this national and international issue of duty free facilities which have developed over the past 50 years into a major international industry.  Europe alone accounts for over 50 per cent of all duty and tax free sales worldwide, its total value in Europe being well in excess of £4 billion per annum.</P>
      <P>Given that practically 20 million people are at present unemployed within the European Union, if the European Union Commission holds to its present decision to end duty free facilities, the loss of this business post-1999 will be devastating. It is anticipated that 440,000 people at present employed on duty free activities could become unemployed in Europe.  Included in that figure are some 300 permanent employees at Dublin Airport apart from the 200 school leavers and unemployed recruited during the summer period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aside from the knock-on effects on those working for small companies, who retail principally <Col N="1311" /> in the duty free market, transport companies, airport and ferryport staff will be affected.  All these activities are vital to local communities.</P>
    <P>I predict that the decision to abolish duty free sales will lead to increased travel costs for air and ferry passengers, as transport companies seek recompense for profits lost in the duty free sector. In Dublin Airport alone, Aer Rianta will incur a staggering revenue loss of approximately £60 million annually.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this issue is that passengers vote in favour of duty free products every time they travel.  This is undoubtedly one case where the interests of producers and consumers coincide.  Should both groups not have a legitimate say in what occurs?  I believe they should.</P>
    <P>Another factor to which I might refer briefly is the potential threat to regional airports and tourism in rural areas.  It has been represented to me that the duty free industry breaches EU directives and regulations and compromises competition. Given that it applies satisfactorily all over Europe and throughout the world I do not see the benefit of withdrawing a service which is popular worldwide. It is European bureaucracy gone mad.  I am aware the Government and the Minister for Finance, in particular, do not need to be convinced by my argument.  While the problem lies with other EU Ministers and Commissioners, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, made a case for Ireland on the issue at the ECOFIN Council in November. Given the implications for jobs in Ireland, particularly in my constituency, it is vital that the International Duty Free Association, which incorporates the organisation in Ireland, lobbies hard to secure a general change of attitude at EU level.</P>
    <P>Our MEPs, who are aware of the situation, should come together and do their utmost to bring the merits of the case before the European Parliament and directly to their parliamentary colleagues.  The discontinuation of the facility will have major implications for jobs and business here.  I do not see any reason the Commission should take a decision to end duty free facilities in 1999 thus putting more people in the dole queues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for again raising this issue.  This matter was debated here on 2 October 1996 and parliamentary questions on the matter have been answered by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>There is no proposal to terminate duty free or tax free sales for travellers to non-EU destinations in 1999.  This portion of the business will remain.  For certain airports, particularly Shannon airport, the non-EU traveller is a most important source of revenue.  The other State airports also handle traffic to and from non-EU locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards EU travellers, the European Union has decided as part of the package of Single Market measures adopted in 1992 to allow the continuation <Col N="1312" /> of duty free and tax free sales for intracommunity travellers until 30 June 1999.</P>
    <P>This was agreed as part of a comprehensive series of Single Market tax measures, including substantial changes to the entitlements of travellers to bring in tax paid goods more freely.  From 1 January 1993, travellers from EU countries benefited from enhanced entitlements to import items tax paid from other EU states and easier border controls.</P>
    <P>This continuation to end in June 1999, set out in two directives, was agreed to allow the duty free operators, including Aer Rianta, the airlines and the shipping operators time to diversify their activities.  It had been originally planned that duty and tax free sales would end in January 1993 for EU travellers and the duty free operators were well aware of this intention for many years before that.  The extension to 1999 was in response to requests for more time to adapt and was reluctantly agreed to by the Commission on the basis of an entirely new system of vendor control of duty free sales and with the legal position being that EU duty free would end in 1999.  This new system of vendor control was to be subject to review by the Commission as it was a substantial change from the previous arrangements.</P>
    <P>The decision to end duty free sales in 1999 was taken by the Council of Ministers and enacted in Community law some considerable time ago.  It is not a proposal from the Commission which has still to be adopted by Council.  Public comment sometimes suggest these are new proposals which can be obstructed by Ireland or other member states.  This is not the position.  The question of obtaining a derogation does not arise.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner with responsibility for the internal market, Mario Monti, has confirmed that the Commission has no intention of bringing forward any proposal for a further retention of duty free and tax free sales beyond the current expiry date of 30 June 1999.  If there is no Commission proposal on the table to that effect, the Council cannot adopt any measures to extend the concession.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has taken many steps to diversify its activities, including the operation of duty free shops outside the European Union.  It operates in Russia and in the Middle and Far East and has adopted a prudential attitude to the question of duty free sales and the issue of extension post-1999. Obviously it would like the concession to continue but has not placed all its eggs in that basket and will be able to cope with the changing circumstances.  Increased passenger throughput at the Irish airports will help and I am pleased growth in traffic is strong and looks set to continue.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta and Nat West Ventures recently completed a deal whereby they will hold a 40 per cent stake in Birminghan International Airport. The chief executive of Aer Rianta has stated this is a long-term venture which fits perfectly into its corporate plans.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> I am aware of concerns over ending duty free facilities for EU travellers and note what the Deputy said.  The Irish and EU duty free sector have been making clear their difficulties with the situation.  At the ECOFIN Council on 11 November 1996, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, raised the issue specifically but did not receive any support from ministerial colleagues for a proposal to commission an independent study into the effect of the abolition of the duty free sales post 1 July 1999.  Neither was there support for an extension of the time period.  The Minister for Finance and I will monitor the position but the right of initiative in this case rests with the EU Commission.</P>

Tá díomá orm narbh fhiú don Aire í féin teacht isteach ach tá súil agam go mbeidh deá-scéala ag an Aire Stáit.</P>
      <P>Tá fhios ag an Aire Stáit go bhfuil muintir Colinamuch le fada ag súil go gcuirfear caoi ar an scoil agus freisin go gcuirfear síneadh riachtanach leis.  Tá an-díomá orthu nach ndearnadh sin go dáta</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming in to listen to me.  Colinamuck is a two teacher school situated between Moycullen and the lake on the east side of Connemara.  For some considerable time it has been seeking funds for the refurbishment and extension of the school which was built in 1949 and is in urgent need of remedial work.</P>
      <P>In January 1995 it was on the priority list. Despite this and the fact that two years have elapsed it has not yet been given the go-ahead to go to tender and carry out the work.  There was disappointment and resentment in the area when in January 1997 other schools in County Galway, and throughout the country, got the go-ahead while Colinamuck was ignored.</P>
      <P>The people of Colinamuck wish to make it clear they do not begrudge anybody better school buildings but do not understand why their project which, although small, is urgent and has been constantly ignored.  They have resisted the temptation to get involved in protest strikes or any other action because they are anxious not to involve the students at the school in such activities.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will respect them for this and will reassure me that such action would not have assisted their case and would not have caused the Minister to give greater priority to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Colinamuck is an area with a rapidly growing population because of the growth of Galway city. Despite a general decline in the birth rate, it is expected that enrolments in the area will continue to be strong for the foreseeable future.  I <Col N="1314" /> hope the Minister can allow this project to proceed. There is no parish hall or other facility that can be used while the school is being repaired so it is vital that the work be done in the summer holidays.  It is important that the go-ahead for tender should be given immediately so that work can commence at the beginning of July.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé ar dtús, táim buíoch den Aire as ucht teacht isteach agus éisteacht liom.  Pobal breá láidir iad pobal Colinamuck.  An rud is lú atá tuilte acu ná go mbeadh scoil don céad scoth acu.

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining the Department of Education's intentions in relation to the provision of permanent accommodation for Colinamuck national school, Roscahill, County Galway.</P>
      <P>The school's accommodation comprises two undersized classrooms and it is accepted that it is inadequate for the school's needs.  With this in mind, the Minister for Education included this school in the capital building programme, which enables the Department to undertake architectural planning and allows the project to progress through the various planning stages.  Architectural planning is now complete and the documentation required for the tender process is prepared.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister is dealing with a significant backlog of projects arising from massive cuts in the capital funding of primary schools in the 1988-92 period.  Recently she approved a number of projects for release to tender, but due to budgetary restraints it was not possible to release all deserving projects to tender simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The expenditure on the primary school building programme is under regular review and the Minister hopes to be able to release a number of additional projects to tender and contract later in the year.  Colinamuck national school will receive every consideration at that time.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that the Minister for Education is committed to the elimination of substandard schools.  However, it will take time to redress the damage done in the 1988-92 period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms. F. Fitzgerald Ms. F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms. F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety of our food has been top of the agenda for the past few months. The safety of food, of our health services and of our streets could be said to be among the most <Col N="1315" /> challenging issues facing us as we move into the 21st century.  The question of the safety of food has become a major issue in recent times with the BSE scare, followed more recently by the infant powder scare in January of this year, and now the issue of the level of pesticides in fruit and vegetables.  The public in Britain has been advised in recent days to wash and peel fruit before eating it, particularly when such fruit is being consumed by children.  Are the apples and other fruit being consumed by Irish children any different?  What percentage of apples consumed here comes from Britain where it has been confirmed that high traces of pesticides, particularly organo-phosphates, have been found on fruit?</P>
      <P>These pesticides have been linked to Gulf War syndrome and illnesses suffered by farmers using such chemicals to dip sheep.  Pesticide figures for the past three years must be published and adequate reassurance given to the public from the Department of Agriculture.  These food scares are unsettling, raise anxieties for parents and give people a sense of vulnerability about the very food they eat.  They demand a rapid and effective response from Government.</P>
      <P>Consumers need high quality information and they need information fast when these scares emerge.  If we have learned anything from the hepatitis C scandal it is that we need rapid reaction responses and we must ensure that consumers get the highest possible technical and scientific information in the clearest language and in the quickest possible time.</P>
      <P>In Britain, out of a total of 700 apples analysed, 126 contained residues above the MRL, or maximum residue level, but in most cases only slightly so.  British scientists said safety margins allow for an occasional breach without any health risk.</P>
      <P>Department of Agriculture figures here on pesticide levels supplied to <i>The Irish Times</i> revealed that out of 1,356 samples, 533 Irish, of fruit and vegetables analysed 27 were found to be above the MRL.</P>
      <P>A further 631 samples had pesticide residues but below the MRL while 698 samples had no detectable residue.  What is a safe level of pesticide residue?  Pesticide residues above the MRL increased from three in 1994 to 11 in 1995, and to 13 in 1996, with most of these samples being imported products.</P>
      <P>In recent times we have been introduced to the phrase &ldquo;genetic engineering&rdquo; in relation to food. As a consumer I believe I should be informed about how food is produced and that clear labelling should be introduced.  I have the right to choose naturally produced food and should be in a position to avoid products which have been developed through genetic engineering methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What monitoring is currently in place?  What is the advice to the public about fruit?  What is the breakdown in levels of pesticide between imported fruit and home grown produce?  What is the percentage of our fruit that is imported?  Is <Col N="1316" /> there a need to state more clearly the country of origin of fruit if British levels are so high?  What are the standards in other countries in relation to applying pesticides to fruit?  Do we need closer monitoring in relation to the practices of other countries?</P>
    <P>I would also like the pesticide figures for the past three years published and a reassurance given to the public by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables need not give rise to any concern from a public health point of view.  The permitted level of residues is strictly controlled under EU legislation and the relevant directives have been transposed in Irish law and are implemented by my Department.  The pesticide control service of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is responsible for implementing these legislative controls in so far as they relate to pesticide and plant protection products.  The responsibilities of the pesticide control service include the authorisation of plant protection products and the clearance of pesticide products for placing on the market after detailed evaluation of scientific dossiers, including safety evaluations in relation to man, animals and the environment; an enforcement programme to ensure that pesticide products placed on the market are used in compliance with the regulations and the operation of the national monitoring programme on pesticide residues in raw agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>Under the extensive monitoring programme undertaken each year, fruit and vegetables, cereals and food of animal origin are sampled and analysed for the presence of pesticide residues. The purpose of such testing is to ensure that food products do not present a danger to human health as a result of the presence of pesticide residues. Samples taken for testing in regard to fruit and vegetables, for example, are analysed for the presence of no less than 89 pesticides and metabolites. The analytical equipment used can detect residues as low as one part per billion in specific instances.  In the period 1990-6 2,660 fruit and vegetable samples were analysed; of these 1,411 were Irish and only 50 samples, or 1.9 per cent, were found to have residues exceeding the maximum residue limits.  Less than half of these samples were of Irish origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain what is meant by maximum residue limit.  Maximum residue limits &mdash; MRLs &mdash; are the concentration of pesticide residues permitted under regulation on food commodities.  In establishing MRLs very large safety margins are included and it does not necessarily follow that even where the limits are exceeded there would be immediate threat to human health.  That said, the marketing of food which does not comply with the required standards cannot be tolerated. Accordingly, produce which is found to contain pesticide residues exceeding the MRL may be destroyed under the legislation at the owners risk without payment of compensation and prosecution <Col N="1317" /> may be brought against the owner.  In 1995 a consignment of papayas were destroyed for exceeding the set MRL.  Consignments of these products from the same sources are also targeted for further more intensive sampling and analysis.</P>
    <P>The Department publishes an annual report on pesticide residues in food and a report for 1994-6 is currently with the printers.  It will be distributed in the next fortnight.  Summary results up to the end of 1995 have already been published. Detailed results of the 1994 and 1995 national monitoring programmes for pesticide levels have been placed in the Oireachtas Library and are available to members of the public.</P>
    <P>Comparison between Irish, US, Swedish and UK results for percentage samples exceeding MRLs show that we compare very favourably. The results in the other countries are higher in the main than the corresponding levels found in <Col N="1318" /> Ireland.  It is my intention that there will be continuing monitoring and sampling of products and every effort will be made to ensure that all products appearing in the market and going into the food chain will be of the highest possible international standard.</P>
    <P>We are at safety levels which have no ill effects on health and there are no cases of repeated occurrences.  Health is only at risk if repeatedly excessive levels of pesticides occur.  Overall, it is fair to say we have acceptable levels of pesticides in our food and they are under control.  Our monitoring and analysis is extensive and effective. The concern expressed in the media may be somewhat overstated.  That said, it is important that we remain vigilant in order that we might maintain our high standards.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 March 1997.</P>

    <P>The total increase provided for is in line with the provisions in the private sector.  However, in the case of the public service, savings will be made relative to the private sector in two ways. Firstly, instead of the full 2.5 per cent first phase applying for a year from the end of the current agreement, the increase in the public service will be limited to the first £200 of basic weekly pay for the first nine months, after which the full increases will apply.  Secondly, the local level negotiations provision of 2 per cent which applies from the middle of the second year in the private sector, will apply in the third year of the agreement in the public service.  That payment will be conditional on verified progress to a satisfactory level on implementation of the public service modernisation programme set out in Chapter 10 of the partnership.</P>

      <P>In general, the main factor affecting changes in the national debt is the Exchequer borrowing requirement. However, there are certain other factors such as discounts or premiums on bonds issued and, in <Col N="1320" /> particular, exchange rate movements which can also affect the stock of debt outstanding.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to predict market developments over the course of 1997 and, therefore, the end-year position cannot be forecast with precision. If all other factors are neutral, the national debt will increase by an amount equal to the EBR which was forecast at £637 million in last January's budget.  A similar situation applies to subsequent years with the budget projecting EBRs, on a non-policy change basis, of £856 million and £698 million for 1998 and 1999 respectively. These projections are inclusive of the prudent contingency provision.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will appreciate that the most important indicator of debt is not the absolute level of debt outstanding but the ratio of debt to GNP or GDP as this measures the economy's capacity to carry the debt burden.  In this regard, the last decade has seen significant falls in the ratio of national debt to GNP from a peak of 125 per cent in 1987 to 82 per cent by the end of 1996. Similarly, general Government debt as a proportion of GDP, the relevant measure for Maastricht purposes has fallen from almost 117 per cent in 1986 to less than 73 per cent by the end of 1996 and is now in line with the EU average.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy is to continue to reduce the general Government debt to GDP ratio towards 60 per cent at a satisfactory pace, as required by the Maastricht Treaty.  The economic background to the budget forecast that, on the present basis of computation, this ratio would fall further to 69 per cent in 1997, 67 per cent in 1998 and 64 per cent in 1999.</P>
      <P>However, it should be noted that, in 1999, new accounting conventions for Maastricht reporting will be introduced with resultant changes in the measurement of the values of general Government debt and GDP which will add some 7 per cent to the ratio of general Government debt to GDP in 1999.  These technical changes will not affect the underlying downward trend in the ratio which, as indicated in Partnership 2000, could be reduced to 60 per cent early in the 21st century.</P>

      <P>With the exception of borrowing to fund payments made under various FEOGA schemes pending reimbursement by the EU, all borrowing by the Government in connection with EU transfers is already managed by the National Treasury Management Agency.  FEOGA-related borrowings are currently managed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  In April 1996, a Value for Money Report by the Comptroller and <Col N="1321" /> Auditor General on the borrowing activities of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry for FEOGA purposes was published.  While the report concluded that the borrowing and associated risks were managed quite well by the Department, it did recommend, <i>inter alia,</i> that consideration be given to the involvement of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) to a much greater extent in the management of the borrowings involved.</P>
      <P>Since then I have had discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, on the feasibility of transferring the treasury management functions of FEOGA to the NTMA.  A critical factor in considering the implementation of such a change is its impact on the various budgetary aggregates, particularly on the Maastricht measure of general Government debt, to which it could add more than 1 percentage point.  As consideration of this impact was being hindered by a lack of clarity in the relevant EU accounting conventions, clarification was sought from the EU Commission last year.  However, it was only last month that the Commission's statistical service, Eurostat, published details of a decision covering the classification of bodies acting on behalf of the European Communities, including FEOGA.  Unfortunately, that decision did not answer all our queries regarding the Intervention Agency and further clarification is currently being sought from Eurostat.  In the meantime, the implications of the decision already handed down by Eurostat are being actively considered by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the NTMA.</P>

      <P>The joint Ireland-Wales INTERREG Programme 1994-1999 is centred on the main Irish sea routes between Ireland and Wales.  The eligible areas include the Dublin, mid-east and south-east regional authority areas in Ireland and the former Gwyned and Dyfed County regions of Wales.  The programme is divided into sub-programmes, maritime development which covers transport, transport information and marine and coastal environment protection measures and economic development co-operation including tourism and cultural co-operation.  The programme was approved by the Commission on 28 July 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the last joint monitoring committee in October 1996 it was reported that a total of 84 projects, of which 65 were cross-Border and 19 stand alone, had been considered by the joint sub-programme working groups.  These groups are composed of representatives of the relevant State and other agencies with responsibility for <Col N="1322" /> each sector.  At that stage, 49 projects had been approved or approved in principle and 15 deferred, one withdrawn and 19 rejected. Approximately £40 million in EU funding had been committed to these projects whose total value amounts to £67 million.  Grant expenditure was reported as 17.115 mecu, or approximately £12.5 million.  Considerable progress has been made in the transport measures, where funding for major projects involving harbour developments in Dún Laoghaire, Dublin and Rosslare and for improvements to road and rail connections had already been approved.  Implementation of the remainder of the programme has been somewhat slower, but this is to be expected, as it is dependent mainly on the development of smaller joint projects involving a wide range of promoters from both eligible areas.  Despite the fact that the programme was not preceded by an INTERREG I programme in 1992/1994 there has been a high level of interest, with over 1,000 information packs issued to interested groups. These and other inquiries are being followed up by the INTERREG development officers with a view to generating suitable projects for consideration by the joint sub-programme working groups.</P>
    <P>At present the programme is undergoing a mid-term review by independent consultants in accordance with the requirements of the programme. Their report will address its effectiveness to date in meeting its objectives and its impact on economic and other indicators for the region.  The joint monitoring committee will receive a presentation on the report at its next meeting in May.  When the final report is presented in June it will be examined by the committee with a view to taking any necessary action to ensure that the programme remains on course to meet its objectives and expenditure targets over the remainder of its time period.</P>

    <P>In general, the main factor affecting the year-on-year <Col N="1323" /> change in the national debt is the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  However, other factors such as discounts or premiums on bonds issued and, in particular, exchange rate movements can also affect the stock of debt outstanding.</P>
    <P>The impact of exchange rate movements was particularly large in 1993 when the realignment of the Irish pound in January of that year added almost £1.4 billion to the Irish pound value of foreign currency denominated debt.  Exchange rate movements were also particularly significant last year when the appreciation of the Irish pound reduced the Irish pound value of the foreign currency debt by some £850 million which, combined with the low EBR outturn, facilitated a reduction in the absolute level of the national debt &mdash; the first such fall in almost 40 years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate, however, that the most important indicator of debt is the ratio of debt to GNP or GDP which measures the burden of debt on the economy and the economy's capacity to shoulder it.  In this regard, the ratio of the national debt to GNP has fallen from 98.5 per cent in 1993 to 82.0 per cent by the end of 1996. Over the same period, general Government debt as a proportion of GDP, which is the relevant measure for Maastricht purposes, has fallen from 94.5 per cent to 72.8 per cent and is now in line with the EU average.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the increase in the absolute level of debt outstanding since 1993, the Exchequer debt service costs have remained quite stable and, indeed, were lower in 1996 than in 1993.  Furthermore, as a proportion of GNP, debt service costs have fallen from 8.3 per cent in 1993 to 6.5 per cent in 1996.  This reflects both rapid economic growth and falling interest rates and bond yields as the financial markets reward Ireland for a succession of low budget deficits and a track record of sound fiscal management.</P>

      <P>It is not entirely clear to what the Deputy is referring when he refers to new tourism start-ups.  The business expansion scheme and the seed capital scheme already apply to tourist traffic undertakings as defined in the BES legislation.  That term has been defined in very broad terms to ensure that a wide range of tourism activities can be covered encompassing a wide range of approved tourism facilities with the specific exception of hotels, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation which were removed from the scheme by the Finance Act, 1991, following a review of the BES.</P>

      <P>The study referred to by the Deputy is the northwest study, carried out by Coopers and Lybrand which reported in April 1990.  The study involved, primarily, the County Donegal and Derry-Strabane district council areas.  The relevant local authorities, with the addition of Limavady district council, form the north west cross-Border group. The group has used the study as the basis for a series of proposals put forward for funding under a number of EU programmes, including the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programme and the special support programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the INTERREG programme, indeed under the particular measure administered by my own Department, the group has received substantial funding in support of a joint secretariat involving the four local authority areas.  Other relevant departments are examining the group's proposals in relation to an integrated area plan which involves a number of sectoral areas such as tourism, agriculture and environmental protection. My Department, with its counterparts in Northern Ireland, has been in consultation with the group on how best to move matters forward and a further meeting with them is planned shortly.</P>
      <P>The INTERREG programme best lends itself to cross-Border strategies such as this, and similar proposals from other cross-Border local authority groupings have also received funding in respect of joint secretariats and support resources.  While the groups involved are not yet as advanced as the north west cross-Border group in terms of their developmental strategies their proposals are being given every encouragement.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may recall that the national plan published in 1993 in relation to the second round of Structural Funding contained a &ldquo;common chapter&rdquo; drafted jointly with Northern Ireland which set out the extent of North-South co-operation across a wide range of sectoral areas.  I have asked that the position be updated for the next monitoring committee meeting on the community support framework which will be held in June 1997.  This upgrade will give a useful indicator of progress in North-South co-operation across the Structural Funds and will also indicate areas where further attention is required.</P>

    <P>The staffing returns for the non-industrial Civil Service can be broken into two categories i.e. main general service grades and other grades. Table 1 gives a breakdown in summary format of staff in general service grades by gender.  An aggregate figure for the other grades is also given and is also broken down by gender.</P>
    <P>The data in Table 1 is then given for each Department-Office in Table 2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> includes the following statement in relation to public spending:</P>
      <P>Over the period of this programme it is intended that the growth of current supply services spending will be constrained to a maximum of 6 per cent, in nominal terms in 1995, and to an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms over the following two years of the programme.</P>
      <P>The actual growth in gross current spending over the period of the programme compared with the target growth is as follows:</P>
      <P>In 1995 the target was for a 6 per cent nominal increase and the outturn was an increase of 5.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the target was for an increase of 2 per cent in real terms and the outturn was an increase of 4.4 per cent in real terms;</P>
      <P>In 1997 the target was for an increase of 2 per cent in real terms and the budget estimate provides for an increase of 4.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>The increases in spending in 1995 and 1996 were due mainly to exceptional and unavoidable factors such as the payment of equal treatment liabilities of £140 million in 1995 and the EU disallowances or beef fines and BSE related costs in 1996.  In 1997, increases in pay and social welfare account for 75 per cent approximately of the total increase in gross current spending.  Full details of the increase in spending in 1997 were given in my statement on the publication of the abridged estimates volume and in my Budget Statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking 1996 and 1997 together, the increase in gross current spending in real terms will exceed the target of an annual average rate of 2 per cent for those years.  However, the 2 per cent spending target must be seen in the context of the overall commitment in the Government's programme to <Col N="1348" /> keep Government borrowing prudently below 3 per cent of GNP.  The overall level of Government borrowing is by far the most important budgetary target set in the Government programme. The Government has made certain that the increases in spending have not resulted in an increase in borrowing above its target levels.  In fact, the record shows that the Government has succeeded by a comfortable margin in meeting its borrowing target.  In this year's budget the general Government deficit is estimated at 1.5 per cent of GDP; in 1996, the general Government deficit was 1 per cent of GDP.  This budgetary performance stands comparison with any of our EU partners.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asks about the cost to the Exchequer in annual interest charges on extra borrowing as a result of the increase in spending above the target levels.  The cost of such additional borrowing cannot readily be calculated. The cost would depend on the precise form of borrowing undertaken and on interest rates prevailing at the time.</P>

      <P>The economic and social development agencies operating in the Border region in general are no different from those operating elsewhere in the country. There are no plans to reduce the number of these agencies.</P>
      <P>A particular aspect of the Border region is the special availability of funding from international sources, including the European Union.  This funding is aimed at promoting development in the Border region as part of the peace process.  It is channelled largely through the existing development agencies in the region.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure greater co-ordination in take-up of this international funding, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for Western Development and Rural Renewal, Deputy Donal Carey, chairs an interdepartmental task force on funding arrangements in the Border region.  This task force has met on an ongoing basis since February 1996.</P>
      <P>I understand that Minister Carey's initiative has resulted in much improved co-ordination between the agencies.  The matter will be kept under review to ensure that the region derives the maximum possible benefit from the funding being made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to account for the current state of development of assets registers in individual Departments, as that is a matter for each accounting officer.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on the 1995 Appropriation Accounts expressed his concern that further action is needed to ensure that all fixed assets are correctly and uniformly recorded, and I fully support his view that such recording is essential for effective control over the capital assets of Government Departments.</P>
      <P>My Department took the following steps in 1996 to encourage Departments to comply with the requirements regarding fixed assets:</P>
      <P>(1)  following consultation with the Valuation Office, we issued a circular outlining the kind of information needed to assess the value of land and buildings.  The circular (14/96) advised Departments which needed assistance with valuations to compile the requisite information and to forward it to the Valuation Office.  The circular also specified that the required information on land and buildings was to be available to auditors in the course of audit of the 1996 accounts,</P>
      <P>(2)  as it appeared that Departments required further assistance with the valuation of It assets including software on the policy side, a cross-Departmental working group was set up to devise expanded guidelines for the inclusion of It assets in assets registers.  The guidelines are being finalised and will be issued shortly, after consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office.  It is hoped that the issue of the guidelines will ensure consistency among Departments in regard to the treatment of IT assets,</P>
      <P>(3)  information seminars were held both on the general requirements for the 1996 Accounts and also in regard to the treatment of IT assets in assets registers.</P>
      <P>At the Deputy will appreciate, my Department's efforts were confined to clarifying policy.</P>
      <P>The development of the actual systems for recording fixed assets must be pursued by the individual Accounting Officers.  My Department will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>The Department of Finance is currently finalising a circular for early issue to Departments and offices on the impact of the year 2000 on information technology (IT) systems.  The circular will require Departments and offices (i) to verify the year 2000 compliance status of their IT infrastructures and systems; (ii) to draw up plans to migrate non-compliant systems to year 2000 compliance; and (iii) to procure only year 2000 compliant products to prevent the introduction of problems in already compliant systems.  Departments and offices will be required also to submit these plans to my Department to enable it to advise Government of developments.</P>
      <P>The objective is to ensure that all Departments' and offices' information technology systems are year 2000 compliant by January 1999 at the latest, or before then for those systems which process post-2000 dates in this century.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>Three successive European Councils have confirmed that the third stage of economic and monetary union will begin on 1 January 1999.  For its part, the German Government has consistently asserted its commitment to the EMU timetable and its intention of meeting the Maastricht criteria. This stance was publicly reaffirmed by my colleague, the German Finance Minister, following the meeting of Economic and Finance Ministers held in Brussels last Monday.  I do not intend to speculate on the German Government's economic forecasts for 1997.  I am, however, confident of the strength of the German Government's political commitment to the EMU project and its timetable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on an estimated average industrial wage in 1997 of around £15,000 and following the enactment of the changes announced in this year's budget, the number of taxpayers in question is forecast to be of the order of 32,200 in respect of the 1997-98 tax year.  Such taxpayers are being assessed for tax as single or widowed persons.</P>
      <P>This figure represents a considerable reduction of close to 23 per cent in the number of taxpayers in the 1996-97 tax year estimated to be paying the top rate at earnings not exceeding the estimated 1996 average industrial wage.  The reduction is due to the significant increase in the income thresholds for the top rate of tax arising from the increase in personal allowances and widening of the standard band which I introduced in the budget.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy in relation to taxation is set out in the Programme for Renewal. The Programme stresses the need to reform the tax system, in particular to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on those with low incomes.  Tax reform will favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap, aim to reduce the tax wedge and encourage enterprise development.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Partnership 2000 states that &ldquo;The Government will introduce personal tax reductions to the cumulative value over the three years of £900 million on a full year cost basis.&rdquo; The first steps towards implementing this undertaking were taken in this year's budget which as stated above will considerably reduce the number of taxpayers on incomes below the average industrial wage paying tax at the top rate. It is Government policy to increase further personal allowances and the standard band in future budgets thereby continuing the process of increasing the income thresholds for the top rate of tax for all taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Statistics on the number of people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service are gathered annually by reference to 1 October each year.  As of 1 October 1996, there were 800 people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service, representing 2.9 per cent of the staff.  The following tabular statement showing the percentage of staff with a disability employed in each Government Department will be made available to the two Deputies who tabled the questions.</P>
      <P>As I said previously, the target percentage of 3 per cent relates to the Civil Service as a whole, not to individual Departments or offices.  The number of staff with a disability employed in a particular Department will vary depending on the nature and extent of recruitment to that Department in a given period.  In addition, the transfer of people with a disability between Departments, while not affecting the overall percentage, may have a significant effect on the percentage for an individual Department or office.  At present, 15 of the 31 Departments and offices have a proportion of 3 per cent or higher of disabled people on their staff and a further seven have a proportion of over 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the number of people with a disability employed in the Civil Service dropped from 829 on 1 October 1995 to 800 on 1 October 1996, bringing the overall percentage to just below 3 per cent, all Government Departments have been urged to make every effort to recruit people with disabilities, having due regard to the staffing targets laid down for each Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>I have no statutory function as regards the setting of interest rates or in relation to the regulation of the profit margins of Irish lending institutions.</P>
      <P>I am aware of recent media reports of a study which compares Irish mortgage lenders' margins with the margins of such lenders in the United Kingdom and the United States.  It should be noted that the study is based on the margin between interbank rates and mortgage rates and on notional costs, rather than on the actual cost structures obtaining in the three countries referred to.</P>
      <P>The setting of the official `short-term facility' interest rate is a matter for the Central Bank, which is independent in the implementation of monetary policy.  Mortgage and other retail interest rates are set by financial institutions themselves in the light of market conditions.  I would, therefore, encourage people taking out mortgages to check through the market to find the best value.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to parliamentary questions on this issue last month, I received a pre-budget submission from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group in November 1996 concerning tax relief for corporate charitable donations and having regard to the fact that charities already enjoy significant benefits under the tax code I have no plans to introduce a general scheme of tax relief on corporate donations at present.  Moreover, the State is already highly supportive financially of charitable endeavours both at home and abroad through ODA spending and Exchequer and national lottery assistance to the domestic voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>These tax reliefs and direct State assistance are testimony to the work done by charities in Ireland which both supplement and complement those services provided by the State.

      <P>The joint Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG programme 1994-99 covers all of Northern Ireland, except Belfast, and the Border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo. The programme is divided into five sub-programmes covering: regional development, human resources development, infrastructure, agriculture-fisheries-forestry and environmental protection. The programme was approved by the Commission in February 1995.  Over 930 applications have been received of which 200 are cross-Border in nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Projects are assessed by joint working groups on the basis of their compliance with the objectives of the programme, cross-Border co-operation and the economic regeneration of Border regions, and the more detailed requirements of the individual sub-programmes, grants are <Col N="1355" /> approved on the basis of projects submitted and funding is not determined on a county basis.</P>
    <P>The most recent data show that over 500 of the applications related to projects in the Border counties.  This figure includes 76 joint projects which applied through partners in those counties. Two hundred and eleven of these applications have been approved and almost £43 million in EU funding has been committed to them.  The total value of these projects is over £83 million.</P>
    <P>At present the programme is undergoing a mid-term review by independent consultants in accordance with the requirements of the programme. Their report will address the effectiveness of the programme to date in meeting its objectives and its impact on economic and other indicators for the region.  The joint monitoring committee will consider the report at its meeting in June and will take any necessary action to ensure that the programme remains on course to meet its objectives and expenditure targets over the remainder of its time period.</P>

      <P>My Department has issued detailed instructions to Departments on the appropriation accounts requirements in a series of accounting circulars.  It has also organised information seminars for accounts branches of Departments on the subject, and finance officers have been briefed on the reforms.  It is the responsibility of accounting officers to ensure that the appropriate accounts comply with the specified requirements, and that adequate systems are put in place to provide the required information.</P>
      <P>It is the function of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the course of his audit of the appropriate accounts to check the extent to which Departments are complying with the necessary requirements.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in paragraph 3.14 of Partnership 2000 on tax credits the social partners recognised the complex policy and other issues that are involved in any move to tax credits and standard rating of personal allowances.  In view of the complex issues involved, the social partners therefore agreed that the issue should be the subject of further examination before end-September 1997. I would hope to get this process under way in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> The question of introducing a tax credit system has been considered over the years.  In looking at possible options in the area of taxation it is important that there should be no confusion between the underlying policy considerations, such as equity, progressivity or efficiency, and the essentially administrative issue of how best to realise these in practical terms.  Tax credits can be viewed as an alternative means of pursuing goals which might be equally advanced within the framework of the present allowance system.  I would expect that this and all other aspects will be fully examined under the terms of the procedure agreed under Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The only relevant information available as to the gain to the Exchequer from standard rating all income tax allowances is in relation to the direct gain to the Exchequer in income tax yield if the change referred to in the question was enacted for the income tax year 1997-98.  On this basis, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, following the enactment of the changes announced in this year's budget, the estimated gain to the Exchequer from confining all income tax allowances and reliefs to the standard rate would be of the order of £750 million in a full year.  If confined to the main personal allowances the gain would be closer to £550 million. However, it should be pointed out that the gain here arises from a reduction in tax relief for all 48 per cent and some standard rate taxpayers such that without further change to the tax system the numbers of taxpayers paying tax at 48 per cent would increase from around 36.5 per cent at present to the order of 60 per cent of taxpayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my Budget Statement I announced that, taking account of the expenditure changes provided in the budget, the estimate for gross non-capital supply services expenditure in 1977 is £12,950 million.  The provisional 1996 outturn figure in the budget was £12,206 million.  To obtain a valid figure for the percentage increase in spending in 1997, the 1996 outturn must be adjusted to exclude £98 million in rate support grant funding which was taken off the 1997 figures as part of the new local authority financing arrangements. The adjusted 1996 outturn figure is therefore £12,108 million.  On this basis, the increase in gross non-capital supply spending in 1997 is 7 per cent in nominal terms or 4.7 per cent in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the budget, the most significant development affecting expenditure has been the Government's <Col N="1358" /> decision to accept the recommendation of the Labour Court on nurses' pay and conditions. The additional cost of the nurses' award in 1997 is estimated to be £49 million.  The Government gave very careful consideration to the impact which the nurses' pay award would have on the 1997 budgetary and expenditure aggregates.  In the light of this, and as evidence of its determination to ensure that spending stays under firm control, the Government agreed measures to offset the full additional cost of the nurses' pay award in 1997.</P>
    <P>Provision for the full cost of the nurses' pay agreement will be included in the Revised Estimates Volume which is due to be published very shortly.  The 1997 departmental expenditure allocations included in the volume will also incorporate the agreed measures to offset the additional £49 million cost of the nurses' pay award.</P>
    <P>The Revised Estimates Volume, therefore, will now show any increase in expenditure since budget day.  The Revised Estimates Volume will also include provision for some other adjustments to the budget-day spending allocations, largely of an estimating or technical nature which have the effect of reducing the overall current spending total very slightly.  The 1997 estimate for gross non-capital supply services expenditure provided in the volume will be £12,949 million, compared to £12,950 million provided in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to reappraise and amend the hepatitis C scheme of compensation. It is not possible to quantify the additional costs that will flow from that decision.  The 1997 allocation for capital spending which I announced in the budget was £1,576 million.  There have been minor estimating and technical adjustments to the capital figures since budget day which have reduced the 1997 allocation to £1,574 million. This represents an increase of 9 per cent over the 1996 provisional outturn of £1,449 million.</P>
    <P>The Government has noted the proposals of the Minister for the Environment to approve the redevelopment of the Ballymun estate with Exchequer capital over a period of eight years.</P>

      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute report on the Economic Implications For Ireland of economic and monetary union, which I commissioned last year, concluded that, on balance, &ldquo;Ireland can expect to benefit modestly in terms of income and employment through membership of European Monetary Union.  This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the unquantified benefits are also <Col N="1359" /> likely to favour European Monetary Union entry&rdquo;.  These benefits will be shared by consumers and producers.</P>
      <P>Particular benefits to consumers will arise through the prospect of lower interest rates within EMU, the elimination of exchange rate transaction costs for tourism and the consolidation and intensification of the single market, which will enhance competition, and lead to greater price transparency and choice for consumers.</P>
      <P>Although economic and monetary union will imply significant once-off costs to business in changing over to the euro, increased competition and price transparency will help to minimise the extent to which these costs are passed on to consumers.</P>

      <P>The Government is fully committed to international actions designed to bring about the full implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina.  An integral part of this agreement is compliance by the parties involved with the orders of the International Criminal Tribunal, including handing over indicted suspects.  With our EU partners, the Government believes that full co-operation by all parties with the tribunal in the effort to bring war criminals to justice is a fundamental obligation which must be honoured if genuine stability and lasting peace are to be consolidated.  The conclusions of the Paris meeting of the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council in November and of the London meeting of the full Council in December 1996, made it quite clear that the provision of international economic reconstruction assistance to the parties is conditional on their co-operation in this area.  Ireland and the European Union have fully endorsed these conclusions.  This policy will determine how the European Commission disburses its funds for reconstruction priorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a meeting hosted by the European Commission on 9 and 10 January, to which I presume the Deputy is referring, reconstruction priorities were discussed at a technical level.  It was not a decision-making meeting and no decisions were made.  The European Commission outlined, in broad terms, priority sectors in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including in the Republica Srpska, identified for reconstruction funding in 1997 and subsequent <Col N="1360" /> years.  Although projects have been identified and costed, the actual disbursement of funding will be subject to the political conditionality which I have just described, and this has been made very clear to the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including in the Republica Srpska.</P>

      <P>I have had no meetings or other contact with Sinn Féin since the ending of the IRA ceasefire in February 1996.  While officials in my Department had over the following 11 month period some subsequent meetings with Sinn Féin, as envisaged by the Government when it ended ministerial-level contact, I do not propose to depart from precedent by giving details of such contacts.</P>
      <P>The present policy of the Government remains as set out by the Taoiseach to the House on 22 January 1997, namely, that &ldquo;the official channel of communication can be used whenever the Government receive reliable assurances that an IRA ceasefire is attainable in a genuinely short-term horizon, and that previously identified and realistically attainable things need to be discussed at the meeting, and done, that will achieve that end.

We are in constant discussion on a wide range <Col N="1361" /> of issues, primarily through the machinery of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has consistently emphasised the importance of confidence-building measures as an intrinsic part of the peace process. Such measures constitute an important contribution to the development of trust which must underlie a genuine and lasting settlement in Northern Ireland.  The issue of prisoners, to take one example, and their treatment generally plays a central role in building confidence within both communities.  The Government has pursued confidence building measures in all their aspects with the British Government through the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Mitchell report also recognised that it was important for all participants to take steps to build confidence throughout the peace process.  The report called not only for action by the two Governments but also for the termination of all paramilitary activities, including punishment beatings.</P>
      <P>It has to be recognised that building confidence is a two way process.  Prospects for the promotion of trust, confidence and reconciliation generally, would be immeasurably enhanced by an immediate and unequivocal restoration of an IRA ceasefire. The Government is concerned about the present situation in Northern Ireland.  The recent murders of Stephen Restorick and John Slane must be condemned by all those who are committed to the peace process.  I discussed the current security situation and confidence issues with the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, at the most recent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 12 March 1997.  Among the matters addressed were the forthcoming marching season, policing, prisons issues and the new material emerging in relation to Bloody Sunday.  I would refer the Deputy to the Joint Statement issued after that meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the marching season, the Government believe that dialogue and reasonable compromise, based on mutual respect and accommodation, is the best way to resolve the differences regarding parades.  As I stated in reply to a <Col N="1362" /> parliamentary question on 19 March 1997, it is the Government's earnest hope that local agreement and accommodation will yet emerge as factors which both ease tensions and point the way toward a peaceful resolution of the parades issue.  There have been some encouraging developments in this regard in recent days.  I would urge all concerned to support those in positions of leadership who are committed to the path of dialogue and compromise at local level on the parades issue.</P>

      <P>The main challenge facing the Government and people of Rwanda at present is the peaceful reintegration of the more than 1.2 million refugees who have returned to the country from Zaire and Tanzania in response to the crisis in Eastern Zaire.  This development has necessitated the support of Ireland and other international donors to ensure that the basic requirements of returnees for food, shelter and basic services are met.  At the same time, we are seeking to meet the ongoing need to ensure national stability in Rwanda, to bring the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide to justice and to ensure that the human rights of returnees, genocide survivors and the country's huge prison population are respected.  Along with our EU partners, NGO's and UN agencies, we are continuing our efforts to support the Government of Rwanda with a view to their implementing a sustainable, fair and inclusive programme of national reconciliation and economic development over the coming years.</P>
      <P>The impact of the current conflict in Eastern Zaire on Rwanda and other countries of the Great Lakes Region provides clear evidence of the need for a comprehensive approach if lasting stability is to be achieved at both national and regional level.  Such a comprehensive approach forms the basis for current efforts being made by the Government along with our EU partners, Joint UN and OAU Special Representative Sahnoun, regional leaders and other members of the international community, in our efforts to help resolve the crisis in Eastern Zaire.  I have given a full account of our approach in my replies to Questions Nos. 82 and 39 of 25 February and 11 March, respectively, and my reply to Question No. 20 of yesterday's date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and our EU partners continue to support the early holding of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes Region under <Col N="1363" /> the joint auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity in order to address the root causes of the crisis in the region and to ensure respect for commitments, thus bringing about a peaceful and comprehensive resolution of the conflicts in the region.  It is hoped that this conference, which is intended to be the culmination of current mediation efforts, will result in agreement between all parties concerned on a lasting and peaceful resolution of the current crisis.  This process will have important implications for the future of Rwanda and the other countries of the region.</P>

      <P>I do not fully accept the premise which appears to underlie the Deputy's question.  Since December 1994, the Government has put in place a process of multi-party negotiations based on agreed and comprehensive ground rules, with authoritative international chairmanship of key aspects of the negotiations.  The negotiations will resume on 3 June, following a break for the British general election and the Northern Ireland district council elections.  The report of the International Body, which appeared in January 1996, offers a balanced and practicable way of dealing with the decommissioning question.</P>
      <P>I agree, however, that progress has been disappointingly slow.  While this is the product of many factors, and while all sides must accept a greater or lesser degree of responsibility, the single most important reason has been the IRA's decision to end its ceasefire in February 1996, and its continuing failure unequivocally to restore it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current situation in Albania continues to be a cause of grave concern, both to the European Union and to the wider international community.  Due largely to pressure from both the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) a Government of National Reconciliation, supported by all political parties in Albania, was established as a first step to bring about a political solution to the crisis in Albania.  Whilst the new Government enjoys cross-party support, and also appears to have the endorsement of a wide section of the population in the south of the country, it has not yet been able to restore civilian structures and administration as well as law and order throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The main priority for the Albanian Government is a return to political stability and in particular the surrender of arms seized by the population to the authorities.  To date a large number of people, including children, have been injured or killed through the accidental discharge of weapons seized during disturbances.  In addition the existence of a large amount of weapons in the hands of rebel factions, criminal gangs and the wider population has produced the fear and insecurity which has led to large numbers of Albanians fleeing the country in conditions of distress. Until all arms are surrendered and normal conditions of Government and local administration are restored, the Albanian people will continue to be faced with an increasing level of deprivation, suffering and insecurity.</P>
      <P>The European Union is strongly committed to assisting Albania to restore law and order and achieve a return to normality.  It will co-ordinate its efforts in this regard with both the OSCE and the Council of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Union has sent, as a matter of urgency, a high level mission to Albanian to assess, in consultation with the Albanian Government, how it can best contribute to assisting the Albanian Government to resolve the current political and economic crisis.  The European Commission is ready to provide emergency humanitarian assistance as soon as conditions are sufficiently secure to <Col N="1365" /> assure its delivery to the people in need in Albania.</P>
    <P>The present crisis in Albania stems largely from an insufficient level of political and economic reform being introduced in recent years.  It was brought to a head by widespread public outrage at the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which resulted in a total loss of savings for the majority of ordinary Albanians.  The public disturbances consequent on the collapse of these schemes, many of which were promoted by the Government as safe investment, developed into widespread rejection of Government authority which has precipitated the current political crisis and the breakdown in law and order.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Albanian Government and people need to accept the responsibility for rebuilding their country and society.  The European Union stands ready to help them with this task.  Albania is the poorest country in Europe and has only recently emerged from a prolonged period of communist rule.  It is recognised that the process of political and democratic reform, as well as economic revival, will require to be sustained over a period of years.</P>
    <P>Both the European Union and other international organisations and institutions have an important role to play in giving political and economic support to Albania and its people in this process.  The European Union has been providing economic assistance to Albania under the Community PHARE programme.  This assistance has amounted to about 450 million ECU since 1992, when the PHARE programme was extended to Albania, and is currently concentrated on developing infrastructue and human resources, sectoral restructuring and macro-economic stabilisation.  Humanitarian and food aid and balance of payment support have also been provided.</P>
    <P>In the light of the current ongoing crisis, the European Union will seek, in co-operation with other organisations, to assist efforts to stabilise the situation in Albania and to assess what further measures, by way of political and economic assistance, can be provided to Albania.</P>

      <P>As regards direct taxes, while there are a number of EU Directives in existence or under consideration in relation to specific aspects of company taxation, there are no plans at EU level for general harmonisation of tax rates or tax bases.  In a recent wide-ranging discussion of taxation policies at the Council of Finance Ministers, there was little support among the member states for harmonisation of income tax or corporation tax rates.  Such harmonisation would in any event require the unanimous approval of the member states.</P>
      <P>There is, however, broad acceptance among EU Finance Minister of the need to achieve greater co-ordination of direct taxation policies between the member states so as to ensure that these are consistent with EU objectives in relation to economic and monetary union, the Single Market and various social regional and environmental policies.  The Council of Finance Ministers has established a high-level policy group chaired by Commissioner Monti to examine these issues and report back to the Council in due course on what initiatives might be considered in this area.  Ireland is represented on the group at senior official level and I will be kept informed of developments within the group at regular intervals.</P>
      <P>In so far as indirect taxes are concerned, a certain amount of alignment has already taken place in respect of VAT and excise rates in the context of achieving the Single Market, though considerable differences in rates remain.  Further alignment is expected to be considered over the coming years and the Government will examine any proposals that emerge on their merits and with due regard to the national interest.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in my budget address, I indicated that when making plans over several years, it is prudent to provide a reserve against unforeseen factors outside the control of the Government which may impact on the budget position for future years.  While some of these factors which include variability in tax buoyancy as well as exceptional costs in the area of public expenditure are likely to be positive as well as negative, it was deemed prudent to allow for a negative net impact on the budgetary aggregates.  As a result, the Government made a general contingency provision of £175 million for 1998 and £325 for 1999.</P>
      <P>With regard to the factors mentioned by the Deputy in his question, these are potential costs on the Exchequer which, while largely outside the control of the Government, are not unforeseen and as such, prudent provision has been made within the overall budgetary aggregates to meet the costs.

      <P>The national debt at 31 December 1996 stood at £29,912 million.</P>
      <P>The most recent available estimate of total population is 3,621,000.  On this basis, national debt <i>per capita</i> is estimated at £8,261.  The total number of PAYE taxpayers for the 1996-7 tax year is estimated to be 886,300.  Thus, the national debt per PAYE taxpayer is estimated at £33,749.</P>
      <P>The number of years it would take to lift the burden of the national debt would depend on the level of the budget surplus achieved each year. The Government's policy is to continue the substantial reductions in the debt burden that have been secured in recent years.  This will be achieved by having low budget deficits which are comfortably below the 3 per cent threshold required by the Maastricht Treaty and which will continue to reduce the ratio of general Government debt to GDP.  This commitment is reflected in the 1997 budget which allowed for a general Government deficit of just 1.5 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's spending targets for the period 1995-7 are set out in the policy programme A Government of Renewal.  This states that over the period of this programme it is intended that the growth of current supply services spending will be constrained to a maximum of 6 per cent, in nominal terms in 1995, and to an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms over the following two years of the programme.</P>
      <P>The provisional outturn for 1996 shows that gross non-capital supply services expenditure increased by 4.4 per cent in real terms.  The overrun in spending in 1996, while unwelcome, did not impact in any serious way on the overall budgetary position in 1996, which saw a general Government deficit outturn of only 1.0 per cent of GDP.</P>
      <P>The 1997 budget estimate for gross non-capital supply services spending is £12,950 million, an increase of 4.7 per cent in real terms over 1996. Since the budget, the Government has decided to accept the Labour Court recommendation on nurses' pay which is estimated to cost an additional £49 million in 1997.  However, the Government has also agreed measures to offset the additional cost of the nurses' award in full. Provision for the nurses' pay agreement will be included in the Revised Estimates Volume, due to be published shortly.  The 1997 departmental spending allocations included in the volume will also incorporate the measures agreed to offset the additional nurses' pay costs.  Therefore, there will be no increase in the allocation for gross non-capital supply services spending provided in the Revised Estimates Volume.  Allowing for some other minor adjustments, the allocation in the volume will be £12,949 million.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to reappraise and amend the hepatitis C scheme of compensation. It is not possible to quantify the additional costs that will flow from that decision.</P>
      <P>The increase in spending in 1996 was due mainly to exceptional and unavoidable factors such as the EU disallowances or beef fines and BSE related costs.  In 1997, increases in pay and social welfare account for 75 per cent approximately of the total increase in gross current spending.  Full details of the increase in spending in 1997 were given in my statement on the publication of the Abridged Estimates Volume and in my Budget Statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking 1996 and 1997 together, the increase in gross current spending in real terms will exceed the target of an annual average rate of 2 per cent for those years.  However, the 2 per cent spending target must be seen in the context of the overall commitment in the Government's programme to keep Government borrowing prudently below 3 per cent of GNP.  The overall level of Government borrowing is by far the most important budgetary target set in the Government programme. The Government has made certain that <Col N="1375" /> the increases in spending have not resulted in an increase in borrowing above its target levels.  In fact, the record shows that the Government has succeeded by a comfortable margin in meeting its borrowing target.  In this year's budget the general Government deficit is estimated at 1.5 per cent of GDP; in 1996, the general Government deficit was 1 per cent of GDP.  This budgetary performance stands comparison with any of our EU partners.</P>

It is also agreed that, in keeping with the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary union, the general Government deficit will be not more than 1.5 per cent by 1999 and the debt-GDP ratio will be 70 per cent by 1999, with a 60 per cent level to be achieved early in the 21st century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied, on the basis of the trend in tax receipts and my detailed discussions with the Revenue Commissioners, that the efficiency of the tax collection system for all sectors of the economy has improved significantly in recent years.  The Revenue Commissioners are continuing with their overall successful approach to compliance which is designed, on the one hand, to make procedures easier for those who are trying to meet their tax obligations and, on the other, to pursue people who do not pay on time or at all.  Measures taken to improve collection and compliance include modern payment methods including direct debits, programmes to secure returns from those who do not file, the large-scale targeted audit programme which resulted in some £129 million being collected in 1996, the random audit programme which exposes every taxpayer to the risk of audit, introduction of withholding tax and tax clearance procedures, significant use of the power to attach assets of tax defaulters, as well as other strong enforcement measures, new local collection and arrears compliance initiative, measures to tackle black economy operators and a more active prosecution policy in cases of serious evasion.</P>
      <P>Revenue have confirmed that these measures, which are to be intensified under its new corporate plan, are underpinning the improved compliance in the tax system in recent years.  The measures needed are reviewed each year on the basis of Revenue's analysis of the returns and levels of compliance for that year.</P>
      <P>Conclusions on tax compliance are difficult to draw from the disposable income figures emerging from the household budget survey, which are compiled on a different basis by the CSO.  These disposable income figures would, for example, include certain State transfer payments which do not come into the computation for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>I would point out that from 1991 to 1996 the contribution of the farming and other self-employed sectors as a percentage of the aggregate take from these two sectors and the PAYE sector increased from 10.2 per cent in 1991 to 13.5 per cent in 1996.  The latter figure would have risen to 14.1 per cent but for the once-off cash flow cost, estimated at £35 million, of the High Court decision to allow withholding tax on professional fees to be offset against an individual's overall liability to income tax on a current year basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income <Col N="1380" /> exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  A medical card normally covers the card holder, his or her spouse and any children under 16.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members.</P>
    <P>Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EC regulations or where they are in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance. The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.  Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.  A student is assessed for a medical card by the health board in whose area he or she is attending college.</P>
    <P>When assessing the medical card entitlement of a family, the income guidelines include an allowance for each dependant and where that dependant is in full-time third level education and is not grant-aided, this allowance is doubled.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons, be they parents or students, to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>I would, of course, be anxious that every student who is in genuine need of a medical card should receive one.  However, it is best to rely on the careful consideration of individual bases by the health boards rather than to introduce a provision on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, local drugs task forces have been set up in twelve priority areas in Dublin as recommended by the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs.  One of the priorities for each task force will be to draw up a profile of all existing services and resources available in the area to combat the drugs problem and to agree a development strategy to build on these.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board, which has statutory authority for the development of health services in Dublin has approved a plan costing up to £5 million in 1997 for the development of its drug misuse prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services in Dublin in accordance with the recommendation made by the ministerial task force that waiting lists for treatment should be abolished during 1997.  The board will be consulting with each local drugs task force about the elements of the plan which impinge on the task force area and these will be considered by the task force for inclusion in its service development plan.  In so far as such developments relate to mainstream services, funding from them will be provided by the Eastern Health Board.  It could arise that a local drugs task force may propose a new initiative involving a number of agencies, including the Eastern Health Board.  In such circumstances it would be envisaged that funding for a proposal along the lines should come from the £10 million available this year to fund proposals from local drugs task forces.</P>

      <P>These schemes cannot be advanced until approval to the Cohesion application is received from the European Commission or until another source of funding is identified.

    <P>Ballyconnell sewerage scheme was also included in stage 1 of the application, but is now being funded under the INTERREG programme and is currently under construction.  Cavan sewerage <Col N="1389" /> scheme &mdash; phosphorous removal, is also included in the work programme for 1997 and is being funded directly by the Exchequer.  The scheme is at the planning stage and is expected to go to construction this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by an enrolment of the school on the 30 of September of the previous year.  The enrolment of Talbot senior national school on 30 September 1995 was 454 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principla and fourteen assistant teachers in the current school year.  Additionally, as an exceptional matter, the school was allowed to retain its fifteenth assistant post in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also wish to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that Talbot senior national school has the services of a concessionary teacher on account of its designation as a disadvantaged <Col N="1393" /> school, a remedial teacher, a home school liaison teacher and two special additional teachers to cater for pupils with special needs.</P>
    <P>The enrolment of Scoil Íosagáin on 30 September 1995 was 189.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and five assistants in the current school year.  Additionally, as an exceptional matter, the school was allowed to retain its sixth assistant post in the current year.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that Scoil Íosagáin has the services of a concessionary teacher on account of its designation as a disadvantaged school, a remedial teacher and a shared home school liasion teacher.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for Education I have introduced a number of measures to address the problems of difficult or disruptive children.  In 1995, I introduced a pilot teacher counsellor scheme with the specific aim of addressing these problems.  A total of 27 teacher counsellors have been allocated to selected schools in the north inner city and Tallaght-Clondalkin areas of Dublin. The scheme will be extended in accordance with available resources.</P>
    <P>In cases of serious disruptive behaviour, the needs of the child may be such as to warrant placement in a one of a range of special schools or classes for children with emotional disturbance.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the case made by the schools to which the Deputy refers.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of these schools will be fully considered when I am next in a position to allocate additional resources to special needs children in the primary sector.</P>

      <Quest>if she will provide assistance for persons in receipt of lone parent's allowance towards the cost of books and exam fees to ensure that their children do not lose educational opportunities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>There are schemes of grants towards the cost of providing school text books for necessitous pupils in first level and second level schools.  These schemes include provision for pupils from single parent families who are dependent mainly on social welfare payments, are on low income from employment or are experienceing financial hardship from particular circumstances in the home. The book grant schemes are administered by schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of the particular circumstances in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The allocation for the primary level book scheme for 1996-97 was £2.427 million; an increase of approximately 47 per cent since 1993-94. The allocation for the second level book scheme for 1996-97 was £3.85 million which represents a 37 per cent increase since 1993-94.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a number of measures aimed at alleviating hardship arising from the payment of examination entry fees.</P>
      <P>For the 1997 exams, a provision of £500,000 has been made available to schools in order that entry fees may be waived or reduced in the case of necessitous pupils.  School authorities are advised that, for the purposes of the scheme, a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, prolonged illness of parent, large family with inadequate means, single parent, more than one child doing the certificate examinations, or other circumstances which would denote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above provision, my Department also operates a scheme under which the fees of candidates repeating the leaving certificate are waived or reduced.  A candidate who remains at school to repeat the leaving certificate is normally charged both a course fee, £100 in 1997, and an increased exam entry fee, £125 in 1997.  Where, however, the parent or guardian of the candidate is the holder of a current medical card, the course fee is waived and the examination entry fee is reduced to, at a maximum, the ordinary leaving certificate fee payable by first-time candidates, £46 in 1997.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to improve the provisions for alleviation of examination fees on an ongoing well targeted basis and as resources become available to me.</P>

      <P>Cars involved in serious road accidents, stolen cars, and cars seized under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 are brought to Fitzgibbon Street Garda station by gardaí.  These are generally stored in the yard to the rear of the station until they are collected by their owners or disposed of as scrap.  It is proposed to develop a car compound at the Talbot Complex in Santry to accommodate those cars seized under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the comments to which the Deputy is referring.</P>
      <P>It has not been the practice, however, to comment on statements made by judges in court and I do not propose to depart from the practice followed by my predecessors in that regard.  Comments that may be made by members of the Judiciary outside of the courtroom setting would be a different matter.</P>
      <P>I do, of course, recognise that the protection of potential victims of crime is one of my primary responsibilities as Minister for Justice.  I am, therefore, particularly aware of the need, when considering individual prisoners for temporary release, to be fully cognisant of the potential risk to the public arising in each case.  All releases are carefully vetted in this regard.  It would be less than frank, however, not to recognise, as I have done on many occasions, that for several years, but especially the past ten years or so the shortage of prison accommodation has significantly increased the pressure to grant early release to prisoners.  That is why I decided, with Government approval, to give priority to a major prisons expansion and development programme which will involve a total expenditure in the region of £135 million by the end of 1999 and will see available prison places increased by 35 per cent &mdash; about 800 places &mdash; by that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these extra places have, in fact, already come on stream and I am proceeding separately with interim measures to reduce the number <Col N="1397" /> of offenders who are released early because of the prisons accommodation problem which I inherited.</P>
    <P>It is right to acknowledge, also, that even if there were no accommodation difficulties, nobody could absolutely guarantee that the early release of offenders, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide, would ever be entirely free of risk.  It is a fact of life, both within and outside of the prisons context, that some individuals, no matter how carefully vetted or how favourably assessed by those dealing with them, will nevertheless betray the trust placed in them and proceed to re-offend.  What this argues for, however, is the exercise of care and professionalism in the vetting procedures, not an end to parole concessions of any kind.</P>

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.

However, I can provide the information on a Garda district basis which is set out in the tables overleaf.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that Ballinasloe, Kilconnell, Kiltormer, Menlough, Mountbellew and Moylough form part of the Ballinasloe District.  Ballygar and Creggs form part of the Roscommon District.  Barnaderg, Corofin, Dunmore, Glenamaddy, Kilconly, Milltown and Williamstown form part of the Tuam District, Kiltullagh, Monivea and Galway form part of the Galway District.  The Ballymoe area forms part of Castlerea District.  Craughwell, Kinvara, Shanaglish, Gort, Kilchreest and Kilcolgan form part of the Gort District, Eyrecourt, Killimor, Kilrickle, Loughrea, New Inn, Portumna, Tynagh and Woodford form part of the Loughrea District.  It should also be noted that up to 16 May, 1994, Salthill was part of Galway District.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907, provides that where guilt has been proven the court may make an order discharging the offender conditionally.  The conditions attached to such orders may include attendance at a workshop or day centre under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service. It is a matter for the Court to decide in which cases the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907, should be applied.</P>
      <P>My Department's Probation and Welfare Service is involved in a number of these workshops and day centres operated in local communities and provides annual grants towards their costs. Offenders attending the centres may learn a number of skills, e.g., computers, woodwork, catering, photography, as well as basic literacy and numeracy skills.  These workships and day centres are managed by a community based management committee comprising statutory and local community representatives, for example, the Garda, the Probation and Welfare Service, local business, the Vocational Educational Committee and FÁS.  Vocational training courses are run by the Vocational Education Committees and FÁS. Among the aims of these workshops/day centres is the training of offenders for employment.  In many cases arrangements are made with local employers for the placement of suitable offenders.  This arrangement has proven to be of great benefit both to the offender and the employer and indeed the community.  Many offenders subsequently find permanent work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> I am satisfied with the present arrangement whereby offenders may attend workshops and day centres under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service and I have no plans to introduce new legislation as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, the working time directive covers employment, both in the private and public sectors.  The Deputy will be aware that the carer's allowance administered by my Department is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who have little or no means and who are engaged in providing full-time care and attention to elderly or incapacitated pensioners or to certain people with disabilities.  Recipients of the carer's allowance are not employees of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health, has undertaken a review of the needs of carers and, arising from that review, I have introduced a 50 per cent increase in the allowance for people caring for more than one person.  It is estimated that this measure will benefit one in four cases.  I am examining other recommendations with a view to further improvements in the context of the next budget.</P>

      <P>Under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which came into effect on 13 May 1996, responsibility for the regulation of bank charges has been transferred to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  This section provides that credit institutions had a period of three months within which to notify the director about their existing charges.  All existing institutions have already done so.</P>
      <P>Section 149 goes on to provide that credit institutions may not increase existing charges or introduce new charges without first notifying the director of their intentions.  In support of proposals for increased or new charges the applicants must provide a statement of the commercial justification for the proposal including a detailed statement of cost and details of the estimated amount of additional income accruing from the proposal.  Thus would-be applicants now have to undergo a rigorous process before charges can be increased or new charges introduced.  Thus I am satisfied that the system as outlined provides adequate protection for consumers in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Director has informed the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology that so far no increases have <Col N="1403" /> taken place in respect of existing charges.  The only notification received has been in respect of a new range of credit card products which provide a wider range of choice, value and transparency for consumers.</P>

I will be considering this request in the context of a very heavy schedule of engagements, to which I am already committed, and I will be formally replying in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of my policy that IDA Ireland, which was given responsibility for the industrial property portfolio in January 1996, should progressively disengage from its role as property landlord.  Advance factory space in the future will be provided by the private sector.  IDA Ireland will then actively promote and market such buildings.  The Deputy will also be aware of the activities of both SFADCo and IDA in successfully marketing existing buildings in towns surrounding Slieverdagh and of the initiatives to involve the private sector in advance factory provision in locations where such investment has real potential to realise an adequate return.</P>
      <P>The industrial property policy of the Government, as outlined, is being actively implemented, in Tipperary and other counties, so as to ensure that Government policy to facilitate balanced regional development and an equitable distribution of employment opportunities continues to be realised.</P>

      <P>Between 1991 and 1996, £2.5 million has been paid to deer farmers under the alternative enterprise scheme, which assists farmers to develop housing and handling facilities for deer together with the purchase of female breeding stock.  Applications on hand are being processed for payment.  This scheme was closed for new applications with effect from 4 October 1996.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Agriculture, Food and Forestry 1994-99 included a measure to extend the producer group scheme which operates under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1360/78 to cover live farmed deer.  No formal application has been received under this scheme to date.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to request the MMDS operator of cell Nos. 4,5 and 13 to carry out a technical audit to ascertain the percentage coverage feasible in the licence area in view of the assertion that approximately 70 per cent of householders will not receive coverage unless there is huge investment from tenders; and the level of investment to be committed by the MMDS operator to give effect to the terms of the licence issued in April 1991.</Quest>

      <P>I have no plans to request the licensed MMDS operator for cells 4, 5 and 13 to carry out a technical audit as suggested by the Deputy.  I am confident that the MMDS technology is such that if it was given a fair chance, multi-channel television service could be provided to the vast majority of homes in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the assertion to which the Deputy is alluding and I do not know what or who these tenders are.  I do know, and the Deputy should also be aware, that by their nature MMDS systems do require substantial levels of investment. Since the advent of MMDS the licensed operators have invested considerable amounts of money in the roll-out of their systems, and continue to do so, even in the face of sustained opposition from illegal deflector groups.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's query on the level of investment to be committed by the licensed operator for cells 4, 5 and 13 that is a matter of detail for the license in which I have no function.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>As the licence for the cells in question was issued only on 1 April 1991, the provisions of Regulation 13 (2) of the Wireless Telegraphy (Television Programme Retransmission Licence) Regulations, 1989 did not, in fact, become applicable until 1 April 1992.</P>
      <P>I understand that the current subscriber base in the area remains just short of the minimum number specified in the licence and that it has not reached the target level since the grant of the licence.  Given the difficulties created for the roll-out of its service by the existence of illegal deflector operators in the area.  I have no proposals to take action against the license on that account.</P>
