    <P> 1.  <b>Mr. B. Ahern</b> asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on his remarks at the launch of the Information Society on 9 April 1997. [9739/97]</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On 9 April, with the Ministers for Finance, Education, Transport, Energy and Communications, Enterprise and Employment, and the Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology, I launched the Government's Millennium Initiative on the Information Society.  A copy of the press statement at the launch has been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The Government acted quickly to establish this initiative to ensure that Ireland takes full advantage of the considerable economic, social and educational benefits of the &ldquo;Information Society&rdquo;&mdash; the name given to the social and work environment of the future.  The Government's action will form part of Ireland's millennium celebrations and will stimulate large-scale investment and improvements in technology throughout the country.</P>
      <P>As recommended by the Report of Ireland's Information Society Steering Committee, the Government has decided to establish an Information Society Commission.  The commission will be chaired by Ms Vivienne Jupp and will report directly to me as Taoiseach.  It will drive initiatives across all sectors of the economy to prepare for the information society.</P>
      <P>As part of the initiative, the Minister for Education announced a comprehensive set of measures to provide our young people with the skills and aptitudes to prosper in the era of the information society.  These will include a schools' information technology 2000 project, a scoilnet initiative and a school integration initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Altogether, 14,000 teachers will be trained in the use of information and communications technologies and at least one multimedia-ready computer <Col N="910" /> connected to the Internet will be provided in every school as the initial step in a phased development programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has also identified a number of proposals to stimulate further developments in the business sector.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment has asked Forfás to develop proposals with industry for the establishment of a Digital Park.  The Information Society Commission has been asked to select 22 areas throughout the country for guaranteed broad-band service access.  The Government has also asked it to recommend changes in legislation to remove any limitations on the use of information and communications technologies.</P>
    <P>Taken as a whole, this initiative will help ensure Irish people in every area of life from business to the home will have access to and benefit from the many different opportunities presented by this new information-based economic and social environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline the terms of reference and remit of the commission and when its membership will be announced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Membership of the commission will be announced this week.  Its remit is to promote awareness of the requirement of change on everybody and every organisation in the State to ensure that we, as a society, fully use the information society to achieve our economic and social objectives and to ensure that the onset of the information society does not create divisions between those who have and those who do not have the necessary resources to use modern technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach's statement that information technology has spread throughout society and not only to those who can afford to use it.  Apart from educational measures, will the Taoiseach indicate what other ways we can be involved in this initiative?  The Department of Education and Forfás are relevant organisations to be involved in it, but will organisations such as those which run FÁS, community workshop and combat poverty programmes and deal with people on the margins be involved in it?  The people who run those organisations are being told there are many jobs in technology and on the information highways, but the people with whom they deal, do not get many opportunities to take them up.  Will the Taoiseach ask the commission to take account of those people in particular, as 20,000 young people are dropping out of education?  This is a good idea but I would not like to see us make the educated more educated while doing very little for those on the margins of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will specifically ask the commission to recommend the introduction of further incentives to encourage those who might not otherwise do so to use information technology in <Col N="911" /> their daily lives.  One of the crucial social questions that will face us in the first ten years of the next century will be whether the development in information technology will create two societies in Ireland or whether we will still have one.  There is a risk that those who can afford to buy computers or go to schools where computers are readily available will have a further advantage on top of the already considerable advantages they have over those who do not have a computer in their homes.  Therefore, we are taking an initiative to ensure a multimedia computer linked to the internet will be provided within easy access of everybody in Ireland.  We will use a network of libraries and Government offices to ensure everybody has the physical means of getting to a facility where information technology is available to them and they can have access to the internet.</P>
      <P>Clearly, training is of crucial importance. FÁS already provides considerable resources for training in information technology but it is not of use to people unless they have access to computers upon completion of training courses.  That is why access to computers for those outside the education system as well as, most importantly, those within the system are central elements in this initiative.  The information society report indicated that up to 48,000 additional jobs could be created by the application of the most advanced modern information technology.  That is why, for example, we are providing for a digital park where multimedia technology for the making of film, film music and so forth can be developed. We will also provide broad band cables in at least 22 locations so that industry and business that wish to use multimedia communications, including video conferencing, have facilities available to them to develop.  Additional employment will be created through this initiative.</P>

      <P>I applaud this initiative and welcome the proposal to place computers at the disposal of primary schools.  Is the Taoiseach aware that when the leader of my party, Deputy Harney, made this recommendation at our national conference in Limerick last November, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, wrote to her the following day accusing her of financial recklessness by proposing to provide computers in every school?  What has happened in the meantime to make the Government change its mind?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a computer in 65 per cent of primary schools and in virtually all secondary schools.  The difficulty is that there are not a sufficient number of them to cater for the number of pupils who want to use them.  For example, in primary schools there is approximately one computer for every 100 pupils while in secondary schools there is one for every 33.  Our aim should be to provide one computer for every ten pupils in primary schools and one for every three in post primary schools.  Considerable leeway must be made up.  It is very important that the computers provided should be capable of being linked to the internet and are not just confined to the use of information available on disk in these schools.</P>
      <P>Emphasis should be placed on training teachers and that is the most important element of this initiative.  The experience of introducing computers in other walks of life is that frequently they were not used adequately, or at all in some instances, because people did not fully understand what they were capable of doing.</P>

      <P>What resources have been made available to the commission?  What resources are available in the 1997 Estimates?  While embracing the information age in our policies, what is provided in the terms of reference of the commission to deal with difficulties on the internet, such as defamation, the availability of pornography and issues of copyright which are causing serious problems in other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately £30 million will be spent on this initiative by the State and I expect this to be matched more than twofold by business and other interests.  Approximately half of this will go towards equipment in schools and the remainder will go towards training teachers. This spending will continue until 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reform of copyright legislation is a matter of considerable importance in this area.  If one considers that during the first half of this century the most important area of law related what could be termed &ldquo;real property&rdquo;&mdash; land and houses, who owned them and who had a right to use them.  In the next century the most important area of law will relate to &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;&mdash; who owns information and who is entitled to use it.  The priority must be to modernise our copyright legislation.  A framework for this is provided in European law.  Britain, a country with considerably more resources than Ireland, took <Col N="913" /> approximately 13 years to modernise its copyright law.  It is a major undertaking and the Government is taking steps to accelerate the modernisation of our copyright law.</P>
    <P>A working group chaired by the Minister for Justice is examining defamation, pornography and other forms of abusive activity on the internet. These matters do not fall within the terms of reference of the commission being established under my Department; they are separate issues. However, the working group is working intensively and will be putting forward proposals on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any plan to make information technology more widely available, particularly for the disadvantaged who cannot avail of it at present.  Has the Taoiseach considered the implications for schools which currently have to pay 21 per cent VAT on computer equipment? There will be a huge investment of £15 million in schools but over £3 million will be taken in VAT. Will the Taoiseach consider removing VAT on computers being provided in schools?  It is clearly an impediment to the development of information technology.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The money provided by the State to assist schools in purchasing computers is considerably in excess of the VAT that would be charged.  The rates of VAT applicable to different goods is governed by EU law.  It is not open to the Government to exempt any product, such as that mentioned by the Deputy, entirely from VAT.  This applies also in hospitals.  The Deputy is engaging in a well worn controversy.  Rather than exempting them from VAT for this purpose, which could be going down a <i>cul de sac,</i> it would be more expeditious to give schools financial assistance to buy computers.  We also hope businesses will supply computers.  For example, businesses sometimes upgrade computers although the existing ones are perfectly good and would be adequate and useful for schools.  In this way, through the Tech Corps initiative, 22 Dublin schools are being provided not only with computers but also with back up on their usage.  I would like such private sector initiatives to supply computers at a low price to schools to be extended throughout the island.</P>

      <P>It is important that we seek to use the most modern techniques of distance learning.  With broad-band technology it is now possible for people in Skibbereen and other parts of the world to attend a lecture given in New York and to interact with the lecturer.  Distance education techniques allow this.  I recently participated in such a discussion when I visited the out-reach centre of the University of Ulster at Enniskillen. It was linked to the extension of Cork regional technical college at Skibbereen and both institutions are linked to the University of Missouri in the United States, using modern distance education technology &mdash; video conferencing, effectively.</P>

      <P>The Government has rightly provided accelerated access to information technology to a number of young people.  Is there a parallel programme to accelerate educational provision to those who have not yet mastered the old technologies of reading and writing?  Some <Col N="915" /> 18,000 of those who leave formal education every year are both illiterate and innumerate.  Is he worried that the gap between achievers and non-achievers at school will now widen and is he making provision to ensure, in the interests of natural justice, this will not happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that people be literate and numerate if they are to use computers, to the extent that they are not, they will be unable to use them.  The point raised by the Deputy is valid.  It is a matter of considerable importance that there should be investment in education and since it has come into office the Government has been able to reduce substantially the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools.  This allows more intensive, one-to-one attention to be given to children who are falling behind.  As the Deputy is aware, there are now four fewer pupils per teacher in primary schools than there were when the Government entered office, which means it is possible for teachers to give more attention to such children.  The use of computers may help people become more proficient in reading, writing and arithmetic.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I met on Wednesday, 9 April last an SDLP delegation comprising the party leader, Mr. John Hume, MP, MEP, and the party's three other MPs, Mr. Séamus Mallon, Dr. Joe Hendron and Mr. Eddie McGrady.  The Government was also represented at the meeting by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>We reviewed the current situation as regards Northern Ireland as well as the prospects for the future.  We agreed that it was of critical importance, at this juncture, that everybody of like mind should take a firm stand against extremism of all shades.  We resolved that we would do everything in our power to press ahead with our efforts to secure a political agreement which can be put to the people for their decision, by way of referenda North and South.  We agreed that, at the end of the day, the way to still the voice of extremism and sectarianism, which is the voice of the minority, is to let the vast majority of the people on this island have their say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took the opportunity, on the steps of Government Buildings, to pay tribute to Mr. Hume and the SDLP for their tireless work for an agreement based on consent between the peoples who live <Col N="916" /> on this island.  I am sure that the House will wish to avail of the opportunity today to endorse this. I have no doubt, too, that the House will wish to be associated with my condemnation of violence on all sides, whether loyalist or republican, and to join with me in extending our heartfelt sympathy to the latest victim of violence, RUC Reserve Constable Ms Alice Collins, shot in the back by the IRA.</P>
    <P>I indicated in my address at the Compaq Ireland Trade Awards on 2 April that the Government remains committed to securing a settlement which will address the three core relationships at the heart of present divisions.  I referred to the shared understanding of the Irish and British Governments on the shape of such a settlement, as set out in the joint framework document.  I also referred to the need for the two Governments jointly to give pro-active leadership at appropriate junctures, if required.  I look forward to working closely with the next British Government in advancing the overriding imperative of a political agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did anything emerge from the Taoiseach's discussion with the SDLP which would indicate that the process could be moved forward after the British election?  Has the British Administration made further progress in preparing for the talks on 3 June?  As the Taoiseach has requested, we join in the renunciation of the attack on the RUC reserve officer last week, as we have done outside the House.  We also condemn the burning of several churches.  In recent nights Catholic churches have been under attack in many parts of Northern Ireland but, unfortunately, churches of all denominations are being attacked by loyalist and republican sources that are creating all the difficulties.  That is all the more reason, even during this election period, our officials and embassies should work to remove the log-jams.  Has any progress been made on these issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In our discussions with the SDLP we agreed that when the talks resumed on 3 June it was important both Governments should be pro-active in moving them forward.  We should also indicate that initiatives are open to us to ensure that the talks address all items which should be addressed in the three strands of relationships.  After the electoral consultation in Northern Ireland is concluded, there must be an added impetus from the Governments and the parties to ensure we move from procedural issues, which have absorbed a great deal of time, to the issues of substance which are currently causing so much hardship and fear.  The SDLP originated the proposal that when an agreement is reached in the talks it should be put to people, North and South, by way of referendum.  Holding a referendum in Northern Ireland, allowing the people to accept or reject the proposal, will assure the majority community that nothing can be done over their heads with which they do not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> Equally, the holding of a separate referendum in the Republic, in which the people here can say yes or no to any agreement reached, contains an assurance for the Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland that nothing will be done which does not adequately protect their interests or is over their heads.  There are, therefore, in the overarching arrangements for the putting of any proposal agreed in the talks to the people in joint but separate referenda very strong safeguards which should encourage the participants in the talks to make the necessary compromises.</P>
    <P>I hope the conclusion drawn by politicians on all sides, particularly in Northern Ireland, from the current appalling spate of sectarian attacks is that they now see in the shape of these vicious attacks the direction in which their society could go if they do not urgently push forward agreement.  I hope all politicians, including the two Governments, will be able to come together when the talks resume to ensure we inject the necessary urgency into the process of reaching an agreement and compromise so that we will have a basis for further progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that will happen among the two Governments.  However, during the last year leadership has been needed to drive these issues forward.  There have been many opportunities to do that over the last 12 months.</P>
      <P>In regard to a more pressing issue, how are our officials in Maryfield being used to bring forward initiatives on the marching season, which has effectively begun?  It seems, except for one or two positive initiatives, we are facing a very difficult year.  On Thursday morning I spoke at length to John Hume regarding this issue.  He had no positive words to say on the matter but expressed his concern about what is happening.  Has the Government exerted pressure, through Maryfield or Downing Street, to try to force some progress on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said here on a number of occasions that I believe the outpouring of sectarianism which arose from the confrontations at Drumcree last year did very great damage.  It is very important for all to recognise their responsibilities in this regard this year.  Everyone will suffer if sectarian passions are inflamed in Northern Ireland.  It is not simply a matter for the Governments &mdash; although it is, of course, very much a matter for them.  I can inform the House that the liaison committee of officials of the Irish and British Governments has been meeting very regularly and recently to consider what can further be done to assist agreement in regard to contentious marches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to make the point that most marches take place without contention, but it exists in a number of localities.  I welcome the efforts being made on both sides to reach agreement. I deprecate the efforts being made by some on both sides to undermine those who seek to <Col N="918" /> reach genuine cross-community agreements on a local basis.  Those who are undermining people who are trying to reach a compromise have a very heavy responsibility on their shoulders for the consequences of their actions.  I appeal to them to recognise their responsibility to their neighbours, children, grandchildren and future generations to ensure sectarianism is not inflamed as a result of the way in which people exercise their rights. There is no doubt that genuine rights are involved here, but these rights conflict.  Where rights conflict, there is a necessity for compromise.  It is very important that compromise should be the order of the day as far as the marching season is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have welcomed, on behalf of the Government, the provisions of the North report.  It is the Government's policy that all those provisions should be implemented, both the statutory and non statutory provisions.  I am continuing to press the British Government to ensure the full content of the North report, which provides a mechanism for conciliation and regulation of marches, is put into effect.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is important that constitutional politicians seize the initiative back from the men of violence and, whatever their political differences, stand united against violence in everything they say and do for the remainder of the British general election campaign? As leader of this sovereign State, can he do anything further to put this approach in place and keep it in place for the duration of the election campaign?</P>

      <P>My meeting with the SDLP was a very important part of the initiative which the Government is taking to ensure that constitutional politics are centre stage.  Constitutional politicians &mdash; those who have never used or supported the use of violence &mdash; are the ones who ultimately have the capacity, means and strength to make the decisions and compromises necessary to move matters forward.</P>
      <P>It must also be recognised that there are risks involved in this matter, the biggest of which is to be found in reaching out, not to the extremes on one's own side but to those on the other side. Real risk taking involves reaching out to the other side of the traditional divide with which one's supporters disagree.  When I hear comments about risk taking in the peace process, they sometimes seem to be solely directed at reaching out to the extremists on one's own side of the divide. That is not where real risk taking is required &mdash; it is required in reaching across the traditional divide.  I hope the parties will do that with added conviction and strength of purpose when the talks resume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also hope, however, that all the parties with an electoral mandate will be capable of taking part in those talks.  For that to happen, it is very important there should be at a very early moment <Col N="919" /> an IRA cessation of violence which is unequivocal and for good.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear of the Taoiseach's meeting with the SDLP and other members of the Government.  In the light of the despicable acts of violence and arson against places of worship, does he have plans to meet any of the other parties, particularly those in the business of building consensus such as the Women's Coalition, the Alliance Party and the Green Party, which I will meet in Belfast on Friday and which has candidates standing for election?</P>
      <P>I suggest that he include in his discussions, particularly those on the marching season, the option of a device designed to build compromise, the preferendum idea with which he is familiar and which has been promoted by the Green Party for many years.  In the case of marches, this device does not simply look at rights from one extreme to the other but at the various options and interpretations of those rights and whether the marching season should proceed in certain areas.  That would not be aimed at polarising communities but at trying to build on the greatest level of common ground.  That should be part of the Taoiseach's discussions with all parties.</P>

I have had, as the Deputy will recall, a meeting with the Green Party on the matter at which the suggestion of a preferendum was discussed.  I also broached that proposal in my recent discussions with the Women's Coalition as a possible instrument which might be used at some point in the talks.</P>
      <P>There is considerable difficulty with the proposal in terms of devising the questions on which preferences could be expressed.  There could be quite an amount of difficulty in finding an agreed phraseology for the series of questions.  However, I have no doubt that the independent chairman of the talks will be willing to use any means of establishing and expanding the common ground between the parties, including the possible use of the instrument to which the Deputy referred, at least within the talks themselves if not in a general consultation with the entire population.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House, in common with loyalists and every right thinking person want an unequivocal ceasefire declaration <Col N="920" /> by the Provisionals.  Nonetheless is it not a reality that the performance on the North report by the British Government clearly indicates the total failure of the efforts of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in the peace process and is a clear indication of just how they have failed in this area of negotiations?  Is it not a fact that they were dismissed by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in the report on the North within the past week?  Despite the Taoiseach's numerous telephone calls and discussions with the British Prime Minister does he not agree that he has failed singularly to make any progress on the matter of marches and the difficulties encountered during the marching season, a clear indication, in addition to many others, of his failure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Deputy has said.  The position, having regard to the North report requires constant vigilance from the Irish Government.  Its recommendations should be implemented and I welcome those elements which have been implemented so far without legislation.  I welcome the appointment of the North Commission.  Those appointed to it have a high standard of independence and are of a calibre of people who will be able to assist the parties wishing to find a compromise in achieving our objective.</P>
      <P>In regard to contentious marches in Northern Ireland, it is very important to recognise there has to be willingness to reach a compromise.  It is exceptionally difficult when there is not willingness at least in embryo, on both sides, for people outside the situation to impose a compromise.  As somebody who has been a Minister for Justice and dealt with public order issues, I am sure Deputy Burke realises that unless there is a willingness, even willingness to begin to think of compromise, it becomes very difficult for external agents to impose compromise, something all fair-minded Members will recognise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Government's policy is concerned, I am very pleased at the manner in which this Government is operating the Anglo-Irish agreement, negotiated by a Government of which I was a member and which for the first time provided a means by which the Irish Government could influence events and policy in Northern Ireland.  While that agreement was not supported initially by the Deputy's party I am glad that, when they had governmental responsibility subsequently, <Col N="921" /> they used it fruitfully.  That continues to be the best way in which the Irish Government can work to protect the interests of the Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland and deal with all others issues, including contentious marches, job discrimination and policing.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective is to reach an overall agreement.  That is why I am very pleased that, as a member of the Government responsible for drawing up the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I have also been a member of the Government which, for the first time ever, obtained a fixed date for all party talks in which all could participate.  That was something not available under any previous Government but was on 10 June, 1996 and remains available to all parties once they have foresworn violence.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach say what is the present position of the framework document?  A poll published in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> last week showed that 94 per cent of people living in the North want to negotiate a settlement, yet 74 per cent believe the Stormant talks will fail and one person in ten only believes the two Governments are doing sufficient about the talks.  Did the Taoiseach discuss the framework document with the SDLP?  What is the present position in relation to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy well knows, the framework document represents something I am happy to have been able to achieve, as Taoiseach, building on the preparatory work of a previous Administration, representing a shared understanding between the Irish and British Governments of the possible outcome of talks.  We did not simply invite the parties to talks on 10 June last and suggest it was up to them to find a solution. As a result of my being able to finalise agreement on a framework document with Mr. John Major, the two Governments were able to give participants in the talks which commenced on 10 June last our ideas on what might be agreed.  For this to work, it is necessary that the parties within Northern Ireland should come to an agreement on proposals dealing with the substance of the matters in the framework document. Unfortunately the talks have not reached the stage at which matters of substance are being discussed. Therefore, the matters in the framework document are not yet being discussed.  The difficulty encountered in the talks so far has been that the focus has been on issues of procedure and the decommissioning of arms.  When the talks resume on 3 June next, it will be very important that they progress into issues of substance, at which stage they will move into discussion of all of the issues put forward in a very systematic and careful way by the two Governments in the framework document.</P>

      <P>In regard to cross-Border trade, does the Taoiseach agree the business community and the CBI in the North have been very positive about North-South co-operation and development? Referring to Dr. McDaid's question, does he agree that will make the operation of the framework document much easier?  Does the Taoiseach consider anything more can be done by the business community to highlight the economic difficulties and losses of the community within the North, or for that matter on the entire island?</P>
      <P>Furthermore, does he agree and approve of the CBI's recent useful meeting with Sinn Féin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most important that the business community avails of every opportunity to bring home to people the price being paid in terms of lost jobs, lost incomes and lost opportunities for people not only in Northern Ireland but in the Border region generally as a result of continued sectarian violence in Northern Ireland and of the military campaign by the IRA.  Every opportunity should be availed of to bring that to the notice of the public.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked what more the business community could do.  It would be useful if more people within that community became active in political life in Northern Ireland since there has not been the normal renewal in political life there.  The ethos of calculated risk-taking which characterises successful business might usefully be applied in the talks process in Northern Ireland where the risk of making a compromise would be taken by the participants on a calculated basis with a view to achieving something better and greater than would be achieved by simply adhering to one's present position.</P>
      <P>That culture of risk-taking is missing in terms of the willingness to make compromise across the community divide in Northern Ireland.  We could do with more people who have been imbued with that culture in business coming into political life, as part of a general renewal of the political life. Regarding any meetings which may have taken place with any political parties, I have no comment to offer on what individual organisations do in terms of meetings with Sinn Féin or with any other party.  That is a matter for them entirely. Obviously, in so far as the responsibilities of a sovereign government are concerned they are a different matter.</P>

The Minister of State will be aware there have been serious complaints in relation to the chimneys in the past.  A number of attempts have been made to rectify the problem. Despite money being spent most people consider the houses to be a health and fire hazard and that earlier remedial works were ineffective.

      <P>I understand Sligo Corporation and the National Building Agency are satisfied with the integrity of the work and the residents have expressed satisfaction in this regard.  There may be a small number of complaints.  With this type of work there may be items that need to be addressed in the way a builder would deal with a snag list.  I am satisfied the work being carried out is meeting the need it was designed to address.  I assure the Deputy there is no problem in relation to any outstanding payment.  The £800,000 is ear-marked, the vast bulk of which has already been spent.  My understanding is that there is general satisfaction with the work.  Because remedial works of this kind are trying to put right a problem sometimes people would prefer to have the whole project started again from scratch.  A remedial works scheme is literally remedial works.  I am happy that the work is satisfactory and if there are outstanding matters of detail Sligo Corporation is the local authority with responsibility for dealing with them.</P>

The Minister of State will be aware also that in 1993-4 a number of chimneys were rebuilt on the instructions of the Department of the Environment and that some of the residents are unhappy with the standard of work. I am concerned the £800,000 would be spent and that the work would still not be completed satisfactorily. Will the Minister of State reassure all <Col N="924" /> concerned and undertake to have an independent assessment of the work carried out?  From my knowledge and having met with the residents of the estate they have little confidence in either Sligo Corporation or the National Building Agency and it is difficult to blame them.  In the interest of ensuring value for money will the Minister of State undertake an independent assessment of the work when completed to ensure its safety for health purposes as a number of people suffer from respiratory problems due to smoke in the houses?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 135 and 157 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the legislative changes required to assign motor tax income to local authorities, as <Col N="925" /> proposed in Better Local Government &mdash; a Programme for Change, £100 million was provided in my Department's Estimate for 1997 by way of rate support grant to ensure local authorities would have sufficient income to enable them continue their operations.  The full amount has been paid to all local authorities.  Legislation to give full effect to the new funding system will be introduced in the House this week and, subject to the co-operation of Deputies opposite, should be enacted quickly.  This will allow motor tax proceeds to be retained by local authorities to fund their services, subject to the equalisation arrangements, already announced.</P>
    <P>All local authorities collecting motor tax will contribute to the equalisation fund on a basis to be provided for in the legislation.  In 1997, the fund will be used, in the first instance, to ensure the income lost through the abolition of domestic water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant is made good to each local authority and that there is an equitable sharing out of the buoyancy the new system will deliver.  A more comprehensive equalisation system will be introduced for next year and subsequent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is slightly better.  What the Minister has indicated is a fundamental change in local authority funding.  I do not think the way to proceed is by rushed legislation.  I suggest, in light of an expected election within a number of weeks, he should not try to rush the legislation through the House.  I would much prefer if he said he was increasing the £100 million allocation to local authorities and let us deal with the legislation after the election.  The Minister has not addressed the question.  I accept he has paid out £100 million to local authorities.  Local authorities are now in serious financial difficulties.  One local authority had 60 per cent less finance at 30 March 1997 than at 30 March last year due to the abolition of water charges.  Will the Minister take account of this?  While he indicated how much was received last year under the rate support grant, he did not take account of the fact that water charges were in place.  Given their severe financial difficulties, will he take the amount local authorities had gained from water charges as at 30 March 1996 from the rate support grant and give them that money?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My allocation of £100 million was to compensate for rate support grant and charges. <Col N="926" /> The total combined amount of rate support grant and charges will amount to £254 million per annum, or £24 million per month.  I have already allocated £100 million, which would average £25 million per month.  There should be no reason for anybody to be in deficit because the allocation not only compensates for any expected income obtained from rate support grant but also for charges that would have been levied for the first four months of this year, had the Government not wisely decided to abolish them from 1 January.</P>
      <P>The legislation was approved by the Government this morning.  I have explained it in detail in the programme for local government change.  The Deputy will be aware that I will publish enabling legislation tomorrow on funding, entailing the establishment of the transfer of moneys from the roads fund to local authorities.  Instead of sending this money to the Exchequer, local authorities will keep 80 per cent locally while 20 per cent will be remitted to establish the equalisation fund. The measures to be taken to establish this fund will also be detailed when the Bill is published tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The second round of legislation will be dealt with in the second half of the year.  I have promised that it will be enacted to coincide with the centenary of local government, which will be next year.  It will include details of all the other measures, such as the strategic policy committees and the new changes.  I hope to include initiatives regarding value for money and the establishment of specific targets, etc., in the Bill tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I doubt it.  I do not agree with targeting one section of the community to pay for local government.  I hope we will overcome the difficulties when I am on the other side of the House and the Minister is on this side.</P>
      <P>If cashflow was evenly spread throughout the year, as the Minister suggests in the case of water charges, adequate funding could be provided to local authorities.  However, in the past, local authorities made huge efforts to collect their water charges at the beginning of the year, receiving up to 60 per cent or 70 per cent of them in some instances.  It helped their cashflow and enabled them to collect the outstanding charges throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to my research, local authorities, both urban and county, have had similar experiences to three local urban councils in County Meath.  My town of Trim was 50 per cent down on cashflow at the end of March.  It received a rate support grant last year, to 30 March, of £14,500 while it had collected service charges of £30,000.  This year it received a grant of £22,000. At this time last year it had £44,000 at its disposal; this year it has £22,000.  Navan is 33 per cent down <Col N="927" /> and Kells is 60 per cent down.  Will the Minister look at this problem as a matter of urgency, even as his legislation is pending, to assist the cash flow situation?</P>

      <P>To date, charges have been normally collected in two moieties.  The first moiety would have probably been collectable by now. The allocation of £100 million out of the total annual expected income of £254 million for a four month period is generous.  While one would expect support at the rate of £21 million per month, £25 million per month has been granted.</P>
      <P>If there are specific cashflow difficulties I will look at them again.  However, I hope speedy enactment of the legislation to be introduced to the House this week will ensure that such difficulties are permanently resolved when a new buoyant system of local government funding is established.  This will allow local authorities access to a good system of funding which will enable them to maintain and develop services.  I look forward to the co-operation of Deputies on the other side of the House in enacting this legislation. It is not complicated because it is the first of two measures and it should be possible to enact it in reasonable time while allowing Deputies on all sides of the House to give it good consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of leakage reduction measures is one of my Department's key strategies for ensuring an adequate supply of good quality water to all users.  A number of initiatives to give practical effect to this strategy have already been completed and others are under way or planned.</P>
      <P>The most comprehensive study undertaken here into the operation and management of water supply systems was carried out in the Dublin region in 1995 on my initiative and that of my Department.  It covered more than one third of households and its main purpose was to assess existing levels of service and water supply problems in the Dublin region and to advise on the cost effective future development of the water supply networks.  It was commissioned in the belief that leakage reduction measures should be central to developing an investment strategy to meet the future water needs of the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key findings of the study was that more than 40 per cent of the water produced in the supply systems in the Dublin region was being lost through leaks.  The consultants recommended that comprehensive works be undertaken to significantly <Col N="928" /> reduce the level of loss.  On foot of this recommendation, I approved a five year programme of works in April 1996 costing £32 million with a view to saving approximately 22 million gallons of water per day, or approximately half of the current loss.  Dublin Corporation is well advanced in the procedures for awarding the contract and the European Commission, in recognition of the real benefits to be achieved from the project, approved Cohesion Funding for it in July 1996.  Since completion of the study, Dublin Corporation has already intensified its leaks control systems, including employing a contractor to undertake specific works which, to date, has saved almost two million gallons of water per day.</P>
    <P>Studies of the water supply networks in the cities of Galway and Waterford were commissioned by my Department in October 1995.  The results of pilot tests, which covered approximately one third of each city, have shown leaks running at approximately 60 per cent of the total water demand.  The studies are well advanced and final reports are due to be completed within a matter of weeks.  The final reports will be set out in a programme of mains rehabilitation and leaks control and they will be given urgent consideration by my Department when they are submitted. Similar projects were completed in the last few years in Dundalk and parts of County Meath under the European Commission funded SPRINT programme.  In addition, projects under my Department's resorts initiative have been completed in Tramore and commenced in Westport.</P>
    <P>The benefits arising from the leakage reduction measures identified in the final report of the Dublin study and the interim reports from the studies in Galway and Waterford confirm the need to make a national assessment of the condition of water supply systems.  Plans are well advanced for engaging consultants to undertake a national water audit to determine for each local authority area, among other things, the need for new measures to reduce leakage.  Results should be available by the middle of next year.</P>
    <P>A number of specific projects are also being advanced in the cities of Cork and Limerick and in County Wexford.  Proposals submitted to my Department by the local authorities concerned envisage that almost seven million gallons of water a day can be saved by implementing these projects which are due to start this year under my Department's water and sewerage services capital work programme.  Local authorities generally have been provided with copies of a guidance manual prepared by consultants on ways to reduce leakage and have been invited to put forward proposals in this area.  A number of such proposals have been received and are under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister is in the last month of his term of office in the Department of the Environment.  He emphasised earlier that 40 per cent of treated water in the Dublin area is lost <Col N="929" /> through leakage because the pipes are 50 years old and defective.  He also said that 60 per cent of water in the Galway area is lost through leakage. It is not known how much water is lost through leakage in other parts of the country. Will the Minister admit that the allocation of £32 million to tackle this serious problem is little more than a drop in the ocean?  The Minister will leave office soon, following the five year lifetime of this Government, but the problem of water leakage will be left to the next Administration to address.  Money will be much scarcer in the next five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave the decision on whether I have weeks, months or years left to enjoy in the Department of the Environment to the discretion and good judgment of the people. I have been Minister for the Environment for two years and not five as the Deputy suggested.  When I took office, I commissioned the Générale des Eaux study on water leakage.  This area was totally neglected before I arrived in the Department. For the first time, there is comprehensive and clear data on the extent of water leakage and a comprehensive investment programme targeted at reducing leaks.</P>
      <P>I allocated £32 million to halve the number of leaks in Dublin and I have already implemented measures which saved two million gallons of water a day in Dublin.  However, the Deputy and her party want to channel scarce resources away from such capital and environmentally positive action towards the folly of spending £200 million on metering water.  They want to impose the burden of paying for water on citizens while at the same time allowing leaks to continue unabated. There is nothing environmentally sensitive or economically sound about the daft proposals and various policies which have emanated from the Deputy and her party on the water issue in recent years.</P>
      <P>As a result of my focus on water leaks, there is comprehensive data for the first time on this area. An investment programme is up and running and concrete results have already been achieved.  In the years ahead, under the stewardship of the current Administration, there will be an environmentally sound and progressive policy on water and maintenance.</P>

      <P>There are mounds of data but the problem is lack of action.  The study commissioned by the Minister stated that £500 million needed to be invested in the Dublin region over <Col N="930" /> the next 20 years to tackle the water leakage problem.</P>

      <P>The Minister has provided £32 million but that falls very short of the finance required.  It is merely tokenism, a nod in the direction of rectifying the water leakage problem.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister was gracious enough to mention metering, did he authorise the installation of meters in local authority houses in Longford town, Bray, Galway and Monaghan?  If he did not authorise it, on whose authority were those meters installed?  Was the finance for the installation of the meters provided by his Department? Is it Government policy to install meters before the election but to keep them under wraps and not inform the public about their real purpose until it is over?  Is this another manifestation of the trickery of the Labour Party in saying one thing before an election and doing the opposite when it is over?  The Minister should not expect intelligent people to accept that water meters are new fangled alarm clocks or underground Christmas trees.  Everybody knows they were installed for the purpose of charging for water. That is obviously the policy of the rainbow coalition and the Minister should come clean on this matter and tell us the truth.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the question has been extended.  It is a measure of the economic competence of the Progressive Democrats that it decides the halving of the water loss is tokenism. That is the import of the Deputy's comments.</P>
      <P>The KPMG report stated it would be uneconomical to meter water and that it would cost £200 million.  The greater Dublin area water supply strategic study examined a range of pricing options.  The Générale des Eaux recommendation was that universal metering would require uneconomic investment levels and that meters are generally expensive to install and maintain.  It also said running costs are high.  It agreed with the recommendation of the KPMG report that it would be uneconomical to invest £200 million in meters when more productive economic and environmental capital investments were required for leakage prevention programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be explicit regarding Government policy because many kites have been flown by the Progressive <Col N="931" /> Democrats.  The kites were different colours, depending on whether they were flown by the Deputy from the west or the Deputy from the east.</P>

His proposal is that £200 million of scarce capital resources should be expended in metering water supplies rather than in conserving them which is my priority and that of the Government.

      <P>Meters were installed in houses in areas of south Dublin as far back as 50 years ago. Local authorities charged for water up to 1 January when the charges were abolished in keeping with Government policy.  Approximately 10 per cent have provided for the possibility of installing meters in local authority houses.  This was not approved by the Government.  Neither was it notified as determinations are made locally. Unless the Deputy wants control to be retained in the Custom House as part of a centralised system, I propose to allow local authorities to make general decisions about houses, for example, the lay out of kitchens and the number of bedrooms.</P>
      <P>On policy, the Government has abolished domestic water charges.  Whatever the Progressive Democrats may say or do, one thing is certain, if returned to power there will be an imposition on every household.</P>

      <P>A detailed review of the urban renewal schemes, as they have operated since 1986, has been undertaken and, as part of the review, a consultants' study on the impact of the schemes in economic, social and architectural terms was published in December 1996.  Submissions were invited from interested parties and organisations on the study's conclusions and recommendations and the consultative process culminated in a conference in Dublin Castle on 25 March which I chaired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that all stages of the consultation process have been completed, I am finalising the framework for urban renewal policy for the future.  This will draw from the lessons learned during the past decade or so, as outlined in the consultants' <Col N="933" /> report, and will have regard to the valuable suggestions made during the consultation process. I expect to have policy proposals ready for submission to the Government before too long.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister of State provide more detail?  Are there specific areas where changes might be brought forward?  When the current urban renewal scheme was announced in Dublin Castle approximately three years ago by the then Minister, Deputy Michael Smith &mdash; Deputy Emmet Stagg held the Minister of State's portfolio &mdash; the policy was that on this occasion there would be no extensions.  What is the reason for the change?  Given that we now find ourselves in limbo, is the Minister of State still open to the possibility of bringing forward good and necessary amendments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first occasion on which a scheme has been extended.  The current scheme was due to expire on 31 July.  A number of submissions were received in the Department highlighting the difficulties being experienced by developers, local authorities and investors in meeting the deadline.  Some dealt with aspects of the scheme which were under consideration by the consultants conducting the review.  It was a good and wise decision to extend the scheme, which was welcomed even by Opposition Deputies, to ensure these problems would not get in the way of its success.</P>
      <P>While urban renewal designation has been extremely successful, as recognised by the consultants, in generating economic activity, there have been numerous shortcomings in approach. We have to continue to develop and improve policy to overcome them.  They relate to planning procedures and land tenure among others.</P>
      <P>The two aspects considered in the review which were not taken into account in previous schemes were the social context in which urban renewal policy has to be developed and the quality of urban design.  These are important factors.  The review has highlighted important and fundamental points which must be incorporated in the next scheme.</P>
      <P>The consultation process was speedy.  As soon as the review was published, the comprehensive consultation process commenced. Now that the final piece of the jigsaw has fallen into place &mdash; the conference was held a few weeks ago &mdash; we will be in a position, I hope before too long, to finalise our approach to the next scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not underestimate the importance of the review process.  One can be glib and think that by drawing a line on a map one can create wonderful things.  This does not happen in all cases.  I <Col N="934" /> remind the Deputy that the economic circumstances at the time the current scheme was designed were totally different although credit is due to its designers.  It has been an important and valuable scheme.  It was a time of recession and there was little economic and construction activity.  Conditions are now healthy.  I have no doubt the Deputy will agree this is due in no small part to the efforts of the Government which has provided good and stable government.  The scheme will have to match current circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a site in my constituency with which the Deputy's party leader is familiar which is being promoted as an ideal location for the Finglas technology park.  There is, however, a need for designation.  Can this be done under the current scheme?  The view is that the project is being delayed because the current scheme has been extended.  There is a need to create employment in Finglas.  The developer may leave if an answer is not given soon.  The Government has designated some areas of Dublin 4, yet approval has not been given to the inclusion of much more needy areas in other parts of the city.  Can the Minister offer any hope to these areas where developers are waiting to proceed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to a specific site and I do not like dealing with specific cases without being prepared.  However, urban renewal designation <i>per se</i> would not be of great assistance in the circumstances to which the Deputy referred.  While I recognise the need to encourage manufacturing industries and other economic activities to set up in deprived areas, urban renewal designation as defined in the Urban Renewal Act is not the panacea for all ills. This designation is specifically targeted at urban renewal projects and I think I am correct in saying that the site to which the Deputy referred would not benefit greatly from urban renewal designation <i>per se.</i> However, this is not to say a strong case cannot be made for its inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the changes in economic circumstances between the time the scheme was put in place and now.  I am sure she will agree that her party cannot claim credit for either.  However much the Government might like to think that all the miracles occurred during the past two years, economic cycles change every six or seven years.  We should be planning now for the downturn in the current economic cycle, something the Government is not doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I detect from what the Minister said that there might be a different attitude to, and a different set of parameters for, a new urban renewal scheme.  Some areas have benefited greatly from the urban renewal scheme and there has been a good uptake in those areas which were included. However, some places which did not benefit from the current scheme may not benefit from a new scheme if the rules and regulations are changed <Col N="935" /> too much.  It is clear from reports that there were shortcomings in the last scheme.  Matters such as the social context, the quality of the urban design, etc, are very important and the regulations governing these should be improved.  However, if we want to ensure the new scheme attracts the kind of support the previous scheme attracted and that there will be development in areas which did not receive urban renewal designation under the last scheme, the rules and regulations should not be changed too much.  I ask the Minister to give an assurance that this will be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am very much in favour of the urban renewal designation mechanism which is a very good one and which, as the evidence shows, works well.  I congratulate the original designers of this mechanism. I agree with the Deputy that we must adopt a more strategic approach to any new scheme.  In this context, I will be looking to local authorities to adopt a more strategic approach to requirements at local level.  The development of this idea will enhance what has gone before rather than negate it.  We need to be clever and smart in terms of how we use this mechanism.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's first point, Democratic Left is part of the Government and it can claim as much credit as any other party for the good state of the economy.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation has made proposals for a programme of works to upgrade some of its housing stock, including the provision of central heating.  There are no funds at my disposal from which assistance could be provided for the works in question and the corporation was <Col N="936" /> advised accordingly.  Subsequently, the corporation proposed a reallocation of capital resources from its housing construction programme to fund the programme of upgrading works submitted earlier.  The corporation's proposals are under consideration and a decision will be notified as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it will take Dublin Corporation 35 years to install central heating in all senior citizens' complexes if it keeps going at its present rate?  It should be possible to allocate some of the fruits of our mar dhea booming economy to elderly citizens.  The way it treats its elderly citizens is the hallmark of a society.  However, if Dublin Corporation continues at its present rate many senior citizens, sadly, will not be around to enjoy the comfort and warmth provided by central heating.  When will a decision be made on the corporation's proposals and what conditions will apply?  Is the installation of central heating in senior citizens' complexes covered by these proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am dealing with this matter as speedily as possible.  I accept that many flat complexes in Dublin need to be upgraded and that people need central heating and should be entitled to it as a matter of course.  However, there are considerable costs involved.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a proposal by Dublin Corporation to divert funding from new start-ups to upgrading complexes in this way.  I am looking sympathetically at this proposal.</P>
      <P>As regards the conditions which will apply, I am not in a position to outline these as we have not yet reached this stage.  The central heating aspect of the improvement programme involves 9,098 dwellings, including 2,579 old persons' dwellings.  Under this proposal a considerable number of units would be provided with central heating.  However, this will have an effect on necessary works such as the repair of roofs, window replacement and safety issues.  While I agree with the Deputy that it is a pity it is only happening now, nevertheless it is being done.  I am dealing with the proposal as quickly as possible as I understand the necessity for it.</P>

Many old people are riddled with arthritis, osteoporosis and other illnesses and are at risk from open fires and a lack of heating. I ask the Minister to ensure that this work is carried out immediately.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review section 8 of the 1992 Planning Act in which public representatives are requested to pay a £30 fee to An Bord Pleanála every time they make submissions on matters before the Bord; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning appeal fees were introduced to offset, to some extent, the considerable cost of the operation of the appeals system operated by An Bord Pleanála, as were fees for formal submissions and observations on appeals submitted to the board.  A public representative may make representations to the board in support of others who have made appeals or who have made submissions or observations on an appeal and in such cases no fee applies.  However, where the representations raise new and substantive issues these constitute formal submissions or observations to which the fee provision apply.  I have no proposals to change this position which has applied since 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>
      <P>I accept the need for it as people who want to appeal a decision may want to go to their public representative, but public representatives should be in a position to make their observations known to the board in their own words.  Is the Minister aware that public representatives can merely support a submission made, which is really a pointless exercise?  Will the Minister look at this matter again with a view to allowing public representatives put forward their views to official bodies? Nothing would be lost in allowing that, provided a submission has already been made by somebody else and that it is not an appeal.  It is ridiculous that public representatives should be asked to pay £30 to represent their constituents.  I ask the Minister to examine this with a view to overturning it.  I understand the reason this was put in place &mdash; I do not want to end up making a series of representations to An Bord Pleanála &mdash; but I should not be penalised at the rate of £30 per letter if I want to make known a point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of merit in the case made by the Deputy and I have given it careful consideration.  Two things strike me.  First, the reason for the establishment of An Bord Pleanála was to set up a clearly independent appeals board that was not subject to political influence. There was concern that the existing appeals system, which was purely at the discretion of the Minister, was less than independent and, because of that, everybody who stands before the board should have equal status.  The notion that one accords a measure of additional status to a public representative by implication gives him a particular status and an added weight to the representations he or she might make.  It is worth reflecting on that point.  The second and equally valid point is one referred to by the Deputy.  If the public felt that a free way to make appeals or observations was to use the local councillor or TD as a conduit, that would be burdensome both on <Col N="938" /> the local representative and on An Bord Pleanála. There are people who like to make representations &mdash; I hope they would not be discouraged from making valid ones &mdash; but some might think they can trot down to the local TD at his or her weekly clinic, put in a list of complaints and expect them to be acted upon.  I accept there is a great deal of weight on the other side of the argument in relation to the right of a public representative to have access to an appeals mechanism such as this without penalty, but on balance it is difficult to decide to open the channel completely. I do not know whether it is possible to have a reduced rate and if that will address the concerns or compound both sides of the argument. My decision to date is that the system that has operated since the Planning Act was amended in 1983 is operating reasonably fairly, although a number of local councillors have voiced particular concerns to me.  It is not a closed book, I am open to persuasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the independence of the board and what the perception might be, but I will never concede to the perception that local or national public representatives in any way lessen the independence of a body simply because they make representations on behalf of constituents.  The Minister has suggested a compromise that might be acceptable in relation to reducing the fee, and I ask him to consider that, as was done in relation to the Data Protection Commissioner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would because if a public representative wants to make a submission in support, it will not cost anything, but if he or she wants to go a little further, £10 or £15 will not break the bank.  The Minister's suggestion is a good one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would advise caution in relation to this matter.  As a member of two local authorities for the past 25 years, I appreciate the point made by the Deputy.  However, I have also had the experience, in cases where planning permission issued in the name of Mr. A or Mr. B, of a member appealing against the decision of his own council, not having raised an objection at local authority level or put through a section 4.  I would encourage the Minister to double the charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not take that line. Everybody has a different view on this matter. We can talk about independence but it is undemocratic to ask public representatives to pay money to do the job they are entrusted to do by the people.  That is playing down their role.  The Minister should allow one letter to be written without charge in cases where an appeal has <Col N="939" /> already been lodged.  Public representatives should not become involved in appealing every decision but if somebody has paid £100 they should be allowed write one letter free of charge or at a reduced fee.  Something must be done about this matter because many public representatives pretend they are doing something when in fact they are merely writing a harmless letter to An Bord Pleanála.  If it did not cost anything, or very little, to write a letter, we could be straight with our constituents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have heard from the views expressed by various Deputies, there is no consensus on the right action to take in this matter. I would be concerned that the public might see the councillor as the conduit for all appeals if they had free access and every other citizen would be required to pay a fee.  I will reflect further on all the points made and see if I can come up with a solution that might improve the matter.</P>

      <P>It was brought to the attention of our Whip just a few hours ago that the Government wished to deal with this matter this afternoon. In the normal course of events we would not agree to that but, as this is an issue which other Members of the House are anxious to see debated and brought to a conclusion, I asked our spokesperson to seek a briefing, as is the age old practice in the House in respect of something the Government wishes to do.  We were refused a briefing on the basis that this is not legislation.  If it was legislation, I would be happy to get on with it.  We do not have legislation, but in half an hour <Col N="941" /> we are being asked to respond to and debate a proposal about which we have no knowledge, and this is unsatisfactory.  We would be quite glad to deal with this matter during the course of the week, but we should not be expected to deal comprehensively and intelligently this afternoon with proposals which, presumably, were cleared at Cabinet today and about which we know nothing. If legislation is to be published we will deal with it then, but if legislation is to be published why do we need a debate now.  I know of no precedent for this approach.</P>
      <P>During the afternoon we asked if we could have the Attorney General's advice on this matter and copies of the licences given to the MMDS operators, which we have not got.  We have also asked on numerous occasions for the consultants' report.  If the Minister wishes to deal with this issue, a more satisfactory way of structuring a debate should be found.  If the Minister wishes to make a statement and give time later for questions and answers on it, that is fair enough.  I have no wish to prevent the Minister from making a statement.  Everybody is interested in these proposals, particularly my rural colleagues.  The Taoiseach's proposals seem an unfair way to treat the Opposition.  I would ask him, therefore, to amend his proposals and work out something more satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy is proposing.  The Government made decisions this morning on proposals brought to it by the Minister.  At the earliest opportunity subsequent to those proposals being approved by the Government, we are bringing them before the Dáil so that the Dáil and the people will be aware of what we are proposing.  We do not expect people in the House to be able to react definitively on hearing these proposals for the first time.  To assist in that respect we are providing for a period of questions and answers at the end of the debate.  Furthermore, to the extent that any proposals to be announced by the Minister refer to or require further action of a legislative or non-legislative kind requiring the approval of this House, those proposals will be brought before the House for debate in the normal way at the appropriate time, and the Deputy's party will be able to comment on them at that stage.  Furthermore, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will take questions in the Dáil next week.  This gives time for Deputies from the Deputy's party who have heard the Minister's statement and who have asked questions during the 30 minute question period but who still require further information or clarification to put down questions for answer next week when the Minister will answer questions for more than an hour on the subject.  It is important that we should allow the Minister to brief the House and the people at the earliest opportunity after decisions have been taken.  That is why the debate is being scheduled to be taken immediately.</P>

The Government made noises outside the House on the hepatitis C issue and promised to carry out what is in effect a cosmetic procedure, to issue heads of a Bill next Wednesday. We are willing &mdash; I have no doubt the Progressive Democrats are also &mdash; to agree to amend the Order of Business at any time this week to take the hepatitis C legislation, which is of greater urgency than the matter we will deal with today, and get it through all Stages this week.  As a Whip, I received two hours' notice of this issue.  I asked for a briefing for our spokesperson but that request was refused.

      <P>What the report tells us is that it is now easier to gauge the requirements of the national broadcasting services more precisely as to time and extent and that, even though frequency space is getting scarcer, it is still possible to exploit certain spare frequency capacity.  The report takes the view that it should be possible to grant a limited form of licence for UHF broadcasting for a short period of time between now and the end of the century.  The consultants were mindful, as I am, of the need to provide for the advent of digital television.  Before that time, therefore, it will be necessary to undertake a full <Col N="951" /> review of the means for the delivery of multichannel television from a frequency management and technology point of view.  I will be consulting with the incoming Director of Telecommunications Regulation with that end in view.</P>
      <P>The report is a complex one.  I have had to give it the fullest consideration and I have taken it into account in arriving at my decision.  In looking at the wider deflector issue, I have had to have regard also to the inputs from other interested persons and bodies.  I have also had to take legal advice on the implications of the court case for the wider deflector issue.  The integration of these considerations has been a long and painstaking process and it has only recently become possible to bring the result of all of this effort to fruition. All in all, I think it is not unreasonable that I have taken the trouble and the time to solve this issue.  So much for Deputy Brennan's silly allegation that I am making this up as I go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite the contrary, it is the outcome of very careful reflection.  Clearly the same cannot be said for his utterances.  If there has been prevarication, it has been by the party opposite while in Government.  I have chosen to act and I will set out for the House what I have decided.</P>
      <P>Before I do that, I should say there has been a great deal of ill-informed comment about the MMDS industry.  The MMDS technology has been variously described as unsuitable and out-moded. Nothing could be further from the truth. MMDS technology has proven itself to be eminently suitable and adaptable to Irish conditions, and as to the future, the use of this type of service for broad band delivery holds out some very interesting prospects.  The system has performed very well.  I would be happier had the MMDS companies been able to roll-out their services to a greater extent geographically.</P>
      <P>Licensees under the scheme which I am announcing today will operate their service on a secondary basis which means their systems will not be allowed to cause, or claim protection from, interference, in particular in relation to national television services.  The new systems will be licensed to operate in those parts of the country where appropriate frequency space can be identified by suitable applicants.  Because of the shortage of frequency space the UHF scheme is not intended for, and will not provide, coverage to all parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new scheme is intended for use only in the non-cabled areas of the country.  Unlike the services provided on Cable relay and MMDS, the new scheme will provide a very basic service.  It is envisaged at this stage that there will be provision for the retransmission of a maximum of four television programme services in any one place.  Licences, when issued, will expire on 31 December 1999.  Current deflector operators will <Col N="952" /> be eligible to apply as will MMDS operators, Cable Relay operators and those not currently providing any such service.</P>
    <P>This scheme will operate in the television broadcasting range of the UHF band.  As in other parts of the radio frequency spectrum, the number of frequency channels available within this range is limited.  Up to now frequency channels within the range have primarily been licensed to, or reserved for use by, the national television programme services.  There are currently three such services on air and a fourth one is planned.  It should be noted that two of these services.  RTE I and Network 2, are not yet operating on an all UHF basis.  Having fully investigated the matter it would still appear to be the case that only four programme services operating to the highest quality standards on a nationwide basis can be planned within the UHF band allocated for television broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The work of frequency planning and the implementation of the national stations has been carried out over a number of years and can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Each stage of development leads to a clearer identification of further network requirements.  In this regard, Teilifís na Gaeilge is a good example. It is the first national programme service to be broadcast solely on UHF and now that the main transmitters are in place we can identify more clearly the requirements for lower power transmitters. When these are operational, we can then identify any further requirements and so on.  I make this point to stress the fact that both the frequency requirements and the actual roll-out of the national services will continue to expand over time.  I am also mindful of the fact that TV3 is planned to broadcast solely on UHF.</P>
    <P>The new scheme which I am announcing today will at all times have to take second place to the national programme services when it comes to the use of any frequency channel.  The frequency assignments that are or may be licensed to or reserved for national services will have primacy as regards protection from interference from the new services. National programme services will be given priority at all times over the new scheme in the regulation of frequency channel usage.  This is a proper and prudent measure and is a provision that would be made by any Administration serious about protecting its national interests.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will be operated in compliance with Ireland's obligations under international broadcasting agreements.  In particular, consultation on the proposed characteristics for each transmitter will have to be undertaken where necessary with the UK Administration. This is required to ensure the principle of equitable access for both countries to available spectrum provided for under these agreements is maintained.  Where such international co-ordination agreement is required, licences can be granted only when this has been achieved.  Co-ordination can be a lengthy process and no <Col N="953" /> guarantees of a successful outcome can be offered.</P>
    <P>Available space in the UHF band is extremely limited and will become more so over time. Applicants for licences under this scheme will have to take account of that.  The band will become progressively more congested as the national services are rolled out.  It is not possible at this stage to anticipate the consequences for prospective licenses but it is likely that the quality of service provided to their subscribers will deteriorate over time.  The licences will specifically state that neither the Minister nor the Department accepts responsibility for quality of service and licenses will be obliged to inform their subscribers of this.</P>
    <P>Two licensed systems are currently in place for the provision of multi-channel television programme services &mdash; MMDS and cable.  Between them the companies concerned provide service to approximately 500,000 subscribers.  The roll-out of cable relay has been particularly successful with a high penetration rate by international standards, while MMDS accounts for about 80,000 subscribers.  However, a substantial number of rural dwellers does not receive multi-channel television services or, if it does, receives them from unlicensed providers.  This cannot continue. There are thus two reasons for the development I am announcing today: I want to increase the number of people who can receive multi-channel television and I want it done on the basis of fair competition which is legitimate and in keeping with good frequency management.</P>
    <P>It is essential that any new scheme should be technically feasible.  The consultants retained by my Department have identified a number of factors which led them to believe that spare capacity in the UHF band could be used for the provision of a limited licensed system of television re-transmission between now and 31 December 1999.  These factors include developments in analogue technology over the years and the fact that the State can identify more clearly the frequency spectrum requirements for the national services.  In addition, however, the type of licensing envisaged by the consultants could work only if the State does not apply to the scheme all of the normal quality and coverage standards usually applicable and, accordingly, I do not intend to apply them here.  While the consultants carried out a detailed analysis in respect only of the application by South Coast Community Television Ltd., there is no reason, in principle, to doubt the proposed scheme could not operate in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy programme of December 1994, A Government of Renewal, sought to allow competition between community television deflector systems and existing MMDS franchise holders in a way that would be in compliance with proper frequency management and our international obligations.</P>
    <P>While it is illegal and unlicensed, there is <i>de facto</i> competition in the market for the provision <Col N="954" /> of multi-channel services.  I am announcing a process which will create the conditions for fair competition as far as it is possible in the sector.  It will be open to deflector operators, MMDS, cable and others to apply for these licences.  The market has been characterised by unfair competition in that the licensed companies are obliged to meet all the costs appropriate to the provision of their services while unlicensed operators are in a position to avoid many of them.  My proposal will put that to rights.  Those who will be licensed in the UHF band, and that could include MMDS companies should they be successful applicants, will have to bear the full business cost of providing service.</P>
    <P>The unlicensed operators are currently in a position to provide the service at a price that is significantly lower than that charged by MMDS companies.  I refer, in particular, to the payment of royalties to the programme makers and the payment of licences fees to my Department.  These are not insignificant costs and they will become fully applicable under the new scheme.  Questions have also been raised about the compliance of unlicensed operators with tax and planning laws. These matters will have to be fully regularised before any licenses are issued.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the fact that because digital television will need to use significantly less frequency space to provide the current range of programmes, its advent will free up a great deal of frequency space.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The advent of digital television will create significantly more pressure on the use of the UHF band in the short to medium term. This arises from the need to broadcast simultaneously on analogue and digital technology during a transition phase which could last for anything up to 20 years.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, to stimulate the development of digital television, it may be necessary to increase the range of programme services.  It is partly because of the need to reserve enough spectrum capacity for digital television that my proposals will have a life span of less than three years and any licences issued under it will expire on 31 December 1999.  The advent of digital broadcasting with its enhanced capacity for delivering additional programme services could impact on conventional methods for multi-channel television distribution.  As regards a timescale for terrestrial digital television broadcasting, I understand that the UK authorities are planning for the introduction of such services in the early part of next year.</P>
    <P>My officials will start drawing up the legislative basis for this scheme.  I envisage regulations for the new scheme will be drawn up under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  Responsibility for the administration of the scheme will pass to the incoming Director of Telecommunications Regulation when the appropriate functional responsibilities are transferred to that office.  Applicants should be aware that fees will be payable and a substantial bond will have to be lodged to ensure compliance with the terms of the licence, including <Col N="955" /> any directions that may be necessary regarding the use of frequency channels.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of preparatory work is required but I hope it will be possible for applications to be submitted in autumn 1997.  A separate application will be necessary for each proposed transmitter site as each licence will be issued in respect of one site only.  If more than one site is to form part of a proposal, then each must be the subject of a seperate application. There will be no objection to different organisations pooling their resources for the purpose of forming a single entity for the provision of services. Multiple applications from a single entity will be accepted.  Applications will be confined to those parts of the country not covered by cable and each application will be judged on its merits. Furthermore, where two or more applications are submitted for a specific area, an adjudication process will be undertaken, if necessary, to determine which of them proposes the better use of the radio spectrum.  Depending on the applications received it may be possible to issue more than one licence in any one area.  Applicants will have to be legal entities and comply with planning and tax legislation.</P>
    <P>My Department will publish a national frequency list as soon as possible, to be updated at regular intervals, which will include the national frequency plan for the existing and envisaged frequency needs for the national programme services in the UHF band.  It will be each applicant's responsibility to propose the frequency channels it will use, in a way which must respect the primacy of the national plan at all times.  In all likelihood, a radio frequency interference analysis will need to be carried out by each applicant before submitting an application in respect of the selected channels.  If, in the context of any application, it is found that the proposed channels would have the potential to cause interference then that application will be refused.</P>
    <P>The date from which applications for licences may be submitted will be specified as soon as possible.  There will be a further date after which unlicensed activity will not be tolerated.  Licences will not be issued to those who are operating illegally beyond that point.</P>
    <P>Applicants will be obliged to show that they have entered into arrangements for the payment, in the event of a licence being issued, of appropriate copyright and royalty fees in respect of the programme services they propose to re-transmit. The Department will publish a list of all licensees and will make them available to all relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>Applicants will be obliged to forward a tax clearance certificate with their application along with a certificate of incorporation in the case of a company.  In addition, applicants will be obliged to forward with the application a certificate to be issued by the relevant local authority stating that the applicant is operating in compliance with the planning laws or a certificate that an application <Col N="956" /> for planning permission has been lodged in respect of all developments to be used in the provision of the service.  Failure to provide these certificates will invalidate the application.</P>
    <P>Licensees will be obliged to comply with all statutory regimes governing their activities and with all legal obligation imposed on them under Irish and European law.  Licences will contain terms and conditions, including strict power output limits.  Licensees will have to comply with the appropriate international guidelines regarding the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields. Failure to comply with the licence terms and conditions will result in loss of the licence.  These terms and conditions are required in order to ensure that the system operates fairly at national level and complies with our international obligations. In providing for these terms and conditions, I am taking at their word various spokespersons for deflector groups who have expressed their preparedness to conform to the requirements of good practice.</P>
    <P>As part of my general powers under the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996 I intend consulting with the incoming Director of Telecommunications Regulation regarding a complete review of all multi-channel re-transmission licences in the period up to the year 2000 with a view to facilitating the formulation of a comprehensive policy for the assignment of frequencies and standards for television broadcasting and re-transmission appropriate to the digital era.</P>
    <P>I ask all those who are directly concerned with this issue to take time to consider carefully the proposals I have outlined today.  The scheme is not simple.  It has many elements and needs to be examined carefully.  I am confident reasonable people will agree with me that it provides the basis for a balanced and equitable resolution of the current position.</P>
    <P>I am sure there is a wide consensus that the current situation is unsatisfactory to all sides.  I urge that, in assessing this scheme, those who have been to the forefront on either side would have regard to the wider interest of the community at large in having a properly ordered approach to the planning and use of the broadcasting bands for the future.  These measures represent the best framework for ensuring competition while respecting the terms of licences already issued.  There has been an unhappy and sometimes violent history to the roll-out of MMDS services.  I hope the measures I have put forward will result in peaceful co-existence and a wider choice for viewers.</P>

      <P>The leader of my party has already objected to the manner in which this ambush has been planned by the Minister.  He has brought proposals to the Cabinet and expected them to be debated here on the same day.  Nonetheless, we will give him that debate and I look forward to him answering some key questions.</P>
      <P>These proposals make a bad situation worse. He has not solved the problems of the MMDS operators, far from it &mdash; he has made their position much worse.  Neither has he solved the problems of the deflector operators.  He is squeezing them out of business.  At least he honestly admitted that the quality of the service will deteriorate over a period, for which the Department will not take any responsibility.</P>
      <P>Deflector operators have heard the Minister promising three year licences but MMDS operators may apply for licences in the same areas.  I thought MMDS operators already had licences for some of these area.  He said the licences would expire on 31 December 1999 and that current deflector operators will be eligible to apply, as will MMDS operators.  The latter will be reapplying to cover areas for which they already have licences.  If they do not already have licences for these areas that is one matter, because the deflector operators would not be there in any case.  However, if the MMDS operators are being asked to re-apply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for areas in which the new UHF bands are being made available, the position is made considerably worse.</P>
      <P>The supporters of the deflector system will see they are being asked to apply against MMDS operators in certain areas and that they are being pushed out on cost grounds.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Applicants will be obliged to show that they have entered into arrangements for the payment, in the event of a licence being issued, of appropriate copyright and royalty fees in respect of the programme services they propose to re-transmit.  The Department will publish a list of all licensees and will make them available to all relevant authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also spoke about taxation, planning permission and other matters.  He is offering the deflector operators immediate massive economic costs, three year licences, no guarantee thereafter, deteriorating services and no right to renewal.  If the Minister was operating a deflector <Col N="958" /> system and was offered this, he would call it a sticking plaster package, a con trick designed to get the Government through the election.  Deflector system operators will know they have three years and that, according to the Minister, their system will deteriorate because the national broadcaster and other companies are entering the airwaves.  They will face huge economic costs, which are immediately applicable, and they have no guarantee of renewal.  This scheme is a big deal and it is not designed to solve the problem.</P>

The Minister offers the deflector operators immediate economic costs, deteriorating service, no guarantee of renewal and short-term licences. That will not and should not be acceptable to them.  When I say it makes the matter worse all round, what does it do for the MMDS cable companies?</P>
      <P>Nowhere in this do I see the advice of the Attorney General.  If the Attorney General was professionally free to give advice in this case to the Government, what advice did he give on compensation? It is disingenuous of the Minister to read a 13 page script to the House without referring to the compensation claims possibly available to the MMDS companies which have been given licences which, as one company said on the national airwaves this morning, could be as much as £100 million.  It is not fair to the House to bring changes before it which are of little or no good to the deflector groups, while not commenting on this key legal difficulty.  It is a smokescreen which is dressed up in technical gobbledygook about the requirements of the UHF band and warnings that companies will be pushed off the UHF band in a couple of years when the big guns arrive.</P>

      <P>We will not be able to test the Minister before the general election.  A couple of hundred thousand television screens around the country are blank at the moment.  What will the Minister say to all those homes which now have no multi-channel television service?  Are we to wait until the Minister goes through this lenghty procedure to give dubious licences for short-term periods for deteriorating services at enormous cost before the screens are switched back on?  If that is what the Minister is saying, no screen will be switched on until the election is over.</P>
      <P>That will allow the Minister to travel around the country saying he brought an innovative scheme to the Dáil which will solve the entire problem.  Meanwhile, the screens are blank and multi-channel television is not being made available to people who require it and have had it up to now.  The Minister should tell us what he is going to say to those people and when the channels will be switched back on.  That is important.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the Government is trying to deal with the licences is unfair.  I have already asked for the consultants' report.  We have been told in the middle of this debate that it will be released after the debate.  It is no good for this Parliament to be told that a consultants' report will be made available after the debate on the scheme proposed by the Minister.  He will be able to say he answered all the questions put, but there are questions we cannot ask because we do not have the report.  The Minister is being extremely disingenuous in promising to issue a consultants' report after the debate.  It is dishonest to release a report after it has been debated in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> The Attorney General's advice has also not been made available to the House.  The Minister has been silent today on the major legal question. He is asking us to have a debate with no consultants' report or legal advice.  Why are the details of conditions and sums involved in the licences and whether universal coverage is required not available to the House?</P>
    <P>I object in the strongest possible terms to the Minister's withholding from the House of information pertaining to this debate which he has introduced.  It would be more honest of him to release the Attorney General's advice, the licence conditions and the consultants' report and tell us about the compensation.  We could then debate the matter in the House rather than being provided with an insult of a document which offers dubious licences at enormous economic cost and which will squeeze out the deflector systems by stealth over the months and years ahead, in the hope that that will get the Minister past the election. The Minister's statement today is a dishonest con trick of which he should be ashamed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister and read his speech.  I am not an expert on these matters. The Minister stated that the report he received from the consultants, which he has not let us see, is a complex and lengthy document.  I do not doubt that if it was made available to me I would require the advice and assistance of experts who are knowledgeable in this field in order to decipher its real meaning.  It is somewhat unfair that the Minister did not circulate the document which he read to the House to the Opposition to enable us to consult people who are more qualified on this matter than Members.</P>
      <P>One can only conclude that this temporary legislation, as the Minister described it, is being rushed through the House because we are facing a general election.  The deflector systems have been shut down to highlight the problem and seek some action from the Government.  The Government's response, as outlined by the Minister, appears to be a rather pathetic effort to cloud over the issue until after the election.  If the reference to the arrangements for these new proposals being ready for implementation, perhaps by next autumn, is anything to go on, I presume that excludes the autumn as a potential general election date and we shall have one this side of the summer.  I witnessed many attempts at obtaining electoral support on the basis of dubious commitments and actions by successive Governments. The Minister's present ones appear very dubious indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 250,000 households receiving multi-channel television reception from deflector systems, all of which are illegal and have been allowed to operate by successive Governments despite MMDS licences having been issued on the basis that they would be the only legal <Col N="962" /> transmitters of multi-channelled signals in non-cabled areas.  This raises a legal question as to where these proposals would stand in respect of such contracts entered into by the State with those companies awarded MMDS licences?  Will there be enormous legal wrangle for those licensees, leading to delay in their implementation?</P>
    <P>The Minister says he can implement these proposals, limited and extraordinary though they be, by way of regulation but that it would take him up to the autumn to have them in place.  In addition, he spelled out in great detail &mdash; lest it ever be thrown back at him later &mdash; that there are very limited spaces only on the spectrum for any successful applicant, if issued a licence, to provide a signal.  The Minister has given no indication of which areas would carry a signal from which an applicant might successfully transmit multi-channelled stations.  It is incumbent on him to supply the House with a map indicating in which non-cabled areas it would be possible to obtain the multi-channel signal.  For example, would it cover all of those covered by the present deflector systems?</P>
    <P>Everybody studying these proposals who had received a television signal through a deflector system will want to know whether they would enable them receive a signal in their area.  From what the Minister has said, that appears very doubtful in very many instances.  The Minister said he did not know whether a signal would be available.  This is a nice political ploy, a nice kick-to-touch, an attempt to put this issue beyond the date of the next election, when the truth will emerge.  It allows the Minister's Government colleagues, when canvassing or attending various meetings, to point to what the Government did and say the Minister is doing his utmost to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>While observing the Minister's political contortions to overcome his electoral difficulties about this matter, I do not deny there is a problem or that none of his predecessors succeeded in solving the matter of getting multi-channel choice into non-cabled areas.  Clearly, for one reason or another, the MMDS system, perceived by the then Minister, Deputy Raphael Burke as the best method of bringing multi-channel choice into all non-cabled areas has not worked, possibly because the State allowed deflector systems to continue when MMDS licensees were unable to proceed with the transmission of the signal and deflectors were there at a much lower price.</P>
    <P>I want to correct some press reports on the position of the Progressive Democrats in this matter.  We were in Opposition when the MMDS proposals were mooted by the then Minister, Deputy Raphael Burke.  We opposed them and questioned the value of that system.  Former Deputy Pat O'Malley emphasised that this technology might very quickly go out of date and a point was made about the health aspects of the MMDS system.  When it came to the discussions flowing from the last general election, I participated <Col N="963" /> on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, with then Deputy Pat Cox, in discussions on the programme for Government.  One matter that concerned us was the MMDS proposal.  We were unaware of how far down the road it had travelled. We wanted to include a clause in the programme for Government calling for a review of the overall MMDS system.  The Minister of the day, Deputy Raphael Burke, while not one of the negotiators, attended those discussions and informed us that the matter had proceeded beyond the point at which the MMDS arrangements for contracts could be reviewed.  At this point I am not clear on what date the contracts were signed, but that was the position as explained to us.  This meant there was little the Progressive Democrats could do.  We were told matters had moved to a stage at which commitments had been entered into.  Therefore, any press reports to the effect that the Progressive Democrats, jointly with Fianna Fáil in that Government, were committed to the MMDS system would not convey the correct position.  I wanted to put the record straight in that respect.</P>

      <P>The discussions took place in July 1989.</P>
      <P>I should like an opportunity to study these proposals further and revert to them again.  It is a very unusual way in which to present anything; we have often had Bills introduced, which were a lot simpler, but we were given more time to scrutinise them.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister said, my general impression is that this is a pathetic effort to get this difficulty about deflectors off the political agenda, to remove it as an obstacle, with the threat of candidates being put forward by deflector groups.  That threat and the anger to which Fine Gael Members have been subjected around the country &mdash; because of commitments and rash promises made by the Taoiseach in the course of previous by-elections &mdash; mean that those not very pleasant chickens for the Fine Gael Party are coming home to roost.</P>
      <P>While scrambling together this kind of solution might meet the needs of some, it is a rather poor effort.  That there are so many conditions, &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; built into this statement renders it a most surprising and extraordinary document. Time will tell whether what the Minister proposes will represent a satisfactory solution over the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is only right that the Minister should refer to the kinds of obstacles encountered, this will allow him to look back at a later stage and say &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  It leads one to believe the Minister is not making very strong commitments, or really saying these proposals constitute the answer, that every deflector system nationwide will be able to obtain a licence.  I am glad to see the Minister shake his head in agreement.  For <Col N="964" /> example, the United Kingdom Administration must be consulted.  In the course of his remarks the Minister had said:</P>
    <P>In particular, consultation on the proposed characteristics for each transmitter will have to be undertaken, where necessary, with the United Kingdom Administration.</P>

Who will get a signal?  What will be the legal position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the current MMDS licence holders?</P>
      <P>The Minister said co-ordination of the UK and our position could be a lengthy process with no guarantee of a successful outcome.  This whole matter could be one big ball of smoke.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated it should be clear that the available space in the UHF band is extremely limited and will become more limited over time.  He went on to say &ldquo;it is likely the quality of service provided to their subscribers will deteriorate over time&rdquo;.  He gave no assurances they will ever get a signal or that there will be a satisfactory picture. He said it will be poor in most cases and will get worse.  We all remember the days when there was only &ldquo;snow&rdquo; on our television screens.  People who have been used to crystal clear images on the deflector system will not be happy to return to poor quality, snowy type transmissions.</P>

    <P>The consultants retained by my Department have identified a number of factors which led them to believe that spare capacity in the UHF band could be used for the provision of a limited <Col N="965" /> licensed system of television re-transmission in the period between now and 31 December 1999...  In addition, however, the type of licensing envisaged by the consultants could work only if the State does not apply to the scheme all the normal quality and coverage standards usually applicable and accordingly I do not intend to apply them here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot give an indication as to when the applications for licences can be submitted.  Given all the doubts mentioned in the document, one does not know whether it will be ready by the autumn or even if one can apply by the autumn nor do we know how long the unlicensed activity will be tolerated.  One of the difficulties with the granting of the MMDS licence was that there was no specific date for the termination of illegal deflectors and no termination date is proposed here in regard to the unlicensed activity and how long it will be allowed continue.  It is unsatisfactory.  I hope the Minister will be able to tighten up on some of these issues later but I do not have much confidence that it will meet the needs of those who today are looking at blank screens.  I do not think the Minister is going so far as to state they can be assured of a picture.  Where it is clear that there is no signal and no licence can be issued will the Minister state what will be the position for those people?  Will he close down those deflector systems permanently?  They cannot get a signal under the new system and probably will not get it until next year.  Even if they could get it then, when will he close them down?  Given that he has stated these regulations cannot be in place before the autumn, what will happen between now and the autumn with the deflector systems?  Will they be allowed back on the air?  Will the transmission <Col N="966" /> sets seized over the years be returned to the owners?  I have been informed by way of reply to a parliamentary question that the Department did not want to be party to an illegal act by returning transmission sets to what would continue to be illegal operators.  Since he has introduced the new system, is it proposed to allow the transmission sets to be returned to them so that they can get back into business while the Minister is waiting for his proposal to come to fruition in the autumn?</P>

When I announce the period during which licence applications will be accepted, I will be open to accept applications from current deflector operators. MMDS operators, cable operators if they wish to apply and people who are not operating any system. I will put a closing date on that and anybody who continues to operate past that closing date, without having applied for a licence, will be operating illegally and I will take action against those operators, if there be such at that time.  I would like to be able to tell Deputies the precise dates we will have all these things.  I am not in a position to do that yet but what I was concerned to do today was to give the House and the public, who has an interest in this, an outline of what I have been able to put together as a result of all my reflections on what I believe is the best way we can get an equitable system in place.  That is what I have done.  When we come to proposing <Col N="967" /> regulations they will go through the normal process in the House.  If, at a future stage, any further matters need to be debated in the House I will come in here with that in mind.</P>

      <P>No.  That is to misunderstand the system.  The new system I propose will operate only in non-cabled areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of signal, it will be for operators applying for a licence to seek the appropriate space on the waveband for the service they wish to provide and to notify that to my Department, having undertaken the necessary interference analysis on it.  If it appears that the service can be carried without causing interference to the national services and to another established service, the applicant will be licensed.</P>
      <P>It will also be necessary, depending on the kind of proposal being made, to examine the situation with regard to the UK to see whether the proposed signal is of a power that interferes with the UK.  We cannot allow that to happen under the terms of international agreements into which we have entered.</P>
      <P>It is not possible, therefore, for me to provide the Deputy with a map of where signals can be provided.  It would be for the operators, the applicants, to provide me with a technical proposal as to how they would provide a signal in an area they will designate.</P>

Does he propose that the licences he will grant will be exclusive to the successful applicants or does he propose that MMDS and deflector operators co-exist in the same territorial area in view of the fact that MMDS operators have licences for parts of rural Ireland to which they cannot deliver a service?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> I have outlined the importance and value of the MMDS system, about which there has been much misleading comment.  It was selected at the outset because it is the kind of service that can provide rural areas with the same quality and range of signal and reception that is available in urban areas from cable systems.  While it is not possible to cable rural areas, the MMDS provides a similar kind of service in many rural areas, including County Kerry, where it provides a good service in a mountainous country.</P>

Will he advise whether those providing MMDS in an area could block a secondary system? While I appreciate that legal action has resulted in the closure of deflector systems, will he clarify the position regarding the litigation taken against many deflector providers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear that we are giving primacy to the national services &mdash; RTE, Telifís na Gaeilge and, eventually perhaps, TV 3 &mdash; and it is appropriate that we should do so.  My proposed system will be treated as a secondary system and will not be allowed to interfere with the principal services.</P>
      <P>The prospect is the quality of service that will be available from deflector systems will deteriorate as more and more of the UHF band is taken up by licensed services.  That would happen even if I were to take no action.  It is important that Members of this House and the public should understand that broadcasting waveband is a finite resource.  The more of it that is taken up by a user the less space there is for others.  While the situation is more complicated than this, the reality is that it is a limited resource.  As the quality of UVF operations is improved by our national services and as RTE migrates from VHF to UHF, as is envisaged, the amount of space left available for deflector operators will diminish and the quality of service they provide will deteriorate, irrespective of anything we do.</P>
      <P>The advent of digital television is expected by some to solve much of that problem; it will not do so, at least not for a long time.  As the range of services available on digital television is expanded, a different technology is employed from the one now in use.  At the very least, there will have to be a period of overlap during which broadcasting continues on the analogue system while the range of broadcasting is expanded on the digital system, given that not everybody can be expected to buy the new sets, equipment and decoders that would be required to pick up the digital system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Things will get worse before they get better, which is an extra difficulty that will arise irrespective of whether we take the action I propose.  The matter is much more complicated than putting an <Col N="969" /> aerial on the nearest convenient hill to rebroadcast a signal.  I am not a party to any of the current proceedings and have no influence on them.</P>

However, he is telling the House that he will give 18 months or two year licences in eight or nine months' time during which the service will deteriorate.  Does the Minister expect a deflector company, which has waited 12 months for a licence, to accept that the service will deteriorate and that it will be off the air by the end of 1999 because the Minister has made no provision for it to stay on air after that time?

It is not the case that he is seeking to suggest that it would be possible to allow for deflector type systems to be brought back into operation, albeit for a limited period, without there being any prospect of interference with or further subscription from existing cable or MMDS areas?  I am sure he will be aware that it is impossible for any deflector system to confirm the level of subscription, who is taking the signal from whom or how many are taking the signal and that has been the bane of the Department's attempts to monitor it in the first place. Does the Minister not realise that to go ahead with a short-term licensing system such as he proposes will lead to serious legal confrontation with the copyright groups who will be seeking, as they did with the legalised MMDS system, to obtain <Col N="973" /> retrospective payments for copyright?  It was six years in relation to MMDS systems, which subsequently had to pay separate supplementary fees for a further four year roll out period as a result of the legal stand of the copyright groups, such as AGICOA.  They will insist on compliance in that respect.  That being the case, is the Minister seriously asking this House and me, as a former Minister in that Department, to believe, in the absence of the most serious increase in resources within his Department to monitor and police the frequencies and conduct of new licensees in the system,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will he indicate the commercial damage which will result for existing MMDS licensees and cable companies?  Does it not fly in the face of the information society report, under the chairmanship of Ms Jupp, which was being trumpeted here by the Taoiseach earlier this afternoon, by confirming that this is going in the opposite direction as far as the provision of internet services through MMDS type services in the future is concerned?

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> I am pleased to say that the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997, is the 15th of 16 Bills which I have published since I took up office as Minister for Justice.  Most of these Bills are already enacted and many of them have been aimed directly at achieving my objective of strengthening the law on crime and ensuring that it gives the fullest and most effective protection to society.  The Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997, is a further and particularly important step in this process because it will replace offences which lie at the core of the criminal law with provisions more responsive to modern needs, including provision for new offences aimed at new forms of criminal misconduct which have become manifest in recent years.</P>
    <P>The present law on non-fatal offences against the person is contained in the Offences against the Person Act, 1861.  The 1861 Act has been the subject of much criticism over the years.  It has been described as a &ldquo;rag-bag of offences&rdquo;.  In February 1994 the Law Reform Commission submitted a report containing recommendations for the repeal and replacement of those provisions which deal with non-fatal offences against the person.  That report was taken into account in the preparation of this Bill which will repeal the greater part of the 1861 Act and codify in statutory form and in modern language the law dealing with non-fatal offences against the person.  The Law Reform Commission is at present reviewing the law on homicide.  When its report on that subject is received it will be acted upon.</P>
    <P>This Bill restates the law relating to various forms of assault, threats to kill or cause serious harm, poisoning, false imprisonment and abduction of children as well as providing for certain new offences.  As I already indicated and in line with a commitment I gave earlier, the Bill includes provision to deal with syringe offences. It is appropriate that a Bill which seeks to modernise the law relating to the variety of assaults which can be committed against the person should also address the modern phenomenon of the use of syringes as weapons to attack, intimidate or cause serious injury to a person.  I have provided in this Bill for a range of offences to combat such conduct, including offences of possession of a syringe or container of blood with intent to threaten or injure; placing or abandoning a syringe in any place in a manner which is likely to injure any person; injuring a person with a syringe or threatening to do so; and throwing or putting blood on another person or threatening to do so.  The penalties provided will range from five years to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Syringe attacks are not the only examples of modern criminal behaviour tackled in this Bill.  It also creates a new offence of harassment which is aimed at behaviour commonly known as &ldquo;stalking&rdquo;. A five year penalty is possible for this offence and the courts will, in addition, be given power to order a &ldquo;stalker&rdquo; not to communicate with the victim or approach near the residence or place of employment of the victim.  Among the <Col N="976" /> other new offences provided for in the Bill, reference must also be made to the offence of abduction out of the state of a child by a parent in &ldquo;tug of love&rdquo; situation and the new offence of endangerment where a person intentionally or recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an important addition to the legislative reforms to the criminal law which I have already secured and which will be further built on by the remaining proposals in my comprehensive legislative programme, which are either already before this House or are in the course of preparation. I do not propose to mention all of my legislative reforms &mdash; the list is too long &mdash; but I will cite a number of examples.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, was a significant reform because, among other things, it allows for the detention and questioning of drug traffickers for up to seven days and restricts the right to silence in drug trafficking cases Similarly, the recently enacted Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous) Provisions Bill, 1997, will achieve savings in costs and in Garda time through changes in procedure in criminal cases, in addition to introducing other much needed reforms.  I expect that the Criminal Law Bill will also be enacted soon.  Earlier today, amendments to the Bill which were recently passed by the Seanad, were moved in this House.  This Bill will make redundant the outdated concepts of misdemeanours and felonies and set out Garda powers of arrest without a warrant.  The Children Bill, 1996, which provides the basis for a new juvenile justice system is currently before the House.  In recent weeks, I published a Bail Bill which will provide for changes in our bail laws as a consequence of the recent amendment to our Constitution and will otherwise tighten up the bail laws. Legislation which I expect to be in a position to bring before the House shortly includes a Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Bill to deal with drug abuse in dance halls and pubs and at unlicensed outdoor premises, a Bill to enable Ireland to ratify the Europol Convention and a Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill.</P>
    <P>The first substantive section of the Bill before the House is section 2.  This section replaces the common law offences of assault and battery usually referred to as &ldquo;common assault&rdquo; with the new offence of assault which combines, in one offence, the element of inflicting personal violence as in &ldquo;battery&rdquo; and the element of causing another to apprehend the immediate infliction of personal violence in &ldquo;assault&rdquo;.  This offence will cover most minor assaults and I am providing that the penalty on summary conviction will be a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for up to six months or both.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the more serious offence of assault causing harm.  This new offence replaces the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm contained in section 47 of the 1861 Act. I am providing a maximum penalty of five years for this offence, which is the same as the existing <Col N="977" /> penalty.  Under the present law, consent cannot be a defence to a charge of causing actual bodily harm.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that such a rule is no longer appropriate and I have accepted that view.  Since section 3 is framed by reference to an assault and consent is a defence to simple assault, it will also be a defence where actual bodily harm is caused.  We are not talking here of cases of serious harm which are covered by the next section.</P>
    <P>Section 4 creates the offence of causing serious harm, which will replace the offences of wounding or causing or inflicting grievous bodily harm in sections 18 and 20 of the 1861 Act.  Consent will not be a defence to a charge of causing serious harm but section 22 provides that existing common law defences will continue to apply. Accordingly, the common law rules under which bodily harm arising in the course of sports, dangerous exhibitions or medical treatments will apply, where appropriate, to exempt the action from criminal liability.  I have provided that a person convicted of this offence on indictment will be liable to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>In section 5, I am updating section 16 of the 1861 Act which makes it an offence to threaten in writing to kill or murder another.  Instead I am providing in this section for a broader offence which covers threats by any means and extends to threats to cause serious injury as well as to threats to kill.  I am providing for a maximum punishment of ten years imprisonment for this offence.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 7 and 8 create a range of new offences relating to criminal conduct involving syringes.  Section 6 deals with syringe attacks, section 7 deals with possession offences and section 8 deals with abandoning of syringes.  In section 6, I am providing for the following offences: injuring another by piercing the skin of that other with a syringe or threatening to do so with the intention of causing the other person to believe that he or she may become infected with disease; and spraying, pouring or putting onto another blood, or any fluid or substance resembling blood, or threatening to do so with the intention of causing the other person to believe that he or she may become infected with disease. I am providing for a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment for these offences.  In doing so, I am conscious that the offence may result in great suffering for victims who have, for example, been wounded with a syringe and must face a long and agonising wait until he or she knows if he or she has contracted a life threatening disease.</P>
    <P>In the same section I am also providing for what I believe to be the core offence of all those involving syringe attacks, namely, the offence of intentionally injuring another by piercing his or her skin with a syringe which contains, or has on it, contaminated blood or contaminated fluid. Similarly, I am making it an offence to intentionally spray, pour or put onto another contaminated blood.  As both of these offences are on a par with <Col N="978" /> attempted murder, I am providing that this crime will be punishable by life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Since publishing the Bill, I have been further considering my proposals to ensure that all possible aspects of criminal conduct involving syringes and the consequences of such conduct are fully provided for.  In that context, I am considering whether injury to third parties in the course of syringe attacks should also be covered by section 6.  If I consider it necessary, I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to widen the provisions accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with possession offences.  I am providing that a person who has, in any place, a syringe or any blood in a container intended to cause or threaten injury to or intimidate another will commit an offence.  Some concern has been expressed that this provision could make innocent possession of a syringe a criminal offence.  I assure people who carry syringes for legitimate purposes, for example, those who are diabetic, that the provision does not criminalise mere possession &mdash; it criminalises possession with the intention of causing or threatening injury or intimidating another.  The maximum punishment for these offences will be seven years imprisonment. To ensure that the courts will be able to apply a common sense approach to this offence, I am providing that the court or the jury may regard possession of the syringe or container as sufficient evidence of intent in the absence of any adequate explanation by the accused if they think it reasonable to do so in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the gardaí have the necessary powers to enforce this provision, I am providing in the section that they will have powers of stopping, questioning and searching any person suspected of this offence.  They are also being given the power to seize any syringe or container with blood in it.  I am providing that the gardaí may arrest without warrant the suspect who does not co-operate with them and it is being made an offence for a person to fail to so co-operate.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the serious problem caused by people who, perhaps intentionally, recklessly or otherwise, leave or abandon syringes in places so that they injure or are likely to injure, cause a threat to or frighten others.  It is important to remember that this type of behaviour can be engaged in as a type of sport to wound an unsuspecting Garda or prison officer or, indeed, to wound an unsuspecting member of the public who, for example, sits down in a café or cinema or on a bus or train and finds too late that a syringe has been left on the seat.  It is important, therefore, to ensure that the prescribed punishment fits the seriousness of the conduct involved. In this respect I am prepared to further strengthen this section.  For example, it might be appropriate to provide for a higher penalty where a syringe placed or abandoned is contaminated. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the highest penalty would be appropriate where a person intentionally places a contaminated syringe in such a way that it injuries another.  I will bring forward <Col N="979" /> proposals on Committee Stage to make such changes as I consider necessary to further strengthen this section.</P>
    <P>Section 9 updates the law on coercion by replacing section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and increasing the penalty on conviction on indictment to a maximum of five years.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the important new offence of harassment which is aimed at what is commonly called &ldquo;stalking&rdquo;.  We are all aware of high profile cases of stalking but such behaviour is not necessarily peculiar to people in the spotlight. Unfortunately, it can occure in everyday life when a person, usually a woman, becomes the object of the stalker's affection &mdash; perhaps obsession is a better word &mdash; and that person is subjected to sustained harassment and intimidation in a perverted attempt by the stalker to gain the attention or affection of the unfortunate person concerned.  This harassment can have a profoundly detrimental effect on the life of the victim.</P>
    <P>I am providing that a person will be guilty of this offence if he or she, by any means, harasses another by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with him or her.  I am providing a definition of what constitutes harassment, the basic element of which is that the offender intentionally or recklessly interferes with the peace and privacy of another person or causes them alarm, distress or harm and his or her acts are such that a reasonable person would realise that they would have such an effect. I am providing that the offence can merit a maximum penalty of five years and because this behaviour can be such a serious and distressing interference with the person's privacy, I am also empowering the court, in addition to imposing a penalty and even where it decides not to convict, to order the stalker not to communicate in any way with the victim for such period as may be specified by the court or to approach within a specified distance of the victim's residence or place of employment.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for a particular type of harassment associated with demands for payment of a debt.  I am making it an offence, punishable by a fine of £1,500, for a person to subject a debtor to demands which, by reason of their frequency, cause the person or his or her family alarm, distress or humiliation.  Other behaviour which would constitute an offence includes falsely representing that criminal proceedings lie or that the creditor has the official capacity to enforce payment.</P>
    <P>Section 12 replaces the offence of administering poison with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy contained in the 1861 Act with a new offence of poisoning.  The offence can incur a three year sentence.  If the poisoning results in serious harm or death more serious charges would, of course, lie.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> Sections 13 and 14 deal with endangerment offences.  Section 13 provides for a general endangerment offence where a person, either intentionally or recklessly, engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm.  This offence is punishable by a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. While we have many endangerment offences in our law dealing with specific behaviour, such as dangerous driving and dangerous parking, a general endangerment offence of this nature is new. The essence of the offence is the creation of a dangerous situation which may result in death or serious injury.  The actual causing of death or injury is not necessary.  Where death or serious harm results other more serious charges would arise.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the specific offence of endangering traffic.  The offence relates to traffic on land and water and is intended to replace sections 32 and 33 of the 1861 Act which are endangerment offences related to railways.  This section creates an offence where any person intentionally puts a dangerous obstruction in a railway, street, road etc. or interferes with any device for control or direction of traffic or throws anything at any conveyance being aware that injury to the person or damage to property may be caused, or is reckless in that regard.  I propose to make this offence punishable by up to seven years imprisonment.  This conduct can have very serious results.  We have all heard of instances where objects are thrown from motorway bridges at moving traffic with disastrous consequences. One could also envisage the danger that might be caused if somebody knowingly moves a diversion sign on a road and causes traffic to drive into a dangerous area.</P>
    <P>Section 15 gives statutory expression to the common law offence of false imprisonment but also extends the offence to cover cases where the false imprisonment is brought about by deception causing the victim to believe that he or she is under legal compulsion to consent.  As this is obviously a very serious offence it will be punishable, as at present, by up to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 16 creates a new offence of abduction of a child by his or her parent or guardian.  Ireland has already ratified and put into law the provisions of the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction and the Council of Europe convention dealing with the recognition and enforcement of child custody decisions.  However, I propose to go a step further and make it an offence for a parent to abduct a child out of the jurisdiction in defiance of a court order or without the other parent's consent, or to arrange to have a child so abducted.  If the child is not taken out of the country I felt it better not to involve the criminal law, but to leave the matter to be dealt with in the usual custody proceedings.  I propose that this offence should be punishable by up to seven years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>In section 17, I provide for the separate offence of abduction of a child by other persons.  This <Col N="981" /> section replaces sections 55 and 56 of the 1861 Act which deal respectively with abduction of a girl under 16 years and the stealing of a child.  The new abduction offence will be punishable by up to seven years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Sections 18, 19 and 20 provide statutory provisions governing the use of force in public or private defence.  The existing law in this respect is governed by the common law and the Criminal Damage Act, 1991.  Section 18 sets out various purposes for which reasonable force may be lawfully used.  The force used must be reasonable by reference to the circumstances believed by the person to exist.  The purposes include the protection of the person or his or her family or another person from injury, assault or detention caused by a criminal act and to prevent crime or a breach of the peace.  Where force is used to protect against trespass on another person or another person's property the force must be with the authority of that other person.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that a person may, in effecting or assisting in a lawful arrest, use such force as is necessary in the circumstances as he or she believes them to be.  Section 20 defines the meaning of the use of force for the purposes of sections 18 and 19.</P>
    <P>Section 21 amends section 6(2) of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991 so that the test in relation to damaging property is the same as the test set out in section 18, that is, that the conduct of the defendant must be reasonable given the circumstances he or she believed to exist.  Section 22 preserves defences available under the common law or statute law in relation to acts which might otherwise attract criminal sanctions under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that a minor who has attained the age of 16 can give effective consent to surgical, medical or dental treatment which, without consent, would be a trespass.  At present whether a consent by a minor to medical treatment is effective is a question of whether the minor understands the purpose and implications of the treatment.  The purpose of this provision is to bring an element of greater clarity in the case of older minors.</P>
    <P>Section 24 abolishes the common law rule in respect of immunity of teachers from criminal liability in respect of physical chastisement of pupils.  The provision will serve to reinforce the Department of Education's policy on the prohibition of corporal punishment in schools.  Section 25 provides that a doctor's certificate can be accepted in proceedings relating to offences alleging the causing of harm or serious harm as proof of such harm.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that this Bill is a comprehensive proposal and, as I have already said, it deals with a wide range of criminal offences which lie at the core of our criminal law. I present this Bill in keeping with my strong commitment to updating our criminal law.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue said earlier that all the Bills I bring to the House are produced compliments <Col N="982" /> of a photocopier.  I assure the Deputy that there was no photocopying done in my Department in order to write this legislation.  It has been under careful preparation for some considerable time.  As I said upon becoming a Minister, I am willing to listen to any reasonable proposals form the Opposition and to incorporate them into legislation if they will make that legislation better. I have never been afraid or ashamed to do that, in spite of what Deputy O'Donoghue thinks.  It shows maturity in a democracy if a Government can accept amendments from the Opposition.  If Deputy O'Donoghue ever becomes a Minister, I hope he will show more maturity than his party has shown previously in accepting Opposition amendments.  This Government has a record that shows we will take any effective proposals on board, or amend them if they are badly drafted and then accept them.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is surely of some momentous significance that, prior to ending her address on the Bill the Minister decided to get in a pre-emptive blow.  Accustomed as she surely must be to replying to debates when legislation is initiated in the House, she clearly decided that, it being an occasion on which she was introducing legislation, it was of the utmost importance that she should launch a Scud missile attack without any attack having been launched upon her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that the Minister has a guilty conscience which extends to the famed photocopier in the Department of Justice. It sometimes runs out of ink but it has been an integral part of her ministry and a feature of the rainbow coalition Government's paltry fight against crime.</P>
      <P>When I became Opposition spokesperson on Justice, I made it clear that where legislation was required and was introduced by the Minister, we would support it.  In addition, I said where legislation was required but was not introduced, we would introduce it.  We have kept our word and that is illustrated by the fact that, in the lifetime of this Government, we have produced 13 different Bills in the area of criminal law and who is to say we are finished?</P>
      <P>It is true that some of these provisions were accepted but some were not.  Furthermore, some of these legislative provisions were lifted by the Minister.  This much is certain: none of those provisions could have been ignored because each had a considerable amount of merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Political historians who have faithfully recorded the era of the photocopier I referred to will long remember 26 February 1997, the day the Minister for Justice finally blew her cover and her lid.  I introduced the Punishment of Aggravated Robbery Bill, 1997, on 25 February 1997 on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  The following day, reminiscent of the days the Minister for Justice would <Col N="983" /> produce the Law Reform Commission report on bail when I introduced legislation on bail, the Minister, who has followed Fianna Fáil with a bucket of paste and scissors in one hand and a photocopier in the other, miraculously produced the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that all the provisions in this Bill were contained in the Fianna Fáil Bill. However, the crucial legislative provisions, dealing with the serious problem of the use of syringes in the streets of this city, were the central core of that legislation.  The Minister produced the Bill we are debating because she wanted to bury the Fianna Fáil legislation quickly in a welter of confusion which emanates only from herself.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not introduce the legislation which we are discussing before then because she needed first to be informed by Fianna Fáil's Bill. Why else would the Minister await the publication and the moving of the Fianna Fáil legislation prior to producing her own legislation less than 24 hours later?  It did the legislative process little credit and reflected poorly on a Government so bereft of ideology, philosophy and original ideas that it has been feeding like a parasite on Fianna Fáil proposals in the criminal justice area since assuming office.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy against the Bill?  He has not mentioned it yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question left for those cynical enough to care about the origin of the Minister's legislation is to ask whether it is the same or merely similar to legislation previously published by Fianna Fáil.  Invariably, the answer to that question depends on whether there is a sufficiency of ink in the Minister's photocopier when she commences photocopying our proposals and legislative provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister, we must allow that the Bill does differ in some material respects from Fianna Fáil's Punishment of Aggravated Robbery Bill, 1997.  Instead of copying only the Fianna Fáil legislation, the Minister also copied the common law of the land and put that in statutory form. When she comes to copy Fianna Fáil's original proposals, the ink again begins to run dry and some of the most important provisions dealing with punishment for syringe offences are omitted from the Minister's Bill.  They are not omitted because it is in the public interest to do so but to save the face of a Minister whose blushes have become a permanent feature of the rainbow coalition, a Minister who is so breathless and bewildered from trying to stay with the pace that she increasingly forgets to order sufficient ink for her photocopier.  In so far as there is new criminal law in the Bill, it is mainly inadequately copied from the Punishment of Aggravated Robbery Bill, 1997.  The mistress of the microwave has served up another hot legislative dish, less some <Col N="984" /> of the ingredients and without a murmur of compliment or apology to the chef.</P>
    <P>We introduced the Punishment of Aggravated Robbery Bill, 1997 because citizens have the right to walk the streets, conduct business and live their lives without violence or the threat of violence. We have repeated our belief that in the hierarchy of constitutional rights the right to live without fear of attack is superior.  It is the duty of a sovereign Government to protect the lives and property of its citizens.  That singular obligation is superior in the hierarchy of obligations.  The blurred recognition of that fundamental fact is something for which the rainbow coalition Government must be castigated.  The right of the individual to live without fear of attack is superior to the right to liberty of persons conducting such attacks.  It is superior to the rights of persons who attempt such attacks and to the right to liberty of persons who have armed themselves with the intention of making such attacks.</P>
    <P>The number of robberies committed by persons wielding offensive weapons of death, particularly syringes, has increased dramatically in recent times.  The Minister for Justice, who proclaims that crime is decreasing, was obliged to admit to the Dáil on 27 February 1997 that the number of indictable offences in which a syringe or needle was used was 353 in 1994.  That number increased to 514 in 1995 and to 1,252 in 1996.  Presumably, if double that number of criminals were attacking people with feathers, the Minister would respond by saying crime figures were increasing.</P>
    <P>People walking the streets, working in shops, driving taxis and, in short, going about their everyday lives live in terror of infection, injury or even death from syringe wielding thugs.  Fianna Fáil sought to deal with this problem in a measured and responsible manner through the Punishment of Aggravated Robbery Bill, 1997.  It created a new offence of aggravated robbery and, in doing so, merely followed the general scheme of legislation in the Larceny Act, 1916 and in subsequent legislation.  We recognised the offence of robbery could have an aggravated form and we specified what it was.  The Minister for Justice sought to pick holes in that legislation at every opportunity.  It was not her first, second or third time to do so.  She did not act in the interest of the legislative process but, in as blatant an attempt as has ever been seen, to cover up her inadequacies and inefficiencies.</P>
    <P>The legislation, which I introduced, challenged the House to introduce minimum sentences for those involved in syringe offences.  It provided for a minimum period of five years imprisonment for a first offence, a minimum period of seven years imprisonment in respect of a second offence and a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment in respect of a third or subsequent offence.  I make no apology for that proposal.  The people of Ireland are entitled to express their abhorrence of this type of crime by directing courts in unambiguous terms with regard to the minimum sentence <Col N="985" /> they should impose for serious offences involving the use of syringes.  There is no constitutional prohibition to minimum sentences.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Bill before the House that there is insufficient political will in the Government to enact the legislation we are entitled to enact and which the people want us to enact.  As there is no academic or legislative reason why syringe robberies should not be punished by minimum sentences, citizens are entitled to ask why the Government refuses to do so.  Who in the Labour Party and Democratic Left told the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach they would not agree to it?  Will they come in from the darkened corners and tell us who they are?  Will they tell us what their objectives are?  They will not.</P>
    <P>Nobody need be surprised by what has happened. This is the Minister for Justice and Government which rejected Fianna Fáil's proposal for a minimum ten year sentence for those found in possession of illegal drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more.  They did this irrespective of statistics which show that despite the existence of discretion to impose a sentence of up to life imprisonment for drug pushing, the average sentence handed down by the courts for this offence in 1993, the last year for which official figures are available, was a derisory two years.</P>
    <P>The legislation before the House, in dealing with syringe attacks, provides that a person can be fined up to a maximum amount or, depending on the seriousness of the offence, jailed for a term not exceeding ten years or up to imprisonment for life.  Nowhere in the Bill is it stated that the court must, as a statutory imperative, impose a minimum sentence.  That is the crucial difference between the legislation produced by Fianna Fáil, in so far as it relates to syringe offences, and the legislation before the House today.  What reason does the Government have for believing the Judiciary will feel less constrained by precedent when imposing sentences under this legislation? The answer is none.  The rainbow coalition did not have the political courage or cohesion to make the hard decision in the interests of the people.  The so-called libertarian wings of the Labour Party and Democratic Left must have their merry way irrespective of the fundamental flaws in their arguments or the will of the vast majority of law abiding citizens.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann notes the sharp decline in the incomes of farm families resulting from the collapse of commodity prices including cattle, beef and milk prices paid to farmers; calls upon the Government to cease its hitherto unsympathetic <Col N="986" /> approach to our farming industry; further calls on the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to pursue at a political level their responsibilities in relation to important agricultural issues, including export refunds and the reopening of lost third country markets; and also calls on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to fulfil his promise of 4th February to farmers to secure matching national compensation for revaluations of the green pound.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The relatively straightforward position is that Ireland is a member state of the EU and is heavily dependent on the beef and dairy industries.  The special position of the beef industry is recognised in several European Protocols and nine out of ten bullocks raised in Ireland must be exported.  Destinations for exports include European countries and third country markets and there must be a balance between the live trade and finished products.  To this end, Bord Bia, the Department of Agriculture and the Government exist to support and assist the beef industry.  Given its special position, there have always been technical and administrative supports in addition to the necessary political support.</P>
      <P>The industry is experiencing a severe crisis at present but, regrettably, political support and sympathy does not exist when it is most needed. The composition of the Government gives a clue to the reason for that position.  Listening to the address of the Leader of the Labour Party in Limerick last Saturday night, farming families must have felt they had been airbrushed from history. The Tánaiste did not mention rural Ireland or rural issues never mind the crisis in farming. Apparently, the Labour Party is entirely oblivious to it.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Tánaiste has done nothing to assist our largest industry maintain its vital market share of foreign markets. He is more concerned with perpetuating his grudge match with the beef industry than assisting farm families.  The Labour Party has betrayed the mandate given to its rural Deputies. However, the arrogance and indifference of the Labour Party is nothing compared to the outright hostility of Democratic Left.  Debates in the House in the last year on matters relating to agriculture, all of which were instigated by Fianna Fáil, have been characterised by a vitriolic abuse of farmers and the farming industry by Democratic Left Deputies.  Apparently, farmers are not part of the working class which Democratic Left purports to represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democratic Left Leader, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, is so inured in his prejudice that he said &ldquo;the farmers are rolling in it&rdquo; in response to a question about <Col N="987" /> the difficulties of farm families on a recent edition of the RTE &ldquo;Farrell&rdquo; programme.  Farmers are the victims of the political bigotry and bias of the left wing parties in the rainbow coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The hostile bias of the Labour Party and Democratic Left is aided and abetted by Fine Gael.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry have repeatedly rolled over rather than confront the hostility of their Government colleagues towards farmers.  For example, the Taoiseach recently said in relation to rural group water schemes that Fine Gael had no policies.  As a result, farmers and rural Ireland must depend on the Labour Party and Democratic Left.  Fine Gael is in office but not in power. Rural constituencies cannot look to this Government for a rescue scheme in the current crisis.</P>
    <P>The litany of broken promises by the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to farmers can only be explained by the political cowardice of Fine Gael.  No other sector of society has been so let down or ignored by Government.  The collapse in farm prices, the closure of foreign markets, the repeated cuts in export refunds and the failure to deliver on the promise of matching a compensation for green £ revaluations add up to a litany of lost opportunities and broken promises.</P>
    <P>The recent editorial on 5 April last in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> sums up the position.  It stated that the collapse in beef prices which followed the previous week's revaluation and cut in export refunds was the clearest signal yet that we have lost our way in our day to day dealings with Brussels and its critical management of the beef market. The editorial continued that, ultimately, the blame for this debacle must end up on the desk of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates.  It said it will take more than recycled compensation announcements to quell farmers' anger and sense of betrayal at this time.</P>
    <P>This is a sad position for farmers and it must be galling for the farming community to hear further announcements of the same tranches of payments. Non farming people are under the impression that farmers get a lucky bag at the end of each week.  Basking in good news is not what is required in this case.  The Minister has been adept at that because he was bequeathed a good position by the previous Fianna Fáil Government. The Minister has run from photo opportunity to photo opportunity and neglected the real work which needs to be done in Brussels, Cairo, Tripoli, Tehran and Moscow.  This aspect has been omitted from the agenda.  The Minister is unable to pull his punch at Cabinet and in Brussels. Regrettably, farmers, the industry, co-operatives and PLCs are the losers.</P>
    <P>Farmers want to know when the Minister will fulfil his promise of matching national compensation for green £ revaluations.  On 20 March and 14 April this year, the IFA said in a statement that it would hold the Minister to the specific <Col N="988" /> commitment he gave to livestock farmers to deliver Exchequer funding to match EU money on revaluation compensation made on 4 February in the Davenport Hotel in Dublin.  The sooner this Administration realises that farmers and their families are the backbone of this country the better.  This has been the case throughout history. If they are removed, the entire structure of rural Ireland falls apart.  Unlike most countries in Europe, farmers are central to the stability and future of the economy.  They have contributed in a major way to the development of Ireland's agri-business. They have never been slow to reinvest generously in farm buildings, equipment and machinery and upgrading systems.  Everybody has benefited as a result.</P>
    <P>Approximately 140,000 or 13 per cent of the workforce depend on agriculture.  In the next few weeks when members of the Government parties call on them seeking their support they will ask &ldquo;when we were down on our knees, what did the Government do for us?  Did Ministers have their photograph taken or go to Brussels?  When did they last go to Cairo or Tehran to seek to have markets for our livestock reopened?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Farmers and their families maintain a key presence in many industries.  Where would the tourism industry be without farm guesthouses which provide good food for tourists who marvel at our beautiful landscape and the good work being done?  If farmers trying to eke out a living and pass on their farms to their sons or daughters cannot look to the Government for support in a time of crisis and difficulty, morale is sapped.  It is currently at an all time low.  No matter what way one looks at the figures, farmers and their families are central to our hopes for prosperity.  Under the left wing dominated rainbow coalition Government, however, there is no hope.  The agricultural Celtic Tiger which Fianna Fáil fed and nurtured is becoming anorexic and will soon fade away.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is conscious of the importance of farmers and their families to the economy.  It has always been the party of the farm family and the village and small town entrepreneur.  All of the schemes and programmes that matter to farmers, be they education schemes, the operational programme for rural development, the Leader programme and so on, have been put in palce by Fianna Fáil which has its roots in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has catered for the needs of the rural workforce.  Two years ago the future of farmers and their families was assured.  There was a thriving live exports market, adequate marketing support and on-farm investment schemes to ensure farmers could continue to compete with their competitors in Europe and elsewhere.  If the Government does not assist farmers, we will move inexorably towards world prices in the next GATT Round.  All on-farm investment schemes have been abolished.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1993, under Fianna Fáil, farm incomes were increasing by 18 per cent to 19 per cent per annum.  Today, they are dropping rapidly and there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  This <Col N="989" /> month farmers hoped that the slaughter premium would be retained at its existing level but there was no give because the Labour Party and Democratic Left members of the Government had no interest in the matter.  GATT, the Americans and the Iranians among others were blamed for the loss of high morale in the industry which dropped to a state of depression and, in some cases, destitution but the real reason is that there has been no commitment to supporting an industry in need of assistance.  More than all other occupations, farming is cyclical in nature.  We owe it to the farming community to support the industry in times of crisis.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil negotiated the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which provided for the most far-reaching initiatives for farmers.  These included the ten month and 22 month beef premiums under which cattle farmers obtained an extra £240 per head.  Fianna Fáil negotiated the extensification and deseasonalisation premiums as well as the ewe premium for sheep farmers. While this has not been dismantled, it has been torn apart and reduced by £6.50 this year.  Hill farmers need it more than most.</P>
    <P>Farmers, big and small, benefited from the unprecedented £700 million package negotiated by Fianna Fáil under the accompanying measures.  It included the farm retirement and REP schemes.  To develop a modern food industry, Fianna Fáil negotiated the operational programme for the food industry worth £641 million. To protect the future of cereal growers, it negotiated the area aid scheme.</P>
    <P>On leaving the Department at the end of 1994, I was confident that the industry would be able to withstand a downturn which is inevitable with a left wing dominated Government.  Unfortunately I was wrong.  Because of mismanagement, for which only the rainbow coalition Government can be held accountable, what happened was beyond the estimation of the worst case scenario.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that the farm prices crisis coincided with the term of office of the left wing dominated rainbow coalition Government.  Farm incomes are under serious threat.  Many farmers will leave the countryside.  It is estimated that 3 per cent have left.  Beef farmers, beef finishers especially, have been let down badly.  There is no hope and the opportunity was not taken to ensure the generous package negotiated in Brussels filtered through to them.</P>
    <P>The single most important thing the Minister can do is to seek to have live export markets reopened.  This requires a political initiative. There is a need to put in place an assurance and certification programme to ensure there are no traces of residues in the cattle we export.  Consumers should be confident that our beef is safe to eat.  We know there is a minuscule difficulty in relation to BSE, the number of cases is in single figures.  Approximately 99.9 per cent of the cattle population is disease free.  Why, therefore, has a certification programme not been put in place? Why has the famous assurance scheme, about <Col N="990" /> which we heard so much, not been put in place? There is no point in the Minister flailing around wildly like a failed manager and blaming anyone who comes to mind.  A live trade will bring its own competition and bring the factories to heel quickly.  Farmers know that even the most rapid computer system in the world will not return prices at marts to their previous levels in the same way as the reopening of the live trade market.</P>
    <P>I estimate that approximately 40,000 of the 100,000 beef farmers &mdash; I again mention this figure as it will be very important in the coming weeks &mdash; have no future, while the remainder will have their incomes severely dented.  If the Minister does nothing else in the coming weeks he should visit the capital cities of those third countries and reopen markets for our live cattle trade.</P>
    <P>Other sectors of farming are also suffering. Incomes in the dairy industry, which is the prize sector of the agriculture industry, are down by 25 per cent, while milk has fallen to less than £1 per gallon.  These figures are going in the wrong direction.  Grain farmers are also suffering and are not looking to a bountiful harvest this year. Morale is so low that many parents find it difficult to get their children to take over their farms from them.  If this was not bad enough, there is also a question mark over the payment of installation aid to young farmers and it is possible that this will be diluted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been stated many times in relation to cattle prices and the EU market that there was no BSE or animal disease problem but there was a ferry transport problem.  That problem was made worse by the Minister who went as far as introducing a weight limitation on the top deck.  However, he abandoned that lunatic measure two days later.  Why would the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry try to make matters more difficult during an acute crisis?  I would like someone to explain the reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As farmers know, the Minister repeatedly talked down cattle prices last autumn and frightened farmers into selling cattle at a loss a month after the statement in the House of Commons on 20 March which caused ripples throughout Europe and the world.  That statement catapulted the Minister into making a statement that a £20 million campaign to promote Irish beef would be needed in the months ahead because the BSE crisis had caused so much difficulty for our marketers. During the main evening news on RTÉ on 19 April 1996 the Minister told the nation: &ldquo;We <Col N="991" /> are talking about looking to the Luxembourg Council for an EU fund, perhaps spending up to £20 million in the most intensive promotion ever for Irish beef.&rdquo;  Where lies that most intensive promotion ever for Irish beef?  It has not yet seen the light of day and farmers are still waiting for it.</P>
    <P>The most serious problems facing the agriculture industry are being put on the long finger. Partnership 2000 contains some nice sentiments but these are merely aspirational and only give recognition to the importance of agriculture and the food industry to the national economy.  It states that the Government will seek to ensure that any reductions in agricultural prices are compensated for through direct income support payments. Where are those compensatory payments? What use is Partnership 2000 to the farming community? Partnership 2000 also states that the Minister proposes to set up a food safety board. Apart from throwing it at the industry, this board does not have a legislative base, a structure or staff.  In other words, it has damn all and is like an aeroplane without an engine &mdash; it makes a hell of a splash and is a disaster.  Partnership 2000 makes 63 promises to the agriculture, food and forestry industries.  During the coming weeks we will seek to ensure that those promises are fulfilled and that there is a serious commitment to the industries so that those involved will benefit.</P>
    <P>Inadequate food control systems are putting the health of consumers at risk.  This is a dereliction of duty, to say the least.  We do not have the necessary controls or a food board, while there is an EHO strike and five counties do not have a full-time veterinary officer.  We need to put controls in place if we are to give a credible assurance to farmers that their products will be acceptable to consumers at home and abroad, are safe to eat and will make a remunerative price.  We need a transparent food tracing system and a cattle tracking system.</P>
    <P>There have been further impositions on the farming community in regard to, for example, the disposal of specified risk material.  There is a big contrast between the disposal of this material in the northern part of the country and in the south where farmers are billed.  During his two years in office the Minister has presided over a catalogue of crises which range over cattle and milk prices, live cattle exports, grain, third country markets, agricultural and horticultural grants, the green pound revaluation, a cut in export refunds etc. On return to Government Fianna Fáil will immediately embark on an action programme which will confront the issues I have highlighted. Our first step will be to embark on a tour of the capital cities of third countries in order to reopen beef and live cattle markets so that farmers, their families and the workforce dependent on a thriving agriculture industry can return to prosperity. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me no great pleasure to contribute to this debate on yet another crisis in agriculture.  I support the motion tabled by my party's spokesperson on Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh.  The Fianna Fáil Party accords the greatest priority to this debate and to listening to the views of the Minister, his ministerial colleagues and Government backbenchers. Even though we are within days of the calling of a general election and there is a serious crisis in agriculture, it is noticeable that not one member of the Labour Party has thought it worthwhile to come into the House to listen to this debate.  I did not expect members of Democratic Left to be present but I thought Deputies who represent rural constituencies would be familiar with what is happening in the industry.</P>
      <P>Farming is a tough, uncompromising business. Nobody expects it will be rosy every day.  Twenty years ago, when Fine Gael and Labour were in power, calves were selling at 50p and cattle prices went through the floor, but the Government withstood that crisis which was followed in the early 1980s by rampant inflation, raging interest rates and land sales to settle bank debts.  A series of other problems arose also as the national debt was driven from £12 billion to £24 billion, again under Fine Gael and Labour.  The Government managed to stagger through that crisis also but now, after a brief respite during which more confidence was generated than had been for some time, the change has come in a dramatic way. Deputy Walsh touched on all the sectors that have been hit but I want to confine my remarks primarily to the beef sector.</P>
      <P>There are 100,000 farmers involved in the beef sector, and I know the importance of the export live trade to those farmers, but how important will it be in the autumn of each year when farmers buy stores from the marts to fatten and finish in the winter if they cannot export them?  It will not make much difference what the Minister tries to do, even on the live export trade, because he will have presided over a crisis involving a huge number of people.  Farmers can withstand a certain amount of pressure, historically they have done that.  It has been said that one year out of ten farmers can manage a fairly disastrous situation, but they cannot manage two in a row.  That is what is happening in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not need a cosmetic exercise carried out for the election.  The Minister knows he must do some rebalancing, find the funds for the compensatory payments and work on getting the export markets reopened.  There is little point in the Minister telling the factories there is a cartel in operation.  Many people have been in farming for a long time and they know there will always be a cartel.  The Minister will not introduce any law or regulation to change that unless there is competition.  Talk about cartels is insignificant. We saw what happened last autumn and what is happening now.  If the Minister does not open up those arrangements he can talk for as long as he <Col N="993" /> likes about what might be done in regard to the processors, factories and cartels.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil wants to emphasise to the Minister, in as strong a way as possible, the seriousness of this problem.  We must forget about the myth that is thrown out occasionally by different groups and media commentators about how well farmers are doing.  If people were leaving the medical and nursing professions, Bord Telecom or the Civil Service at the rate farmers are leaving farming, there would be an outcry.  There is only one place people are leaving at a faster rate in proportional terms, and that is Dáil Éireann.  If farmers are as prosperous as everybody says they are, why are so many of them and their wives not staying in the business?  It is an idle exercise talking about rural development, county enterprise systems, Leader programmes and grants to watch butterflies if the farming stock and farm enterprises are not viable.</P>
    <P>Some of us have been in politics for a long time.  I am not necessarily interested in who does what, but we are facing a monumental disaster which needs immediate treatment.  On the basis of what is happening here this evening it appears that the Minister is a lonely figure in what the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, calls a left of centre Government.  We are talking about the people who have been left out by the left of centre Government.</P>

      <P>At the outset I wish to thank my colleague, Deputy Walsh, for allowing me and Deputy Smith contribute to this debate.  I have noticed that debates in this House on agriculture, be it on the beef or dairy sectors or the BSE crisis, have been initiated by the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition.  Tonight's debate is another example of that with our spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Joe Walsh, bringing this matter to the fore in the Dáil.  This is the place where issues of great importance should be discussed and where the views of our constituents should be aired.  Unfortunately, it is the Opposition which has used its time to express those particular views.  We are happy to do that but it points the finger at the Government and its cavalier attitude to these issues when it does not deem fit to initiate debates on how to tackle the serious problems currently facing agriculture.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate we do not have any Labour or Democratic Left Members in the House to listen to this debate.  That is a more eloquent statement than anyone in this Chamber could make.</P>

      <P>There was no need, the Minister's expression said it all.  A number of IFA meetings have been held throughout the country, and an important one was held in my constituency of County Clare last night to discuss the beef crisis.  We are in the middle of a major crisis, yet we are told our economy is prospering and there is much talk of the famous &ldquo;Emerald Tiger&rdquo;. That prosperity is not evident, however, in the agricultural community.  As Deputies Walsh and Smith pointed out, the fall in farm incomes in the beef sector could be up to 10 per cent this year, and incomes in the dairy sector have dropped 5 per cent.  If that occurred in any other sector there would be an outcry, and rightly so.  To date, farmers have been extremely patient but they cannot afford to be as patient as they have been, putting forward their views in an articulated and vociferous way.</P>
      <P>There has been no provision for green pound revaluation.  We have heard a great deal about what the EU can do on this and we have had promises from the Minister with regard to national Exchequer compensation.  Those promises were made on 4 February but he has not delivered on them.  We appreciate the importance of immediate political and diplomatic movement with regard to our markets.  This takes political guts and courage.  I hope, even at this late stage, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will be backed by his Government in his efforts to reopen those markets.  As to the argument about reopening the cattle markets in north Africa making difficulties for the GATT regime, our spokesperson, Deputy Walsh, has pointed out on a number of occasions that we can take this on quite comfortably within the GATT regime.  This should be done, and it should be done immediately.</P>

    <P>Before dealing with some of the substantive and detailed issues in this debate I will make a few initial observations, as I note that a number of farmers are present and, what with water and television deflectors, I have not had the opportunity to speak publicly on these issues.  I am glad to have the opportunity to do so now.</P>

      <P>Much of what Deputy Joe Walsh said was true but, as a Deputy who is a former Minister and Minister of State who spent seven consecutive years in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, his memory is selective. It was not I who negotiated the GATT quota of 60,000 tonnes a year, about which I will speak at some length and which farmers need to understand. It was not I who negotiated the 15 per cent reduction in the intervention price for beef.  It was not I who negotiated the safety net for Irish beef which is now 72p a pound.  These were all part of the CAP reforms Deputy Walsh was so willing to boast about in the context of increased premia &mdash; the basis of the MacSharry reforms was to move from product support to direct income aid. However, in those good times in 1994-5 when we were not putting beef into intervention, behind the scenes the supports were being systematically dismantled so that when they were needed post-BSE in the implementation of GATT, I was left to deal with a situation where Council regulations have been put in place and can be amended only by Council which, as the Deputy knows, requires a qualified majority of 58 votes.  It is fanciful to suggest the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, the Tánaiste and members of the present Government caused the problems in the beef sector.  I am happy to compare the Estimates of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in 1996-7, the tax concessions on capital acquisitions tax, on capital depreciation and capital allowances, decisions of this Government and supports of one kind or another for the rendering industry and so on with the achievements of any of my predecessors.  Any time I have had a problem this Government, and particularly the Taoiseach, has been wholly supportive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very rich that the Deputy should speak in mellifluous tones about the suspension of schemes.  He knows all the Structural Funds from which the FIP, CFP and dairy hygiene schemes are funded were negotiated by him.  I have brought forward moneys from 1998 and 1999 into 1996 and 1997, but the truth is that there was a woeful under provision simply because of the shrinking billions subsequent to the Edinburgh summit &mdash; we all remember the <i>fourchette</i> cast <Col N="996" /> upon by Deputy Ahern and others in relation to those billions that disappeared.  That is the reason there is no CFP scheme today.  I assure the House that all relevant schemes have been brought forward so that farmers can be paid at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Speaking to farmers as much as to the House, I regret that there is no quick-fix solution as far as the beef sector is concerned, regardless of who is Minister or what Government is in office.  One can argue about the cut in export refunds of 17.5 per cent, but it is beyond my control that pre-fixations for beef last week were 20,000 tonnes and today were 30,000 tonnes so that, as we speak, refunds have been suspended again. Despite having spoken on three occasions in recent days to Commissioner Fishcler, he and I are prisoners of GATT; we have to manage something like 25 per cent of the remainder of the GATT year to 1 July with about 15 per cent of the licences to give out.  This means if we do not adjust the refunds there will be no refunds to disburse in late May and June.  The reason for that is that beef consumption in Europe post-BSE is down by a minimum of 8 per cent.  If the beef cannot be sold in Europe it must be sold outside Europe.  We sell it outside Europe with a subsidy, and if that subsidy has limits on it in volume and value terms, GATT licences must be shared out. That is what I want to address tonight, because farmers need to understand the root cause of the present difficulties.  People will remember that before the BSE crisis we had our first taste of cuts in refunds in December 1995, the first year of GATT.  In years to come we will not have access to intervention as we now have, and the GATT quota will be tighter in 1998 than it was in 1997, and tighter in 1999 than it will be in 1998.</P>
    <P>These problems will not simply evaporate because Deputies De Rossa and Spring are in or out of Government.  That is a facile analysis.  The Deputy referred to an editorial in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal,</i> which I read, which implied that all these problems can be deposited at my door.  That is an insult to farmers' intelligence; these problems run far deeper than any allegation that people have lost their way in Brussels.  This is part of the wider liberalisation of world agriculture which started seven or eight years ago, is well under way and will not go away for the next 15 years.</P>
    <P>I proposed my amendment to the motion because it more accurately reflects the reality of the Government's efforts to deal with the current difficulties facing farmers.  There is no argument from me regarding the income difficulties of the beef sector.  I fully accept this is the most expensive time of year to produce beef and that the prevailing price of 80-82 pence per pound is not viable.  There is no argument form me on the severity of the difficulties.  However, the revaluation of the Irish green pound of 8 per cent to 8.5 per cent cumulatively again has not been directly in the Government's control because sterling has been revalued and we have been dragged <Col N="997" /> upwards.  When I became Minister the problem was that the Irish pound was £1.04 against sterling. Many Border Deputies cry salt tears now that the Irish pound is at 95p, and there is not a word about our competitiveness on Northern Ireland and British markets which has been a plus of the currency situation.  The revaluation has been much stronger and yet beef prices have not dropped as much in the United Kingdom as they have here, and this is the question I have put to the meat factories.</P>
    <P>There has been a stream of intensive activity. Everybody knows since the House of Commons' activity on 20 March that my Department has been on red alert working continuously through the night and through the weekend to do everything in our power to assist farmers in every way. I will list some of the solid achievements over that period.  We need no advice on the importance of the potential of the agriculture industry.  The link between BSE in cattle and CJD in humans precipitated an unprecedented drop in beef consumption throughout Europe.  As a result of the increased resources which I allocated to An Bord Bia, beef consumption is highest in Ireland.  The promotional campaign by An Bord Bia, involving in the order of £1 million, has worked.  There has been a more intensive focus on beef than ever before in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties, Irish beef exports to international markets in 1996 increased by 40 per cent over the previous year. That is in sharp contrast to the position when our friends on the other side of the House were in power, when nine out of every ten bullocks went into intervention.  We are all aware of the associated problems of malpractice that existed at that time, when markets in third countries closed not for three weeks or three months but for three years in many cases.  Before the BSE crisis there was an annual drop in beef consumption in the European Union of 1.5 per cent per year, with a drop of almost 10 per cent in the previous decade.</P>
    <P>In 1993 Europe exported 1.3 million tonnes of beef and that figure will be reduced to 800,000 tonnes, with no export subsidy payable for half a million tonnes, the exact amount we export, at the lowest price in the European Union.  That it is the nub of the present problem.  Taking into account the drop in consumption, which varies between 8 per cent and 12 per cent throughout the European Union, one can understand the pressures that exist because of the GATT limitation, and those difficulties will remain for some time.</P>
    <P>While Fianna Fáil has been very vocal about what I should do in regard to compensation, I have not heard that party say that Fianna Fáil in office will pay the matching compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent times I put to the Commission a counter strategy to manage the GATT quota.  I suggested that, as with the intervention tenders, a co-efficient reduction would be applied rather than cut the value of refunds.  It must be borne in mind that, on two occasions, I succeeded in persuading the Commission not to reduce export refunds only to find the following week that 30,000 tonnes or 40,000 tonnes were prefixed within a matter of hours and the Commission had no choice but to cut refunds &mdash; the one million tonnes are divided into a weekly quota of about 20,000 tonnes and that figure cannot be overstepped.</P>
      <P>I put further proposals to Commissioner Fischler on refunds, for example, relating to the sex of the animal &mdash; we are particularly dependent on steers &mdash; and suggested that refunds be applied in a way that would not affect markets such as Russia and Egypt on which we are particularly dependent.  There is a disproportionate effect on the prevailing price here because three-quarters of our steers go to such third countries. I do not agree with the Commission's view that it has adopted the best strategy to maintain prices and, with my colleagues, I will continue to press this issue.</P>
      <P>During our Presidency, the first steps were taken to deal with this matter.  Deputy Joe Walsh asked where is the light at the end of the tunnel. I took more personal abuse on this matter than anybody else in the European Union because I said that the only way we could restore balance between production and the drop in consumption was to slaughter calves.  I was vilified when I said that the Commission's proposals did not go far enough.  In October I persevered in Luxembourg to get that measure through, and that is the light at the end of the tunnel.  Under the calf slaughter premium and the early marketing premium, we are effectively cutting beef production by 350,000 tonnes.  Meat factories strongly opposed this measure because they knew it would prevent cattle and beef prices from plummeting in Europe.  I single-handedly pursued this issue despite having no support for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have slaughtered about 13,000 calves while the UK and France have slaughtered 540,000 and 180,000 calves respectively, bearing in mind that France only started that scheme in October.  That will restore balance to the market.  There is hope as we approach 1998 in that there is a reasonable prospect that we will slaughter one million calves, the number in excess of requirements.  It can be expected that beef production will fall by almost 600,000 tonnes per annum and that will be the <Col N="999" /> first step in rebalancing the market as well as meeting GATT requirements.</P>
    <P>Were it not for my efforts and the concession I received from Commissioner Fischler, the weight limit of 360 kgs for intervention would be much lower and the O4 category would not be eligible for intervention.  In addition, DSP would not be payable.  Some people have suggested adjusting the DSP, but that would require an amendment to the Council regulation.  I succeeded in reducing the DSP eligibility trigger from 40 per cent to 35 per cent of seasonal slaughterings, North and South.  Were it not for my negotiations, there would be no DSP for winter fatteners and no higher extensification premium for 66,000 farmers who are seeking an extra £15 million this year.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to recycled announcements, but if I do not produce the money I am criticised for doing nothing and if I produce the money I am accused of recycling old announcements.  Some £122 million of European funds will be brought forward and the first payments to beef farmers will be made from 12 May this year.  I hope that, within four to five weeks, the vast majority of people will receive top-up payments on their suckler cow and beef premiums.</P>
    <P>On 4 February in the Davenport Hotel &mdash; I always tell farmers the position as it is, whether the news is good or bad &mdash; I said that I was very anxious to pursue, particularly for beef farmers, the question of matching national compensation.  At no stage did I say that the Government had agreed to it.  I was at pains to say that no provision has been made in the Estimates for that matter because, at the time of the budget, there was no revaluation. I wish to put it on the record again that the Government has not agreed to provide matching funds.  I am, however, involved, as are my colleagues &mdash; I received wonderful support from the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party and from our Labour colleagues on this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What would have happened if I had rushed to pay out compensation on 5 February and the big drop in cattle prices took effect on 1 April?  I want to target those in greatest need and I am listening to my colleagues to find out who has been most affected by the drop in prices.</P>

I am the first Minister of any member state to pay out the money within three months of the revaluation.  The Government has not concluded its deliberations on the question of matching money.  While Fianna Fáil tends to blow hot and cold in this area and place demands on me, farmers can rest assured the Government is monitoring the position carefully and will do everything possible to provide the appropriate resources.</P>

      <P>I have been to Tripoli, to Russia and to a number of other states within the Union and have attended all the major beef promotions carried out by An Bord Bia.  Notwithstanding the constraints imposed on us by the Presidency of the European Union, we had a higher ministerial input than any other member state at those promotions. Irrespective of whether there is an election, I will be in Cairo between 6 and 9 May.  For the first time the Irish Government will be represented at the International Food and Trade Fair in Cairo and I will be in regular touch with Dr. Wally.  Beneath the surface we ran into serious difficulties with the export certification of beef to Egypt in that it precluded cuts of beef close to the spinal cord from entering its market. Intensive diplomatic and technical discussions concluded only in the last fortnight and in the first half of this year we will ship more beef to Egypt than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We will ship more beef to Egypt than to Russia during that period.  That is an indication of our success in that market.  However, <Col N="1001" /> I agree with Deputy Walsh that live exports are essential and the spring of 1997 is proof of the need for competition between live exports and the meat trade.  On the best advice available to me, there is no question of the live trade being reopened before May.  I accept the advice of our Ambassador in Cairo, An Bord Bia and my officials who have had the experience of dealing with a three year ban from the Egyptian market on another occasion.  Despite all the flak I took last October in regard to the Russian deal, we would not be selling beef to that market today if we did not sign the Protocol with our opposite number there.  We maintained the orderly disposal of beef.  Unlike Fianna Fáil, we did not throw a quarter of a million tonnes of beef into intervention.  Massive stockpiles in intervention solve only current problems.  Those stockpiles have to be released on the market at some time in the future and the Egyptians or the Iranians could decide to buy cheap intervention beef rather than Irish beef.  That is why I put such an effort into maintaining these markets.  I have always been aware of the long-term implications of putting beef into intervention.</P>
      <P>Egypt and Libya are the only countries that have accepted large numbers of live animals.  I visited Tripoli last year and, following a visit here, a technical delegation &mdash; which was impressed by our controls &mdash; is in the process of making recommendations.  I am following this up by making representations to my opposite number in Libya.  I was the first European Cabinet Minister to visit Libya since the Lockerbie air crash and I informed them of the priority the Irish Government attaches to beef.  I hope they will soon start to accept our beef and we can then consider the question of live exports.</P>
      <P>A technical delegation will shortly pay another visit to Iran.  I could have signed a deal with the Iranians but it would have involved even more extension of regionalisation.  My friends opposite are the biggest critics of regionalisation.  They cannot have it every way.  They must either agree with regionalisation and signing Protocols or disagree with being excluded from Iran.  I am pleased to confirm the reopening of the United Arab Emirates market which may encourage other Gulf states to drop restrictions on Irish beef.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that 1996 was a difficult year for the dairy sector and there were delays in passing on price reductions in 1997.  Dairy incomes reached a high point in 1995-6.  I recently made a decision in regard to temporary leasing and restructuring in this area.  I am focusing on the future of the quota regime and await the Commission's proposals in that regard.</P>

He was riding high, handing out cheques and announcing new schemes.  Does he remember the farmer's charter?  It was forgotten before the photograph was developed.

      <P>The Minister has failed to get anything through Cabinet, but the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, has no problem getting measures through when his Department is at risk.  If farmers were asked what is the main difficulty facing the industry, they would say the closure of markets in Egypt, Libya, Russia and Iran.  They should be reopened.  The Deputies opposite have heard farmers call for that many times.  When the Russians came here the Minister, Deputy Yates, considered that his clinic work was more important than our trade with Russia.  Let us call a spade a spade.</P>

      <P>There is complete indifference in Government to the farming crisis.  The Tánaiste spoke for an hour at the Labour Party Ard Fheis and he never mentioned the word &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; in his address.  We then heard the attacks on farmers by the Minister, Deputy De Rossa.  He said: &ldquo;the farmers are rolling in it&rdquo;.  He also said that farmers were leading the revolt concerning water charges because they wanted free water for their farms.  The Minister and his colleagues behind him know that those remarks are untrue, but that is how agriculture is being portrayed by the two centre left parties in Government with Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>I am surprised he is going to Egypt at this late stage because initially he attended public meetings where he told farmers they would get outrageously high prices for their cattle.  I attended a meeting in Athenry which was also attended by Deputy Connaughton.  The Minister did not give them the facts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and this has been borne out. The current price per pound of cattle is not what the Minister said it would be when he attended these meetings.  Farmers are glad he is going out of the country rather than around the country and I hope he will be able to open up export markets.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> referred to the country's unique position in regard to live exports and stated farming was turning into a lottery.  I want the Minister to recognise the uniqueness of the live cattle policy and I hope his colleagues support that policy.  It is better to sell beef to other countries rather than have it stored in intervention.  What has been done?  For the first quarter of this year, 12,741 live cattle were exported, 76 per cent down on last year.  That is a huge drop.  The Egyptian, Libyan and Iranian markets are closed and the Russian market is confined to 40 per cent of Irish beef exports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The agriculture industry is going through its most difficult period for many years on a number of fronts.  There is serious difficulty in the beef industry.  Having attended meetings in my constituency and spoken to individual farmers, there is no doubt that those who have committed money to this capital intensive sector face bankruptcy.  They are without hope and are asking what will the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry do for them.  Promises have been made that a package will be put together before the election but that is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The difficulties in the industry must be approached in a planned and co-ordinated manner. They have their roots in the BSE problem and the curtailment of the live export markets with a consequent build up of stock which has led to problems selling meat and the difficulties that exist with the operation of the GATT quota arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farming is the largest industry in our economy. Is it within the negotiating capacity of a Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to go to the EU and tell it that Ireland is more dependent on output from the agriculture industry than any other country in the Union and plead a special case even on a short-term basis?  There must be flexibility in the operation of the export refund arrangement within the context of the controls of the GATT quota arrangement to take account of the build up in the system.  Is it possible, for <Col N="1008" /> instance, that some live export markets will reopen in July or August?  Is it realistic to suggest that we should take beef out of the system between the middle of April and July and then approach the EU to examine the export refund and GATT quota arrangements and look at the detrimental impact they are having on farmers?</P>

Is negotiation a possibility?  Is it possible to approach other member states to take account of the perilous position of the industry here?</P>
      <P>While the beef sector has been the principal focus of debate, the potato industry is another area in which there is no common organisation of the market.  Potatoes and beef are the two principal forms of agricultural production in the Taoiseach's constituency, yet neither is getting the priority it deserves at Cabinet level.  Why?  Where does the influence lie within the Cabinet on these issues?  People involved in beef and potato production will be bankrupt before the end of the year.  There are dire predictions for the beef, milk and cereal sectors.  There is a mass exodus of people from the industry and there is a long-term threat to the rural economy.  Rural Ireland will be denuded of resources and people in the long term.</P>

      <P>Prior to adjourning this debate I said it seemed that Labour and Democratic Left must have their merry way in framing criminal justice legislation.  Irrespective of the flaws in their arguments, or the will of the vast majority of law-abiding citizens, they appear to believe they know best.  They will not be thanked by people in the eastern division of the Dublin metropolitan district, where there was one indictable offence in which a syringe was used in 1993, four in 1994 and 11 in 1995; by those in the north-central division, where there were 33 such offences in 1993, 76 in 1994 and 145 in 1995; by those in the northern district, where there were 19 such offences in 1993, 38 in 1994 and 79 in 1995; by those in the south-central division, where there were 66 such offences in 1993, 112 in 1994 and 176 in 1995; by those in the southern division, where there were 35 such offences in 1993, 85 in 1994 and 94 in 1995.  We do not have the breakdown in the Dublin metropolitan area for 1996 but the figure for the country reached 1,252 in that year and the vast majority of these offences were committed in Dublin.  Those figures are rising rapidly.</P>
      <P>There is a crucial difference between the approach of the rainbow coalition Government to syringe offences and that of Fianna Fáil.  In setting out the sentences it feels should be imposed, the Government uses the words &ldquo;not greater than&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall not exceed&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil uses the words &ldquo;shall not be less than&rdquo;.  We believe society has the right to impose minimum sentences in respect of serious offences; the rainbow coalition Government, no doubt because of the influence of Labour and Democratic Left, believes the opposite.  Those who believe that imprisonment for offences such as these does not constitute a deterrent are badly mistaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour and Democratic Left have an undue influence in framing criminal justice legislation when it is largely photocopied from Bills published by Fianna Fáil.  In this context it was remarkable to hear the Tánaiste deliver a speech on crime in the past week.  As always on issues of this kind, he spoke the tough, populist language expected of a politician in the throes of an election, facing an electorate which, to say the least, has not been amused by his performance on this <Col N="1010" /> issue.  He spoke as if he were an Opposition politician and although he talked tough, he does not act on the issue.  He appeared implicitly to criticise the performance of the Minister for Justice during the reign of the fast-fading rainbow coalition Government.  He complained that sentences were not harsh enough and prison places were too few.  He said the only place for criminals was prison.  While he is right to say that, he conveniently forgot that his own Minister for Finance had unilaterally decided not long ago that there should no place for criminals in prison.</P>
    <P>The blather of his backbenchers on Dublin radio stations every Sunday night is coming home to the electorate as the howl of those left in the wilderness, not knowing where to go, having lost their way through having been directionless for so long on an issue of such fundamental importance to the people of this city and country.  All the humbug in the world in the dying days of the rainbow will not be sufficient to rescue the Tánaiste's and the Minister, Deputy De Rossa's backbenchers from an electorate which has been outraged by the division and derision with which this Government has treated the crime issue.</P>
    <P>People were surprised that a man convicted of three manslaughter offences had been loose in Ireland in the last two years while wanted in Britain to serve out his term, but I do not understand their surprise.  Our home grown criminals roam the streets day and night, having been released under the open door policy operated with such abandon by the Minister for Justice and the coalition.  It would be a sick joke except that countless unfortunate people are the victims of this negligence.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister for Justice to plead she inherited difficult circumstances but everyone recognises that for the past few years the number of serious crimes has risen, violent crimes are becoming ever more violent and, as a consequence, the sentences imposed by the courts have become longer.  It should have been known it would be necessary to provide a sufficient level of prison spaces, in the short term at least, to solve this problem.  The rainbow coalition Government cancelled the proposed prisons in Mountjoy and Castlerea.</P>
    <P>In July 1996 there was a sudden realisation among the so-called civil libertarians of the left, those who would adorn themselves with the red band of the rainbow, that something needed to be done.  However, that was not because they believed something needed to be done.  It was because they suddenly realised their seats were in grave jeopardy.  One after another, as sure as night follows day, they clambered and scampered to get aboard the referendum shuttle in autumn 1996.</P>
    <P>It was strange in July to see the Labour Party Minister for Finance bring the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996, to the House to establish the Criminal Assets Bureau.  It was stranger still to see him and other members of the rainbow coalition Government subsequently boast that only <Col N="1011" /> for them the assets of criminals could not be frozen or seized.</P>
    <P>Let us nail the lie.  The harsh truth is that Fianna Fáil's Proceeds of Crime Bill, 1996, was a central plank in the Government's response to organised crime because the Government had no philosophy, ideology or ideas on how to deal with it.  The Criminal Assets Bureau was an axiomatic consequence of the Proceeds of Crime Bill, 1996. There is no point, now that the horse has bolted, in any member of the Government trying to pretend that Fianna Fáil's achievements are theirs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice said she was not ashamed of the fact that she had copied Fianna Fáil's legislation and that she was right to do so if the legislation was worthwhile.  I have no objection to the Minister for Justice copying Fianna Fáil legislation, proposals and provisions. However, I strenuously object to the political hypocrisy and opportunism of those who now seek to claim what was never theirs in the interests of little more than political expediency. The electorate will see that for the humbug it is and recognise that, since the protection of people's lives and property is, in the hierarchy of obligations, a superior obligation, an Opposition which leads the fight against crime should be in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank everyone who contributed to this interesting and important debate.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bill, 1997, is an important legislative proposal. Deputies have rightly drawn attention to some of the modern manifestations of crime and the unfailing ability of criminals to adjust to modern circumstances and exploit modern situations.  This is precisely why it is necessary to take down old statutes, brush the dust off them and look critically to see if, and how, they need to be updated or restated in modern statutory terms to deal with the criminal acts being perpetrated in society in 1997.</P>
      <P>Such updating in relation to non-fatal offences against the person is vital because these offences lie at the core of our criminal law.  The provisions in this Bill are the result of very careful drafting which takes account of the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission on this subject, made, of course, after its usual detailed examination.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has also taken the view that any updating of the criminal law would not be complete unless it also addressed new criminal developments not already covered or not fully dealt with by existing law.  Accordingly, she has included provisions in the Bill to deal with the modern crimes of stalking and syringe attacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also, of course, appropriate that a Bill which seeks to modernise the law relating to the variety of assaults which can be committed against the person should also address the modern phenomenon of the use of syringes as wea-pons <Col N="1012" /> to attack, intimidate or cause serious injury to the person.  The Minister has provided in this Bill for a range of offences to combat such conduct, including the offences of possession of a syringe or container of blood with intent to threaten or injure, placing or abandoning a syringe in any place in a manner which is likely to injure any person, injuring a person with a syringe or threatening to do so and throwing or putting blood on another person or threatening to do so.  The penalties provided will range from five years to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been made by Opposition Deputies of their Private Members' Bill to deal with syringe attacks which was introduced by Deputy O'Donoghue.  There is much to admire in the Deputy's zeal and attention to this matter in responding to the problem by so quickly producing a Private Members' Bill.  However, as the Minister for Justice indicated to the House, while that Bill was well intentioned it was inadequate to deal with the range of criminal behaviour involving syringes which, unfortunately, is increasing in society.  The provisions of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997, are, on the contrary, comprehensive and deal with all aspects of this most serious problem.  They also provide for a range of penalties to reflect the degrees of seriousness of the different forms of criminal behaviour concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue complained that the Minister's provisions relating to syringes do not provide for minimum or mandatory sentences. Clearly, the Deputy does not trust the Judiciary to weigh up the circumstances of each case and to ensure the punishment fits the crime.  Would the Deputy deprive a judge of the possibility of imposing a lesser sentence where, for example, the offender indicates participation in a drug treatment programme?  Of course, no two cases are ever identical.  That is why the law only in the rarest of cases, such as murder, provides for maximum rather than minimum sentences.  There is certainly clear evidence that the courts are prepared to impose sentences at the maximum end of the range, as some recent cases show.</P>
    <P>It is clear the problem of stalking is of great concern to this House and the public.  The Minister for Justice shares that concern.  Stalking is a very serious interference with the peace and privacy of the individual.  The Minister has, accordingly, provided in this Bill for a new offence of harassment which will be punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.  The provisions in this Bill are intended to provide very important protection to anyone who is the subject of a stalker's attention.  That protection includes empowering the court to order the stalker not to communicate with the victim for such period as may be specified by the court or to approach the victim's residence or place of employment.</P>
    <P>Deputies have raised a number of issues in relation to this Bill and I will bring their comments to the attention of the Minister for Justice who intends to carefully examine all the comments <Col N="1013" /> made.  As she indicated at the beginning of the debate, the important thing is to get the best possible legislation in place to protect our citizens. If, having considered the comments of Members on this Bill, she thinks it necessary to do so, she will make proposals to ensure this very important body of legislation is as watertight and effective as possible in protecting our citizens against criminal attacks.</P>

      <P>Everybody will be appalled that a triple killer who has been on the run from Broadmoor high security hospital for more than 16 years has been participating in a FÁS scheme in the native city of the Minister of State at Cork women's poetry circle.  It is quite incredible that Alan Patrick Reeve, responsible for the killing of three individuals, has been living here for the past two years without any serious attempt being made to restrict his movements or to protect others from him.  It is not as if our authorities were not aware of the existence of Mr. Reeve here.  Indeed reports suggest that as far back as August 1995 Thames Valley police in the United Kingdom were made aware by the Garda that Mr. Reeve was living in Cork.  How is it possible that a convicted killer can be permitted to remain at large here with the authorities oblivious to the potential risk to ordinary, law-abiding citizens? Such disregard for the life and limb of each and every citizen, amounting to negligence, is nothing <Col N="1014" /> new on the part of this rainbow coalition Government. We are all only too well acquainted with the litany of gaffes which has become the forte of this Administration, more particularly of the Minister for Justice.  Rarely has a day passed in the preceding two years that we have not learned of another episode of bungling by the Minister, another escaped prisoner, another incomplete extradition warrant or, dare I say, another unopened envelope.</P>
      <P>Tough words from the Tánaiste recently will not protect the men, women and children of Cork or elsewhere from people who remain at large long after they should have been removed from our streets.  Such a person is Mr. Reeve who was convicted of three manslaughters.</P>
      <P>Most people will be incredulous that not only was this man able to roam freely around Cork and presumably elsewhere &mdash; for that matter perhaps in and out of the country &mdash; but he was actually given employment by a State agency, FÁS. This is an extraordinary indictment of the vetting procedures for employing individuals.  The very least people participating in State schemes, recruited for State or any other employment can expect is that their lives and limbs be safeguarded. In this instance it would appear those participating in the FÁS scheme in Cork were in direct contact with an individual who was, and in all probability is, extremely dangerous.</P>
      <P>For this and many other reasons extremely serious questions must be answered.  While I do not say so facetiously, I can only hope the extradition of Alan Patrick Reeve from this State does not suffer the same fate as the fatal, debauched and chaotic shambles that characterised the Duncan extradition case handled by another Administration here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall ignore the electioneering phraseology of Deputy O'Donoghue and deal with the facts.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities indicated that in August 1995, on becoming aware of this man's presence in this jurisdiction, they informed the police in Britain of that fact.  Deputies will appreciate that, pending receipt of warrants for the purpose of the person's extradition to Britain, the Garda had no basis on which to proceed against him.  Two warrants in respect of the person concerned were received by the Garda Síochána from the Thames Valley police force on 20 February 1997 indicating that the person concerned was absent without leave from a mental hospital where he had been detained following his conviction on two incidents of manslaughter and was liable to be retaken under the United Kingdom Mental Health Act, 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána sent these warrants to the Attorney General's Office on 20 February 1997 for examination in the normal way.  On 5 March 1997 the Attorney General's Office informed the Garda that the warrants were in order for endorsement.  On 12 March 1997 the Garda, in <Col N="1015" /> accordance with the law, inquired whether the Minister for Justice wished to intervene in the case.  On 14 March 1997 the Minister, having examined the warrants, indicated that she did not propose to intervene.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities indicated that the person concerned was arrested on foot of the two warrants on 3 April 1997 and brought before the courts on that day.  He was remanded in custody to 9 April on which date he was further remanded to 14 April 1997.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be aware that neither the Garda Síochána nor the courts have the power to detain any person without proper cause.  The Garda Síochána must have a legal basis to proceed against any person and, prior to the receipt of the warrants in this case, had no basis to commence any proceedings in this jurisdiction against the person concerned.  The Minister for Justice has been informed by the Garda Síochána that the person involved is neither wanted nor charged in connection with any offence committed in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had this opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, to provide clarification on the basis of the information provided by the Garda authorities about what happened in this case.  The House will appreciate that, as the case is at present before the courts, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in any greater detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject I raise is a serious one and requires urgent attention.  I am glad that has now been accepted and I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his office.</P>
      <P>Scoil Iosagáin, Buncrana, County Donegal is a special school with a special ethos.  Its aim is inclusion and overcoming marginalisation. Already alongside the mainstream school with an enrolment of 552 pupils, Scoil losagáin has a class for 12 Down's syndrome children with moderate mental handicap.  Plans are at an advanced stage for another class to cater for children with profound mental handicap.  It will be the first of its kind ever attached to a mainstream primary school in Ireland.  These are the initiatives it is taking to overcome social exclusion and marginalisation.</P>
      <P>These children vary in their physical education and emotional needs.  Anyone looking on will recognise the need for classroom assistants.  This is acknowledged given that it already has an assistant.  I raise this matter because this classroom assistant is to be taken away from these children and placed in the newly created class for profoundly mentally handicapped children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the Minister for Education is a teacher I cannot understand how one with that background can take away a classroom assistant and justify it.  How can a school dedicated to promoting inclusion and developing all the children's <Col N="1016" /> varied abilities be abandoned in such a fashion? Where does it fit into the programmes for Government or even plain simple human rights? Education is a right and not a privilege.</P>
    <P>These children are being catered for by a teacher whom they highly respect and who is ably assisted by a person whom they all know and trust.  The level of the current provision is not in question.  The abandonment of the teacher, parents and students by removing that help is in question.  The rejection of their concept of cherishing all our children equally is similarly in question.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education considered it necessary in June 1995 to make an appointment to help meet the needs of the pupils attending the special classes attached to the school.  The appointment was to take effect in September 1995.  By October 1995 the school was notified that when the new class for profoundly mentally handicapped children was set up, the classroom assistant would be moved out.  I could speak for hours on how the parents feel about it.  Their feelings of anger, frustration and helplessness are understandable.  They know their children and the resources needed in time and people for each of their children.  They appreciate the advances being made within the school to ensure their children are accommodated and cared for as individuals. They are at a loss to accept the reasoning behind the decision to remove the classroom assistant.  They cannot understand that the finances involved warrant this level of disruption to their children's lives.  I have been assured that for some of those children, this will be the end of their school days.  Given the amount of individual care needed, one set of parents who have two children at the school will not leave them with a teacher and ten other children.</P>
    <P>For the teacher there are various practical issues outlined in the letter which was forwarded to the Department and various other people. Poignant examples are, for instance, that one child has suffered kidney failure and an external bag is in place and has to be changed regularly which takes about seven minutes.  Who does this task and who looks after the rest of the class if the assistant is not present?  Incontinence, hygiene and puberty are issues that impinge on the day for one adult to deal with.  How can one teacher alone cope with this while caring for the remainder of the class?  These children have special needs and need special attention, be it in the classroom or in the playground.  Often it is necessary to separate them into two groups for visits to clinics, psychologists, speech therapists, the swimming pool and for behavioural reasons. Sometimes there is a need for time out for those who display inappropriate behaviour.</P>
    <P>One teacher for 12 pupils on individual education development programmes is not enough. Given the ratio of 1:10, if they lose the classroom assistant the social skills development will be such that the teacher will never be in a position to leave the classroom.  I ask the Minister to look at <Col N="1017" /> this case, to understand the work and ambitions of the school and not to leave the class without an assistant because it is inhuman, senseless and too incredible in this day and age to contemplate. In these days of economic boom, the Celtic tiger and so on, I appeal to the Minister's humanity, his sense of fair play for those with disabilities, and to his common sense.  One teacher in a class of 12 children with special needs cannot continue. We are still asking for a classroom assistant to cater for children with profound mental handicap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The unit to which she refers is a special class being established to cater for children with severe or profound mental handicap.  The need to make the support of a classroom assistant available to the children in question is fully recognised by my Department.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the establishment of this special class, my Department allocated a child care assistant post to the school in question in June 1995.  At the time of this allocation, it was indicated to the school that the child care post in question was intended to be used specifically for this special class, once it had been established.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand plans for the establishment of the special class are at an advanced stage. Some necessary building work associated with this development is expected to be completed shortly.  The necessary furniture for the class has been ordered and the process of selecting pupils for enrolment in the class has already begun.</P>
      <P>Where children with severe of profound mental handicap are concerned, the level of special need is such that a multi-diciplinary response is required.  This response involves education and health care inputs.  In the context of establishing this special class, my Department is in contact with the relevant health authorities to ensure the children in question will have access to the full range of necessary support services.</P>
      <P>In terms of educational provision, the special class will operate at a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1.  It is also intended that the class teacher will be supported by the child care assistant. Pupils attending the special class will also attract special capitation funding at a rate of £383 per pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand officials of my Department are in ongoing contact with the authorities of the school in question in relation to the establishment of the <Col N="1018" /> special class and the class is expected to commence operation in the near future.</P>
    <P>Where children with certain disabilities are concerned, including those with severe or profound mental handicap, my Department fully recognises the need to provide backup support through the allocation of child care assistants. The need for such support can arise in relation to such matters as mobility and toileting and other non-teaching duties.</P>
    <P>Since taking office the Minister for Education has allocated a total of 175 child care assistant posts to special schools and special classes.  This brings the total number of child care assistants now in place in the special education area to 252 and provides concrete evidence of her commitment to the needs of the children in question.  It is her intention to maintain this commitment in the future.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> Under the proposed subsidy scheme, an amount of up to £75 per annum will be payable by local authorities to groups towards the costs of supplying domestic water to the estimated 55,000 houses connected to privately sourced schemes, and up to £35 per house will be payable to groups with a local authority source in respect of the 90,000 houses served by them.  To assist in the financial management of groups it is proposed to pay, on an interim basis, instalments of the subsidy of £45 and £20 to groups with private and public sources, respectively.  Full details of the subsidy scheme will be notified to the local authorities following my forthcoming meeting with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.</P>
    <P>Under the new scheme of grants for individual householders, 75 per cent of the cost up to a maximum of £1,600 per house will be available to assist in the provision of a new water supply, or the upgrading of an existing supply.  These grants will be payable by the local authorities, subject to prior approval before work commences.  I plan to make a further announcement on the details of this grant scheme shortly.</P>
    <P>As I announced on 21 January, a new multiannual programme is being established, with funding of £5 million a year, to allow for the upgrading and take-over of group schemes by local authorities where this is agreed by the group scheme concerned.  Responsibility for the administration of the existing capital grants schemes for the development and upgrading of group schemes, and for small public water sewerage schemes, has been devolved to local authorities. Block grant allocations in respect of these measures were notified to local authorities on 26 March.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the comprehensive approach now being adopted will not only achieve equity in the approach to the provision of water services to all households, but will secure a significant improvement in the quality, reliability and efficiency of rural water supplies generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 30, 38 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>My Department was represented by an assistant principal officer at the consultative seminar organised by the European Commission in May 1996 at a preparatory stage of this draft directive's elaboration.  There was, at that stage, no proposal in relation to water charges.  This proposal first emerged in an internal draft document &mdash; not approved by the Commission &mdash; which was circulated informally by the Commission Services in December 1996.</P>
      <P>While preparation of the draft directive continued within the Commission Services during the Irish Presidency, the proposal was not adopted by the Commission until 25 February 1997; the Irish Presidency, therefore, had no role in relation to it.</P>
      <P>Since its adoption by the Commission in February, there has been no correspondence with the Commission on the subject of the draft directive. The matter was, however, on the agenda for the Environment Council on 3 March for presentation by the Commission.  While substantive consideration by the Environment Council of the relevant sections of the draft directive has not yet commenced, the Commission has been made fully aware of the Irish position on the matter.  I am arranging to have a full statement of all contacts with the Commission on this issue placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 35, 136 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>All road accidents are investigated by the Garda whose reports are submitted to the National Roads Authority and are the basis for the annual road accidents facts report.  The 1996 report will be available later this year.</P>
      <P>The reports available to me do not provide information on the number of accidents in which tourists are involved.  While there is no specific evidence to suggest that tourists are a high risk category of road user in Ireland, I am concerned about this matter.  Special precautions are taken to assist visitors in their understanding and appreciation of driving, cycling or walking on our roads.  These measures include special multi-lingual road signs, introduced last year, and multilingual information leaflets, provided by the National Safety Council and distributed via the major car-hire firms, including those operating from the airports and ferry terminals; both the signs and the leaflets focus on the requirement to drive on the left.  I am considering what further measures, including signs and devices to be fitted on hired cars, could be introduced.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the increase in fatalities and injuries generally on our roads in the last two years.  Trying to reverse this upward spiral is a challenge to all of us.  It is not a problem that lends itself to quick, easy solutions and new measures take time to achieve positive results.</P>
      <P>The wide range of road safety measures being implemented on a continuous, year-round basis are aimed at making our roads safer for all road users.  In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, has assured the House that the Garda is committed to the rigorous enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The road safety together strategy, introduced last year, is focused on the four main areas of engineering, enforcement, education and encouragement. It is directed at all the responsible agencies and all road users who must work together to seek new ways to tackle the problem.  Specific initiatives which I have recently taken include the introduction of on-the-spot fines for speeding offences, the publication of a traffic signs manual and a new guide to road safety engineering, and the development of a road safety initiative at county level.  I have also provided support for the establishment of a driver instructor register. <Col N="1025" /> Work is being finalised in my Department on new traffic and traffic signs regulations and plans for a theory test for new drivers and compulsory vehicles testing are being advanced.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the Mayor of Galway last October suggesting that the corporation should consider the option of a treatment plant based on alternative technology that would allow the facilities to be built underground on Mutton Island, without the need for a permanent causeway.  For reasons which I have publicly explained, that remains my preferred option.</P>
      <P>I have since received a reply from Galway Corporation stating its preference for an overground plant serviced by a causeway, although the plans to proceed on this basis have been challenged in High Court proceedings.  I replied to the most recent letter on 27 January 1997 and I met a deputation from the corporation on 27 February.</P>
      <P>The corporation, both in its letter and at the meeting, asked that I agree a twin-track approach which would involve the undertaking of two detailed designs for different projects one of which would, by definition, never be constructed. In the circumstances, and bearing in mind the legal proceedings, I do not consider that it would be justifiable to approve such an approach and the major additional planning and design costs which it would involve.  I made my position on this matter clear to the corporation in my letter and at the meeting referred to.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 18, 53, 54 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality in 1995 indicates that overall quality continues to be satisfactory, especially in the public supplies.  However, further measures to improve water quality, especially in relation to private group schemes, are needed.</P>
      <P>The position outlined by the Environmental Protection Agency is that, apart from coliforms, compliance levels in respect of strictly health related parameters were close to or above 99 per cent in 1995.  In the case of coliforms, the overall compliance level, 87.5 per cent, was a small improvement on 1994.  There is no room for complacency about the limited exceedances of drinking water quality parameters identified in the report and I will be asking local authorities to ensure that intensive follow-up measures are taken where exceedances have occurred.</P>
      <P>In September 1996, my Department wrote to sanitary authorities reiterating earlier advice that they should carry out risk assessment of water supply sources, with highest priority to be given to groundwater supplies which are in close proximity to potentially polluting sources.  I have asked sanitary authorities to review their action plans for the protection of water supplies in the light of the findings of these risk assessments.  In addition, my Department will continue to support the development of the integrated training programme for personnel involved in the treatment and supply of drinking water which is being promoted by the Sanitary Services National Training Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency report already referred to indicates that 43 per cent of private group water supplies suffer some degree <Col N="1027" /> of coliform contamination.  This has arisen largely as a result of the lack of investment in water filtration and disinfection facilities.  Many of these schemes were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s when cost-effective and straightforward water treatment technology was not widely available. As a result, some groups are unable to respond to the challenging task of supplying water in compliance with the standards for drinking water.</P>
    <P>Specific measures have now been put in place to improve the quality of drinking water provided by private group schemes.  Additional moneys have been provided in 1997 to start a multiannual programme which will enable local authorities, subject to the agreement of the group schemes concerned, to take over individual schemes and upgrade the quality of the supplies. The existing capital grants scheme is being maintained and will be available to support the improvement of schemes which wish to continue independent operation.  Proposals in relation to subsidies towards the operational costs of group schemes and grants for private individual supplies have also been announced and are referred to in the reply to Question No. 12 on today's Order Paper.  All of these measures are specifically designed to address the key issue of water quality in private group and individual water sources.  I am confident that they will contribute to a major improvement in the quality and reliability of these supplies.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question refers to the survey of pesticide levels countrywide which the Environmental Protection Agency has undertaken in accordance with its statutory responsibilities for the monitoring of drinking water.  The agency's report, entitled Pesticides in Drinking Waters (1996), is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency survey checked for the presence of 38 pesticide compounds, selected on the basis of their use in Ireland, in a total of 251 samples of drinking water and entailing over 3,300 individual analyses. This represented data from a total of 139 water supplies serving approximately 1.8 million consumers.  No evidence of presistent background contamination by any of the target pesticide compounds was found.  In three samples, including one from County Cork, pesticide residues in excess of the 0.1 microgrammes per litre limit specified in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 were detected.  In these cases, the supplies were re-sampled and found to be clear of residues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey was the first to provide a national overview of pesticide levels in drinking water in Ireland.  In view of the satisfactory position disclosed in relation to the quality of supplies, the carrying out of more comprehensive monitoring of pesticide levels in drinking water would not be <Col N="1029" /> justified at this stage.  The Environmental Protection Agency intends, however, to keep the position under review and to carry out such further monitoring as may be appropriate.</P>

      <P>The principal commitment under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC 1992) is for developed countries to return by the end of the present decade to earlier levels of manmade CO 2 emissions.  Other commitments relate to the preparation of national and regional programmes for climate change abatement, national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions, and national communications for submission to the Convention Secretariat.</P>
      <P>Ireland is participating in the EU policy objective of stabilising overall Union CO 2 emissions at their 1990 level by the year 2000; this objective is on course.  Ireland, in common with many other countries, has also adopted a national CO 2 abatement strategy and undergone review by the Convention Secretariat in relation to its first national communication.  A second national communication will be submitted to the Secretariat shortly.</P>
      <P>The first conference of the parties to UNFCCC concluded in 1995 that the original Convention commitments were not adequate in face of the urgent problems of climate change.  The strengthening of these commitments is now being addressed by an international negotiation process due to conclude in December 1997.  The EU has adopted a leading role in these negotiations by proposing that developed country parties should, individually or jointly, reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 15 per cent by the year 2010 relative to 1990.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed to take Questions Nos. 22, 29, 140, 141, 173 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the proposed port access route is to provide a direct link from the C-ring motorway to Dublin Port to cater for existing and anticipated growth in port traffic. A number of options for access to Dublin Port were examined as part of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, including an eastern bypass, a northern port access route, an east-west tunnel and a Royal Canal truckway.  The DTI report recommended the development of a northern port access route.</P>
      <P>The proposed route is intended to be a national primary road.  The development of proposals for the route is, accordingly, a matter for Dublin Corporation, as road authority for the area, acting under the general supervision of the National Roads Authority which has overall responsibility for the planning, design, construction and financing of national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the intention that the proposed route would be constructed as a motorway.  The Roads Act, 1993, outlines the statutory procedures which must be complied with before a project of this nature can proceed.  These include a full environmental impact assessment, the preparation of a motorway scheme and the holding of a public inquiry into all matters <Col N="1031" /> relating to the scheme, including the environmental impact.</P>
    <P>As regards the environmental impact statement, a total of 638 written submissions on the likely effects on the environment of the proposed development were received within the specified period.  I will take these into account in reaching a decision on the matter, in conjunction with the motorway scheme, when the latter is submitted by Dublin Corporation.  In view of my quasijudicial role, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment on the scheme at this stage.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>whether delays in the planning process have been responsible for the loss of a major industry to this country; the investigations, if any, he has had carried out in this regard; and, if so, the action, if any, he proposes to take to rectify the situation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many factors involved in the decision of industry to locate in any country; for example, the supply and cost of labour, the availability of appropriate skills, distance from markets and transport links, language, the level of grants or other fiscal incentives, etc.  Ireland has been particularly successful in attracting major foreign investment in recent years.</P>
      <P>It has not been shown that delays in the planning process in Ireland have been directly responsible for the loss of any major industry.  The reforms introduced by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992 and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 have ensured more efficient processing of both planning applications and appeals.  In fact, over 93 per cent of appeals to An Bord Pleanála were determined within four months in 1996, compared with only 20 per cent in 1991.</P>
      <P>My Department is in regular contact with the industrial development agencies regarding the operation of the planning system and all relevant aspects of the matter are kept under review.  As indicated in Partnership 2000, the possibility of further changes in the system to minimise delays and uncertainties will be considered; any such changes, of course, would have to ensure a continued high level of protection for the environment and amenities, and have regard to established rights to public participation in the planning process.</P>

      <P>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change acknowledges that there is a clear gender imbalance in the management levels in the local authority service, notwithstanding the fact that local authorities have adopted equal opportunity policies and that some progress has been made in recent years.</P>
      <P>A number of measures are now proposed to further promote equality of opportunity in the local authority service.  Guidelines on the introduction of active equality policies and programmes in each local authority are nearing completion, and I expect to issue them to local authorities very shortly.  A special development programme is also to be established for women managers.  Other matters related to promotion of equality of opportunity are being developed by the local government management services board, with the input of the local authority personnel officers' network.  The Local Appointments Commission has already made considerable strides in ensuring that there is increasing participation by women in its interview boards. Local authorities are being asked to place considerably greater emphasis on this important aspect of recruitment policy too.</P>

      <P>The Building Regulations, 1991 place a duty on persons providing or reconstructing buildings to cater for the needs of disabled people.  Departments and local authorities have been asked on a number of occasions over the years to ensure that appropriate provision is made for access for disabled people to all buildings under their control. The provision of access for disabled people to other existing buildings is a matter for the owners or occupiers of the buildings concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the design and execution of road works and pedestrian facilities, my Department has requested local authorities to pay particular attention to the needs of disabled people.  This includes consideration of such matters as the safety and accessibility of footpaths, including the <Col N="1034" /> dishing of kerbs, and pedestrian and parking facilities.</P>
    <P>A scheme of grants is available to local authorities in the greater Dublin area to implement traffic management measures forming part of the overall DTI strategy.  In the 1994-6 period, over £1 million was paid under this scheme for the provision of facilities for the mobility impaired.</P>

      <P>The new funding arrangements for local government which I announced last December are based on assigning the proceeds of motor taxation to local authorities.  This does not involve a new tax, rather a reassignment of the proceeds of an existing one at existing rates.  There will be scope for local authorities, should they choose, to increase the national rates from next year on, by up to 6 per cent in total, should they wish to raise additional funds to finance local services generally.</P>
      <P>The transfer of the proceeds of motor taxation, at existing rates, to local authorities is more than sufficient to allow the rate support grant to be replaced and charges for water and sewerage facilities supplied by local authorities to domestic dwellings to be abolished in 1997.  There is no question, therefore, of subjecting anyone, whether in an urban or rural area, and whether or not they avail of a public water supply, to increased motor taxation to offset the abolition of these charges.</P>

      <P>It is an offence to drive, or attempt to drive, or be in charge of, a vehicle while under the influence of drugs.  Section 14 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, provides that where a garda is of the opinion that a person is committing such an offence, that person may be required to give a blood or urine sample.  I am advised that no apparatus equivalent to the breathalyser is available for the purpose of testing for drugs in drivers.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Government Act, 1994, each library authority must, from time to time, prepare and adopt a programme for the operation and development of its library service.  In September 1995 my Department issued guidelines to library authorities on the matter, and, to date, 19 plans have been prepared and adopted by library authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department also intends to review library strategy at national level with a view to providing an updated policy framework for the development of the public library service.  The review will involve widespread consultation.  It will examine the functions being carried out by public libraries, the expectations of different groups from the service, and the relationship between library and other services.  The review will complement a more wide-ranging review of the library sector being planned by An Chomhairle Leabharlanna.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the sewage treatment plant in Dingle was the subject of an Adjournment debate on 26 February during which the issues raised in the letter of 11 December were addressed.  I regret, however, that due to an oversight in my Department a reply to the letter was not issued.  As requested in the letter referred to, arrangements are now being made to hold a meeting, involving officials of my Department, Kerry County Council and representatives of the fishery interests involved, to clarify the position.</P>

      <P>The Government decided on 5 November 1996 to offer State financial assistance and other support to the County Louth residents taking court action against BNFL.  The assistance applies to specific items of scientific investigation, research and other work to be identified.  The Government also decided to seek agreement for the removal of the State as a defendant from the action being pursued by the residents.</P>
      <P>Details of the decision were subsequently conveyed to the Louth residents at a meeting with members of the ministerial committee on Sellafield and the Irish Sea.  Matters discussed included access to scientific reports and other relevant documents held by Departments and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; RPII &mdash; and identification of other possible areas of support. The residents were invited to explore possibilities in this regard and to submit proposals for consideration in line with the terms of the Government decision on the matter.  The residents recently submitted two claims for costs incurred in respect of the legal action conducted to date and these are being examined at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information on documentation held by the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications, the Environment, Health and Marine and the RPII has been made available to the Louth residents, as well as copies or summaries of many of the documents concerned.  Other documents which the residents may regard as relevant to the preparation of their case can be supplied on request.  In addition, the Department of Health has offered to make medical and statistical experts available for a meeting to assist the <Col N="1042" /> residents with the interpretation of health-related data.</P>

      <P>In February, 1997, I published draft Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations which would impose extensive obligations on suppliers of packaging and packaged goods in relation to the acceptance, collection and recovery of packaging waste.  Following consultations at national level and with the European Commission, I expect to be in a position to make these regulations in the near future.  I am confident they will have a major beneficial impact on recycling of packaging waste.</P>
      <P>I intend to keep under review the scope for measures to deal specifically with plastic bags in the light of the provisions available under section 29 of the Waste Management Act, 1996 which will soon be amplified by the Litter Pollution Bill, 1996.</P>

      <P>The European Commission initiated proceedings against Ireland in the European Court of Justice on 5 December 1996 for alleged failure to adequately transpose the EU Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment (85/337/EEC).  The action by the Commission primarily relates to one aspect of Ireland's transposition of the directive i.e. the levels at which EIA should be required for projects involving afforestation, peat extraction and intensification of agriculture. Ireland will be lodging a full defence in this case.</P>
      <P>Full effect has been given in Ireland to the EIA Directive since the introduction of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 and other relevant regulations.  Indeed, a European Commission report, prepared in pursuance of the directive itself, showed that Ireland had established active and extensive EIA procedures on foot of the directive and that a comparatively high proportion of development is subjected to EIA in this country as a result of the adoption of more stringent thresholds than in member states generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 181 together.</P>
      <P>Following the decision to relocate the outfall pipe for the proposed treatment works from Rinnashark, I approved Waterford County Council's proposals to undertake land and marine site investigations in connection with alternative outfall arrangements.  This will enable the council to further advance the planning of the scheme, including the carrying out of a new environmental impact assessment.  The council has recently submitted tender recommendations for the site investigation to my Department which are at present being examined.</P>
      <P>Cohesion Fund assistance has been sought for the completion of the planning of the overall project and the construction of the treatment plant. The Commission's decision is awaited.</P>

      <P>The proposed EU vehicle emissions directive includes provisions to ensure that vehicles would continue to meet stringent emission standards while in service.  Proposed measures include onboard diagnostic systems which would monitor the performance of emission control components. This aspect of the proposals has raised concerns that the associated safety features would restrict in-service repairs to facilities in possession of the necessary information and tools.  This is a legitimate concern which is being addressed during the Council's ongoing detailed examination of the draft directive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 137 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>The EU Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC) established a minimum recovery rate, in Ireland's case, of 25 per cent for waste packaging by 2001.  A target rate of 27 per cent by 2001 has been adopted by REPAK, and this is broadly consistent with relevant EU and national targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of REPAK will be supported by the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations which I have published in draft.  The draft regulations are intended to promote the collection and recycling of packaging waste.  The main obligations will apply to large-scale suppliers of packaging waste who will be required to accept or collect such waste and to take measures to secure or <Col N="1047" /> facilitate its recovery.  The draft regulations also provide for the approval by the Minister for the Environment of schemes for the recovery of packaging waste.  Suppliers who are participating satisfactorily in an approved scheme will be exempt from the main requirements of the regulations. I propose to bring the regulations into effect next month, following the obligatory period of three months' consultation within the European Union.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer and her husband are jointly assessed for tax.  A portion of their combined tax-free allowances is allocated to the taxpayer for use in her employment and the balance to her husband for use against his private pension.  Her husband also receives a pension from the Department of Social Welfare which while taxable is paid gross i.e. without tax being deducted.</P>
      <P>The tax on the social welfare pension is collected by reducing the couple's tax-free allowances by the amount of payment received.  The couple's net tax-free allowances (tax-free allowances less social welfare payment) for 1997-98 are less than their allowances for 1996-97 as the husband's social welfare pension is likely to increase by an amount greater than the increase in the tax exemption limit from £9,000 to £9,200.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the total tax and corporation tax liability of play-schools, kindergarten and Montessori schools for the year 1993, the latest year for which figures are available, is of the order of £720,000.  Corresponding information is not available in respect of PRSI.  This figure does not, however, include crèches which are classified elsewhere with other miscellaneous personal services and which cannot, therefore, be separately identified without carrying out an individual examination of all tax returns for such cases.  Such an Examination could be carried out only at an disproportionate cost. Corresponding information on other taxes and duties either could not be obtained, or could not be obtained without undertaking inquiries which could be carried out only at disproportionate cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of allowing tax relief on expenditure relating to child care services raises complex issues with very different views on the likely impact of such a measure.  The Second Commission for the Status of Women in its report to Government in January 1993 considered the matter but did not recommend that tax relief for child care expenses be given to working parents.  The commission considered that it was preferable that any additional State assistance for child care facilities should be provided through increased investment in child care support and services rather than by providing tax relief to parents for work-related child care costs.  (The NESC Report No. 1991 on women's participation in the Irish labour market reached the same broad conclusion).  The commission noted that tax relief would do nothing to increase the supply or quality of child care and would not improve the training or the supply of qualified child care workers. Furthermore, it concluded that tax relief would <Col N="1053" /> be of little or no use to those with low or no income and that it would be of more benefit to the higher paid than low earners.</P>
    <P>In this context, for example, it is tentatively estimated that if a tax allowance were introduced for the parents of children under five years to cover the cost of registered child care up to a maximum of £3,000 per annum, then the cost to the Exchequer would be £60 million.  I have no plans to introduce tax relief for child care expenses at this time.  As the Deputy is aware tax relief is but one of the methods by which assistance can be provided for children and may not, in fact, be the most appropriate method.  The State already provides considerable assistance to parents, in particular through expenditure on child benefit, education and health services.  I will, of course, keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are, at present, four single mobile task units in County Donegal, located in Letterkenny, Bridgend, Donegal and Ballyshannon.  The proposed centralisation of three mobile task units (MTUs) in Letterkenny, with the resultant loss of one unit, will give rise to surplus staff.  It is not possible to identify the locations where the actual surplus will occur until the reassignment of staff to the new centralised location in Letterkenny is completed.</P>
      <P>The commissioners will, however, endeavour as far as possible to minimise any disruption to staff concerned by redeploying any surplus occuring in the northern or southern part of the county within the same county region.  The only cost envisaged in the centralisation of the MTUs in Letterkenny is the payment of removal expenses, where appropriate, to relocated staff where the transfer would justify a change of residence by reason of such factors as difficulties in travelling to and from work.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the <Col N="1054" /> taxpayer and his wife are in receipt of pensions from the Department of Social Welfare in addition to a pension from a private pension fund.  All these pensions are taxable.  Since their total income in the current tax year will not greatly exceed the exemption limit applicable in their case, £9,200, they will be taxed under the marginal relief system.  Based on the information available, the amount of tax deducted each week will be in the region of £12.40.  The amount will be deducted from the private pension as the pensions paid by the Department of Social Welfare, while taxable, are paid gross, that is, without tax being deducted.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer's income tax liability for the years 1993-94 to 1996-97 has been reviewed.  A refund amounting to £155.62 is due and a cheque for this amount will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for most of the tax year 1996-97 the taxpayer was taxed at the 27 per cent rate.  In March 1997 the taxpayer's taxable income exceeded the 27 per cent threshold of £9,400 and the portion of her taxable income which exceeded £9,400 was taxed at the 48 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>To avoid a repeat of this situation in 1997-98 the taxpayer will be taxed at 48 per cent throughout the year.  She will, however, as happens in the case of other 48 per cent taxpayers, be given an additional tax free allowance, table B allowance, to compensate her for having tax deducted at the higher rate.  In this way the taxpayer's tax payments will be spread evenly over the year and she will not find herself in the position that the amount of tax to be deducted from her pension increases towards the end of the tax year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, conditions of employment in the Civil Service are the responsibility of my Department.  The Civil Service has for many years had working options which are family friendly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A job sharing scheme was introduced in the Civil Service in 1984.  Under the terms of the scheme two members of staff share the duties and responsibilities of one job in return for half the pay and benefits.  The decision whether a post is suitable for job sharing is a matter for each head of department.  At the end of 1996, there were over 2,200 members of staff job sharing, representing <Col N="1056" /> approximately 8 per cent of the workforce. All officers &mdash; whether established or unestablished, including those still on probation &mdash; are eligible to apply to participate in the job sharing scheme.  Officers of all grades are eligible to apply to job share and at present officers are job sharing in grades up to and including principal level. The implementation of a broader range of job sharing options, such as a four day week or a three week month, is currently under consideration in conjunction with staff representatives.</P>
    <P>Most Departments-Offices have introduced a flexitime system.  This system facilitates civil servants, generally in grades up to the middle management level, to be flexible in their arrival and departure times to and from work, subject to being present for a standard core time each day and subject to a minimum number of hours being worked over a four week period.</P>
    <P>A crèche for the children of civil servants opened in April 1992 in existing office space in Lower Mount Street.  The State provided the premises and paid for their refurbishment.  The management of the crèche is the responsibility of a co-operative set up by the staff side representatives. Following a tendering procedure held in 1991, the co-operative appointed a manager.  The day-to-day running costs are to be met from the fees paid by clients of the crèche.  The possibility of opening a crèche on the north side of Dublin city is currently being researched.</P>
    <P>There has been a career break scheme in operation since 1984.  This scheme allows civil servants to take special leave without pay for periods ranging from a minimum period of six months to a maximum period of five years for a number of purposes, including family responsibilities.  At the end of 1996, there were 870 people on career break, 47 per cent of them for child rearing or other domestic purposes.</P>
    <P>There are provisions for special leave with pay for up to five days in the event of the serious and unforseen illness of a close family member. Special leave without pay up to a maximum period of two months may be granted in special circumstances for urgent domestic affairs.  Where special leave without pay is sought for the purpose of coping with family difficulties arising from the death or serious illness of an immediate relative, the amount of special leave may be extended to six months.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I wish to take Questions Nos. 85 to 89, inclusive, 93, 94, 112 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the review referred to by Deputies Davern and Fitzgerald is that of the 1978 working party established to examine the grading structure for physiotherapists in hospitals.  The report of the working party was circulated in 1979. However, this was not a pay review.</P>
      <P>Physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, similar to all other paramedical professions, have benefited in full from all standard and special pay awards under the various national pay programmes over the last number of years.  The relative position of these professions in terms of remuneration has been maintained with those of their collegues in other paramedical disciplines.</P>
      <P>IMPACT, on behalf of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, is pursuing a pay claim under clause 2 (iii) &mdash; annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> These negotiations are complex and are being handled by the health service employers' agency with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputies that every effort is being made to resolve this dispute and informal contacts are being maintained to ensure that the industrial relations machinery available is utilised to its fullest extent.</P>

      <P>Additional funding amounting to £12 million has been made available for the further development in 1997 of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Two million pounds is being used to meet identified needs in existing services.  The remaining £10 million is being used to provide additional residential-respite places <Col N="1060" /> and day care places, to improve services for persons with autism and to continue the ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from inappropriate placements to more appropriate care settings.</P>
      <P>In allocating the additional funding which has been provided in 1997 to the various health board regions for the provision of new residential-respite and day care places, the primary factor which was taken into account were the needs which have been identified by the National Intellectual Disability Database.  The allocation of 33 per cent to the Eastern Health Board region from the £7.5 million provided for new residential and day care services was in line with the needs indicated by the database and the demographic trends for the region.</P>

Some of the additional funding provided in 1997 is also being used to further enhance services to persons with autism in line with the recommendations outlined in my Department's policy document on services to persons with autism which was published in 1994.

      <P>The majority of persons with autism are in receipt of services within the mental handicap services.  However, a minority do require more specialised facilities.  Specific services for persons with autism are available in the Eastern, North-Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards which provide between 128 and 130 residential places overall.  Planning for the development of further specialist facilities is being included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs of persons with a mental handicap and autism in their regions.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> The broad aim of developments in the general medical services over the next three years and beyond is to ensure that both the general practitioner and community pharmacy services are better organised and supported in fulfilling a <Col N="1064" /> more integrated role within the overall health care system in order to deliver a service consistent with the principles, set out in the health strategy, of equity, quality of service and accountability.</P>
      <P>Developments in general practice have included the establishment of general practice units in each health board and the upgrading of practice premises and equipment.  Over the next three years, the focus will be on developing, within a general practice setting, a number of services, including services for the elderly, physiotherapy, dietetics, counselling and social work support, services for cancer patients linked to palliative care, women's health and services for the travelling community.</P>
      <P>The traditional approach to the delivery of certain health services has seen heavy demands on hospital services and a less efficient use of resources.  There is scope for general practitioners to undertake procedures which could be provided in a primary care setting but which have traditionally been available only in hospitals.  The implementation of the policy, set out in the health strategy, includes the development of improved links between general practitioners and their consultant colleagues so that both groups are facilitated in delivering their respective services as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>A new agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act was introduced in 1996.  This agreement comprised a package of measures, including a new format of the pharmacist's contract incorporating an emphasis on the professional role of the pharmacist and the establishment of new standards in the quality of community pharmacy services delivered to patients.  The agreement also provides for the introduction of appropriate accountability arrangements in the operation of the community drugs schemes, more effective arrangements for dispensing high-tech drugs, the regulation of the granting of pharmacy contracts in accordance with public health criteria, support for community pharmacists to maintain and update their professional skills through continuing education courses, funding for upgrading of equipment, including telematic linkages with health boards and the GMS (Payments) Board and a series of measures designed to improve communications between health boards and community pharmacists.</P>
      <P>Most of the elements of the new agreement are already in place and my Department is proceeding with the implementation of the remaining measures, such as the development of continuing education programmes and the implementation of the information technology aspects of the agreement.</P>
      <P>The overall direction of the general medical services which I have outlined above will be reflected in any development of the scheme over the next three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> In February 1997, the European Parliament and Council adopted Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients and my Department is the competent authority in Ireland for its implementation.  Foods and food ingredients which have not hitherto been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Union and which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall within the scope of the regulation which comes into effect in all member states in mid-May of this year.  The regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved-authorised before being placed on the European market.  Thus the regulation, which is an internal market measure, ensures that common rules and procedures in relation to novel foods and ingredients will apply across all member states of the European Union.  It also contains provisions for the labelling of novel foods and food ingredients. The controls available under Regulation 258/97 will provide protection for both consumers and food producers and I will be keeping the matter under continuing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to the incident involving the substance to which the Deputy refers and my Department was aware of the incident in 1989 when it occurred.  A food ingredient produced by genetic modification which has not hitherto been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Union would fall within the scope of Regulation 258/97 and would have to be assessed before it could be <Col N="1066" /> placed on the market anywhere in the European Union, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regulation 258/97 differs in its scope to Directive 90/220 which concerns the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. This directive has already been transposed into Irish law by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, and the Environmental Protection Agency, is the competent authority in Ireland for its implementation.  The Food Safety Advisory Board, FSAB, set up a working group of technical experts to consider the food aspects of notification received by the Environmental Protection Agency under EU Directive 90/220.  It is not the role of the FSAB to decide whether a substance is a novel food; the scope of Regulation 258/97 on novel foods is set down by the European Parliament and Council, the FSAB provides advice on the technical aspects with regard to the food element of dossiers submitted under the terms of Directive 90/220 to the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is a matter for that agency to decide on the outcome of notifications which it receives. To date the working group of the FSAB has not considered any notifications concerning soya and has reviewed three notifications for various types of genetically modified maize.  These notifications were addressed in the first instance at the competent authorities of other member states in whose territories it is intended to make the release of the genetically modified organism.  In accordance with the provisions of the directive, each member state is informed of notifications received in another member state and there is a stated period of time in which observations on a notification can be provided to the evaluating competent authority.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, Regulation 258/97 comes into force in mid-May this year and I am at present making arrangements for its implementation. I am considering the role to be played by the FSAB working group in the assessment of products falling within the scope of this regulation and I wish to assure the Deputies that public health concerns will be paramount in the assessment procedure which I will put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are now met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition such as cancer, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.  I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from cancer-related illnesses.</P>
      <P>I have recently taken a series of important initiatives to ensure that all cancer-related services are delivered in the most effective and patient-centred way.  Last November I published the national cancer strategy which deals with the development and improved co-ordination of cancer services at all levels, and on 4 March 1997 I announced a detailed action plan showing how the national cancer strategy would be implemented.  The plan involves additional expenditure of £25 million over the next three years, starting this year.  I am committed to ensuring a responsive and sensitive network of cancer services which will meet the needs of patients and their families in the most appropriate way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): In Ireland, mammography is currently used primarily as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or concerned women on referral from their GPs and in some cases for women at particular risk of developing the disease.  Diagnostic mammography services are currently provided at 19 centres <Col N="1070" /> throughout the country which are indicated in the following list.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis. The aim is to lead to earlier detection and treatment of breast cancer in asymptomatic women.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in October 1995, I gave the go-ahead to the establishment of a national screening programme on a phased basis.  Since then work has been ongoing on the organisational structures and operational arrangements required to implement the phased expansion of the programme and on resolving the data protection issues surrounding the compilation of a population register.</P>
      <P>I was pleased, therefore, to be in a position to announce on 4 March 1997 the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the National Cancer Strategy.  The plan provides for the establishment of a national steering group to guide the implementation of the national programme of screening for breast cancer; and the introduction of legislation to ensure the screening programme will comply with data protection requirements.  This legislation has been introduced very recently.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the national breast screening programme will commence shortly and will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas.  It will target 120,000 women in the 50 to 64 age group, which represents some 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is guided by the need for the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
      <P>It is vital that the phased introduction of the breast screening programme should take cognisance of these critical success factors.  Decisions taken in relation to the subsequent phases will be guided by the experience gained in putting in place Phase I of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the 1970 Health Act, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over. The guidelines for persons aged 66-79 is £96 per week for persons living alone and £83 per week for those living with family, while those for persons aged 80 and over is £100.50 per week and £86 per week.  In addition, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person <Col N="1072" /> may still be awarded a medical card.  Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs or special diet foods due to a long-term medical condition such as diabetes or coeliac disease, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.</P>
    <P>Persons suffering from diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus can avail of the long-term illness scheme which entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of their particular condition.</P>
    <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>Persons in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance may be entitled to financial supplements for dietary needs.  Application for such a supplement should be made to the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the eligibility criteria currently in place and the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from conditions such as diabetes and coeliac disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): Clinical studies and clinical research are undertaken in this country on eating disorders. However, there have been no reports or studies specifically commissioned by my Department or agencies under the aegis of my Department in relation to this disorder.</P>
      <P>Eating disorders can be extremely serious for those affected and their families.  Although these conditions are not specific to either gender, they particularly affect women.  The symptoms may range from mild to severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards are responsible for the delivery of health services in their functional areas.  The delivery of health services includes the provision of care for persons with eating disorders.  Persons <Col N="1073" /> with eating disorders are generally treated in the health board area in which they reside.  Where inpatient treatment is deemed necessary, it is provided in the person's local acute psychiatric unit or hospital.</P>
    <P>In addition, a tertiary referral service with fully trained medical staff for treating persons with eating disorders is available in St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, St. Patrick's Hospital, Dublin, St. John of God Hospital, Stillorgan, County Dublin, and in an Eastern Health Board administered service at Warrenstown House, Blanchardstown, Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to prevent eating disorders arising in the first place.  The Health Promotion Unit of my Department is actively involved with the Department of Education in the promotion of healthy nutrition in schools and in programmes which foster self-esteem and positive body-awareness, particularly among young girls.  The Health Promotion Unit has also published and distributed widely an information leaflet on the subject of eating disorders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that, further to my previous answer on this subject, Parlimentary Question No. 211 of 22 January 1997 refers, the Waterways Service of my Department installed safety chains in all the lock chambers in the area.  Some of these chains were recently vandalished, but they have now all been restored.</P>
      <P>The Waterways Service has also recently obtained copies of Coroner reports on a number of the fatalities that occurred in the canal last year and has sought a meeting with Dublin Corporation, the Garda Síochána and the National Safety Council to explore further the particular factors contributing to these tragedies in this stretch of canal.</P>
      <P>In relation to the operation of the locks and lock chambers, the Waterways Service generally avoids keeping the chambers full, particularly in summer, in order to discourage swimming in the lock chambers.  I note the Deputy's suggestion that by filling the lock chambers with water, a reduction in the risk of accidents might be achieved.  However, I understand that most of the drownings have occurred in the main canal channel.</P>
      <P>It has also been suggested that the Waterways Service should erect security fencing around particular stretches of the canal.  However, regardless of the aesthetics etc. of this proposal, experience from abroad has shown that such barriers may be breached and in these circumstances efforts to rescue persons in trouble might prove to be more difficult to achieve.</P>
      <P>I know that the Deputy appreciates that there is no easy resolution of this tragic problem. However, I wish to assure her that the Waterways Service will continue to seek ways to constructively address the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 130, 158 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>My responsibility in regard to genetic engineering relates to implementation of Council Directives 90/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms and 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms to the environment.  These directives have been transposed into national law under the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994, for which the Environmental Protection Agency is the competent authority.</P>
      <P>The fundamental objective of the EU directives and the national regulations is the protection of human health and the environment.  In this regard, the regulations require persons carrying out deliberate releases of genetically modified organisms to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment.  It is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency to assess and determine individual cases, based on the date which must be provided in accordance with the notification requirements set out in Part III of the regulations.  I am satisfied that the agency has the necessary resources to discharge its functions under Part III of the regulations.</P>
      <P>In regard to proposals for consent for the placing on the market of products containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms, the notification requirements under Part C of Directive 90/220/EEC include an assessment of any risk for human health and the environment.  The decision at EU level in May 1996 to grant consent for the marketing of genetically modified soya beans (Glycine max. L) was made in accordance with the notification, assessment and consent provisions of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> It is recognised that the labelling provisions of Directive 90/220/EEC need to be improved.  This requirement is at present being addressed in two ways.  EU Regulation No. 258/97 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients will take over control of many products formerly controlled by Directive 90/220/EEC.  The new regulations will involve explicit requirements on labelling and will come into operation on 15 May 1997. In addition, Directive 90/220/EEC is being amended to provide for more transparent labelling requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory basis for the application of disc parking is currently provided in traffic and parking by-laws made by the Garda Commissioner under sections 89 and 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, following consultation with the relevant local authorities and with my consent.  Under these by-laws, the introduction of disc parking in any area is a matter for the local authority concerned. The charges for parking discs are set down in the by-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 35 and 36 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which I intend to implement this month, provide for the replacement of sections 89 and 90 of the 1961 Act.  Section 36 will allow local authorities to make their own by-laws in relation to paid parking controls generally, including disc parking, without the approval of the Commissioner or the Minister.  This devolution of control is in line with the general policy of extending the discretionary powers of local authorities; it is desirable also, in this case, to give local authorities <Col N="1078" /> maximum freedom, in the exercise of their traffic management and other responsibilities, to determine the level of charges and other conditions which should apply to parking in their areas, having regard to local circumstances.</P>
    <P>At present, rates of charge for disc parking vary widely and it is probable that local authorities wish such variations to continue, having regard to the different circumstances of different areas.  The adoption of a national disc parking scheme, with standard fees, or the introduction of mutual recognition arrangements while maintaining different fee levels, could give rise to significant income losses for some local authorities.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements to be introduced under the Road Traffic Act, 1994, it will be a matter for local authorities generally, or particular groups of authorities, to determine whether or not to introduce greater standardisation in the conditions and charges for disc parking.  A possible alternative, from the point of view of the convenience of motorists, would be the introduction by local authorities of arrangements whereby discs would be more widely available for purchase in their areas, particularly by visitors, singly or from on-street machines; it will be a matter for local authorities to consider this and other possibilities in reviewing their disc parking systems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general responsibility of local authorities for the management of their housing estates includes responsibility for the implementation of improved estate management arrangements, including decisions on the type and level of tenant involvement and on training courses for tenants and local authority staff.  To assist local authorities to improve estate management and to secure greater tenant involvement, the following initiatives have been taken by me and my Department, some of which involve courses for tenants and local authority staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced a new housing management initiatives grant scheme in 1995 to encourage local authorities to develop pilot projects designed to improve housing management and the delivery of a better service to tenants.  In 1995 and 1996, this scheme grant-aided 28 projects related to estate management.  The scheme is being continued in 1997 with an increased allocation <Col N="1081" /> of £200,000 and local authorities have been invited to submit proposals for consideration for funding by 25 April.</P>
    <P>I set up a housing management group last year and its first report contains best practice guidelines on housing management, including the key area of tenant involvement in estate management. Six regional workshops, with more than 100 key housing personnel attending, are now taking place to promote the best practice guidelines.  The implementation of these guidelines by local authorities will help to improve estate management generally and facilitate tenant involvement in the process.  In addition, I have invited each county and city manager to a seminar in the near future to ensure their support for the implementation of the best practice guidelines.</P>
    <P>My Department supports initiatives being undertaken by Area Development Management Limited to develop appropriate training programmes for housing and partnership officials as well as other initiatives in the area of tenant training and empowerment and community development.</P>
    <P>Networking arrangements between local authorities to promote best practice in housing management and tenant participation are being encouraged.  Authorities have been requested to implement a programme of tenant development and information courses for prospective tenants, more particularly those for new local authority housing schemes.</P>

      <P>The conditions governing new house grants normally preclude payment of a grant where the applicant or the spouse of the applicant had previously purchased or built, individually or with each other, another house for his-her occupation.  However, a grant may be allowed where; the marriage of an applicant has been dissolved or annulled by court order, or the applicant is seperated under a court order or a deed of separation; and the applicant and any dependants are in need of housing; and the Minister is satisfied that refusal to pay a grant would cause undue hardship.  Each such application is considered on its merits.</P>

The increase in motor taxation which local authorities will be allowed at their own discretion to implement to finance local services generally in the next two years will not exceed 6 per cent, will have only a minimal impact on any individual motorist and will amount to only a very small proportion of the total cost of maintaining a car.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan (NDP) 1994-99 envisages expenditure of more than £600 million, in 1994 terms on water and sewerage schemes over the period of the Plan.  Just under £500 million of this is to be co-financed from the Cohesion Fund; over £70 million is to be co-financed under the European Regional Development Fund funded Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 and from INTERREG 2; and the balance is to be funded wholly by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The 1997 Water and Sewerage Services Work Programme, announced in February and which is available in the Oireachtas Library, includes over 70 major public water schemes at various stages of planning and construction, with a total estimated cost of £340 million.

      <P>The primary means for enforcing construction standards are the Building Regulations and the related Technical Guidance Documents.  Part D of the First Schedule to the regulations requires the works to which the regulations apply are carried out with proper materials.  For this purpose, proper materials includes materials complying with an appropriate Irish standard or a technical specification from a member state of the European Union which provides an equivalent level of safety and suitability.</P>
      <P>Under EU Law, regulations, public procurement specifications or grant conditions cannot require the exclusive use of reinforcing steel to particular national standard without also permitting the use of reinforcing steel made to an &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; national standard of any other EU member state.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for those designing buildings to specify the quality of reinforcing steel and to require the production of evidence that relevant steel meets the specified quality.  Such evidence may include a third party certificate issued by a national accredited certification body, including the UK Certification Authority for Reinforcing Steels (CARES).</P>
      <P>As the enforcement of the building regulations is primarily a matter for local building control authorities, any representations about the use of sub-standard reinforcing steel on a specific project should be made to the relevant authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's specifications for public water and sewerage schemes and road works call for reinforcing steel to comply with BS 4449 or an &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; standard of a member state of the EU.  It is a matter for the local authority to ensure compliance on site by, for example, demanding production of a certificate of compliance. The conditions for payment of the first <Col N="1093" /> time buyers' grant; £3,000, include a requirement that new houses comply with the building regulations.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which the public was advised or warned about ozone levels in order that vulnerable members of the population could refrain from exposing themselves to these adverse conditions in view of the fact that the ozone levels in Cork were greater than EU limits for the protection of public health on 23 days in 1995; and the contacts, if any, there have been with relevant health authorities to conduct epidemiological studies on the increase in cataracts and respiratory problems, which are expected due to elevated ozone levels.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Directive 92/72/EEC, on air pollution by ozone, requires the establishment of an ozone monitoring network and public information system in each member state.  In Ireland, a network of six stations, including one at Glashaboy in County Cork, is managed by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The public information procedures, operated with the assistance of Met Eireann, are in line with the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> The directive establishes three graded thresholds for ozone concentrations relative to effects on human health and vegetation.  Public information requirements are triggered by two of these thresholds, a &ldquo;public information threshold&rdquo; of 180 micrograms of ozone per cubic metre of air (ug/m³) and a &ldquo;public warning threshold&rdquo; of 360 ug/m³, both measured for a mean value over one hour.  No public information measures are required for exceedances of the lower threshold of 110 ug/m³, for a mean value over eight hours.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency recorded 23 days on which the lower threshold of 110 ug/m³ was exceeded at Glashaboy; these partly overlap with some eight exceedances of the 180 ug/m³ theshold, the highest of these recording 230 ug/m³.  In relation to these and other exceedences, the appropriate public information arrangements were implemented.</P>
    <P>Overall ozone monitoring results for Ireland in 1995 have been analysed in a published Environmental Protection Agency report.  This concludes that the concentrations recorded in summer 1995 are probably the highest that have been recorded in Ireland; and that they give a good indication of the maximum ozone levels attainable in this country at current NO x and VOC emission rates.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency consider however that these ozone concentrations are not very high if compared with the levels experienced in the worst affected parts of Europe.  In the circumstances it does not appear that special epidemiological studies would be warranted at this stage.</P>

      <P>There is no record in my Department of a proposal for a group water scheme at Clogher, Ballyshannon.</P>
      <P>As already announced, responsibility for the administration of the group schemes programme has been devolved to the local authorities, subject to existing commitments on foot of approvals issued by my Department.  Where schemes have already been approved, such as the Rath-Lisminton scheme, the local authority will issue the grant allocation to the groups as soon as possible.  Block grant allocations notified to local authorities on 26 March take into account the commitments made, including £142,000 for this scheme.  In addition, an European Regional Development Fund co-financed grant of £100,000 has been approved for the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185, 186 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>Consulting engineers have been appointed by the Northern Ireland Roads Service, acting on behalf of a joint North-South Project Board, to prepare a feasibility report on Alternative Road Options for the Newry Dundalk cross-Border Route.  The work is being carried out in two phases.  The first phase, completed in July 1996, examined a number of options, including the upgrading of the existing road, and an interim report identified three possible routes as warranting further examination.  Those route options were the subject of public consultation aimed at eliciting the preliminary views of the public on the major issues they see as important on the corridors identified.  This exercise was not part of, and does not prejudice, the normal statutory process to which any emerging scheme will be subjected.</P>
      <P>The second phase is still under way.  This is examining and identifying options in greater detail and it is anticipated that the study will culminate in the recommendation of a route corridor for further detailed investigation.  The study report, which will be accompanied by 1:2,500 scale maps of the routes and more detailed, 1:500 scale, maps at appropriate locations, mainly junctions, will, in the event of a scheme proceeding, be published.  Any such scheme will be subject to the normal statutory processes to both jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The capacity of the Newry by-pass is not a consideration in the study.  The northern limit of the study area is the new terminal roundabout on the southern end of the Newry by-pass at Cloghoge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Demographic trends indicate that the number of pupils attending first and second level schools will decline significantly in the period up to 2006.  This pattern is already evident at first level, where enrolments fell by around 11,000 in the current school year and by over 23,000 since the 1994-95 school year.  Although the rate of retention to leaving certificate is expected to increase further, projections indicate that enrolments at second level have reached a peak in the current school year and will decline thereafter.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that resources becoming available due to the projected drop in enrolments will be redistributed to meet the objectives and recommendations contained in the White Paper on Education.</P>
      <P>Since taking up office, I have targeted surplus teaching posts to effect improvements within the primary system generally by lowering the pupil teacher ratio, by reducing maximum class sizes and by directing resources specifically towards pupils with special needs and in disadvantaged areas.  While I am anxious to continue to utilise surplus posts in this manner, I will of course obtain the views of the education partners before final decisions are made.</P>
      <P>Within the national trend, different patterns of change in enrolment levels may occur in individual school areas.  Such local variations have implications for the extent and timing of the provision of new and improved school accommodation. There will be a continuing need for significant capital investment in school buildings to maintain progress in eliminating substandard accommodation. New and extended school facilities will also be required in areas experiencing population growth, to meet the needs of the multi-denominational and gaelscoileanna sectors and to provide for curriculum expansion and development, particularly at second level.  Rationalisation options will be examined before new buildings are provided, as is the case at present.</P>
      <P>The Commission on School Accommodation Needs, which I established last year, will recommend criteria and procedures for school planning and provision, having regard to such factors as demographic change and the need for plurality within the system.</P>

      <Quest>if she will consider the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 6W who wishes to purchase pension rights for two years of incremental service at the same rate as other teachers who remained at home but did not join the scheme, as is allowed under the revised Programme for Competitiveness and Work proposals for teachers and the current APSO programme.</Quest>

      <P>The revised proposals for agreement on the pay and conditions of teachers under Clause 2 (iii) of Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> include a proposal for the purchase for superannuation purposes of incremental service given to teachers when they were eligible to join the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme but did not do so.  The proposal provides for the purchase of such service at the normal contribution rate of 6.5 per cent &mdash; 5 per cent for teachers who are not members of the spouses' scheme.  The proposal is confined to actual incremental service given in schools in this country and would not apply to the purchase for superannuation purposes of any other service.</P>
      <P>It is possible for teachers on voluntary service abroad with APSO to have up to two years of such service given after 1 January 1995 made reckonable for superannuation purposes subject to payment of contributions at a rate of 18? per cent &mdash; 15? per cent for a teacher who is not a member of the spouses' scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a scheme for the purchase of notional service.  This scheme enables teachers to voluntarily purchase additional years for the calculation of superannuation benefits.  It is open to any member of the relevant superannuation scheme to apply for the purchase of notional service at the appropriate rates.</P>

      <P>Under the 1996 higher education grants scheme, independent mature students are defined to be mature students who are not ordinarily resident at home with their parents.  Their entitlement to a grant is assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>The address of independent mature students for the purpose of determining the rate of grant payable is their residence for the purpose of attending college.  If this address is 15 miles or less from the college, the adjacent rate of grant is payable.  If the address is more than 15 miles from the college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable.</P>
      <P>Where independent mature students can produce evidence that they are maintaining a residence, other than their address while attending college and the non-college residence is more than 15 miles from the college, the local authority can regard that address as the student's normal residence and award a non-adjacent maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation, the body statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme, that the student in question is an independent mature student whose residence is within 15 miles of the college attended.  The student in question is therefore only entitled to the adjacent rate of maintenance grant.</P>

      <P>My Department is aware of the survey referred to by the Deputy, which highlighted concerns regarding the mechanical safety of the buses used under the school transport scheme, and double tripping on school bus routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that safety standards of vehicles for school transport is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann, who operate the scheme on its behalf. All school transport vehicles operated by Bus Éireann and private contractors are subject to an annual roadworthiness check.  Regular inspections are carried out to ensure that their reliability is maintained throughout the year.  All <Col N="1115" /> vehicles in the scheme are fully compliant with Department of Environment legislation.</P>
    <P>The standard of vehicles used in school transport is subject to Bus Éireann's policy of continuous fleet replacement.  Three replacement buses have been introduced on the route in question over the past year or so.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient and cost effective manner, individual vehicles are often required to operate a double trip.  The services operating to the post-primary centre in question generally operate on a first-in first-home arrangement, and the travelling and waiting times for the pupils in this instance are within my Department's guidelines.  Accordingly, I am satisfied with the current arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>When granting an order of judicial separation the judge can make a number of different orders in relation to the family home.  For example, under section 10 of the Family Law Act, 1995 the judge can make an order granting sole rights of residence in the family home to one spouse to the exclusion of the other spouse.  The judge can also make a barring order against either spouse.</P>
      <P>Court records are not maintained in a way which would provide statistics on the number of cases in which rights of sole occupancy in the family home were granted to one spouse.  However, statistics which are available on the number of judicial separations granted by the Circuit Court and the High Court and on the number of barring orders granted by the Circuit Court for recent years are given below.  It is not possible to say how many of these barring orders were granted to women or how many were granted in the course of judicial separations proceedings.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the judge concerned having heard the facts of each case and considered all other relevant information including the circumstances of the parties involved to decide whether or not to make an order in favour of either spouse granting him-her sole residency in the family home.  It is also for the judge to decide if the circumstances of the case warrant the granting of a barring order against either spouse.  No research has been carried out by my Department into the whereabouts of the excluded-barred spouse following the making of such orders and it has no information on the number of persons who may have become homeless as a result thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the constitutionality of legislative provisions is a matter for the courts and one in which I have no function, I am aware that in the case of T.F. <i>v.</i> Ireland the Attorney General and M. F., the constitutionality of section 16 (a) of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which gave the court a power, similar to that in section 10 (1) (a) of the Family Law Act, 1995, on the granting of a decree of judicial separation <Col N="1117" /> to make an order granting sole occupancy of the family home to one spouse to the exclusion of the other spouse, was challenged, and that the <Col N="1118" /> Supreme Court held that that power did not constitute an unjust attack on the property rights of the other spouse.</P>

      <P>The current recruitment competition covers the period of 31 December 1997.  A total of 600 trainees are scheduled to be admitted to the garda college in four quarterly intakes this year and these are all being recruited from the current competition.</P>
      <P>The Government recently approved the holding of a new garda recruitment competition in 1997 to cover the three year period 1998 to 2000, inclusive.  It is expected that this competition, which will be conducted by the Civil Service Commission, will be advertised in the near future.</P>
      <P>Recruitment to An Garda Síochána is governed by the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988.  These regulations lay down the criteria for admission to the Force and have been applied to all garda recruitment competitions since 1988.  The minimum height requirements prescribed in the regulations are five feet nine inches and five feet five inches for men and women, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> Section 17B of the Employment Equality Act, 1977 (as inserted by the European Communities (Employment Equality) Regulations, 1985) permits the application of different height requirements for men and women for the purposes of garda recruitment.  The Employment Equality Bill also makes provision for the application of differing height criteria for men and women for this purpose but further provides that the criteria chosen must be such that the proportion of women in the State likely to meet the criterion for women is approximately the same as the proportion of men likely to meet the criterion for men.</P>
    <P>I do not regard the use of minimum height requirements as being discriminatory.  They arise from the particular nature of the employment and the height differential between the sexes is not contrary to equality legislation.</P>

      <Quest>the number, names and addresses of District Court clerks assigned during the month of December 1996; the reason they were assigned; whether any of the individuals concerned had signed summonses prior to being assigned; whether any member of the public had been convicted on foot of such summonses; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Section 48 (1) of the Court Officers Act, 1926 provides for the assignment of District Court clerks by the Minister for Justice.  It had not been the practice in my Department to formally assign all District <Col N="1120" /> Court clerks to the area which they served on the basis of legal advice received and a High Court decision made in July 1983 to the effect that such assignments were not necessary in all cases.</P>
      <P>Following a related matter being raised in Ballina District Court in a case in December 1996 where the validity of a summons was challenged, on the grounds that the person signing summonses had not been formally appointed as a District Court clerk it was decided, in order to remove any doubts, to formally assign, as a matter of routine, all District Court clerks.  In December 1996 a number of formal assignments were made where clerks had been properly appointed but not formally assigned or where there had been changes in the District Court areas which they serve.  It is now practice in my Department to make a formal assignment of District Court clerks on appointment or transfer as as well as formal appointment.</P>
      <P>In a case raised in Wexford in March 1997 which relates to the assignment of a properly appointed District Court clerk the court dismissed a number of summonses.  In that case I understand that a Notice of Appeal by way of case stated to the High Court has been lodged by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of staff time and costs to establish details of summonses issued by the District Court clerks in question which could only be ascertained by the examination of individual court files.  Nor would it be appropriate for me to comment on any matter in connection with the issue of summonses or conviction on foot of summonses where there are legal issues involved.</P>
      <P>Assignments of individual District Court clerks in December were as follows:</P>

This meeting took place on 4 April 1997 at the Sisters of Charity Convent, which is located close to Seville Place.  Five members of the local clergy and religious attended the meeting along with the Garda Superintendent and the Garda juvenile liaison officer for the area.

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at the maximum rate <Col N="1125" /> from February 1991.  It came to attention during 1996 that she is employed by the local health board as a home help since April 1991.  Following investigation her claim was disallowed from 30 October 1996 on the grounds that she is not unemployed and not available for work.</P>
      <P>An appeal against that decision was made to the independent social welfare appeals office on 6 November 1996.  An oral hearing of the appeal took place in Ballina on 13 March 1997.  The appeal was disallowed on the grounds that she was not unemployed.  Notification of the appeals officer's decision was issued to the person concerned on 8 April 1997.  In view of the circumstances of the employment my Department will be in touch with the person concerned to see whether there is scope for a change in her current working arrangements which would enable her claim for unemployment assistance to be reassessed.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks each year from mid-October to mid-April and this has been the case since the rationalisation of the urban and national fuel schemes in 1988.</P>
      <P>An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week was introduced in October 1990 to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas. This was later extended to Cork city and adjacent areas to coincide with the ban on the sale of bituminous coal which came into effect there on 13 February 1995.</P>

      <P>The free schemes, including the free telephone rental allowance and the free television licence, are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65, whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes, retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were extended in July 1996 to low-income pensioners who were not in receipt of a social welfare type payment.  The weekly income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age (contributory) pension, currently £75 per week, plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.  The estimated additional annual cost of extending the two schemes in question to all widowed persons in receipt of a social welfare payment, regardless of their age or household composition circumstances, is £4.5 million in respect of the free television licence and £11.6 million in respect of the free telephone rental allowance.  A further 69,820 recipients would be entitled to the free television licence and a further 71,200 recipients to the free telephone rental allowance.</P>
      <P>The estimated costs of the two schemes in question, together with number of recipients, for each of the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 is as follows:</P>

      <P>A six weeks payment after death is payable in circumstances where both spouses have a separate entitlement provided one or both of the entitlements is a non-contributory old age pension, <Col N="1127" /> a blind pension or a carer's allowance.  The payment does not arise where each spouse has an independent entitlement to an insurance-based contributory pension.  Extension of the payment to these categories would cost in the region of £1 million per annum and could be considered only in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>the reason there is a lower age limit for the student summer jobs scheme, the consequence of which is that a number of students who have completed a year in third-level education are not entitled to participate on this scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The student summer jobs scheme was originally introduced to provide income support for third level students who were debarred from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months.  To qualify for unemployment assistance a person had to be 18 years of age and consequently this became the lower age limit for participation in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Up to last year a student, in order to qualify for the scheme, had to have reached 18 on or before 1 June.  However, following representations made to me that this requirement was precluding students who reached that age during the summer months from taking part in the scheme, I decided that students who attained 18 years during the duration of the scheme, i.e., by 31 August 1996 could qualify.  It is estimated that this change allowed about 60 more students to participate in the 1996 scheme.  The same rule will apply again this year, and, accordingly, any student who reaches the age of 18 years prior to 31 August 1997 and who satisfies the means test for eligibility and all other requirements of the scheme will be allowed to take part in the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if he will raise substantially the level of savings to be excluded from calculation of a means test in relation to a non-contributory old age pension; if he will put in place a realistic figure of interest rate returns on savings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The means tests used to determine entitlement to all social assistance payments include an assessment of the value of any capital <Col N="1128" /> or investments which the applicant may have. Different methods of assessment have been applied in the case of the various social assistance schemes.  For example, for non-contributory old age pension purposes an initial disregard of £200 is currently allowed, the next £375 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent, while for unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance purposes, the first £400 is assessed at 5 per cent and capital in excess of this amount is assessed at 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new disability allowance payment in October 1996 and the one-parent family payment in January this year provided me with the opportunity to commence the process of standardising the provisions for the assessment of capital across all of the various social assistance schemes on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>Under these new arrangements the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000, if any, is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>The recently enacted Social Welfare Act, 1997 provides for an extension of these revised capital assessment provisions to apply to non-contributory old age pensioners and also to recipients of pre-retirement allowance, carer's allowance, blind person's pension, widow's and the new widower's non-contributory pension.  In view of the substantial numbers of recipients affected, the revised provisions will come into effect from October this year.</P>
      <P>The substantial £2,000 initial disregard under the new arrangements will significantly reduce the effective interest rates for most recipients and will mean that claimants, in general, are not effectively assessed at 7.5 per cent until their level of capital approaches £25,000.</P>
      <P>These new arrangements also mean that single old age non-contributory pensioners will qualify for the maximum rate of payment where they have capital of up to £6,160.  The equivalent amount of capital for a couple will be £12,320, i.e., an increase of £6,345 on the existing provisions. An old age non-contributory pensioner will still qualify for a reduced rate pension where he or she has capital of up to £35,500 in the case of single person, or £71,100 in the case of a couple.</P>

      <P>To qualify for payment of disability benefit a person must satisfy certain conditions.  One of the requirements is that the person must have at least 13 paid contributions in the recent contribution year.</P>
      <P>According to the records of my Department, the person concerned last paid contributions in the 1982-83 contribution year.  She cannot, therefore, be considered for payment of disability benefit.</P>
      <P>A person who does not satisfy the contribution conditions for social insurance payments may apply for a social assistance payment where they are in financial need.  The relevant schemes in this case would be either supplementary welfare allowance, or, in a case of long-term incapacity for work, disability allowance.  A new means tested scheme &mdash; sickness allowance &mdash; will be introduced in October 1997 to cater for people who do not qualify for disability benefit.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to January 1994 when she commenced work on a community employment scheme.  She transferred to the job initiative scheme in November 1996.</P>
      <P>The social welfare legislation which prevailed at that time provided that continued child payment was payable only to persons who had been in receipt of an unemployment payment immediately before taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The legislation has now been amended and persons who take up employment immediately after participation in a community employment scheme are eligible for continued child payment.</P>
      <P>The continued child payment may also be paid to eligible customers moving from community employment to job initiative.  Arrangements are now being made to have any arrears of continued child payment due paid in this case.  The person concerned was in receipt of family income supplement for the period in question and, as this supplement is not payable in the ordinary course until entitlement to continued child payment ceases, the arrears will comprise the difference between the two rates of payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The community employment programme is targeted at a particular severely disadvantaged group of unemployed people, i.e. those registered long-term unemployed whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment. Limited resources, unfortunately, do not make it possible to provide CE for all unemployed people.  It is necessary, therefore, to target the programme at those most in need.  The eligibility criteria for CE is in my view a fair, objective and cost effective way of achieving that target.</P>
      <P>CE consists of two distinct options &mdash; the integration option and the part-time job option.  Both men and women, married or single who fulfil any of the following eligibility criteria can participate on CE:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Part-Time Integration Option</i>
      </P>
      <P>&mdash; Those aged 21 years or over and on unemployment benefit (UB), unemployment assistance (UA) or one parent family payment (OPFP) for at least 12 months</P>
      <P>&mdash; Special categories such as those referred by the NRB, or travellers on the live register, or on one parent family payment (OPFP) for at least 12 months.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Part-Time Job Option</i>
      </P>
      <P>&mdash; Those aged 35 years or over and in receipt of unemployment assistance (UA), unemployment benefit (UB) or one parent family payment (OPFP) for three years or longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; Special categories such as those referred to by the NRB who are aged 35 or over, or travellers who are on the live register or <Col N="1133" /> on one parent family payment (OPFP) for at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>In addition, married unemployed people can swop their social welfare entitlement in order to qualify for participation on the programme.  In this way, a married person who meets the eligibility criteria can transfer entitlement to his or her spouse, who is unemployed but not on the live register, in order for that person to qualify for participation on CE.  Also, persons with children who are in receipt of survivor's contributory pension or deserted wives benefit can apply to transfer to one parent family payment in order to become eligible to participate in CE.  These eligibility criteria only came into effect last year following a detailed review of CE and in response to the recommendations of the task force on long-term unemployment.  They were designed to target the programme at those priority groups already referred to.  I have no plans at present to widen the eligibility criteria.  However, I do of course keep all programmes under constant scrutiny in so far as their objectives and effectiveness are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that all unemployed people, including married women, are eligible to participate in FÁS mainstream training-specific skills training programmes.  Also from time to time FÁS offer return to work courses for women who wish to return to the workforce.</P>

      <Quest>when the proposed prompt payment legislation will be published; and if he will ensure that this legislation is extended to include the private sector and, in particular, small firms who are finding it extremely difficult to continue in business and whose only course of action is through the courts, which they cannot afford.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prompt Payment of Accounts Bill, 1997 was published on Friday last, 11 April and, hopefully, will progress through both this House and the Seanad without delay.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure the prompt payment of amounts due to suppliers of goods and services by public sector purchasers and by contractors on public sector contracts.</P>
      <P>While the Bill applies primarily to public sector purchasers, all suppliers to the public sector, including small business suppliers, will benefit from the legislation.</P>
      <P>A key provision of the Bill is an automatic entitlement to interest in respect of the late payments. Any interest due cannot be waived and must be paid without any demand for its payment being made by the supplier.  This provision will be of particular benefit to small business who might otherwise be reluctant to pursue their interest entitlements for fear of possibly jeopardising future contracts.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not generally apply to private sector purchasers.  However, private contractors on public sector contracts will be obliged to comply with the payment provisions of the Bill, so as to ensure that the benefits flowing to main contractors from being paid on time by the public sector bodies will be passed on, in turn, to their suppliers.  Again, this provision will be of significant advantage to small business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not, for the present at least, propose to extend the legislation to cover other private sector purchasers.  My views on this issue concur with those of the task force on small business which reported in 1994.  The task force recommended the introduction of legislation in the public sector, in the first instance, with the position being reviewed three years later to ascertain the merits or otherwise of introducing similar legislation in the private sector.  I am committed to instigating such a review three years after the current legislation has been implemented.  The review will, <i>inter alia</i>, examine the effectiveness of the existing voluntary codes of payment practice in the <Col N="1135" /> private sector and take on board the experience gained following the introduction of prompt payment legislation in the public sector.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to readaptation aid payable, under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty, to 209 former Irish Steel workers made redundant in 1994, 1995 and early 1996 under the 1994 Irish Steel restructuring plan.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the European Commission approved, in December 1995 and November 1996, the provision of readaptation aid of 627,000 ECU to 209 former Irish Steel workers. This funding has recently been received by my Department from the European Commission and arrangements are currently being made to issue payments to the former workers as soon as possible. Each former worker will receive 3,000 ECU which, using the appropriate exchange rate, amounts to IR£2,175.80.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated to the House, the provision of additional matching funding from the State does not arise in relation to this EU readaptation aid.  The extra-statutory redundancy payments received by the former workers constitute the matching funding and this has been accepted by the EU Commission.  On the previous occasion that readaptation aid was paid to former Irish Steel workers by the EU Commission in 1985, the extra-statutory redundancy payments received by the workers made redundant also constituted the matching funding.</P>

      <P>The Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, governs the opening hours of retail establishments. The Act provided for a ban on Sunday trading for most shops but gave the Minister power by order to add to the list of exempted businesses, or to exempt specified regions from the provisions of the Act.  However, an order made later that year exempted the whole country from the provisions of the Act and effectively removed all restrictions on Sunday trading.  This remains the position to the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> The 1938 Act was enacted for the primary purpose of regulating competition.  Therefore any justification for the reintroduction of the legislation to ban even limited types of Sunday trading would have to be based first and foremost on competition considerations.  I do not think that such considerations arise at present.</P>
    <P>Sunday opening is commonplace in Ireland. Examples include hotel and catering, entertainment, continuous process, industrial, the health service and security services, newspapers, broadcasting etc., where a considerable variety of employments are represented.  Legally, it is not possible to selectively ban Sunday trading for large shops.  A sector-wide ban on Sunday trading in the retail sector would adversely affect small shops.  It is not the intention of the Government to close small family shops, garages, 24-hour shops and shops which traditionally open on Sunday.</P>
    <P>The issue of Sunday working is dealt with under the Organisation of Working Time Bill which has been cleared by the Dáil and will go before the Seanad in the next few weeks.  The legislation proposes a range of health and safety protections for employees on rest and maximum weekly working time.  In particular it proposes that employees will be entitled to a minimum weekly rest period which shall include Sunday, unless otherwise provided in an employee's contract of employment.  This is the first time that the special position of Sunday as the traditional day of rest has been recognised in legislation.  In addition, the Government has accepted a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill making Sunday working optional for employees of retail stores.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the independent evaluation of the headage scheme was completed in July 1995 and the evaluators came up with broad recommendations as follows: bias the scheme towards producers who have the capacity to develop; reallocate some funds to capital investment/rural development measures; adjust the payment structure by e.g. imposing an upper ceiling on payments, changing the rates, disallowing farmers over 66 years of age, introducing a household income; take action in relation to overgrazing; and consolidate the schemes into a single payment.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of the report, I put a number of proposals to the European Commission to provide for amendments to the scheme in 1997 and following years.  The intention was that two of the proposals (i) implementing a ceiling of £3,000 on payments to individual farmers and (ii) reducing the higher rate of grant for Friesian cows and in-calf heifers would come into effect in 1997 and the remaining two in 1998 &mdash; (iii) disallowing headage payments to farmers over 66 in receipt of a non-means tested retirement pension and (iv) paying headage to farmers in areas designated as degraded under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) only if they were participating in REPS.</P>
      <P>As part of Partnership 2000, it was provided that proposals (ii), (iii) and (iv) would come into effect from 1 January 1998 and that proposal (i) would also come into effect on that date unless agreement was reached between the Government and the farm organisations early in 1997 on a workable alternative which did not involve exceeding the total OPARDF allocation for compensatory allowances.  I have not yet received any submissions in that regard from the farm organisations. Formal negotiations with the Commission services have commenced on the four proposals but I am not yet in a position to indicate when this process will be completed.</P>

      <P>The property in question, consisting of 58.65 hectares, was originally owned by the forest service and was sold by the Department of Energy which at the time had statutory responsibility for forestry matters, in December 1991.  The <Col N="1141" /> property had been retained by the Department of Energy following the establishment of Coillte Teoranta because of its substantial reserves of sand and gravel.  Prior to the sale detailed assessments on the property were carried out by the Geological Survey of Ireland and by independent consultants to evaluate a fair market price for the property.</P>
      <P>In April 1990 the independent consultants suggested that the Department of Energy might be best advised to invite offers by tender for the sale of the land.  However, following an offer for the property by the first company mentioned by the Deputy, the consultants subsequently advised in October 1990 that it would be most unlikely that any other party would be able to match an offer from that company and strongly recommended that the sale to the company be pursued.  The then Minister for Energy accepted that advice and the land was not advertised for public sale. The Minister was aware that there had been an expression of interest from the second company mentioned by the Deputy.  While negotiations on the sale of the property to the first company were in progress, the second company made an offer for the property but that offer was significantly lower than that of the first company and was not therefore accepted.  On the basis of advice available to him, the Minister was satisfied that, if the land were put on the market, it would most likely fail to reach the price on offer from the first company. In accordance with the guidelines on the disposal of Government property where a sale is not conducted by public tender or auction, the approval of the Department of Finance was sought and obtained before the offer by the first company was accepted.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it appropriate to divulge the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the contract of sale.  A felling licence was issued to the purchasing company in January 1992. While there was no specific reference to planning permission in the licence, the purchasing company had been informed in a letter of December 1991 that a felling licence would issue to facilitate the extraction of sand and gravel provided such activities complied with the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts 1963-90.  In this case as in all other cases, the grant of a felling licence did not exempt the licensee from compliance with relevant planning legislation.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the circumstances of the case, the then Minister was satisfied that the State received a fair price for the sale of the property.</P>

      <P>Genetically engineered foods have been on world markets for many years.

It is likely to make a significant impact on agriculture and food production over the coming years.</P>
      <P>An innovatory agriculture and food sector, in order to remain competitive, must in the long-term be open to the opportunities provided by such technology which of course must be used responsibly under proper regulatory control.

      <P>I have, on a number of occasions, indicated my support for any initiative which would lead to the allocation of additional quota to milk producers in the Border counties.</P>
      <P>This matter has been discussed between officials of my Department, the United Kingdom's Ministry for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.  I also raised this matter directly with the UK Minister for Agriculture and I have also met the Cross-Border Milk Quota Action Group.</P>
      <P>However, the success of an initiative of this nature will be dependent not only on the circumstances and timing of its presentation at EU level, but also, of course, on the position taken by the United Kingdom authorities.</P>

      <P>The land parcel identification system (LPIS) involves digitising of all land parcels on maps submitted by farmers and its purpose is to provide my Department with a database whereby land parcels being claimed for area aid purposes can be located, identified, and have area values and land use attributed.  Furthermore, the system ensures that parcels of land are not overclaimed by farmers or that the same parcel is not claimed by more than one farmer in any given year.  In a minority of cases certain problems have arisen under this system in identifying all of the land parcels being claimed.  In some cases there are apparent overlaps between parcels being claimed by two or more farmers and in other cases the area aid application form was not fully completed which led to difficulties in validating parcels being claimed against maps supplied.  These difficulties did not delay the making of advance payments in respect of 1996 schemes but are delaying the making of balancing payments to certain farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is making every effort, including making contact with farmers in many cases, to have the outstanding problems sorted out with <Col N="1146" /> a view to issuing outstanding balancing payments at the earliest opportunity.</P>

In future the Agriculture Directorate will be responsible for legislation whereas the Consumer Affairs Directorate will be responsible for inspections.

      <P>As the Deputy will know, international agreements make it obligatory for countries which lie within a certain geographic <Col N="1149" /> range of each other to agree, beforehand, the precise use of proposed frequencies for broadcasting. This process is known as the co-ordination of frequency usage.  The objective is to minimise the scope for interference to a transmitting station which might otherwise be caused by transmissions in another jurisdiction.  Therefore, agreement must be reached between my Department and the UK Radiocommunications Agency with regard to the frequency referred to by the Deputy.  Negotiations are ongoing and I am hopeful that the matter will be resolved in the near future.</P>

      <P>In addition to basic pay, Permanent Defence Force personnel serving in Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £50.07 per week in the case of officers and £44.91 per week in the case of non-commissioned officers and Privates.  A military service allowance is also payable to all members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of Colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to serve in all conditions.  The current rate in the case of officers is £2,091 per annum, and in the case of non-commissioned officers and Privates is <Col N="1152" /> £40.08 per week &mdash; £2,091 per annum &mdash; with the exception of Privates with less than three years' service who receive £14.43 per week.  These allowances are paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, including periods of annual leave, sick leave, etc.</P>
      <P>The rates of remuneration of the Permanent Defence Force, including military service allowance and Border duty allowance, were determined by the Gleeson Commission in 1990.  The Commission expressly stated its conclusion that military duties were clearly in a distinctive category and that it would not be appropriate to fix military pay on the basis of a direct comparison with the pay of gardaí.</P>
      <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990, the payment of allowances comes within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association and may be processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the association.  The question of the payment of allowances to personnel involved with the BSE-related operations in Border areas has been raised by the association under the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the association, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential.  You will appreciate, therefore, that as the matter is under active consideration at present it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>The sale of B &amp; I to the Irish Continental Group plc. in early 1992 was the subject of a share purchase agreement, the contents of which cannot be disclosed for reasons of commercial confidentiality.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage of the B &amp; I Line Bill, 1991 the then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications informed the House that his Department had signed an agreement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the B &amp; I Unions on matters relating to the sale of B &amp; I to Irish Continental Group.  He placed that agreement on the record of the House on 17 December 1991 as reported in Volume 414 No. 8, columns 1681-1683.</P>
      <P>In 1994, functional responsibility for matters arising generally in relation to international ferries was formally transferred from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to the Minister for the Marine.  Since then, successive Ministers have, in the context of what I consider to be the Department's brief to develop supportive and sustainable frameworks for the Irish shipping sector, endeavoured to determine how various expressed concerns arising from the privatisation of B &amp; I might best be met.  I am satisfied in this regard that everything realistically possible and feasible has been and will continue to be done.</P>
      <P>In the context of the frameworks mentioned above, over the past number of years I have been reviewing ways in which the operating climate for the shipping sector can be enhanced to support the objectives of increased employment, improved services, standards modernisation and the ability to compete of the Irish-registered fleet including Irish Ferries vessels.  The strategic objective, in line with overall EU objectives, has been to ensure that Irish shipping companies meet international competition under comparable cost conditions and to stem flagging out from the Irish register of flags of convenience where costs are considerably less.</P>
      <P>The intention has been to ensure the maintenance and creation of employment in the sector and to facilitate productive investment to modernise and expand the fleet.</P>

    <P>In sum, the Department is now (i) seeking to make the recruitment or maintenance in employment of Irish seafarers more attractive to Irish shipping operators, thereby maintaining-increasing the number of Irish seafarers on Irish flagged vessels; (ii) trying to make the Irish flag more competitive, thereby promoting employment in Ireland via maintaining vessels under the Irish flag and attracting non-Irish shipowners to locate in Ireland; (iii) attempting to &ldquo;level the playing pitch&rdquo;<i>vis-á-vis</i> other low labour cost EU and non-EU competitors, thereby enhancing the competitiveness <Col N="1155" /> of Irish operators who employ Irish crews; (iv) trying over the long run to increase the pool of maritime expertise in Ireland, thereby stimulating an increase in marine-based activities and in general, in the development and exploitation of our extensive offshore and coastal marine resource and (v) attempting to increase the quality and attractiveness of seafaring to young Irish men and women.</P>
    <P>To this end, certain important measures have been put in place in the context of this ongoing policy orientation and other measures are being considered.  Among these measures are (i) amendments in the Finance Act, 1996 aimed at <Col N="1156" /> stimulating activity through facilitating tax-based leasing by Irish operators; (ii) a shipboard subsidy scheme for marine cadets studying at Cork regional technical college; (iii) the refund of employer PRSI in respect of seafarers engaged on certain Irish-owned or operated merchant shipping vessels which qualify for a reduced rate of corporation profits tax under the Finance Acts; and (iv) possible special concessionary income tax scheme for Irish seafarers working on Irish-owned or operated merchant shipping vessels.</P>
    <P>The above policy and the measures taken under it are intended <i>inter alia</i>, to maintain a strong, vibrant and efficient Irish ferries sector, employing Irish personnel to the greatest extent possible.</P>
