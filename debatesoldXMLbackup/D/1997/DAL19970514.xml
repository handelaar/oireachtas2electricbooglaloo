      <P>There are five matters to put before the House.  Is the proposal for a late sitting tonight satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister for Finance has published the ICC Bank (Amendment) Bill. This is enabling legislation and is due to be taken tomorrow.  However, due to other events which may take place tomorrow that Bill may not be processed through the House.  If the Minister wishes to put it through today I am sure the Whips could come to an agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation will be taken tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach going to keep us here the whole day?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 26 agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 9 agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 10 agreed? Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 2 agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We should record the generosity of our Finance spokesperson who wished to give the Bill a hearing today if there was not time for it tomorrow and thank him for clarifying the Taoiseach's intentions as to the exact time we will break up tomorrow.</P>
      <P>During Taoiseach's Question Time yesterday, the Taoiseach told Deputy Ahern he had spoken to the British Prime Minister about the case of Róisín McAliskey.  He said he did not have the up to date position as of yesterday but that he had raised the matter.  The House was glad to hear that.  In the light of allegations and revelations from a former prisons Minister about how her superior, the former Home Secretary Michael Howard, ran the UK prison service, as a matter of urgency would the Taoiseach again take up the case of Róisín McAliskey in whom it was alleged Mr. Howard took a personal and vindictive interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since yesterday, I received a detailed report from a member of the Irish Embassy staff who visited Róisín McAliskey in recent days.  The report is generally positive in terms of her position but the Government remains concerned about her health and wishes <Col N="495" /> to ensure that everything is done medically and psychologically to assist her at this important time in her life, the birth of a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's interest is appreciated by the House.  However, this raises a further question, namely, the handling of the prisoners issue by the former Home Secretary. Would the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste raise the matter through the Anglo-Irish conference or in a more immediate way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated yesterday that this is a matter that ought to be looked at.  There are constitutional obstacles to some of the things that one might wish to do in this area but there is no commitment other than to look at the matter in a serious and open minded way.  It deserves to be looked at because of the changes in trading patterns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter raised by the deputy leader of my party, the Taoiseach will be well aware that our law prevents anybody from being extradited merely for questioning.  That is what is happening to Róisín McAliskey who is being held in a British jail and is wanted for questioning by the German authorities.  On the second last day of this Dáil, will the Taoiseach with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs take the opportunity to contact the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister and ask that Róisín McAliskey be either charged or released rather than subjecting her to ongoing victimisation in holding her in jail pending extradition for questioning? That is not allowed here in the case of an Irish citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to rule rigidly on the matter.  If the Taoiseach wishes to intervene, he may do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction between the administration of a prison regime, a matter for which there is political responsibility, and decisions in regard to the handling of prosecutions. It is important that, where political responsibility is exercised in another jurisdiction, we should make representations for the most humane treatment possible of Irish people in that situation.  As the House knows well, in this jurisdiction it is important that decisions about prosecutions should be made independently of the political process.  I regard that as a sound principle for all jurisdictions in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have a timescale in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware of the excellent reports published yesterday by Aer Rianta, the management and staff of which have to be congratulated on having had a very successful year.  The Taoiseach will be aware also of the views and concerns expressed by the chairman <Col N="496" /> and chief executive of the company about the abolition of duty free sales and the effect this will have on employment and fares for the travelling public.  As the Government failed to place this item on the agenda when it held the Presidency of the European Union, will the Taoiseach assure the House that he will take action immediately at EU level to ensure duty free sales will continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter that might be raised at a more appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that it was the leader of the Deputy's party who allowed this proposal to become European Union policy at the European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach never raised the matter during the six month period when Ireland held the EU Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact to which I refer, the Deputy's attempt to make a political issue out of the matter is not creditworthy.  The Minister for Finance is seriously concerned about the matter and has initiated a study&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position on the legislation under which staff of Telecom Éireann will be allowed to buy up to 15 per cent of the shares in the company?  I understand that overnight, in consultation with party leaders on the opposite side of the House, the Taoiseach may have had a miraculous change of mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is not the crucial issue.  What we are seeking is an agreement between all the interests concerned on a partnership basis to ensure that those employed in Telecom Éireann gain the maximum benefit from their contribution to the increased efficiency of the company and that everything is done to ensure the company as a whole is competitive, thereby securing the employment of everybody concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said yesterday in the House and on previous occasions when the Deputy raised it, the matter is the subject of <Col N="497" /> ongoing detailed and intensive negotiation in a spirit of partnership by all the interests involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate on this important legislation.  It is appropriate that we devote most of our time to Committee Stage so I will be brief in my response to the issues raised on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke asked if it was correct to proceed with this Bill rather than with her Bill.  I accept her concern about this legislation. I examined her Bill to see if it would be more effective and speedy to conduct the detailed amendment it required to convert it into workable legislation or proceed with the drafting of this Bill, which had already been put in train when the Deputy introduced her Bill.  I decided it would be preferable to proceed with a Bill, the heads of which were already drafted, than to accept a Bill which would have required far-reaching amendment.</P>
      <P>The cost of the Goodbody's survey was just over £20,000.  It is a very important survey because we had no information previously on payment experience in the public sector.  The only previous survey was carried out by the Society of Chartered Surveyors.  This was a very small survey dealing with only 11 companies, and the payment period it turned up was untypical of payment periods in the sector generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> I am pleased to assure the Deputy that I have tabled amendments to provide that Telecom Éireann, Bus Éireann and Aer Lingus will be treated in the same way as any other body.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the possibility of using the Ombudsman as a vehicle for dealing with issues under this Bill.  I considered this but have been wholly persuaded by the arguments advanced, by the Ombudsman among others, that it would be quite inappropriate to deal with this prompt payments legislation, which deals with commercial relations, through the Ombudsman service.  There are a number of reasons, technical as well as otherwise, for not using the Ombudsman service. Essentially it would involve the Ombudsman in commercial contract disputes, interpretation of terms of contract and issues of private law which are matters for the courts or special arbitration procedures and not for the Ombudsman who deals with the way in which members of the public are dealt with.  The Ombudsman also makes recommendations rather than binding arbitration as required in this area.  There are other reasons which the Ombudsman outlined and which I articulated in response to the Private Members' Bill, including the fact that it would not be in the interests of the long-term development of the Ombudsman to move into the commercial area.  I am satisfied that the alternative vehicle we have provided whereby the supplier can go to arbitration at his own discretion is a satisfactory way to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised the possibility of spurious querying of invoicing to interfere with the workings of this Bill.  However, if this is not done within ten days the clock goes back.  Therefore, the concern on that front is not valid.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also suggested that the Bill might apply to goods after the passing of the Act rather than after the commencement of the Act, but this would not be workable in practice.  It would be unfair to impose interest penalties and other provisions of the Bill in relation to transactions taking place during the preparatory period. It is sensible to indicate a commencement date as we are doing in this Bill and ensure that public bodies are prepared for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also raised the issue of whether there should be positive affirmation in the House of, for example, changes in the Schedule or the list of bodies.  That would not be practical. There will be a need to delete or add bodies to the list from time to time and it would not be practical to have to look for time in the House on every occasion.  I have included a safeguard against ill-conceived removal of bodies by requiring the Minister to specify in the order the reasons for any such deletion.  Deputy McDowell also raised questions surrounding the taxability of interest under the Bill.  I am satisfied with the existing provisions and do not propose to make taxation proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions on Second Stage.  I am sure better use of the House's <Col N="505" /> time would be made by proceeding to Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Rourke's amendment and mine seek to achieve a common purpose.  They propose that Aer Lingus, Telecom Éireann and Bus Éireann should be included in Part 1 of the Schedule so that all bodies are treated in a similar fashion.  On Second Stage Deputy O'Rourke expressed concern about the exclusion of those bodies from Part 1 of the Schedule and I indicated that they had agreed to comply with the timescale provided for in the Bill.  I am pleased to move this amendment which will ensure the same rules apply to all suppliers dealing with public bodies as purchasers. It is not necessary to provide special treatment for the three bodies concerned.</P>
      <P>The amendments taken with No. 1 have a similar purpose.  One of them proposes to delete paragraph (b) and another proposes the deletion of references to paragraph (b) which will no longer exist.  Amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6 follow from the amendment being made to section 1.  The purpose of those amendments is also to ensure that all bodies are treated in a similar fashion.</P>

I opposed this on Second Stage because I fail to understand the need to give them special status, particularly in light of the profits they make.  That special status will now be removed and, like all other State bodies, they will pay their bills on time.

      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall, by order, designate all small businesses (under 50 employees, under £3 million in turnover) as consumers to give such companies further avenues to redress difficulties.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I spoke on this matter last autumn and again on Second Stage in the understanding that many EU countries designate such small businesses as consumers. There are various rights of redress for consumers under European law which would open up to small businesses avenues which have hitherto remained closed.  Small businesses have particular difficulties and redress is often costly and very bureaucratic for them.  It would be attractive to and worthwhile for them if their rights were designated as those of consumers. This Bill is for all businesses but those who will gain most from it are the small businesses which suffer enormous disadvantages when money is tied up.</P>

      <P>I can see what the Deputy is driving at but her amendment is not an appropriate way of tackling this problem.  This legislation deals with prompt payment of suppliers by purchasers who are public bodies.  The designation of small businesses as consumers would not confer any benefits on small businesses because consumers are not given any entitlements under this Bill.  The Deputy is going beyond the remit of the Bill to raise an issue concerning the treatment of small businesses.  It would not be practical to so amend legislation of this sort in the consumer protection area as, in practice, it would stand our consumer law on its head.  The definition of a consumer in existing legislation is based on a person acting outside his or her business capacity.  It deals with the relationships between consumers and businesses, including small businesses.  Therefore one could not redesignate small businesses as being consumers.  That would create strange contradictions in our consumer law, as the consumer would no longer be protected against small businesses under, for example, the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be looking for special protections to be given to small business in dealing, for example, with credit charges.  The Director of Consumer Affairs now has certain powers in relation to credit charges, so that is provided for. I cannot accept the amendment because it would disrupt an existing corpus of consumer law.  If we are to pursue the precedents the Deputy suggests are worthy of pursuit in EU law, those would have to be looked at afresh and suitable vehicles would have to be found to transpose into Irish law if they were found to be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I accept in a general sense that this amendment would be beyond the remit of the Bill.  Nevertheless, in credit terms and in many other ways of redress small businesses do not have an appropriate channel or appropriate appellation which would enable them to avail of various methods of redress.  The amendment was worthy of being tabled, but I will not press it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Minister shall, by order, extend the remit of the small claims court to allow for the registering of judgments for commercial debts up to £5,000.  The order shall provide for a procedure to be established where respondents who do not dispute a claim of non-payment within 30 days of receipt of a notice from a district court registrar will be <Col N="508" /> held to have admitted it.  The claimant shall then be entitled to proceed to obtain a judgment against the respondent.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The small claims court is under the remit of the Department of Justice and since its inception it has been of great benefit to consumers.  It started modestly on a pilot basis and has been extended to various other centres.  In 1992 I visited various registrars of the small claims court.  While the work they do has been held up of late, the essence of their work is to provide people with access to a speedy redress of a claim in an non-judgmental environment.  I understand there is a backlog at present and people are not being paid promptly, but that is an issue for the Department of Justice to pursue in conjunction with the consumer section.</P>
    <P>The small claims court could be opened up to allow for the registering of judgments for commercial debts up to £5,000.  That makes sense. The necessary structures are in place and would lend themselves to such further usage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envisage public bodies going to court or being required to be brought to court under this legislation in pursuit of the interest due by them on late payments.  We have provided that such interest will automatically fall to be paid.  There is no question of the supplier having to request payment or any such obligation on the supplier to pursue the purchaser.  I envisage the position being clearcut as to when the interest falls due and the automatic payment of it by a public body.</P>
      <P>There may be a possibility of dispute about whether the invoice was correctly issued and if changes were required to it.  We have provided protections for the supplier in that there cannot be spurious arguments about invoices.  However, if there are such disputes, there is a provision whereby small businesses or any business which is a supplier can go to arbitration.  If the purchasing business or the public body concerned is not agreeable to that, we provide that the Law Society shall appoint an arbitrator whose recommendations shall be legally binding.  I do not envisage that public bodies against whom the arbitrator rules will pursue the matter in court.  I understand what the Deputy is driving at but it goes beyond the scope of the Bill, which will not result in court problems for small businesses.  The Deputy is seeking a more simple way to deal with commercial claims.  I sympathise with that but there are problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small claims court works under court rules and not under Statute so it would be appropriate for changes to the court's rules to be made by the Minister for Justice.  I will raise the question of an appropriate revision of the court rules with the Minister.  There is another problem that would have to be overcome, of which I have no doubt the Deputy will be aware from her time on this side of the House.  I recall Deputy Burke established the small claims court and there is a question of whether it should apply to small business. <Col N="509" /> The experience in the UK and Northern Ireland was that the small claims court became so clogged up with the pursuit of business claims that it ceased to be a vehicle to provide redress to consumers. That caveat will have to be overcome.  I assure the Deputy that I will take up this issue with the Minister for Justice.  Under the current small claims court procedure the upper limit is £600&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will raise this issue with the Minister for Justice, but the UK and Northern Ireland experience will have to be considered before a proposal to make changes in this area can be brought forward.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made arrangements for the arbitrator and does not envisage public bodies reneging on the requirement to pay.  I do not have as much faith as the Minister in public bodies to pay their debts.  They are so strapped for cash under every regime that they take it out, so to speak, on small suppliers. The spurious nature of invoice nit-picking means this legislation is necessary.  Public bodies are not as white as the driven snow and will have many trepidations about this legislation.  We have only to note the way Telecom Éireann, Aer Lingus and Bus Éireann were given an exemption until we tabled these amendments.</P>
      <P>I read about the report on the operation of the small claims court in the UK in <i>The Sunday Times</i> and sent for a copy of it about nine months ago.  Despite the courts being clogged by small commercial bodies taking cases, the report's conclusion was positive in that ordinary people can get quick redress for small claims.</P>
      <P>I understand the upper limit in the small claims court is £1,000.</P>

I have reservations about the good intentions of public bodies to pay their bills on time, but we will have to wait and see.  I accept the Minister's statement that the question of a review of the small claims court's procedures will be referred to the Department of Justice.  I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;This Act shall apply to and in relation to all payments made by Government departments, including the payment of grants and the handover of EU funds.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I regard this as definitely falling within the remit of suppliers' bills.  Throughout Government Departments &mdash; this does not relate to any particular regime but to all &mdash; there springs to mind the Department of Education and its very slow payment of maintenance grants.  There is nit-picking of various documents that must be submitted before grants can be paid by the relevant local authority, vocational education committee or other body.  There are all sorts of headage and agricultural payments in respect of which the same nit-picking takes place.  This is particularly the case within the Department of Social Welfare to which elderly farmers may have applied for a pension and will have handed over their farm and relevant documentation to their son or daughter; yet months after its transference the procedure will not have been finalised.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the payment of grants and the handover of EU funds which often occasion huge delays.  I do not know why because the funds are there.  Perhaps it is a reluctance on the part of the relevant Department to open its purse strings. When it comes to the Department of Finance, whose job I recognise is always to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash; I often think its officers are born and die saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash; it is well known there are always delays in the payment of grants even to those whose need will have been identified and certified.  I ask that the provision of this Bill be extended to take this into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that that is way beyond the scope of this Bill.  Essentially what Deputy O'Rourke is seeking is that all payments by Government Departments &mdash; including salaries, social welfare benefits, grants and the transfer of funds between Departments &mdash; are not amenable to late payment, including the handover of EU funds.  Even from a technical point of view, most of these would not be accompanied by an invoice. The mechanisms we are establishing here to stipulate prescribed payment dates would not apply to the types of payments in respect of which the Deputy wants the provisions extended.</P>
      <P>I see the Deputy's point, that payments should be made in time, say, to farmers seeking social welfare benefits, to students in respect of higher education grants or whatever &mdash; I can certainly see the validity of that case &mdash; but that must be done through the mechanisms being developed by respective Departments.  For example, I know the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has introduced a charter which enables it to identify&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Similarly, I know that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Doyle &mdash; who is responsible for the introduction of clear statements of entitlement from all Government Departments &mdash; later this year will examine statements submitted by all Government Departments of the service people can expect to obtain from them, including the turn-around of responses in relation not merely to payments but to their many varied inquiries. That is a key part of the strategic management initiative which is being pursued by Government Departments throughout the public sector.  It should be dealt with in that context and to try to insert in this Bill such provisions as are in the amendment is to put a burden on it which it is not capable of carrying.  It is designed for specific commercial transactions between suppliers and public bodies and is structured on the basis of invoices, payment periods relating to them, contracts, etc.  That is the structure within which the Bill has been developed and the safeguards and arbitration procedures come within that.  They have not been developed in the wider context envisaged by Deputy O'Rourke and I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 6, before section 9, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>9.&mdash; Where there is a contract (`the first <Col N="512" /> contract') between a purchaser and a supplier for the supply of goods or services and the supplier is also a purchaser under a contract (`the second contract') for the acquisition or supply of the goods or services to be provided under the first contract&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where the first contract is in writing and provides for a date by which the payment of the agreed price for the supply of the goods or services shall be made, the period used in calculating the prescribed payment date for the second contract shall be the same number of days as the period between the supply of the goods or services and the payment for the goods or services provided for in the first contract or, if the second contract is in writing, any lesser period specified in the second contract, or</P>
    <P>(b)  where the first contract is not in writing or is in writing but does not provide for the date of payment, the prescribed payment date for the second contract shall be 45 days&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  after receipt by the purchaser of an invoice for the payment due, where the invoice is received after the completed delivery of the goods or services, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  after the delivery of the goods or services, where the delivery is made at the time of or after receipt by the purchaser of an invoice therefor,</P>
    <P>or the least of such lesser number of days&mdash;</P>
    <P>(iii)  as may be specified in the second contract (if the second contract is in writing), or</P>
    <P>(iv)  as the Minister may, by order under section 10(2), prescribe.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a new section which, if accepted, involves the deletion of section 9.  We provided in the original legislation that, where a main contractor was involved with a public body and received payment terms under this legislation, those conditions would apply to the subcontractor. However, we left open the possibility that the main contractor and the subcontractor could set that aside and agree to worse terms.  On re-examination, we felt it could possibly subject the subcontractor to unfair pressure to agree to payment periods which were not in their interests resulting in an unfair relationship between them and the contractor.</P>
    <P>We have provided instead that the period used in calculating the prescribed payment date for the second contract shall be the same number of days as the period in the first, or any lesser period if specified.  This is effectively a safeguard against possible exploitation of a subcontractor.  Similarly, if the contract is not in writing, or is in writing but does not provide for a payment date, the <Col N="513" /> prescribed payment period for the second contract shall be 45 days.  We are using the same definition as in the original section 1 for determining the payment period for the 45 day test.  Alternatively, the period could be a lesser number of days.  We are providing that subcontractors are not put in a position of disadvantage to the main contractor and are not put under pressure to agree to less favourable terms.  The original formulation of this section left it open that they could be put under such pressure.  This section is more watertight and gives greater protection to the subcontractor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the amendment. The original section 9 was imprecise and could lead to covert intimidation of a subcontractor by a contractor, in the same way as a public body could intimidate a supplier.  The original section 9 was faulty.  The amendments make the section much more watertight and give more protection to subcontractors, who are often smaller than small suppliers and need all the protection they can get.  I accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the dispatch, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, as applied by the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the UN authorised multinational Stabilisation Force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in accordance with UN Security <Col N="515" /> Council Resolution 1088 of 12 December 1996, and that it further approves the terms of the exchange of letters on Ireland's financial responsibilities arising from participation in SFOR, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 12 May, 1997.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion, which is required under section 2 of the Defence Act, 1960, as applied by the Defence Act, 1993, is to enable the dispatch of an Irish contingent for service with the UN-authorised multinational Stabilisation Force &mdash; SFOR &mdash; in Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1088 of 12 December 1996.  The motion also provides for approval of the terms of an exchange of letters with NATO clarifying Ireland's financial responsibilities arising from participation in SFOR, copies of which have been laid before the House.  This exchange clarifies that Ireland, like all other non-NATO troop contributing nations, will be responsible for its own costs.</P>
    <P>In commending this motion to the House I wish to emphasise three key points.  First, SFOR's presence and role are indispensable to the international community's efforts to maintain and consolidate peace after a sustained conflict which was the most destructive in Europe since the Second World War.  The dimensions of the suffering and loss were and remain shocking: over 400,000 people died in the four year conflict in former Yugoslavia.  Over two million people were displaced internally or became international refugees. Second, SFOR operates under the mandate and authority of the United Nations Security Council.  Third, Irish participation in SFOR is entirely in keeping with our foreign policy traditions and objectives.  It is particularly in keeping with our long and respected tradition of United Nation's peacekeeping that Ireland should participate in this UN authorised force, whose contributors number over 30 states, allied and non-allied, neutral and non-aligned, including all those European states with whom we have served over the years in UN operations such as UNIFIL and UNFICYP.  SFOR currently has some 31,000 troops deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina made up of contingents from the 16 members of NATO and from 19 non-NATO countries, including Russia and Ukraine, most of the countries of central and eastern Europe, the neutrals Sweden, Finland and Austria, and non-European non-aligned countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Malaysia.</P>
    <P>The conflict in former Yugoslavia posed major &mdash; indeed defining &mdash; challenges to the UN, to the European Union and the international community at large.  There can be no one who has not been touched by the humanitarian catastrophe, especially in Bosnia.  The resolution of the differences in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains a central objective of the European Union's foreign policy.  It is also, as was made clear in Chapter 10 of the White Paper, a priority of Irish foreign policy. Ireland made an important contribution at <Col N="516" /> the political and diplomatic levels through our conduct of European Union policy during the recent Presidency, through ongoing Irish participation in the European Community Monitor Mission and through the provision of members of the Garda Síochána to the UN's International Police Task Force, including the former head of the force, Assistant Commissioner Peter Fitzgerald. Since the end of the Irish Presidency the level of our Defence Forces participation in the ECMM has been scaled down significantly from its Presidency level of 79 members.</P>
    <P>In the context of the preparations for the Bosnia peace agreement in 1995, the UN Secretary General made clear his view to the Security Council that, to implement a peace agreement in Bosnia, the Security Council should authorise a multinational force, acting as appropriate with regional organisations or arrangements.  The Security Council, acting as the body under the UN Charter charged with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, decided that NATO would take the lead in connection with the multinational force.  A large number of states, including other neutrals such as Finland, Sweden and Austria, non-NATO states such as Russia, and non-European non-aligned states participated.</P>
    <P>UN Security Council Resolution 1008 of 12 December 1996 authorised the establishment of the multinational Stabilisation Force, known as SFOR, for a planned period of 18 months from December 1996.  SFOR's role is to help the parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina to implement a peace accord, the &ldquo;Dayton&rdquo; agreement, to which they have freely agreed, and to contribute to a secure environment necessary for the consolidation and stabilisation of peace in the region. SFOR, like its predecessor force, the UN authorised Implementation Force, IFOR, is crucial to the efforts to preserve peace and contribute to a climate of confidence in which the political and democratic processes can be pursued after a war which has left a legacy of great bitterness and division.</P>
    <P>In execution of its Security Council mandate, SFOR co-operates and works with the other agencies principally involved for example, the Office of the High Representative &mdash; currently Carl Bildt, the former Swedish Prime Minister &mdash; the International Police Force, which includes a number of members of the Garda Síochána, UN civilian agencies such as the UNHCR, the International Red Cross and the OSCE.  This co-operation covers a wide range of activities, notably maintaining local security, facilitating freedom of movement for the local population and assisting the return of refugees.</P>
    <P>SFOR, like its predecessor force, IFOR, operates under Chapter VII of the UN Charter: that is, it is entitled to use force to implement its mandate, to separate the parties in the event of a resumption of hostilities or to protect itself.</P>
    <P>Although SFOR's predecessor, IFOR, generally succeeded in achieving on time the military <Col N="517" /> objectives assigned to it under the peace agreement, and therefore in providing an environment in which the tasks of civilian implementations could be addressed, progress on the civilian side has been consistently difficult to achieve, although some important results have been achieved during the 18 months since the peace agreement came into force.  In relation to war crimes, the Government wishes to see all indicted war crimes suspects appear before the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague to face the charges against them.  We believe full co-operation with the tribunal by all parties to the peace agreement is a fundamental obligation.  It is ultimately the responsibility of the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to ensure that indicted persons are handed over to the tribunal.  The Government, in co-operation with our European partners, will continue to press the parties involved to do so.</P>
    <P>Following national elections in September 1996 which were facilitated by the close co-operation of IFOR and the OSCE, most common institutions have finally been established and are now beginning to function.  However, their work is still at an early and fragile stage and requires further time for consolidation.  It was not possible to organise local elections in 1996 and these have been scheduled for next September.  Local elections will have a crucial impact on important aspects of civilian implementation such as freedom of movement, return of refugees and associated reconstruction and economic development. SFOR and the OSCE are working closely in preparation for the local elections.</P>
    <P>Ethnic tensions remain high in many parts of the country and could easily erupt again into open conflict in the absence of an international stabilisation force.  A secure environment must be maintained if civilian implementation is to move forward at the desired tempo and if democracy and reconciliation are to develop.  SFOR, by its presence and numerical strength, has an indispensable role in deterring threats to peace and providing the confidence and security necessary for implementation of the civilian aspects of the peace agreement.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important to keep clearly in focus the reality that the United Nations is increasingly reliant on regional organisations to help it meet the new security challenges of the post Cold War world.  The new reality we must face is that no one institution in isolation can cope with the full range of new and multifaceted challenges to international security &mdash; challenges with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic dimensions and which can transcend ethnic, state and even regional boundaries.  Former Yugoslavia is one example of this, the situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa is another and the situation in Albania is the most recent example of an internal conflict with roots radically different from those we have been accustomed to over the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> The OSCE has developed and endorsed the concept of mutually reinforcing co-operation between security institutions and has encouraged a sense of common purpose between institutions to meet the new security challenges.  In Bosnia it is evident that the UN, the OSCE, the EU, NATO and the Council of Europe are all playing valuable and mutually reinforcing and supportive roles across a broad spectrum of activity &mdash; military, civil and humanitarian.</P>
    <P>It is not only in Europe that the UN has encouraged and authorised regional peacekeeping approaches.  Recent peacekeeping initiatives in Liberia and Haiti are also examples of this approach.  In Africa too, efforts have been in train to enhance a standing African peacekeeping capability based on the Organisation of African Unity.  The mandate given to SFOR by the Security Council should be seen in this broader context.</P>
    <P>Participation in SFOR would place Irish troops under the command structures established by NATO in accordance with its UN mandate, but the participation of other neutral countries such as Finland, Sweden and Austria, of non-NATO countries such as Russia and of non-European, non-aligned countries indicates that military neutrality or non-membership of NATO has not been a barrier to participation in IFOR and SFOR.  Moreover, in the context of peacekeeping, it is important to distinguish between the role of NATO as a mutual defence alliance and the assistance which, as an international security institution, it is providing in support of peace-keeping and other operations under the authority of the UN Security Council or OSCE, including by making its resources and expertise available.</P>
    <P>Chapter 4 of the White Paper has dealt with this issue in some detail.  Participation in SFOR would place us alongside traditional and like-minded UN peacekeepers.  Our involvement would be in line with the approach to peacekeeping set out in the White Paper.  Non-involvement, on the other hand, would risk marginalising us from developments in conflict prevention and peacekeeping in Europe under UN and OSCE auspices.  The reality is that SFOR is a mission in support of peace in Europe which has brought 35 countries together under the authority of the United Nations in a way which would have been unimaginable earlier this decade.  I strongly believe that Ireland should become part of this multinational effort.</P>
    <P>We have exchanged views with the other participating European neutral countries who, far from seeing participation in SFOR as incompatible with their positions outside alliances, value their participation as a practical contribution to the peace implementation process in Bosnia. Moreover, they have emphasised to us, as traditional UN peacekeepers, the importance of enhancing their experience of and influence over the development of peacekeeping in the post Cold War era.  It is very much in our interest to enhance our experience and influence in co-operation <Col N="519" /> with these traditional UN peacekeeping countries as peacekeeping evolves to meet the new challenges to peace and security which the international community will face.</P>
    <P>In deciding on Irish participation in SFOR, the most careful consideration has been given to all aspects of the matter.  A team of officials from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence, together with representatives of the Defence Forces, had preparatory consultations with NATO HQ in Brussels, with the SFOR co-ordination centre based at SHAPE in Mons, Belgium, and, subsequently, made a reconnaissance visit to SFOR HQ in Sarajevo to establish the operational, logistical and financial arrangements for a possible participation in SFOR.  These consultations identified an SFOR requirement for a military police contingent at SFOR HQ in Sarajevo as one that the Irish Defence Forces would be in a position to meet.</P>
    <P>The Irish military police element would be part of the international military police company at SFOR HQ, which consists of a company HQ and three MP platoons.  Ireland is being asked to provide the company HQ and one of the platoons. The Irish MPs will perform the normal range of military police duties for SFOR HQ in Sarajevo, where approximately 8,000 SFOR troops are stationed.  Duties would include: (a) enforcement of military discipline and good order; (b) monitoring and control of military vehicular traffic, including investigation of road traffic accidents: (c) enforcement of SFOR protection policy, in other words, measures to ensure the safety and security of SFOR troops; (d) investigations of incidents involving SFOR personnel or property; (e) HQ security functions, for example, security checks on SFOR compounds; (f) liaison with local police and the UN International Police Task Force (IPTF) and (g) operation of 24 hour international MP stations at SFOR HQ and/or other SFOR locations at Sarajevo.</P>
    <P>The MPs would be armed and equipped for their personal protection to carry out this supporting role.  The Irish contingent would comprise the MP company HQ, totalling 16 personnel, the MP platoon, totalling 27 and a national support element consisting of six personnel.  In addition, Ireland is entitled to appoint an officer to the force HQ at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel who will be the national contingent commander.  Each nation participating in SFOR is also invited to appoint a military liaison officer to the SFOR co-ordination centre at SHAPE, near Brussels.  In total, the Irish deployment to SFOR would consist of 50 personnel of all ranks in SFOR HQ in Sarajevo, with one military liaison officer assigned to SHAPE in Mons, Belgium, for the duration of SFOR's mandate.</P>
    <P>The role which has been offered to the Irish contingent is an important and responsible one and is clear testimony to the high regard which SFOR has for the professionalism and commitment of Irish peacekeepers.  Arrangements are in <Col N="520" /> place at NATO HQ in Brussels for regular political consultations and briefings with all troop contributing nations on developments relating to the force.  Under the terms of the Security Council resolution, monthly progress reports are submitted to the UN Secretary General and the Security Council.  As a troop contributor, Ireland will be consulted on the preparation of these reports.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the Irish commitment to SFOR will be until the expiry of the force's mandate set out in Security Council Resolution 1088. The expiry of the mandate is scheduled to occur in June 1998.  It is envisaged that rotation of the Irish contingent will be at six monthly intervals. In keeping with good peacekeeping practice, it is our intention to confirm to NATO that our contingent will not be withdrawn without four months prior notice, unless otherwise agreed.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that SFOR, like its predecessor IFOR, operates under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.  This protective element of the mandate is becoming the norm in UN peacekeeping operations.  Troop contributing countries are increasingly unwilling to commit troops to UN operations unless there is a Chapter VII authorisation to enable the peacekeeping force to take all necessary measures to protect itself.  The House may recall that the multinational force planned for Zaire late last year, for which the Dáil approved Irish participation, also had a Chapter VII mandate.  SFOR's predecessor, IFOR, was initially deployed at a strength of 60,000 under a Chapter VII mandate to ensure that it would be able to deter any aggression against it.  SFOR has been reduced in size to half that of IFOR in the light of the major diminution of the likelihood of the force coming under attack.  Currently, the main risk to SFOR personnel in the area of operations is posed by land-mines and road traffic accidents, risks which the Irish personnel in the EC monitor mission have had run for the last six years.</P>
    <P>In recommending that Ireland contribute a military police contingent to SFOR HQ in Sarajevo, safety and security factors, including the specific function of the military police in SFOR, which as I have already said is a supporting role, were taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>In so far as the discharge of SFOR's mandate is concerned, the Irish contingent, like those of the other neutral countries in the force, would come under SFOR's central and unified command and control structure.  However, non-NATO nations, including Ireland, would retain national command of their contingents.  Moreover, the force commander would utilise national contingents in accordance with their capabilities, taking into account the advice of the contingent commander.  These are standard arrangements for non-NATO troop contributors to SFOR.</P>
    <P>The Irish military authorities would take the necessary measures to assure the maintenance of proper discipline and would retain exclusive criminal jurisdiction for the Irish contingent.  The Irish contingent, as a non-NATO contingent, <Col N="521" /> would enjoy the same rights, privileges and immunities as are provided for in the status of forces agreements signed between NATO and the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>
    <P>Contributors to SFOR are responsible for their own costs of participation.  This is set out in the terms of the exchange of letters before the House.  As the Attorney General's advice is that this exchange of letters on the financial arrangements would constitute an international agreement involving a charge on public funds within the meaning of Article 29 of the Constitution, the motion also seeks approval of the terms of the exchange.</P>
    <P>SFOR is an important expression not only of the international community's commitment to peace in Bosnia but also reflects the new and mutually reinforcing and co-operative approach to ensuring international peace and security. Ireland has long been an advocate of co-operative approaches to security and participation in SFOR would be a concrete example of our commitment to inclusive co-operative security in Europe in general and to helping the people of Bosnia in their search for peace and normal political life after a conflict of catastrophic proportions.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long-standing reputation in UN peacekeeping which is a legitimate source of pride for all of us.  I attach great importance to our continuing involvement in the mainstream of peacekeeping.  Our participation in SFOR is important in this connection.</P>
    <P>I know very well the concerns of Deputies about the tragic situation which has developed in Bosnia.  I share these concerns.  I also know well that Ireland can and must play its full part in helping to ensure peace in Bosnia.  That is what we have been doing in a number of ways.  The further step we are now taking is fully consistent with, and complementary to, the efforts we have made not only in Bosnia but also in the service of peace under the auspices of the United Nations throughout the world.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has contributed to UN peacekeeping missions since the early 1960s. Members of our armed forces and, more recently, the Garda Síochána have earned worldwide respect and admiration for their courage and skill as members of various UN missions.  We, in Fianna Fáil, have always proudly promoted Ireland's humanitarian and peacekeeping role. Today, more than 40 years after Ireland first joined the United Nations, Fianna Fáil remains committed to making an active contribution to the development of collective security under the auspices of the United Nations.  We are equally committed to enhancing Ireland's positive role in the United Nations through peacekeeping. Fianna Fáil supports the principle that Irish troops should be made available to the United Nations for peacekeeping missions on a case by case basis.  We believe that, as a member of the <Col N="522" /> United Nations, Ireland must participate in SFOR, the stability force deployed in the former Yugoslavia under a UN resolution.  I ask each Member of the House to support the motion and the accompanying financial resolution.  By supporting the motion we fulfil our duty as a member of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The SFOR mission has as its mandate the implementation of the Dayton agreement and has been operating under a Security Council resolution since 1995.  I freely admit that SFOR troops are under NATO command.  However, the key point is that the request for Irish participation comes from the United Nations which bears ultimate responsibility for the mission.  SFOR is not a NATO force.  This point is clearly demonstrated by the participation of 17 non-NATO member countries, including Sweden, Austria and Finland. Unlike the Government parties, Fianna Fáil does not suggest that Ireland must participate in SFOR because several other militarily neutral countries are doing so or risk isolation.  Fianna Fáil supports Irish participation in SFOR as it is in keeping with our firm commitment to play a positive peacekeeping role in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Were it the case that the SFOR mission was not under the authority of a Security Council resolution, Fianna Fáil and the people would strenuously oppose Irish involvement.  This goes equally for all missions under Partnership for Peace which is little other than NATO under another name.  As Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, I support the participation of Irish troops only on the understanding that Irish participation has been requested by the United Nations and the mission operates under the authority of a Security Council resolution.</P>
      <P>Since 1991, 350 Irish troops have served in the former Yugoslavia, mostly as observers.  During the Irish EU Presidency more than 100 Irish troops staffed the monitoring mission run by the European Union in the area.  Today, the House will decide whether we should commit a number of our soldiers to involvement in SFOR in the role of military police.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil believes Ireland, as a militarily neutral nation without a colonial history, can make a valuable contribution to world affairs.  Through involvement in the United Nations, the Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe and the European Union, Ireland has developed an active and positive approach to foreign affairs while remaining true to the principle of military neutrality cherished by the people.  It is within the context of Irish military neutrality and membership of the United Nations that Fianna Fáil supports the motion.  As a neutral member of the United Nations, we have a positive contribution to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is determined that Ireland must not be forced, coaxed or cajoled into surrendering her valuable position of military neutrality.  We will continue in Government as in Opposition to defend and promote Irish military neutrality as a valuable asset while making a valuable contribution <Col N="523" /> and playing an active role in the international arena.  The Government has consistently undermined Irish military neutrality through its weak, divided and vacillating foreign policy.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Spring, is determined Ireland must join the NATO-led Partnership for Peace which has been described by the American Ambassador to NATO as nothing less than second-class membership of NATO and a clear step on the road to full membership.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has stubbornly ignored these warnings and the serious implications membership of Partnership for Peace would have for Irish military neutrality and remains determined to recklessly force a change in Ireland's neutral military status.  His justification for membership of Partnership for Peace is that everyone else has joined and is typical of the Government's &ldquo;me too&rdquo; approach to foreign policy.</P>
    <P>During the six months of the Irish EU Presidency, a period when Ireland was placed centre stage and given a unique opportunity to influence the development of the European Union, the Government did nothing to advance the basic principles of military neutrality and nuclear non-proliferation held dear by the people.  Through its inaction, the Government has enabled the potential development of the European Union as a self-centred military alliance.</P>
    <P>On 21 March, the Dutch Presidency launched an initiative to commit the European Union to the progressive creation of a defence union.  In this context, proposals to commit the European Union to a merger with the Western European Union, a military alliance with a first strike nuclear capability, and to formulate a mutual defence agreement have been mooted.  A senior French diplomat stated in no uncertain terms that military neutrality was no longer compatible with EU membership.  The Government continues to refuse to take action for fear of offending those member states in favour of such developments and has failed to provide an opportunity to engage in meaningful debate on this issue either publicly or in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The strategy statement of the Department of Foreign Affairs published in March removes all doubt as to the Government's real intentions with regard to Irish military neutrality.  It does not mention Irish military neutrality in either positive or negative terms as either a current strategy or a future objective.  At this critical juncture, as the future security identity of the European Union is being decided under the Dutch Presidency, a strong and clear foreign policy is essential if Ireland is to fulfil its potential in the international arena.</P>
    <P>The Government parties are totally divided on the central issue of Irish military neutrality.  The Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, has stated on several occasions that he supports the development of the European Union as a federal super state with a binding common defence policy.  The <Col N="524" /> Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs prefers to emphasise his desire to see Ireland join Partnership for Peace while the third member of the triumvirate, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, in his address to the annual Democratic Left delegate conference clearly stated his party's contradictory policy that &ldquo;Ireland ought not join NATO, the Western European Union or Partnership for Peace&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The clarity and unity of Fianna Fáil foreign policy, particularly in reference to Irish military neutrality, is in stark contrast to the opacity and disunity which reign supreme in the coalition Government.  Fianna Fáil is fundamentally opposed to Irish participation in NATO, the Western European Union &mdash; beyond observer status &mdash; and NATO led organisations such as Partnership for Peace, all of which have serious implications for our military neutrality.  Furthermore, we give the unconditional guarantee that Ireland will not participate in any co-operative security agreement without first consulting the public by way of a referendum.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil strongly reaffirms Ireland's traditional role within the United Nations and its commitment to the development of international security as a collective and inclusive concept.  In a recent article published in <i>Der Spiegel</i> Herr Genscher, the highly respected former German Foreign Minister and political architect of the new Germany, clearly expressed his views on the expansion on NATO on Europe when he stated:</P>
    <P>Such a development would undermine the autonomy, independence and identity of the European Union.  The creation of new trenches and separating lines can and must be prevented.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that the creation of new lines of division and global conflict must be resisted at all costs and for this reason opposes the expansion of NATO and Irish participation in NATO and Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that we are having this debate on SFOR at a time when debates are taking place on the expansion of NATO to the borders of Russia.  This proposal is a major mistake.  This is also the view of Herr Genscher and many others who have considered this matter.  This is a classic example of ignoring history and of not learning lessons from it.  If this expansion takes place we will unfortunately be ensuring that the mistakes of history are repeated.  We witnessed the welcome break-up of the communist bloc, the disappearance of the Iron Curtain and the reunification of Germany.  NATO, which was established for Cold War purposes, now has no real purpose and its generals and military chiefs are trying to find a new role for themselves.  The seriousness of the proposal to expand NATO to the borders of Russia was highlighted by the Russian President, Mr. Yeltsin, who said it was the most serious occurrence since the Cuban missile crisis during 1961.  The implications of this proposal must be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> We are falling into the old trap of assuming that security frontiers give security to nations. The Maginot Line and the experience in Germany in the run up to the Second World War should have taught the people of Europe the lesson that security lines do not mean security. Security can only be secured by interdependence between nations and the principles which guided Schuman and Monnet in the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community after the Second World War.  They recognised that to achieve real peace in Europe there had to be independence between nations in an economic and social sense.</P>
    <P>Security is not only about the number of men and weaponry available, it is about creating interdependence. Europe should strive to develop the Organisation for Security and Co-operation from Vladivostok to Vancouver, thereby guaranteeing real security which respect frontiers and the positions of nations.  The artificial expansion of NATO to the frontiers of Russia merely issues an invitation to the Russian military to rearm and prepare for conflict.  We must encourage the people of Russia, the Russian Government and the forces to the East to establish interdependence with the rest of Europe in economic and social terms.</P>
    <P>I welcome our participation in SFOR in the former Yugoslavia where more than 400,000 people have been killed.  Late last year I visited Croatia where I saw at first hand the damage done to the heritage city of Dubrovnik.  The murder of the people in that area and the damage to this city is an example of man's inhumanity to man.  We should be ashamed that a member of the human race could do this.  This destruction continued as far as the city of Zagreb.  Some of the people displaced by this conflict have been welcomed into Ireland.  It is important that we participate and are seen to participate in this very effective force.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is committed to the principles of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.  We believe there is a fundamental contradiction in the Government's professed commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation and its determination to embroil Ireland in Partnership for Peace in the light of its intimate connection with NATO, a nuclear defence alliance.  I again guarantee that Fianna Fáil will ask the people to make a judgment on this matter.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will strive to achieve a fresh vision of Europe where the European Union represents a new model in international relations defined as a political and economic community rather than a military superpower or federal super state.  We are opposed to all plans to establish any organisation within the structure of the European Union which aims to boost research and development into weaponry, facilitate the international arms trade and place arms contracts.  We are committed to developing non-military industry in areas of Europe threatened by unemployment due to the shrinking arms trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> Military neutrality is defined by Fianna Fáil as not equivalent to splendid isolation.  Fianna Fáil is determined that Ireland will fulfil its potential in the international arena.  We believe that as a small nation on the periphery of Europe we can best reach that potential by maintaining our valuable tradition of military neutrality and through involvement in organisations such as the UN, the EU and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  In keeping with Fianna Fáil's commitment to contribute actively to UN peacekeeping missions, I call on all Members to support this motion and Irish participation in this stability force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support this motion which proposes that Ireland should dispatch a contingent of troops to serve with the SFOR forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, it is necessary to comment on the circumstances in which we are doing this.</P>
      <P>I understand that the contribution of troops is limited to 50 military policemen.  It is a pity that our contribution is non-operational in a military sense and confined simply to activities as military police.  In joining a contingent of this kind I would prefer if we had a larger contingent which constituted combat troops.  The total SFOR force is 31,000 and our 50 military policemen will not be able to play a significant role in a force of that size.</P>
      <P>We were told at some length that this was organised by the United Nations.  Those of us in this House are almost not allowed to use the dreaded &ldquo;N&rdquo; word, but I have before me the draft exchanges of letters in which I find the name &ldquo;NATO&rdquo; appears 11 times.  This is one of the more curious exchanges of draft letters I have ever seen because there is no indication to whom or from whom the letters are being sent.  There is a kind of security anonymity about the whole matter.  However, it is not for security reasons that this gross anonymity besets us, it is for political reasons.</P>
      <P>In the brief opportunity I had to glance at the Tánaiste's speech, it appears that the unnamed Secretary General is not the Secretary General of the United Nations but the Secretary General of NATO.  This is an entirely NATO commanded force and all the arrangements are made with NATO.  The United Nations is not mentioned in the course of these letters except in a passing reference to a Security Council resolution.</P>
      <P>Apart from the 11 times NATO is mentioned, it is interesting to see that Ireland will be entitled to representation at NATO headquarters, the only stipulation being that it will be at the expense of the Irish Government.  All the arrangements are made by NATO.  NATO, through its commanding officer, will cause identification cards to be issued to all SFOR personnel to make it clear they are troops under NATO command and answerable to NATO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have laid some emphasis on this because I want to draw attention to the fact that it is happening. <Col N="527" /> I welcome the fact that it is happening, but I look around me at the empty benches in this House and inquire where today are those who told us this country would never have anything to do with NATO, that it would remain in glorious isolation that it ostensibly or nominally chose to be in for a long time and that it would not seek to face up to reality.  Where today are the spiritual sons of Kim II Sung whom I might have expected to be apoplectic about the motion and the anonymous letters about to be exchanged which are now before us?  I would like the Minister of State to confirm that those letters are to and from NATO, not the United Nations.</P>
    <P>There was an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in the past few days by Séamus Martin, who is now stationed for that paper in Moscow, in which he amused himself and no doubt some of his readers, including myself, by speculating about the state of Irish neutrality.  Ireland, we are solemnly informed, is neutral.  It is neutral, presumably, between Russia on the one side and NATO on the other.  The difficulty is that Russia has now joined the Partnership for Peace.  I raise the question, which the Minister of State may wish to answer, as to exactly between whom we are now neutral.  Mr. Martin says in his article that Ireland has one ally in Europe which has not joined the Partnership for Peace and that is Malta, which recently acquired a socialist government and withdrew from the Partnership for Peace.  I was under a misapprehension because I thought there was another European state that was not a member of the Partnership for Peace, Vatican City.  If one takes the greater European area as far as the Urals, I understand Tadzhikistan is not a member.  Every other country is except Ireland, Malta and Vatican City.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because Tadzhikistan is experiencing some turmoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is experiencing a serious civil war and I am sure it is concentrating on that and not on external matters.  If one excludes Tadzhikistan, we are in the distinguished military company of Vatican City and Malta.  We should really begin to cop on to ourselves.</P>
      <P>Mr. Martin concludes his article by saying: &ldquo;When the Dáil votes on Wednesday to send Irish soldiers to join Sfor in Bosnia it will be a stepping stone towards commonsense and responsibility.  Membership of PFP would be a further step in that direction&rdquo;.  I fully agree with Mr. Martin.  Unfortunately, I was rushing from Limerick this morning and I did not get the opportunity to hear the Tánaiste's contribution to the debate, but I glanced through his speech on my way into the House and hoped it would contain an announcement that this country had now joined the Partnership for Peace.  So far as I can see, it does not contain that announcement, which is disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Martin made some interesting comments in <Col N="528" /> his article about European security and the Irish attitude to it.  I am inclined to agree with him.  He says that European security is hardly an issue to be ignored, given the recent outbreaks of violence in Europe which he describes.  He goes on to say: &ldquo;... it is, on the other hand, a concept to which all European states should contribute&rdquo;.  I fully concur with that sentiment.  I have always held the view that we should make a contribution pro rata with everybody else in Europe.</P>
    <P>Mr. Martin continues: &ldquo;But then `contributions', in Ireland's more recent European experience, have been something which other countries make and which Ireland receives&rdquo;. Unhappily, Mr. Martin is again right.  If this country came under attack, or the threat of attack, we would rapidly turn to our NATO neighbours, to our direct east and to our direct west, to protect us.  We would demand all the rights of protection of a NATO member without having contributed anything to it and having indulged in an official policy for approximately 40 years which almost cast doubt on the legitimacy of NATO as something inferior to which the moral Irish people could not descend.  I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves in a ridiculous position given development in Europe and the anxiety of President Clinton and NATO to come to terms with Russia and to expand NATO in a way that will not be seen by the Russians as a threat.  They hope to expand it in a way that will guarantee the security of not just the 15 EU states but also the central and eastern European states which are more volatile, where there have been serious outbreaks of violence in the recent past and where the danger of further outbreaks will continue.</P>
    <P>The SFOR force, the largest peace-keeping force ever assembled, is disappointing given its size and strength.  It has done little to vindicate human rights in the former Yugoslavia.  It has not arrested a single alleged war criminal.  Indeed, the NATO commanders have made it clear they have no intention of doing so.  The size of the force, the manner in which it is armed and its air and naval support off the coast of the former Yugoslavia mean that, for as long as the force remains in the area, there will be no major outbreak of hostilities in Bosnia and the surrounding states. However, as soon as the force leaves it is almost guaranteed hostilities will recommence.  It is not enough that SFOR should remain in the area for a temporary period &mdash; it is mandated to remain until June 1998 &mdash; and then walk away and allow the former belligerents to attack each other again. The recent war in the Balkans, like all previous wars in that area, was notorious for its viciousness. Unhappily, if there is a further outbreak of hostilities in the Balkans it will be an appalling war in which hundreds of thousands of people will die and millions will suffer.</P>
    <P>SFOR has been able to do little or nothing to restore refugees to their homes.  It has simply propped up the partition of Bosnia and maintained a temporary and most uneasy peace which neither it nor anybody else believes will last.  It <Col N="529" /> has done nothing to bring to book those accused of genocide before the international tribunal established for that purpose.  I am not saying every one of the accused would be found guilty, but they should at least be tried.  No doubt many of them would be found guilty.</P>
    <P>The record of the international tribunal, through no fault of its own, is a sorry one.  It has found only one person guilty and only a handful of people have been brought before it.  That is not the tribunal's fault.  It depends on the forces mandated by the United Nations, which are under the command of NATO, to arrest and bring such people to trial.  Many of them are charged with killing thousands of people in Srebrenica and other places which are a blot on the conscience of the western world because we stood by and allowed those events to take place.  Even now we are not prepared, although we can easily do so, to arrest those who have been indicated for these crimes.  We are even prepared to see SFOR troops fraternise, as it has been described in newspaper reports over the past year, with indicted war criminals.  That is deeply regrettable and shows that the approach of many western governments to the vindication of human rights is coloured by their economic and political interests rather than by an attachment to such vindication.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed Irish troops are joining a force that is not doing its job and not carrying out its duties.  Nonetheless, I do not underestimate the significance and symbolism of what is happening today.  I am glad it is happening and I support it.  I hope on future occasions we will make a more meaningful contribution to such forces with sufficient numbers of properly armed and equipped combat troops.  Unfortunately we are not in a position to do that today.</P>
    <P>I also hope the passing of this motion will put behind us much of the nonsense and hypocrisy we have had to endure with regard to NATO and our so-called neutrality.  I am glad to acknowledge NATO as the most successful military force ever assembled.  It defended the western world against aggression for almost 50 years with consummate success and through its own strength and the resolution and interdependence of its members. Most successfully of all for a military force, it did so without having to fire a shot.</P>

      <P>There is an unhealthy tendency in Irish society not to debate certain issues.  There is a politically correct view supposedly supported by majority opinion to which we must subscribe, whether it is in relation to the Catholic Church, the Protestant churches, the Unionist view in the North on certain issues or the so-called unified Nationalist view of what should happen on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Security and defence is also an area on which it is difficult to secure rational debate.  In a Chamber such as the Dáil, where we represent the people, these issues should be debated.  I listened with interest to Deputy O'Malley's contribution. <Col N="530" /> He has done the House a singular service by putting forward a view &mdash; not all of which I support &mdash; which is a positive and worthy contribution to this debate.  I wish we could discuss issues of this nature without being dubbed militarists if we do not take the Fianna Fáil line that we must align ourselves with Tadzhikistan &mdash; a country that will probably join Partnership for Peace when its civil war is over &mdash; or isolate ourselves and not participate in such debates.</P>
    <P>Some people claim Ireland has nothing to gain from Partnership for Peace and should have nothing to do with it.  That view has the support of a large number of Members of this House. However, Partnership for Peace is a co-operative security framework.  It does not entail first, second or third class membership of NATO.  It is important to emphasise that participation in PFP entails no treaty obligations of any sort.  Partnership for Peace is fully compatible with our policy of military neutrality.  Austria, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland have already joined as countries that remain outside military alliances.  Each state participating in PFP decides the scope of its own participation, 43 countries, all members of the OSCE, are participating in PFP.  The European states not participating include, for obvious reasons, the three states of Yugoslavia and others that Deputy O'Malley mentioned.  PFP has already become a key forum for peacekeeping co-operation and training involving most of the countries with which Ireland has traditionally cooperated closely in the past.</P>
    <P>We stated in the White Paper that the Government has decided to explore further the benefits that Ireland might derive from participation in PFP and to determine the contribution that Ireland might make to the partnership against the background of the principles set in a later chapter of the White Paper apart from chapter 453, from which I am quoting.  We say also that a decision on participation in PFP will be taken by the Government only in the light of consultations, including with the relevant committees of the Oireachtas, and such a decision will be subject to a motion on the terms and scope of any participation by Ireland being approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is going much further than we are required to do under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It will not happen during this Dáil &mdash; we are in the closing hours of this Dáil, if my intuition is right &mdash; but when we come to debate the issue, let us hear all the arguments for and against and, for heaven's sake, let us hear those arguments in a respectful way.  We can put it before both Houses of the Oireachtas if a future Government decides to do so, but let us not get ourselves tied up in issues like the right of former Warsaw Pact countries to join NATO.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of things Deputy Burke said to which I would like to respond.  Deputy Burke said that the Irish nation is neutral.  That is not so.  Northern Ireland is part of the Irish nation and has been in NATO since 1949.  If the Deputy <Col N="531" /> wants to speak for this State, that is fine.  This is the Parliament of this State, and we are the Government of this State.  However, we do not necessarily speak for everybody in Northern Ireland.  Let us stop talking nonsense about this nation.  We are talking about the State, and that is not the same as the nation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke said that the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, made points with which the Government would not agree.  The Government's position is set out in the White Paper, and everything the Tánaiste said is consistent with that.  If Deputy Burke had heard Deputy O'Malley's speech this morning, he would find it very hard to reconcile it with some of the nonsense he himself went on with.  It was a Fianna Fáil Government that, without debate or discussion, took us into our current status membership of the Western European Union.  Deputy Burke says we have not provided the opportunity for debate.  This Government produced a White Paper on foreign policy, having consulted widely throughout the country.  That White Paper was put before the Houses and committees of the Houses.  The Tánaiste and I and many officials have appeared time and again before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs to update them on the Intergovernmental Conference and deal with questions.  There has been much debate and discussion before any Intergovernmental Conference discussions were entered into by this Government.  As the White Paper makes clear, the Government position on NATO is that we are not seeking or planning to join NATO.  Our policy position is set out, but people like Deputy O'Malley, if they wish to challenge that, are right to do so.  It is time we heard people who have different views expressing their views and having them respected.  I have said where the Government stands on it.  Furthermore, to correct something Deputy Burke said, any outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference in relation to changes in security or defence arrangements in Europe &mdash; and I do not expect that we will be under great pressure to do anything in particular as a result of that &mdash; will be put to the people in a referendum, and there will be no side door or back door entrances by this Government.  The important thing is that we are not under pressure to do anything.  The question is what role we want for Ireland and, furthermore, what role Ireland wants for Europe.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Burke went very far when he condemned the expansion of NATO and the countries which plan to join it.  If we take a decision for ourselves that is fair enough, but what right have we to lecture the people who have suffered in Hungary, the Czech Republic or Poland?  The decision to join NATO is a decision which those states must make for themselves, and if they differ from us in making that decision, we should respect it.  That is something which concerns those states, and they have a right to make <Col N="532" /> that decision.  If they wish to make that decision we should not lecture them.</P>
    <P>We really do need to look at what Deputy O'Malley called the hypocrisy of our position.  I find it difficult to justify some of the talk that has gone on.  I am ashamed of the role of the European Union in dealing with the crisis in the former Yugoslavia where people had their eyes gouged out, their homes burned, their children massacred and where multiple rapes, murders, genocide and mayhem were perpetrated.  That is what happened on our doorstep and all the talk that went on in the European Union did not help those suffering people.  Let us not shed any more crocodile tears on their graves.  The reason we are not speaking German, as well as the odd word of Irish, is that somebody stood up to the tyrant, Hitler.  Tyrants have to be stood up to.  I am not suggesting that the only way to do that is through NATO.  For some states that is the way to do it, but for Ireland we want to make some contribution, and our contribution is evolving.  Our contribution to SFOR is an evolving one.  We may never go the way that some of the African states or the member states of NATO have gone, but we do need to have discussion on the role we want for Ireland and the role Ireland wants for Europe in taking on crises of this kind.  I am glad the House supports this SFOR contingent and the motion to approve sending military policemen to participate in it.  It is a worthy contribution for us to make.  I hope that when the House resumes we will continue to discuss this issue in a respectful manner and that all views are reflected in the debate so that we can play the part in the security of Europe that we wish to play, that we do not do it through a back door but can see clearly what we are doing, where we are going and have agreement on it.</P>

      <P>I support the measure before the House and wish the members of the Permanent Defence Force who take up duty in Bosnia Herzegovina every good fortune.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that so few people have been brought before the war tribunal in The Hague as a result of the horrible civil war in the former Yugoslavia over the past five or six years.  To date only one person has been convicted and that is appalling when the perpetrators are, in many cases, well known.  They come from all sides, the Serbians having been the main offenders, but Muslims and Croatians were also involved.  I just wonder if the tribunal will ever deal with the matter in a significant manner as it should be dealt with.  We are delighted that relative peace has come to the region, although it is an uneasy peace, but it is very worrying that people are allowed to go scot-free when their identity is known.  I hope the Irish force, with forces from NATO and non-NATO countries, will keep the lid on the position there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland should be a member of NATO.  We should be involved in peacekeeping and peace enforcement activities and, while most people <Col N="533" /> would not agree, that view must be taken on board.  We cannot continue to evade our responsibilities in this regard.  The United Nations and NATO protect mankind against tyrants and warmongers such as Saddam Hussein and Hitler. We have a responsibility to protect the humanity of which we are a part.  We benefit from the civilised conditions that exist in most parts of the world today, but we are not doing our duty because we are not getting involved in peace enforcement activities.  I do not agree with neutrality, it does not become us.  It would be regrettable if Fianna Fáil were to make political capital from this issue simply because the majority of the people want us to remain neutral.  It would merely mean making political capital from a humanitarian issue.  Some of us must voice our personal opinions on this matter.  We reap benefits from being members of the European Union and part of the civilised world and we should be willing to return that generosity.</P>
    <P>Representatives of our armed forces have stated they do not want their members coming home in bodybags.  None of us wants our soldiers killed abroad or our peacekeepers or aid workers to suffer.  However, we have a responsibility and if that does not extend to peacekeeping and peace enforcement, I question the relevance of having a national Army.  Would it be better employed maintaining civil order rather than pretending it is prepared to fight wars?  The role of the permanent armed forces must be considered in a realistic light.  We should not fudge issues.  We should not have an Army for the sake of having one when we are not prepared to protect minority or ethnic groups which are in danger.  We must be prepared to get involved in peace enforcement activities and if that means fighting to protect people then so be it.  I make no apologies for holding that point of view.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure.  I hope there are no casualties, but I would like us to change our attitude and strategy.  I would like us to play a role that benefits mankind.  We are currently sidestepping that issue to a considerable degree.</P>

      <P>As Leader of Democratic Left and a Minister in this Government I support the motion before Dáil Éireann to approve a contingent of 50 military police to serve with SFOR, the UN mandated stabilisation force, in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</P>
      <P>I support this motion because it is critically necessary that the people of Bosnia should be enabled to live their lives free from fear and oppression.  It is particularly important that SFOR, the military operation to assist the people of Bosnia, will not run in isolation but will complement a detailed and comprehensive programme of civilian and political and economic reconstruction.  I would not, and Democratic Left would not, support a purely military operation. We have to rebuild civil society in Bosnia, a many sided task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> I hope the Irish contribution can be part of a process which restores everyday life in Bosnia. The decision to support Irish participation in SFOR was not taken lightly, particularly by a party of the left.  The legitimacy and authority for SFOR derives from a UN Security Council resolution and, while this will be the first time Ireland operates under a NATO-led command, delegated by the UN, it is noteworthy that 17 other non-NATO countries, including other neutral and non-aligned countries, will participate.</P>
    <P>The basic issue is the continuation of our strong tradition of participation in peacekeeping operations in a changing geopolitical world.  This is a greatly valued tradition on the left, seen as complementary to a foreign policy that is strong on both human rights and solidarity with the Third World.  Ireland is greatly respected throughout the world for its stance on international peace issues and on international human rights since the foundation of the State.  As Irish people and Europeans we are proud of our record.</P>
    <P>Military neutrality is a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy and Ireland's voice has been strengthened and our influence increased because of it. Traditional Irish neutrality, as it was known in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, is dead.  It began to die when we joined the European Union and is not relevant in its old form since the end of the Cold War.  Democratic Left policy is for a positive neutrality &mdash; a policy that is proactive, not negative and reactionary.  We support a policy that engages in dialogue about security of the European Union and of the world and recognises that military might is not a basis for that security.  It must take account of the destabilisation caused by poverty and disadvantage, particularly in the Third World.</P>
    <P>We believe we should not join NATO.  We believe a peaceful Europe cannot be created through militarism, but we know also that we cannot hope to truly shape a peaceful Europe by turning our backs when we are asked for help. Our fundamental position is that Ireland should commit her military forces in the cause of peacekeeping only under a UN mandate.</P>
    <P>We now have the possibility to assist in the reconstruction of a country which has been devastated by an appalling genocidal war. We have the possibility of helping to bring suspected perpetrators of war crimes to justice.  We not only have a contribution to make to Bosnia, we can learn lessons from what happened there and its consequences.  Such lessons are not only about how sectarianism can spiral into genocide and they can be applied even closer to home than Northern Ireland.  Refugees do not appear in a vacuum.  They are forced to seek refuge from war, civil strife, repression or poverty.  In recent weeks there has been much political and media comment on the apparent increase in the number of non-nationals in Dublin. Many of them are asylum seekers whose applications will be processed under the new <Col N="535" /> Refugee Act.  Others are legal immigrants, and some may be illegal immigrants.</P>
    <P>I suspect that part of the apparent increase may be due to the UK Tories' decision some months ago to cut off the social welfare entitlement of asylum seekers awaiting appeal.  I urge the new Labour Government to reverse that outrageous decision out of common humanity.</P>
    <P>In an era of increasing globalisation, it is inevitable, and not unwelcome, that Ireland will become an increasingly multicultural society. There is a responsibility on all of us, but especially on public representatives, to choose our words with care and to avoid creating or exacerbating tensions.</P>
    <P>I have been extremely concerned at the tone of recent media and political comment.  Ireland is not faced with a flood of economic refugees, as one Deputy opposite recently claimed.  In a European context, the numbers entering this country are very small, and it is not up to any Deputy or any commentator to decide whether a person is an economic refugee or a &ldquo;legitimate asylum seeker&rdquo;.  In the Refugee Act we have an independent decision-making procedure which conforms with best international practice.  Everyone in this House should respect that procedure and not prejudge the merits of any application or group of applications.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have always shown a deep concern for the victims of famine or strife.  That solidarity is exemplified by the excellent work of our development aid organisations, but we cannot simply view these problems at a distance.  We are being challenged to give practical expression to our solidarity by ensuring that those seeking refuge in this country are not met with hostility or prejudice.  Our experience of peacekeeping must serve as an object lesson to us on how our society should behave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the motion, as proposed by the Tánaiste, approving the dispatch of a contingent of the Defence Forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of the Stabilisation Force, SFOR, established under the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1088 of 12 December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SFOR's role is to help the parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina to implement a peace accord to which they have freely agreed and to contribute to a secure environment necessary for the consolidation and stabilisation of peace in the region. The mandate given to SFOR by the UN Security Council follows the precedent of the Implementation Force, lFOR, which was established in late 1995.  In the case of IFOR, the UN Security Council decided that NATO, acting as an appropriate regional organisation under Chapter VIII of the UN Charter, would take the lead in providing unified command and control of the UN authorised multinational force established to implement the above arrangements.  It could be all too easy for us to forget the suffering and strife <Col N="536" /> endured by the people of the former Yugoslavia a very short time ago.  I feel, therefore, that it is incumbent on Ireland to support the ongoing effort to ensure peace and stability in the region.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long tradition of supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations and has been involved in international peacekeeping since 1958.  Irish military personnel have built up a considerable reputation as peacekeepers.  As a small country we can be proud of our record in terms of peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>With the exception of our participation in UNOSOM II in Somalia in 1993, all Irish participation in UN missions has been mandated under Chapter VI of the UN Charter.  The Security Council has endowed SFOR with a Chapter VII mandate, that is to say it is entitled to use force to implement its mandate, to separate parties in the event of a resumption of hostilities or to protect itself.  SFOR's rules of engagement reflect this mandate and are based on the principle of minimum use of force.  This protective element of the Chapter VII mandate is now becoming the norm in UN peacekeeping operations.  Troop contributing countries are increasingly unwilling to commit troops to UN operations unless there is a Chapter VII authorisation to enable the peacekeeping force to take all necessary measures to protect itself.  Thankfully the situation in this region is relatively stable at present and it is everybody's earnest wish that it should continue so.</P>
    <P>There are at present 16 NATO countries and 19 non-NATO countries contributing to SFOR. Should the Dáil now approve the dispatch of a Defence Forces contingent, Ireland would be the 20th non-NATO country to contribute.  There is at present a requirement for a military police contingent at SFOR HQ, based at Sarajevo.  The Irish Defence Forces are in a position to meet this need by the provision of 50 personnel.  The Irish military police element would assume the functions of the International Military Police Company at SFOR HQ in Sarajevo.  This international military police company will consist of company HQ and three MP platoons.  Ireland has been asked to provide the company HQ and one of the platoons.  The Irish military police would perform the normal range of military police duties for SFOR HQ in Sarajevo, where approximately 8,000 are stationed.  Their duties would include, <i>inter alia,</i> liaison with local police and the UN International Police Task Force or IPTF.  There are 30 members of the Garda Síochána serving there who will shortly be joined by a further five members.</P>
    <P>The tasks to be undertaken by the Defence Forces military police are duties for which they are already well trained and in which they are experienced.  The composition of the Irish contingent would be the MP company HQ, totalling 16 personnel, the MP platoon totalling 27, and a national support element consisting of six personnel.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland is entitled to appoint an <Col N="537" /> officer to the SFOR Command at the rank of lieutenant colonel who would be the national contingent commander.  Each nation participating in SFOR is also invited to appoint a military liaison officer to the SFOR Co-ordination Cell at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe, SHAPE, at Mons, Belgium.  It is proposed that an officer at the rank of lieutenant colonel would be appointed for the duration of the participation of an Irish contingent in the mission.  In total, the Irish deployment to SFOR would consist of 50 all ranks in SFOR HQ in Sarajevo, with one military liaison officer assigned to SHAPE in Mons.</P>
    <P>The Irish contingent would be equipped with the necessary transport and equipment to discharge its role.  In this regard it is intended that suitable and appropriate light transport will be dispatched with the contingent as well as certain technical backup equipment.  Deputies may feel that our contribution is not very large in terms of numbers, but I assure the House that the contribution which we propose to make is a valuable one in terms of existing requirements in SFOR and is one which I am aware would be greatly welcomed by the force.  It will be appreciated that the position at SFOR headquarters being offered to the Irish contingent is a prestigious one, offered undoubtedly on the basis of the Defence Forces' outstanding reputation as peacekeepers.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the contingent would be deployed within approximately two months following Dáil approval.  The pre-departure period is required for personnel selection, processing and administrative arrangements, etc.  An advance party could, however, be deployed to the mission area within one month and the remainder would follow as quickly as possible.  Personnel would be recruited on a voluntary basis.  The Irish commitment to SFOR would continue until the expiry of the force's mandate, as set out in Security Council Resolution 1088, currently envisaged for mid-1998. It is proposed that rotations would be at approximately six-month intervals.  The contingent would not be withdrawn without four months' prior notice unless otherwise agreed.</P>
    <P>SFOR has been reduced in size to half of that of IFOR's strength, to 31,000, in the light of the major diminution of the likelihood of the force coming under attack.  Currently the main risk to SFOR personnel in the area of operations is posed by landmines and road traffic accidents.  In recommending that Ireland would contribute a military police contingent to SFOR HQ in Sarajevo, safety and security factors, including the specific function of the military police in SFOR, which is effectively a supporting role, were taken fully into account.  The MP element will be armed and equipped for their personal protection to carry out this supporting role.  I would not be happy to commit troops to any mission where their task would be unclear and where they would be exposed to unacceptable risks.  I am satisfied that the proposed role of the contingent of Defence Forces Military Police would be in keeping <Col N="538" /> with their training and experience to date both at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>I fully agree that a contingent of the Defence Forces should participate in this mission.  I support involvement in this worthy mission, notwithstanding the fact that all troop contributing countries, including Ireland, must bear their own costs. Command and control of this UN mandated force is vested in NATO as the appropriate regional organisation, as was also the case in relation to lFOR.  While the SFOR mission operates under a UN Security Council mandate and reports on a monthly basis to the Security Council, participation of the Defence Forces in SFOR would place Irish troops under NATO command for the first time and this may cause some concern in certain quarters.  The participation of other neutral countries such as Finland, Sweden and Austria, of non-NATO countries such as Russia and of non-European non-aligned countries indicates that military neutrality has not been an issue in the context of IFOR and SFOR.  The overriding consideration is the critical need to create peace and stability in this troubled region.</P>
    <P>The Irish contingent, once in the area of operations, would serve under the operational control of the NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and his designated force commander for SFOR and would be subject to NATO rules of engagement.  Non-NATO nations, including Ireland, would retain national command of their contingents.  The Irish military authorities, through the Irish contingent commander, would take the necessary measures to ensure the maintenance of proper discipline, would retain exclusive criminal jurisdiction for the Irish contingent, and the Irish contingent, as a non-NATO contingent, would enjoy the same rights, privileges and immunities as are provided for in the status of forces agreements that have been signed between NATO and the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.</P>
    <P>The operational, logistical and financial arrangements for possible Defence Forces participation in SFOR have now been fully clarified and the requirement for a 50 strong military police contingent has been identified by NATO as being the most pressing need within the force which would correspond with the resources which Ireland could possibly provide.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied Ireland should contribute to this worthy mission in support of the war weary people of the former Yugoslavia by providing a contingent of 50 military police personnel who are well trained and suitably experienced to undertake this task.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the point about why Ireland cannot deploy more than 50 Defence Forces personnel to SFOR, which I would like to address.  There is a requirement for a military police contingent at SFOR HQ and that requirement has been communicated by the relevant SFOR authorities.  The Defence Forces are in a position to meet that need by providing 50 personnel.</P>
    <P>The level of overseas participation is kept <Col N="539" /> under constant review to ensure that security needs at home can be met at all times and the cost to the Defence Vote does not become excessive. Unlike other missions in which we have participated in the past, such as those in the Lebanon, Ireland will bear the cost of this mission.</P>
    <P>At present there are 711 personnel serving overseas and, in line with the decision of the Government last year regarding participation in UNSAS, Ireland would be constrained to committing a maximum of approximately 850 troops serving overseas at any given time.  Each country participating in this mission is obliged to bear its costs.  I hope that answers Deputy O'Malley's question.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992 (Assignment of Function)&mdash;Order, 1997,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 30th April, 1997.</P>
      <P>Section 5(2)(a) of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, provides that the institute shall have such other functions, which may include the function of conferring degrees, postgraduate degrees and honorary awards, as may be assigned to it, from time to time, by order made by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  Section 5(2)(c) of the said Act provides that:</P>
      <P>Whenever an order is proposed to be made under this subsection, a draft of the proposed order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
      <P>Consideration of this order by the Houses of the Oireachtas, following the successful completion of the review group process on degree awarding status, is another step in the history of the DlT.</P>
      <P>I am happy to return to this House with this draft order so soon after the future of the Dublin Institute of Technology has been debated here. This House has had a very important role and most effective input into the formulation of policy on higher education.  I look forward to a very informed and illuminating debate today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress my role in initiating this process.  I put the formal mechanism to evaluate the institute for degree awarding powers in place.  I asked the Higher Education Authority to establish an international review team to recommend whether degree awarding powers should be given to the <Col N="540" /> Dublin Institute of Technology.  This was not a general review of the legislation governing the operation of the institute, rather it dealt in some detail with the important issue of degree awarding powers.</P>
    <P>The review group recommended principally that the Dublin Institute of Technology be granted authority to award its degrees in respect of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, with effect from the academic year 1998-9.  The Higher Education Authority endorsed this recommendation. The group also recommended that the system of quality assurance and quality improvement in the Dublin Institute of Technology should be subject to periodic review and that the Dublin Institute of Technology should ensure that its organisational structures and processes are firmly in place and operating effectively.</P>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the international review team, the order we are discussing here, when signed, will formally grant degree awarding powers from 1998 onwards.  The draft order assigns to the institute the function of conferring degrees, postgraduate degrees and honorary awards with effect from 1 September 1998. The effective date of 1 September 1998 is to allow the institute time to put the necessary procedures in place.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee entered a partnership agreement with the University of Dublin in 1975 whereby a number of college diplomas were recognised by the university for the award of its degrees.  Since that time, more than 8,000 Dublin Institute of Technology graduates have become eligible for degree awards of the University of Dublin.  The institute has developed academic links with other universities in recent years, including Dublin City University and University College, Dublin.  Postgraduate degree programmes have also been initiated by the institute in collaboration with a number of universities within the European Union.</P>
    <P>All this is evidence that the institute has more than 20 years active experience in a rigorous course evaluation process where new course programmes are proposed for degree recognition. An academic council has been functioning in the institute since 1970 before being established on a statutory basis under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992 and in recent years the institute has put considerable effort into the development of its quality assurance procedures. These developments are further evidence of the institute's endeavour and commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>Conferral of degree awarding powers on the institute must also be seen in the context of the policy framework set out in the White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future.  The White Paper sets out the Government's approach for the overall development of the higher education sector and, in particular, for the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It notes that developments in higher education in <Col N="541" /> Ireland, particularly over the past 20 years, have been based on a differentiated system of third level education.  One part is formed by the universities and the designated institutions under the Higher Education Authority, with State funding allocated by the Authority.  The other part includes the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology, with State funding allocated directly by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The White Paper clearly states that &ldquo;the diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements&rdquo;.  The White Paper further outlines in relation to course provision in the Dublin Institute of Technology that:</P>
    <P>Particular considerations apply to the Dublin Institute of Technology, given its historical development, size and present academic profile. The work currently under way to create a single unified Institute, including the establishment of appropriate academic and administrative structures, will be continued and completed. Given the existing level of degree provision in the Institute, the guidelines in relation to the balance of provision will allow for more degree provision than in Regional Technical Colleges generally, while still maintaining a substantial level of provision at certificate and diploma level.</P>
    <P>The institute has, since its statutory establishment in 1993, made great progress in building a single integrated institution.  It has a vital role to play, not only in the Dublin region but throughout the country, in providing a comprehensive and high quality range of third level programmes. Conferral of degree awarding powers on the institute will greatly enhance its already high academic standing both nationally and internationally and will meet the growing need for the highest possible attainment in educational standards. I take this opportunity to again congratulate the DlT on the progress which it has made since 1992.  It has a vital role in higher education in providing qualifications at certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate levels.  Building on its legislative base, put in place in 1993, it has made major strides with the active support of my Department.</P>
    <P>I stress my commitment in my time as Minister to the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Staffing and student numbers have increased substantially in this time and many new courses at certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate level have been developed.  There is now recurrent funding of over £50 million in this academic year.  In addition since 1993 over £18.5 million of capital funding has been invested.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention two further elements of the recommendations of the review group.  It recommended that the funding and oversight of the Dublin Institute of Technology be transferred <Col N="542" /> from the Department of Education to the Higher Education Authority as soon as possible.  There is a commitment to this in the White Paper.  The appropriate legislative and administrative changes will be brought forward to bring the Dublin Institute of Technology and the technological sector as a whole under the aegis of a reconstituted Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>The report of the review team also recommended that the relevant authorities should consider whether the key features of the universities legislation should be extended to the Dublin Institute of Technology and its legislation amended in the light of such analysis.  This was in the context of a reference to the devolution of increased levels of responsibility under the universities legislation so that institutions could run their affairs within budgetary and staffing constraints, subject to appropriate statutory obligations in relation to the discharge of those responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Arising from this, the Dublin Institute of Technology made a strong case for inclusion in the Universities Bill, 1996, over the past few months. The Universities Bill provides, for the first time, a statutory mechanism in section 9 for the recognition of a third level institution as a university.  I listened carefully and with interest to its views and have announced that when the Universities Bill becomes law, I will request the Government to appoint a body pursuant to section 9 to advise the Government on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university, the Dublin Institute of Technology should be established as a university.  The outcome of that process will be for consideration on another day.  Today is a momentous day and I ask the House to approve this draft order and thus support the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the laying of this order before the House which gives the Dublin Institute of Technology the power to award its own degrees and diplomas.  This is the culmination of a long process and marks the surrender of the Minister to a campaign which has been under way for some time.  Deputy Keogh and I must reflect on events as they have unfolded over the past three months.  During Committee Stage of the Universities Bill, the Minister held steadfast against any concessions to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  However, the sustained campaign of its students, parents and staff resulted in this order being laid before the House.  It is a good illustration of how the confluence of events, the imminence of a general election and an outstanding campaign by the students and staff has resulted in concession after concession over the past six weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not sad, it is a day to celebrate because this is a victory for democracy.  Today <Col N="543" /> illustrates that the Parliament can still work.  A combination of parliamentary pressure by Opposition parties on Committee Stage of the Universities Bill and the campaign organised by the students and staff of the college resulted in the Minister having urgent rethinks on the position and future of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage of the Universities Bill the Minister made no concession on the utilisation and application of the legislation to the Dublin Institute of Technology and its future as a university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Was section 9 included for no reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 relates to any new university. The Minister then went to Seanad Éireann where the numbers concentrated the mind because Independent Senators with the Fianna Fáil spokesperson, Senator Ormonde, tabled amendments on the Dublin Institute of Technology.  To get the Bill through the Seanad where the numbers were tighter, she had to make another concession to the Dublin Institute of Technology, which I welcome.  The concession provided for the appointment of a review body to consider the case the Dublin Institute of Technology made for university status.  The chronology of events is there for all to see.  Concession after concession was made when political pressure was applied.</P>
      <P>The most important breakthrough came when the Minister faced a difficulty with numbers in the Seanad.  It is a pity she did not do this in a more proactive way on Committee Stage in this House.  The Minister has been responsible for the Department of Education for five years but Deputy Séamus Brennan put the Dublin Institute of Technology on this platform and introduced the Dublin Institute of Technology Act and the framework for this order which was to have been introduced within two to three years of the Act being passed.  This is happening now because the college developed an effective campaign.  We are facing an election and something urgent had to be done.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed resources have not been put in place to support the Dublin Institute of Technology's case.  There was no announcement of additional resources being provided from this year's Estimate.  Notwithstanding the progress the Dublin Institute of Technology has made, there are considerable difficulties in providing resources for new buildings and facilities for the music faculty and physical education facilities for the students.  Today's announcement reflects an incoherent approach to the third level sector.  The Minister issued press release after press release when lobby groups emerged from each side without any coherent vision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that the increase in internationally placed manufacturing and services industries that occurred through the 1970s and 1980s resulted from the 10 per cent corporation profits tax rate and that he is taking a very extensive gamble in proposing to increase that rate by 25 per cent to 12.5 per cent?  Will the Minister of State give the House the figures for the last two decades?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question sought the number of persons at work in manufacturing industries since the 1930s.  I have that information compiled on a census basis: the number of people working in manufacturing industry increased from 138,100 in 1936 to 246,500 in 1996.  A number of factors operate here: we have a very vigorous, well educated, young workforce; a very stable industrial relations climate and the perception that because of our good economic performance, Ireland is considered to be a good place to locate by investors.  Last but not least we offer a <Col N="545" /> variety of inducements and incentives which make it worthwhile from the point of view of indigenous and foreign industry to locate here. Therefore, to isolate any one element would be to highlight that to the detriment of the perceived contribution of others.  Cumulatively, all of these factors gave rise to our tremendous economic performance which the ESRI predicts will last into the next decade at least.</P>

      <P>It will last particularly with a change of Government.</P>
      <P>I welcome the success of many Governments since the 1930s to the point at which we have now 246,500 employed in manufacturing industry. Those employed at the International Financial Services Centre would add to those figures.  Having served as Minister for Industry and Commerce and travelled abroad to attract foreign investment, I accept the package of measures the Minister mentioned were most important &mdash; the education system initiated by the late Donogh O'Malley, the stability wrought under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in 1987 &mdash; and have added to this success.  In negotiation with potential investors does he agree the commitment to a 10 per cent corporation profits tax rate by successive Governments has been a fundamental attraction and, if so, does he not consider the Government is making a gross mistake in proposing to increase that rate by 25 per cent in the dying days of its administration?  On re-election to Government, we will rescind that decision?</P>

Ag éirí as sin, mar shampla i gcas Inis Bó Finne ceadaíodh staidéar féidireachta.

      <P>Maidir le piara Cleggan, cuireadh £20,000 ar fáil i 1996 chun staideár féidireachta ar an phiara a fhorbairt á dhéanamh do Roinn na Mara.

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if, in his capacity as chair of the Government's committee on Sellafield, his attention has been drawn to the discovery of contamination from Sellafield in the Canadian Arctic; and the steps, if any, the Government has taken to enlist the support of the Canadian Government and other affected Governments in order to internationalise the campaign against Sellafield.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report published in the edition of 10 May of the <i>New Scientist</i> which states that new Canadian data indicates that radioactivity from Sellafield has spread through the Arctic Ocean into the waters of northern Canada and that the contamination is greater than that caused by fallout from nuclear weapons testing and radioactivity released during the Chernobyl accident.  Data from the study is due to be presented at an international conference on radioactivity in the Arctic which will be held next month.  These findings will be assessed by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to determine their significance in the Irish context.  The Government co-operates with other states sharing its position on nuclear safety issues.  The case for initiating further co-operative efforts on foot of the Canadian study will be considered in light of the publication of the findings and the detailed assessment by the RPII of the impacts involved.</P>

      <P>While I understand the Minister is waiting for the conference where the full facts and figures will be published, the people who have carried out the research are making available their findings to whoever wants them.  Up to now we have been a lone voice in our opposition to Sellafield and this is an opportunity for us to internationalise the issue.  If the emissions are evident in Canadian waters, they are probably also in waters off the United States of America.  I understand the Minister wishes to wait, but from speaking to people who carried out the research &mdash; the head of that department is in Europe at present and I could not speak to him &mdash; they will make available the figures.  I hope our bodies are working on those figures so that they can brief the Minister before the conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is greater contamination from Sellafield than from nuclear arms programmes and Chernobyl, <Col N="550" /> although there has been practically no contamination from a similar facility in France.  The levels of emissions from Sellafield are alarming. We should question the continued operation of the Sellafield plant.  I hope the Minister will press for internationalisation of the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree with the Deputy that this issue needs to be internationalised.  As Minister for the Environment, I repeatedly raised this matter at the European Council and at the European Conference on the Environment held in Sofia.  It is not right to say we are a lone voice on this issue.  I have tried to build allies among the latest European Union members.  Austria is very concerned about nuclear power plants operating on its borders, particularly within the Czech Republic.  This issue is an international one.</P>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about the most recent data.  It is simply an advanced brief on information to be presented to a conference to be held in Norway next month.  Mr. Per Strand of the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority reported that the pattern of discharges from Sellafield shows peaks in discharges from Sellafield in 1975, 1977 and 1980.  Each of those peaks was replicated four years later in the Barents Sea as the radioactive plume worked its way into northern waters.  It is absolutely clear from the limited information available &mdash; I have arranged for the Government to be represented at the conference so that we will have the full data first hand &mdash; that the impact of Sellafield is not confined to the Irish Sea.  I hope to build alliances that will continue to put pressure not only on the operation of Sellafield by British Nuclear Fuels Limited but on the entire British nuclear programme, which continues to pose an unacceptable risk to the health and well-being of the people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the support of smaller non-nuclear countries in Europe, but if we had the Canadian and American Governments behind us in this campaign it would strengthen our hand.  For example, the involvement of the US in pushing to bring about a resolution in Northern Ireland has been productive.  If it was brought to the attention of the Canadian and American public that their waters are being contaminated by a plant in England, there would be a public outcry and pressure would be put on the British Government to resolve the issue.  We should use every means at our disposal to bring about the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's remarks. By way of evidence of the ongoing work of the Government in highlighting at every international forum our concern about Sellafield and its impact on Irish coastal and international waters, at a heads of delegation OSPAR Convention meeting which is ongoing in London Ireland has called on the contracting parties to reduce immediately the <Col N="551" /> current discharges of technetium 99 from Sellafield to their pre-1994 discharge levels and ultimately to eliminate them entirely through the urgent development and application of best techniques. We will use the OSPAR Convention and the International Maritime Organisation resolutions to put pressure to bear to reduce the negative impact environmentally of Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I look with great interest at this new dimension which shows the potential damage from Sellafield stretches well beyond our understanding of it, the immediate waters surrounding Ireland, the Irish Sea and the North Sea, impacting on Canada and perhaps the United States of America.  We will raise these matters bilaterally with those nations and multilaterally at every forum available to us.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if he has already or if he intends to change planning and development Acts in relation to local authority activities.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The carrying out of development by a local authority in its functional area is exempted development under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1993, and is not therefore subject to normal planning procedures.  For major classes of development, however, not subject to environmental impact assessment, local authorities are obliged to give notice of such developments under the provisions of Part Ten of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations.  Submissions or observations on the proposal must be sought and the plans must be available for inspection by the public during a period of not less than one month.  A report on the proposal must then be prepared, including details of any submissions or observations received.  This report must be submitted to the elected members of the local authority concerned which has discretion, under section 3 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1995, to direct that the proposed development is not to proceed.</P>
      <P>The Part Ten procedure was introduced in 1994 after full consideration and in the context of changes to planning law relating to development carried out by public bodies generally.  From experience, it is an open and democratic procedure and I have no immediate plans to replace it in terms of local authority development generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a local authority proposes to carry out development which is subject to environmental impact assessment under the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, it is required to submit an environmental impact statement to the Minister for the Environment for certification.  Arising from the recent commencement of a system of licensing for waste disposal activities under the Waste Management <Col N="552" /> Act, 1996, local authority landfill development will be subject to licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency.  In line with this, I intend that the present system of certification by the Minister of environmental impact assessments for landfill development by a local authority will be terminated. The relevant provisions in Part Nine of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, are in the process of being amended to give effect to this change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware serious conflicts have arisen in various parts of the country because local authorities &mdash; under the system which arose from the 1994 Act &mdash; are in breach of their own development plans?  There have been a number of instances of this, including one in Carlow, in relation to a housing development which the local authority proposes to build.  Is the Minister considering a change in the planning and development laws to ensure a local authority is subject to the same planning and development procedures as a private developer or an individual in areas such as housing, halting sites and landfill?  Serious conflicts are arising in various places because the local authority is applying one set of rules to the private citizen and yet is in breach of the rules itself.  This brings the whole system of planning and development into disrepute. Will the Minister agree there is a need to look at this and to change the law accordingly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any great number of conflicts of the type which the Deputy described.  In a previous existence Deputy Dempsey will be aware of conflicts where State bodies were exempt from the normal rules of planning and were required simply to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That has changed in relation to State bodies.  We had a major national controversy on that issue in the past and the law was subsequently changed to provide for full planning permission in all such cases.  That is a good thing. As a matter of principle we are moving towards that for everybody.  There are practical difficulties in relation to housing.  Ordinary citizens would probably not regard it as a reasonably objective analysis of a planning application if a local authority had to go through its own planning department and the ultimate decision was made by the manager.  That would not be a fair and open system. That is why, in relation to other matters, the Part 10 procedure requires public consultation and ultimately it is in the hands of the elected membership to determine by way of vote.  That has worked well in a number of major projects whether road widenings, developments of infrastructure and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of halting sites, every Government Department has looked at the implications of the recommendations of the report of the task force on the travelling community.  So far as it affects <Col N="553" /> my Department a Bill is being drafted to provide for such matters as halting sites.  No doubt that will be published in due course and will be debated here.</P>
    <P>On the issue of landfill, it is correct to move the licensing regime from local authorities which, up to now, could determine their own planning permissions for the establishment of a landfill. That is no longer the case.  As and from 1 May they have to apply to the Environmental Protection Agency for a licence for any new landfill.  It would be invidious if the determination of an environmental impact assessment remained with the Minister for the Environment if the determination of a licence is now a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency.  Accordingly, I intend to amend the regulations to have the licence and the EIA determined by the agency. That will result in a more coherent analysis of any future project.  Given that under the Waste Management Act the Environmental Protection Agency will be responsible for monitoring licensing conditions we will have a cleaner, more environmentally sustainable future pattern of waste disposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the 1994 Act with which we are both familiar.  Will he agree it is invidious the State and State Departments have to apply for planning permission for some worthy projects such as schools, Garda barracks and so on while a local authority can build 40, 50 or 100 houses by going through a procedure which nobody believes is independent or democratic?  I agree there is a role for An Bord Pleanála with regard to local authority planning applications.  In regard to the Bill the Minister proposes, is it intended to change the planning and development laws on the provision of halting sites or will it enable the Minister to direct local authorities to provide a certain number of halting sites?  I am curious about the exact effect of the Bill being proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which is only in draft form will provide a comprehensive strategy nationwide to deal with halting sites.  By and large it will mirror the recommendation of the task force and will enjoy widespread support from the House when we have an opportunity to debate it.</P>
      <P>Section 39 of the 1963 Act prohibits a local authority from carrying out any development which would contravene materially its development plan.  Local authorities are obliged to have regard to their development plans.  The local authority has the power to amend or vary the development plan but subject to a period of public notification and consultation.  Given that I would like to see an independent validation system for all proposed developments I will take advice on the points raised by Deputy Dempsey.  I can understand that there could be some disquiet about aspects of the rights of local authorities to make decisions without some independent vetting. That is a matter we can revisit.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>the new steps, if any, his Department proposes to take in the horrific number of fatal road accidents to effect a reduction of the number of fatal accidents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The rising trend in road accident numbers and fatalities is a matter of grave concern to me and to all the Departments and agencies involved in road safety.</P>
      <P>The disimprovement which began in the summer of 1995, when accident numbers shot up in comparison with previous years, has continued throughout 1996 and 1997.  This trend must be viewed against the backdrop of a significant increase in kilometres travelled and in the number of registered vehicles on our roads.  That offers no consolation to those involved in road traffic accidents and their families and friends. Every accident is one too many.</P>
      <P>For that reason I have endeavoured to step up road safety measures on an ongoing basis and have reported on individual initiatives to the House in recent months.  The Road Safety Together strategy, introduced last year, is focused on all the critical areas &mdash; engineering, enforcement, education and encouragement &mdash; and is directed at all the responsible agencies and all road users who must work together to seek new ways to tackle the problem.  Specific initiatives I have taken in recent months include the introduction of on-the-spot fines for speeding offences, the publication of a traffic signs manual, the issue of a new guide to road safety engineering and the development of a road safety initiative at county level.  I have also provided support for the establishment of a driver instructor register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wide range of road safety measures being implemented on a continuous year round basis aims at making our roads safer for all road users. Enforcement is a critical element of any strategy. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, has assured the House the Garda authorities are committed to a rigorous enforcement of the road traffic Acts throughout the year.  I welcome the proposal of the Garda Commissioner to set up, at an early date, a national traffic policy bureau for traffic policing on a national basis to ensure a coordinated <Col N="555" /> and policy driven approach by all gardaí to the enforcement of traffic law.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, permit me to join the Minister and Deputy Ryan in their tributes to you for the intelligent, independent and gracious manner in which you have discharged your duties at all times.  You will be missed and fondly remembered.  When we are back after the election, I am sure we will often talk of how we enjoyed Question Time under your stewardship and how, at all times, you upheld and enhanced the reputation of this House which is the seat of Irish democracy.</P>

      <P>You deserve it and a lot more.</P>
      <P>I thank and acknowledge the Minister's efforts but 24 people were killed on our roads last week. Will the Minister accept that there would be universal, international outrage if that number of people had been killed as a result of terrorist activity?  However, there is scarcely a whimper when they are killed on our roads.</P>
      <P>Last year, 456 people were killed on our roads. That is equivalent to the population of an average provincial town.  Will the Minister accept that, whatever the extent of the measures he has implemented, they are not achieving the desired result?  Will he also accept the need for a new package, an intensification of existing efforts and the establishment of a new body to assess the effectiveness of the package?  Such a body could report to the Department and confirm whether the package is having the desired effect or whether other measures are required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noticed that the Deputy has managed to have the same statement appear in the national press on successive Mondays.  That is no mean feat.  This is an extremely important and difficult issue.  To give the Deputy a blunt answer, I am deeply depressed that the figures for fatalities and accidents are going up.  I have the statistics in terms of increased traffic volumes and kilometres <Col N="556" /> travelled.  For example, 18,000 million vehicle kilometres were travelled in Ireland in 1978 when 628 people died.  In 1995, the most recent year for which figures are available, 31,000 million vehicle kilometres were travelled, a 72 per cent increase, yet the number of deaths decreased by 30 per cent to 437.  When one thinks of 437 fatalities in 1995 or 456 last year, this is a horrendous toll.  It is a nightmare to see the television pictures or visit the family of a victim one knew. I am open to any suggestion which would help reduce these figures.</P>
      <P>Having consulted in detail the Minister for Justice, I am strongly of the view that enforcement must be a major part of our response.  I am heartened by the increased enforcement, such as the use of unmarked Garda vehicles on major roads. As a result of the investment in some of these roads, it is possible to travel at very high speeds. There has been a huge increase in the number of on-the-spot fines for speeding.  The problem with enforcement is that many accidents occur in the middle of the night or the early hours of the morning and it is difficult to implement a comprehensive enforcement regime on every road, 24 hours a day.</P>
      <P>The National Safety Council has a strong role to play in pulling the strands together.  I have appointed a new chairman to the council and specifically instructed him to focus on road safety as a priority to see what more can be done to improve the statistics and what other ideas exist internationally which could be applied to Ireland. That will be done.  If the Deputy has any further suggestions which would reduce the fatalities, even by one, I would be delighted to take them on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>This is too serious an issue with which to play party politics and I would not do so. The Minister spoke about the television pictures. However, I talk about the anguish of bereaved families, many of whom I have met.  Last week there were a number of fatalities involving motor cyclists.  Will the Minister consider the introduction of a national training programme for motor cyclists similar to the compulsory basic training scheme in Britain?  This programme has proved effective in reducing motor cycle fatalities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Data such as this does not lend itself to monthly analysis.  There can be a dreadful incident and then a month without any incident. There has to be an ongoing evaluation and implementation of good ideas, improving all the elements which contribute to improved road safety, for example, improved road standards, markings, signage, lighting, enforcement, education and exhortation.  Taken together, these measures will have the desired impact and I assure the Deputy of my constant efforts to address this issue in a comprehensive manner. That is why I introduced the Road Safety Together strategy, which pulls together all the elements and agencies such as the National Safety Council, the Garda Síochána, local authorities, the insurance industry and everyone with an interest in improving these awful statistics.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>the implications, if any, for Ireland of the recent announcement of a reduction from 85 per cent to 80 per cent in funding for water schemes under the EU Cohesion Funds.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13115/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>European Council Regulation (EC) No. 1164/94 establishing the Cohesion Fund states that &ldquo;the rate of Community assistance granted by the Fund shall be 80% to 85% of public or equivalent expenditure&rdquo;.  The Commissioner for Regional Affairs wrote to the Minister for Finance on 21 March stating that the Commission wished to reduce the aid rate for environment projects that have not yet been approved for Cohesion Funding from 85 per cent to 80 per cent.  This was stated by the Commissioner to have arisen mainly from the substantial over-supply of environment projects for Cohesion Funding and a concern that the abolition of domestic water charges may be contrary to &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle.  The Minister for Finance has written to the Commissioner requesting that the Commission review the matter in light of a fuller consideration of the new arrangements for funding local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A marginal reduction in the aid rate for projects not yet approved would not reduce the overall level of funding available to Ireland for environment projects.  The overall level of funding for environment projects is set to increase significantly for the remaining years of the Cohesion Fund; a reduced aid rate would simply mean that the total aid available would have to be applied to a larger number of projects.  Deputies will be <Col N="558" /> delighted to know that more projects will be approved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the European Commission has not adopted a final and definitive position on the matter and that it is still open to negotiation?  Will the Minister confirm that the State will have to spend an extra £60 million to draw down the existing level of EU funding, £800 million approximately, for environment projects because of the proposed change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on the way one looks at it.  In essence, there are three mechanisms from which to fund sanitary services and environment projects &mdash; the Cohesion Fund, Structural Funds and own resources.  The bulk of projects are funded from the Cohesion Fund.  The overall budget for the Cohesion Fund, in 1992 figures, is 15,150 million ECU or £12,120 million at an exchange rate of one ECU = 80p.  Ireland's share is approximately 9 per cent or approximately £1.1 billion which is distributed in the ratio of 50:50 between environment and transport projects. There is a move, however, to alter the ratio to 40:60 in favour of environment projects.  To date, 12 water projects have been approved at a cost of more than £160 million.  A further 35 waste water projects have also been approved at a cost of £290 million.</P>
      <P>This year we are spending approximately £40 million of our own resources to close the gap in funding of 20 per cent.  We are drawing down every available penny which means that more projects will be approved.  To comply with our own environmental standards and waste water directives all necessary projects will have to be approved between now and 2005 and will be funded through a combination of own resources, Cohesion Funds and Structural Funds.  I am heartened that so many projects have been advanced during the past two years.  In the context of the mid-term review and in discussions on the next round of Cohesion Funds I hope to be in a position to make a strong case in seeking the maximum amount for Ireland for infrastructural developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, it all depends on the way one looks at it.  There is no doubt that Irish Governments are well able to draw down the maximum amount for this country. Is it not the case that to draw down the existing level of £800 million at an aid rate of 85 per cent, only £941 million had to be expended? Because of the proposed change, under which the aid rate will be 80 per cent, £1 billion will have to be expended.  This means the taxpayer will have to find an extra £60 million.  The Minister may have difficulty in following what I am saying but I am using round figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong and he knows it.  We are spending a huge sum of money. There are three components &mdash; Cohesion Funds, Structural Funds and own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We can draw down the same amount by spending £40 million this year.  Every project does not qualify for Cohesion Funding.  It is simply a matter of readjusting the percentages. We will spend the same amount on more projects and of a different type.  The amount we are spending is sufficient to draw down the maximum EU funding available, even at the reduced rate which applies to new projects only.  It is not that complicated and I know the Deputy understands what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very complicated.  Was it Disraeli who said there are three kinds of lies &mdash; lies, damn lies and statistics?  Even an ordinary citizen like myself can understand that if we receive less from Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the taxpayer will have to pay more to close the gap following the reduction in the aid rate from 85 per cent to 80 per cent.  By my calculations, the taxpayer will have to find an extra £60 million.  Will the Minister accept there will be a substantial increase in the running costs of these plants when they come on stream which will have to be carried fully by either the taxpayer or the commercial ratepayer?  Will the Minister agree that any cavalier action taken by the Government which puts at risk drawing down maximum funding from Europe will be paid for dearly by the taxpayer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy began her question by saying there are lies, damn lies and statistics and then went on to prove the point.  I will repeat what I said for those who do not hear or refuse to listen.</P>
      <P>The total Cohesion Funding available is £1.1 billion and every penny of this will be drawn down and used for good projects.  The Deputy is being deliberately wrong when she says we will lose money.  She knows that every penny of Cohesion Funding will be drawn down.  Nobody is suggesting that this will not be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows full well that every penny of the £1.1 billion will be drawn down.</P>
      <P>I intend arguing trenchantly in favour of &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle in relation to the regime which was in place and of which the Deputy is so fond, that is, charging for water by way of a water tax which was in no way related to the concept of &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle as understood in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy knocks on doors in Cork North-Central she will be asked why she wants to reintroduce this charge.  If I were the Deputy I would focus my attention on that matter rather than on trying to score points in the House.</P>
      <P>The Government made the right decision to abolish this tax which was not environmentally or socially progressive.  I am confident that the Government will be returned to office but if that does not happen I predict that no other Government will reintroduce this tax, despite the arguments put forward by the Progressive Democrats Party.  If that party tries to reintroduce this unpopular and socially and environmentally regressive tax the electorate will give it a very clear message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party introduced the tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party and this Government abolished it.</P>
      <P>It is clear that every available penny of Cohesion Funding will be drawn down so that there will be no loss to the Exchequer.  To put it another way, if a person who has to build 100 houses receives a fixed grant it is irrelevant how the money is distributed as long as the houses are built.  We have to build a sewage treatment facility and install a water supply for every urban centre.  However, the building blocks are constantly moving, so to speak.  Those involved in schemes bid for Cohesion Funding and if they are rejected they are considered for regional funding, Structural Funding and finally domestic funding. This happens all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> Every penny of Cohesion Funding will be drawn down.  The maximum investment is taking place.  I have announced an investment in water projects of £150 million which is by far the largest investment in water and sewerage schemes.  This investment must continue in future if we want to put in place the necessary infrastructure which will enable the country to thrive into the next century.</P>
    <P>It is very important not to regard every view expressed by an official of the European Commission or a Commissioner as holy writ so that we argue our case.  Ministers of all other nations fight their corner at Council.  I am proud to have done this on behalf of Ireland and will be proud to do so again.  It would be a mistake not to fight Ireland's case or defend our good interests. However, this seems to be the attitude adopted by the Progressive Democrats in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much debate about water charges and local government financing. I agree that local government financing has to be put on a sound footing if we want to develop it.  The abolition of water charges is contrary to &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty.  How can the Minister say that charging for water is environmentally unfriendly?  Maybe I misunderstood him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstood me as I made it clear that the system of charges in place, water taxes, was not related to the cost of providing water or, more importantly, to the volume of consumption.  This flat rate tax was totally unrelated to consumption and gave no incentive to people to save water.  An environmentally positive water charge is designed to have an effect on the level of consumption.  If there is a flat rate charge and unlimited access to water people will make full advantage of the water supply without any regard to the volume consumed.</P>
      <P>We monitor, meter and charge the commercial sector for water.  This remains part of the environmentally positive approach to water consumption. Late last year I looked at the prospect of metering domestic consumers and asked KPMG to examine the matter.  It told me it would cost £200 million to install meters and £8 million per year to administer the system.  It concluded that such a system would not be economically viable and that it would be better to invest the £200 million in upgrading the present system.  The Government decided not to go down the road of installing meters.  All objective people will agree that this was the correct environmental, social and economic course of action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important issue for those in local government is the problems of pollution and traffic caused by motor cars.  Local government will be funded from the source of greatest harm.  This is a contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time the Government is abolishing water charges.  I do not see the logic in this proposal which is contrary to &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Why should this system not be used to fund local government rather than going into the central Exchequer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the transfer of motor tax income from the Exchequer to local government is a popular and good decision.  We have one of the lowest rates of motor car ownership <i>per capita</i> in Europe and there will be an increase in the number of cars.  Deputy Eoin Ryan is lucky to live in Dublin as people in many other areas do not have access to public transport and a car is a necessity for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The reality is that we will have increased car ownership as this country becomes more affluent as a result of good government and the change in economic conditions.  We will become the top, as opposed to the lower, earners in the European Union.  This Government will continue to provide the economic boom to ensure that economic performance continues.  All the statistical profiles indicate that, as that happens, car ownership will increase.  There should be a tax on cars and local authorities should benefit from that revenue to develop their own communities. This whole reform package has been welcomed by all the regional conferences to which I brought this message around the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>To get back to the original point of the question, the Minister has now indicated that Cohesion Funds amount to £1.1 billion in total.  I did my sums in relation to that and I agree with the Minister not one penny of that funding will be lost.  We will still get £1,100 million, but if we were getting subvention from Europe at 85 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;irrespective of the way it is divided, we would draw down £1,100 million on the basis of a spend of £1,294 million.  The position now is that to draw down that £1,100 million, we have to spend £1.375 million.  In reality, the Minister has cost this country £81 million, not £60 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the lies, damn lies and statistics.  We are now confusing the transport section of the Cohesion Funding, which is half of it, and applying the same across that rate also. The Deputy can fiddle all he likes with the figures, but they are quite clear.  We will draw down every penny.  This year we will spend sufficient of our own resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We will spend sufficient of our own resources to draw down every available <Col N="564" /> penny, and more besides.  Will it be Fianna Fáil policy &mdash; and perhaps this is part of the PD pressure on funding &mdash; that we should simply draw down EU money, provide the 15 per cent or 20 per cent top-up and not spend any of our own resources on projects?  Is that what we will witness from Fianna Fáil under PD pressure?  The minimum of infrastructural investment in water and sewerage schemes will be carried out if they ever get back to power because that has not been the practice under any recent regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent two years putting right what Deputy Quill's party did in Government with Fianna Fáil.  The Deputy has a brass neck to make comments like that.  Any Government that wants to provide the infrastructure Ireland will need to continue to thrive &mdash; water supply, roads and sewage disposal systems &mdash; will have to put in a considerable portion of taxpayers' money to match the maximum money that will be available from the Cohesion Fund.</P>

Labour quickly jumped into bed with us in 1992 because they thought they would be able to spend some of those funds.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the impact of the rising housing market on the shared ownership scheme and while proposals for improvements to the scheme are currently under consideration, I am not in a position to make a statement on the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is to launch his manifesto tomorrow, he might wait until then to make his statement.  However, the problem is that good and valuable schemes such as the shared ownership scheme are being rendered redundant by rising house prices.  In my local authority the number of successful applications under the scheme decreased last year.  Can the Minister give an indication of his thinking on the matter?  Will he change the income eligibility limits or the maximum size of the mortgage permitted or reduce the initial equity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a good case but he should not gild the lily by overstating it. The shared ownership scheme is good and there is a good take-up of it.  That take up has only slightly reduced.  The figure for 1995 was 1,381 <Col N="568" /> and in 1996 it was 1,277.  I do not have the figure for this year but I expect it to be similar.</P>
      <P>I want to achieve the maximum possible take-up of the shared ownership scheme.  I and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing have drawn up proposals which are currently under discussion in the Department of Finance.  I do not wish to pre-empt the Department's decision but it will be proposed to increase the income limit and the level of subsidy payable, particularly in the case of people on lower incomes.  I hope to be in a position to give further details when our negotiations with the Department of Finance are concluded.</P>

      <P>In the Dublin area, with which I am most familiar, a basic former local authority house is selling for between £50,000 and £60,000. Under present regulations those houses are almost out of the reach of a person seeking to purchase under the shared ownership scheme. We need and must retain a hierarchy of housing options.  Unless we do something quickly, people who would normally opt for shared ownership will wonder why they should bother committing themselves to a £50,000 mortgage for a house when they can go on the housing list and the local authority will probably build them a new house at £80,000 or £90,000 or buy them a house in a private estate for about £80,000.  The hierarchy of options is out of kilter.  This scheme requires a major change in its regulations to maintain the incentive to purchase.  People should not be encouraged to go on the housing list if they are capable of buying their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes a great deal of sense.  I wish to give what assistance we can and to improve that assistance to a level which will allow people to be independent of local authority housing in so far as that is possible.  Obviously some people will not be in a financial position to do anything other than go on a local authority housing list.</P>
      <P>There are problems in Dublin because the cost of land and housing is extremely high.  In 1996, 85 per cent of transactions completed under the shared ownership scheme were in respect of secondhand houses and 59 per cent of all secondhand houses were sold for £60,000 or less.  In Dublin, more than 40 per cent of houses were £60,000 or less.  The changes I and the Minister of State have put together will increase the level of house cost that can be achieved by the same input &mdash; in other words, a person can buy a more expensive house for the same financial outlay &mdash; and adjust the supports to enable that to happen. That is most important to prevent people who could perhaps afford to purchase with a little extra help being forced to abandon the prospect and apply for a house from the local authority.</P>
      <P>Our ideas are being discussed and I hope to make an announcement about them shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the severe <Col N="569" /> cost of land in Dublin.  The Taoiseach also, when referring to the ESRI report, said more land in Dublin needed to be rezoned as there is a shortage of land zoned for housing.  Has the Minister changed his thinking on this matter? Would he, on behalf of his party, apologise for blackguarding Fianna Fáil for years because it tried to provide for the future by having land ready and available so young couples could buy houses at a reasonable rather than an inflated price?  The chickens have come home to roost. The ESRI, the Taoiseach and everybody else accepts that we have been caught without a suitable and adequate supply of land for housing. Has that thinking got through to the Minister's Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different question but I will be happy to answer it.  I have not opposed rezoning. However, I am implacably opposed to maverick rezoning and we have seen a great deal of it in recent decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Maverick rezoning takes no account of either infrastructural requirements or the environmental pressures it puts on an area. Many people are up in arms about maverick rezonings that are either in train or being contemplated. I make no apology for taking a strong line on maverick rezoning.</P>
      <P>We need a supply of land for good quality housing that is structured and orderly.  More importantly, we need a more structured overall land use policy and to avoid looking at parts of counties and individual counties in isolation.  We must have a rational population and land use policy for the country so every area can participate in the economic boom.  One corner of a county should not suddenly become a huge urban area and villages should not suddenly turn into large towns in a few years.  That type of development is not healthy.  I do not share the view that the provision of housing is the beginning and end of the issue.  Sustainable development and planning involve more than simply providing houses.  They involve providing a sustainable environment for the future and that must be done in an integrated way.</P>
      <P>I have required local authorities in Dublin and adjoining local authorities to work in concert to provide a rational land use plan.  That is a better way of addressing the real needs the Deputy has identified than simply saying rezoning is a good thing so get on with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>My Department, in association with the National Roads Authority, is reviewing and updating the technical specifications for the construction of road traffic signs.  The review, which is expected to be completed in the current year, is being carried out against the background of the development of a new specification at European level by CEN, the European standardisation organisation.</P>
      <P>A traffic signs manual which I published last December covers all other aspects of road signage. It is a code of good practice which will help to ensure that we have an effective and well maintained traffic sign system.  A copy of the manual is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the quality and position of road traffic signs are important factors in promoting road safety and preventing accidents and deaths on the roads?  In the UK, for example, an improvement in the positioning of road traffic signs and improved road markings resulted in a reduction in the number of road accidents.  Would the Minister acknowledge that a broader specification should be adopted to allow for the use of a range of materials depending on road conditions?  The publication, A Guide to Road Safety Engineering in Ireland, outlined the use of improved reflectivity in traffic signs.  That was good in so far as it went, but would the Minister acknowledge that it would have been better to have specified the type of sheeting to be used in particular situations with a view to upgrading quality and reflectivity and putting in place the best available technology in terms of road markings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of any particular difficulty with the reflective nature of signs that are in place, but I welcome the Deputy's views and will have them tested by the technical experts in my Department.  I strongly agree with her view on the importance of signage and road markings in relation to road safety generally.  The new road markings and reflective cats' eyes on some of the national primary routes have resulted in a remarkable improvement in motorists' ability to judge positioning on the road and to see oncoming cars etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme being undertaken by the National Roads Authority is a very important one <Col N="571" /> and the national routes have benefited greatly from it.  The upgrading of signage on the N1 was completed last year, the first year of the programme; the N2, the N13, the N14 and the N15 will be completed during this year.  It is also expected that the N3, the N4, the N8, the N9, the N10, the N11 and the N25 will be completed by the end of this year. Reflective cats' eyes, even on roads that are not particularly straight, make a remarkable difference to road safety.  Somebody said on a national radio programme the other day that I had turned some of the national roads into runways.  That is a positive thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that visibility is the key and if the visibility of signs is upgraded, road safety is improved automatically and roads become safer and more comfortable for drivers?  Will the Minister accept my suggestion that any review of the road safety guidelines should clearly specify the type of sheeting to be used on signs, and that the best available sheeting should be used for all signs, not just on the national primary routes?  Fatal accidents are occurring on rural roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>Information supplied by fire authorities indicates that fatalities from fires in the home attended by fire brigades totalled 48 in 1993; 42 in 1994; and 36 in 1995.  Unfortunately, there was an interruption in this downward trend in 1996; the provisional figures indicate a total of 53 fatalities from fire in the home, including seven members of a family who died in one fire.</P>
      <P>While the level of fatalities is of great concern, it should be noted that the overall number of fires in domestic buildings has fallen from 16,000 in the early 1990s to 12,500 in 1995, the last year for which complete figures are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards measures to reduce the risk of fires, <Col N="572" /> the building regulations already set out detailed requirements in relation to the fire precautions to be provided for in the design and construction of dwellings and where material alterations or changes of use are being made.  Technical guidance documents which accompany the regulations contain comprehensive guidance on matters such as means of escape, including the provision of smoke alarms, internal and external fire spread, and access and facilities for the fire brigade.  Following a review by my Department, I plan to make consolidated building regulations and publish revised technical guidelines as soon as I can. The revised documents will require, in relation to all new dwellings commenced on or after 1 January next, installation of mains operated smoke alarms &mdash; this sounds like a small thing but it is very important because so many smoke alarms are battery operated and people simply forget to test them &mdash; and provision of windows suitable for use as a secondary means of escape.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, fire safety in the home is the responsibility of the individual householder. Better awareness of the dangers of fire and of fire hazards, together with simple common-sense fire prevention practices, can help to prevent and reduce the number of fires and the consequent tragic fatalities and injuries.  Accordingly, the National Safety Council actively encourages fire safety in the home as part of its ongoing fire safety education and publicity campaigns.  Particular stress has been placed in recent media campaigns on the routine tasks to be carried out nightly to guard against fire and on the value of smoke alarms which, if properly installed and maintained, can provide early warning of fire and save lives.  In addition, local authorities have been asked by my Department to consider the provision of smoke alarms in all their rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>As regards the services provided by the fire authorities, improvements have been made on a comprehensive basis in the fire services over recent years.</P>
    <P>There were about 30 professional posts in the local fire service prior to 1982, whereas now there are 121 such posts, with a greatly increased emphasis on fire prevention and fire safety.</P>
    <P>Capital investment by the State since 1981 has resulted in the provision of over 100 new or reconstructed fire stations, over 320 fire appliances and a wide range of emergency equipment, as well as major improvements in mobilisation and communication systems.</P>
    <P>Major improvements have taken place in the training of fire service personnel.  Training facilities have been provided at several centres around the country to facilitate the training of brigades locally.  To complement this local training, the Fire Services Council has, since 1983, held almost 200 training courses for over 3,000 local fire officers.</P>
    <P>A series of codes of practice and guidelines have been issued by my Department in recent years giving advice on fire safety in places of <Col N="573" /> assembly, hotels and guest-houses, flats and apartments, and nursing homes.  Work is continuing on the preparation of further guidance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am sure the Minister would agree that 53 deaths from fires in homes is a horrific figure.  Home ought to be a place where families can be safe and secure.  That certainly was not the case where the 53 fatalities occurred.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he is in the course of putting new guidelines in place.  He has further spoken of mains operated alarm systems, which is a very good idea.  Will it be mandatory, and from what date will it be so, for all housing projects, both in the public and in the private sectors, to put such systems in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>That work is continuing is a recognition that this is a difficult problem which needs to be kept constantly under review.  It is amazing how many houses in housing estates, with which we will all become familiar in the next few weeks, have windows which do not allow people to get through and which, because they are double glazed, would be difficult to break.  Is that something the Minister is taking note of in terms of future housing?  Can he offer assistance towards replacing such windows, some of which, ironically, are quite new and have replaced safer windows? It is difficult to get out through double glazed windows even when they are broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have a breakdown of fire deaths as between local authority and private housing?  While I am not suggesting windows are the only reason for such deaths, under Department by-laws the windows in local authority housing are small and barrack like.  I agree with Deputy Sargent that while double glazed windows are flashy and may be designed to stop people breaking into houses, they are not helpful when people want to get out in an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The consolidated building regulations have been published and the technical guidelines being finalised will require new dwellings, commenced on or after 1 January next, to install not only a mains operated smoke alarm but windows suitable as a secondary means of escape. I will put the question on specifications for local authority housing to the design unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The size of windows in proportion to floor area is very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be a basic requirement that people should be able to get out through windows without much difficulty.  This is particularly important in dwellings that accommodate <Col N="574" /> the elderly.  I will speak to the people in the housing division in my Department and refer directly to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the matter will be dealt with in future housing programmes. These windows are installed in current housing stock and people should be informed that they are potential death traps.  The Minister may claim the house improvements grant was abused in the past, but this is not a case of cosmetics or increasing the value of houses.  It is a matter of life or death and it is not satisfactory for the Minister to say it will be dealt with in future housing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the Deputy was in the House for my original reply.  A comprehensive range of regulations covering fire safety is in place under the current building control regulations. One can never rest on one's laurels and say one has done enough in terms of fire safety. We are constantly carrying out research into fire retardant materials for household furnishings, paint, panelling and so on.  That research will not stop.  We must continue to be vigilant in this regard.</P>
      <P>In the last analysis, fire safety is a matter for the individual householder.  The State or the local authority cannot be totally responsible.  In its extensive campaigns on fire safety, the National Safety Council must beam the message at people. People should do their own inventory of fire safety in their houses by checking fire escapes, smoke detectors and the availability of fire extinguishers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining his proposals.  Does he intend to apply the new regulations retrospectively, in particular to Victorian houses that are divided into apartments and bedsits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always difficult to apply retrospectively what is ultimately a planning law.  We can apply the regulations only from a current date and give people due notice that they will apply in future.  We must alert people to their responsibilities. Individual safety is crucial for oneself and one's family.  The National Safety Council is doing a good job in alerting people to the specific dangers of fire.</P>

      <P>Prior to the adjournment of the debate I was celebrating the surrender of the Minister for Education to a long campaign by parents, staff and students of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Opposition parties in the House.  On reflection, the Minister lacked a coherent vision to develop the third level sector during the past year.  She lurched from crisis to crisis and made up policy on the hoof in response to pressure groups from various constituencies.  It was a red-faced Minister who was forced to establish an expert group to review the status of the regional technical colleges following a press release she issued on a Sunday afternoon regarding Waterford Regional Technical College.  I am disappointed today's announcement did not contain a reference to that body's recommendations and the implications for other regional technical colleges.  It is now evident we will not have legislation brought before this Dáil to give Waterford Regional Technical College degree awarding powers in line with the status of the Waterford Institute of Technology.  Nobody begrudged the regional technical college its new status when it was announced, but it is clear the Minister has not given Waterford Regional Technical College that new status.  All it has received is a name <Col N="576" /> change.  The Minister has been in office for five years and the recommendation of the Higher Education Authority steering committee was that extra degree provision should be put in place in Waterford as a priority to serve the needs of the south-east.  The Minister has not increased degree provision significantly in Waterford, nor has she allocated significant extra financial resources to enable Waterford Regional Technical College to expand the range of its degree courses.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot of rhetoric and hypocrisy designed to meet immediate electoral needs rather than substantial policy initiatives.  Behind the smokescreens of name changes and press releases, it is clear the degree provision referred to in the Higher Education Authority's steering committee report has not been made for Waterford.</P>
      <P>The Minister made clear commitments to Cork &mdash; as did the Tánaiste &mdash; when she visited the city to try to calm the outburst of concern and anxiety from the students, staff and management at Cork Regional Technical College when its application to be upgraded to institute of technology status was not mentioned by the Minister.  This is the Minister's last day in the House dealing with matters related to her brief, and she has not referred to Cork, Athlone or any other regional technical college.  Legislation has not been introduced to give Cork its own institute of technology.  This was promised by the Labour Party spin doctors when they descended on the city <i>en masse</i> to put the lid on an embarrassing electoral situation. Cork was promised this would be resolved before the conclusion of the Dáil, and that institute of technology status would be granted to Cork.  The reality is much different, as the situation has not advanced from the Minister's announcement three months ago.  Many people will feel betrayed and fooled by the Minister's approach to their college.</P>
      <P>This illustrates the incoherence in the Minister's office in terms of an overall vision for the third level sector.  We must be careful to protect the technological sector and ensure that, even in the Dublin Institute of Technology Order before us, the correct balance of degrees, diplomas and certificates is kept.  The formation and development of the regional colleges sector more than 20 years ago was both enlightened and visionary on the part of the then Fianna Fáil Government.  It helped to serve needs in the economy, such as skills shortages, and this facilitated the attraction of inward investment.  That is important when maintaining the binary system at third level.  We have a strong university sector side by side with a strong technological sector.  These sectors can together provide graduates with the necessary skills to serve the new information technology industries and the new information age in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We look forward to going back into Government and picking up the pieces left behind by the Minister.  We will put a rational framework in place for the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology and other institutes of technology <Col N="577" /> throughout the country.  We will mould them into a driving force to develop Irish economic and industrial life over the next 20 years and they will have a critical role in attracting inward investment. Under future Fianna Fáil Governments, there will not be the skills shortages that we have witnessed recently under this Government. Because of the lack of a coherent vision of the role of the third level sector, the Government has had to introduce panic measures.</P>
    <P>We welcome today's order because, as Opposition spokespersons, we feel we have played a role in bringing the Minister to this point.  We have ensured the Minister made the concessions the Dublin Institute of Technology wanted and campaigned for actively and constructively.</P>

      <P>This is an unusual day in that we are in the dying days of the Government.  I welcome the opportunity to debate the order conferring degree awarding status on the Dublin Institute of Technology.  We have called for this consistently over a long period and the institute has also stressed the need for this.  During the debate on the Universities Bill, we spoke consistently of the Dublin Institute of Technology's desire for university status.</P>
      <P>The Minister went half way when she said the intention was to ensure the institute could award its own degrees.  However, this happened because there was a long campaign for that measure, and the Minister seemed unwilling to enter into this commitment.  From my discussions with staff and students at Dublin Institute of Technology, they felt they had to battle the whole way to ensure they would get degree awarding status.  That is important from the perspectives of the Dublin Institute of Technology and its staff and students, though that is not to denigrate their links with other educational institutions.  Those links have been very welcome and have added to excellence in the institute.  They ensured that recognition was given to courses developed in Dublin Institute of Technology and underlined the quality of education students received there.  Degrees being awarded by an outside body were welcome to an extent but it meant those in the institute felt recognition was not given to their roles and abilities.</P>
      <P>We must welcome this order from that perspective. Nobody would object to it and I do not understand the earlier foot dragging so that we have had to wait for this until the penultimate day of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look at this in the context of how third level education has been treated by the Minister.  The Minister will speak during the election campaign about making university places more available to people through the abolition of fees.  However, we find students want to discuss maintenance grants.  This was raised by the Buckley report, which the Minister abandoned. Students want to know how they are to maintain themselves at university, especially those students from deprived backgrounds who do not have the <Col N="578" /> benefit of having parents who can support them. Those students who do not have the wherewithal to maintain themselves in university need some maintenance and current grants are totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>A great opportunity was missed by the Minister who went for the populist gesture and forgot about the less advantaged in our society.  It is regrettable she took that attitude.  However, she referred earlier to the strong case made by the institute over the past few months for inclusion in the Universities Bill.  That is a complete turnabout from what she said on Committee Stage of that Bill when she continually stonewalled and trenchantly refused to countenance the idea of supporting the case for the Dublin Institute of Technology becoming a university.  She cited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology not once or twice but many times and accused us of wanting to award titles because we thought they would infer a certain status.  Despite explaining to her at great length that the Dublin Institute of Technology was seeking the status of a university to enable it to develop, to have the same remit as other universities, to be able to appoint staff within the budgetary guidelines and follow the selection procedures available to universities and so on, the much improved Universities Bill will not apply to that institute.</P>
    <P>I was delighted, but astounded, to hear the Minister say earlier today that she listened carefully and with interest to the institute's views because I remember she objected to the fact that the students had sent in photocopied postcards which they had only signed.  We explained that was a legitimate way for the students to lobby the Minister and that she should not object to it but should realise that they went to such trouble and expense because they were serious in their intent and were determined to ensure the institute would have recognition as a university rather than an institute of technology.</P>
    <P>That objective has nothing to do with the title, it has to do with the ability of the institute to develop in the same way as our universities, without the heavy hand of the State, which was a major feature of the Universities Bill as originally drafted and put before the House.  However, thanks to the numerical advantage in the other House, the Minister had to table more than 100 amendments to that Bill, which ensured the State role in it was not as heavy-handed and was far removed from the Minister's original intent.  That is what the Dublin Institute of Technology wants.</P>
    <P>Despite my pleadings on Committee Stage of the Universities Bill to give a commitment to support the idea of the Dublin Institute of Technology seeking university status and the Minister's refusing to give it, I am delighted that in the dying days of this Government she has had a change of mind and will request the Government to appoint a body pursuant to section 9 to advise the Government on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university, the Dublin <Col N="579" /> Institute of Technology should be established as a university.</P>
    <P>The Minister is playing to the gallery.  She has come face to face with political reality.  The wonderful thing about our democratic State is that politicians, particularly those who wield power, know they have to answer to the people.  That can be a salutary warning to all of us, particularly to those who have the power to make decisions. Thankfully the Minister is not able to proceed with the Education Bill, which is a travesty, but has succeeded in putting through the Universities Bill, which is much amended and much improved compared to the initial draft.  In legislative terms she may have done relatively little damage when we take account of what she set out to do.  We must be grateful that people get a good dose of sense when faced with political reality.  I welcome the Minister's turnabout and that she realises people's views count, particularly those who are genuinely trying to improve our education system. I look forward in the next number of weeks to returning to a different type of Government that is more responsive to the needs of our education system.</P>

      <P>I moved the resolution that the House approve this draft order.  I recognise the strongly felt views of this House on the future of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It appears there is a full recognition on all sides of the role of the Dublin Institute of Technology in Dublin and in the country.  I put the formal mechanism in place to evaluate the institution for degree awarding powers.  I asked the Higher Education Authority to establish an international review team to recommend whether degree awarding powers should be given to the institute.  This was not a reaction to other pressures which were on me.  It was quite the opposite.</P>
      <P>The review group recommended principally that the institute be granted authority to award degrees in respect of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, with effect from the academic year 1998-9.  This view was endorsed by the Higher Education Authority.  My response to this recommendation was to indicate I would be bringing forward a draft order under the terms of the relevant legislation.  I am doing so now.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is in the process of ensuring its organisational structures and processes are firmly in place and operating effectively in line with the recommendations of the report.  The order we are discussing, when signed, will formally grant degree awarding powers from 1998 onwards.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to again congratulate the DIT on the progress it has made since 1992 in building a single integrated institute.  It has such a vital role in higher education in providing qualifications at certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress my commitment in my time as Minister to the development of the Dublin Institute of <Col N="580" /> Technology.  I remind the House that staffing and student numbers have increased substantially in this time.  Many new courses at certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate level have been developed.  Three new diplomas, two advanced diplomas and two graduate diplomas were sanctioned in 1995-6.  Nine postgraduate advanced technical skills programmes were sanctioned in 1996-7.  A further two new diplomas, one new diploma-degree and two advanced diplomas were sanctioned in 1996-7.  This is a major commitment to the future of the institute.</P>
    <P>There is recurrent funding of more than £50 million in this academic year.  In addition, since 1993 more than £18.5 million of capital funding has been invested.  The making of this draft order will provide further opportunities for the future development of the institute.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the Deputies who participated in the debate which has moved forward the third level sector significantly during my term of office.  We have seen new beginnings created for students whose expectations, regardless of the level of maintenance or grants, were that they might not even finish second level.  We have seen the gates of the local schools opened to those children.  Many are in their third year at school where classes are no larger than 15 and parents, particularly mothers, have a welcome role to play.  It will be nine years before people will be able to say this Government and I were right.  These young children had the early start break so that they could look forward to becoming graduates of a university or a college in the technological sector.  Their ambitions and expectations changed with this Government.</P>
    <P>The universities will also benefit from legislation &mdash; one institution waited many centuries for it while the others waited one century.  These children will move into a sector whose future we have all played a part in securing well into the new millennium.  I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the courtesy you extended to me as someone who came to this Chamber as a recruit and who leaves it as a Minister.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate when discussing the section to ask the Minister what assurances can be given to transfusees who are concerned about the issues raised in my amendment No. 2 which has been ruled out of order.  When I tabled the amendment I did not intend to impose a charge on the Exchequer but I would like provision to be made to assist and facilitate in limited circumstances.  A situation might arise where the State would have to indemnify in certain circumstances. <Col N="582" /> Perhaps it was for that reason the amendment was ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>When one meets members of Transfusion Positive and talks to them about these issues, it is clear they are outstanding and need to be addressed in some way, if not in this Bill because of the ruling that I cannot move an amendment which may be deemed to involve a charge on the Exchequer.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It seems the items listed here are not homogeneous in nature. Under the health package we provided for research in respect of hepatitis C victims, which permits a section of the research board to deal with research on hepatitis.  A significant number of research projects have been substantially funded this year and we shall continue to fund them in the future.</P>
      <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board has continued cover of persons with hepatitis C, as it would in the normal way.  I know of no prohibition on membership of persons with hepatitis C. Of its nature, our health insurance is communityrated. Membership is available to all members of the community without discrimination.</P>
      <P>In respect of hospital accommodation, there are six designated acute hospitals with hepatologists who deal with the issue of hepatitis where accommodation arrangements are made on a one to one basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters that have proved very difficult for victims are life assurance and mortgage protection insurance.  Obviously, if the risk varies private insurance companies will either refuse to cover the risk or quote higher premia.  Disadvantages such as these for persons affected by hepatitis C would form part of the claim to be made legitimately either before the courts or the tribunal. In circumstances in which a provision cannot be made for a disadvantage along the lines of those listed by Deputy Cowen in his amendment, they have done and will form part of the claim of those who have already gone through the compensation tribunal who will be compensated for the disadvantages which might arise in the field of insurance cover.  I am aware a difficulty will arise in the event of a waiting period before a claimant gets to the compensation tribunal but the amount awarded in respect of these disadvantages will be <Col N="583" /> taken into account retrospectively by the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which establishes the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal on a statutory basis.  The idea of sitting in divisions was an interesting one.  As we all know, there has been much concern about the timescale involved in endeavouring to deal with more than 1,600 cases.  That 326 cases have already been dealt with, none of which has been appealed, bodes well for the efficacy of the tribunal and its operations. As the Minister said, the judge and his staff are to be congratulated on their work to date.  The Minister has spoken about making two divisions.  Has he any plans to increase the divisions beyond two because, should these settlement mechanisms incorporated in another section not prove very successful, there would be a need for more than two divisions to avoid the delay to which he referred when replying to Second Stage?</P>
      <P>Despite the delays experienced in the courts, it might prove more expeditious for people to go the courts.  The overall objective of establishing the compensation tribunal was to ensure its efficacy and replace the court in terms of trying to reach fair and just settlements in these cases.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify that aspect of section 3.  He has not explained in any great detail what the Attorney General has in mind in devising these settlement mechanisms to obviate the necessity of 1,600 cases coming before the court, the alternative proposal being that settlements be made a rule of court, with the agreement of the parties concerned to the negotiations which preceded their cases coming before the tribunal in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> Section 3(5) reads:</P>
    <P>The term of office of a member of the Tribunal shall be for such period as is specified by the Minister when appointing such member.</P>
    <P>Should the cases be dealt with over a reasonably short period &mdash; one might well compare the tenure of office of members of boards of semi-State agencies sometimes lasting between three and five years &mdash; it might well be expected that the work of this tribunal would have been completed well ahead of that timescale.  What is the thinking behind the appointment of members of the tribunal by the Minister as distinct from their appointment for the duration of the tribunal, thus allowing its hearings to come to finality without the prospect of its members chopping and changing? Just as Mr. Justice Egan has considerable familiarity and knowledge of the issues arising in these cases &mdash; and he may be accompanied by another distinguished colleague to head another division of the tribunal &mdash; I should prefer that its members remained for the duration of its sittings. Perhaps the Minister would comment on that aspect.</P>
    <P>Subsection (12) relates to the conduct of hearings otherwise than in public.  Clearly the issue of confidentiality is very important in that it allows people to deal with cases that come before them in a manner which means they do not have to worry about public scrutiny, which is in sharp contrast to the position of the State which does not allow people to proceed under an assumed name.  The Minister mentioned the constitutional problems involved in terms of ensuring that people who go to court must do so in their own name rather than an assumed one.</P>
    <P>Although the thrust of this Bill is to ensure that victims have an equal right of going to the tribunal or having their day in court, unfortunately, those who must go the court route &mdash; since its hearings will not be held in private &mdash; will be discriminated against whereas those who go the tribunal route will have that benefit.  If we are seriously endeavouring to provide parity of treatment for those who come before the tribunal and those who go before the court, we need to thrash out that issue more thoroughly.  If some provision could be made for cases which go to court to be held <i>in camera</i>, it would provide equality of treatment for victims who wish to go to court rather than to the tribunal.  Such a provision exists in family law. The devastation brought upon families by this tragedy, while not covered by family law, is such that familial implications are very strong and an <i>in camera</i> provision for those who go to court would be a sensible approach to avoid creating a disincentive for those people.</P>
    <P>In the establishment of this statutory tribunal and the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal, there was a deliberate policy of encouraging people to use them rather than the courts.  A paternalistic attitude exists that people should avoid the adversarial nature of a court hearing.  However, some <Col N="585" /> people feel so strongly about what happened that they are not prepared to accept the tribunal, despite its payments of general and aggravated damages.  They want their day in court and believe it is the only way they can exorcise the traumatic experience, apart from vindicating their constitutional rights in a court of law rather than a tribunal.  An <i>in camera</i> provision would signal that the Government and the State are genuine in ensuring equality of treatment for victims who want to go to court rather than take the tribunal route.  Will the Minister give his views on that aspect of the matter because it is important it be addressed?</P>
    <P>Section 3(16) allows the tribunal, in addition to hearing counsel for a claimant in respect of any matter before it, to seek the assistance of a number of parties, including counsel appointed by the tribunal, for any matter it regards as necessary. This is an important provision.  The overall section seeks to ensure the statutory tribunal, in terms of resources and provisions, can deal more quickly with the workload than the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal. Those involved in the latter are to be congratulated for the manner in which they dealt with the throughput.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give more information on the possible requirement of more than two divisions of the tribunal, the length of tenure of new members and why it should not correspond with the duration of the tribunal and the possibility of an <i>in camera</i> provision being made for those who wish, within the terms of this section, to go to court rather than to the tribunal?  If the Minister were to address those issues it would clarify the Government's thinking, especially if he were to address the thinking which lies behind the settlement mechanisms which have a bearing on whether two divisions would be sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If a person applies for a hearing date at the tribunal, they are more than likely to receive a reply that all dates for the next two years have been allocated.  As practically all the 1,600 eligible people have applied, there will be pressure in processing the claims.  Not all those who have applied have their applications at a state of readiness sufficient to have their hearing date assigned.  Even those who have everything ready are in a position where their hearing dates are at least two years' hence. A serious problem is emerging and it can only be solved by increasing the throughput of the tribunal which means more personnel.  I have already appointed two additional people to the tribunal and the Government has sanctioned four others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would prefer not to organise two tribunals and I will explain why.  Mr. Justice Egan has been an extremely successful chairman and is recognised as such by the legal teams, the applicants and the representative groups.  I want him to continue as chairman of the tribunal with his vast experience as a former Supreme Court judge.  I also want to avoid a situation of two tribunals <Col N="586" /> where one might be more or less generous than the other.  There could also be a divergence in attitude, perceived or otherwise, with legal teams advising applicants that one tribunal might serve their interests better than the other.  It is envisaged that Mr. Justice Egan will be the chairperson and that he can appoint another person of experience at the tribunal to chair a sitting of a division. This means people would get the advantages of the faster throughput while the uniformity of approach within the tribunal would be maintained.</P>
    <P>If there were no settlement provision, two divisions would not be sufficient to deal with applicants quickly and to ensure the waiting time was significantly shorter than if they applied to the High Court.  If the settlement provision does not work as well as I expect, either myself or my successor will have to appoint extra people to serve at the tribunal if that is the only way compensation can be awarded.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a settlement procedure. If a claim for compensation is made to the High Court, it may be settled at any point up to just before the hearing.  I want a similar facility to be available for the tribunal.  Legal people tell me there is a significant number of people with expertise who can measure to the pound what it is likely to award in a particular case.  If that level of expertise exists and if people, in accordance with the law of tort, can predict very accurately within a modest range what compensation award the tribunal will offer, there is an opportunity for a parallel settlement procedure.  The only reason I include it is to address the issue of potentially long waiting periods and because it might be a more effective mechanism than adding indefinitely to the number of personnel at the tribunal.</P>
    <P>My thinking is to first have the enabling provision in the Bill.  Second, I have obtained a Government decision to appoint a number of extra solicitors to the State Solicitor's Office to deal specifically with this because it will have to be driven in the first instance by the solicitors serving it.  Preliminary discussions have taken place with the Bar Council to see how it would facilitate that objective.  That is as far as it has gone.  If it comes to fruition in the way I think it might, it will be very beneficial, but it will not be in place until about September.  The second division of the tribunal will operate during the summer court session, which starts on 29 May. We will try to get four extra people in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>On the period of office of the persons appointed, that relates to the quality of people we are looking for.  For policy reasons we decided Judge Egan would be chairman and the other members of the tribunal would be women solicitors and barristers.  The typical tribunal would sit in the first instance with Judge Egan chairing it, accompanied by a woman solicitor and a woman barrister.  We are looking for women solicitors and women barristers who are very experienced, people whom an Administration would consider <Col N="587" /> suitable to be judges.  Already Ms Alison Cross, a barrister, has been appointed to the Circuit Court from the tribunal, although she still works at the tribunal, and Ms Mary Collins, a solicitor, has been appointed to the District Court from the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged very experienced and dedicated women practitioners would give some of their time at the tribunal and some of the people appointed would move on to the Bench subsequently. It is difficult to get people to commit to stay for the duration of the tribunal.  The type of people we are seeking and have appointed up to now are very busy with their own practices. The work of the tribunal is not the most lucrative if one has a big private practice as a solicitor or barrister.  The reason for the term of appointment is to ensure maximum flexibility and to get the people we need to do the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the legal position on whether the High Court cases should be held <i>in camera.</i> The constitutional position is if a person decides to sue, one is entitled to know who they are, they cannot use a pseudonym.  That may apply in very harsh and tragic cases.  The courts made such a judgment on a number of occasions, most recently in respect of the case referred to last night when Judge Mary Laffoy said it could not proceed on the basis of anonymity.  I am not sure whether a similar constitutional issue would arise in respect of cases <i>in camera</i>, but it has been the practice in the courts, and has always been the position that in compensation claims justice is done in public, and there are good and valid public interest reasons for that.  I will have this matter examined.  It is not an issue that can be dealt with under this Bill, but I understand the thrust of the Deputy's remarks.  The issue of confidentiality is important.</P>
    <P>My approach to these matters has been to provide a compensation tribunal to overcome the difficulties presented by litigation in the High Court. There is no difficulty in an informal or statutorily based compensation tribunal ensuring applicants retain their anonymity, but that difficulty would arise in the High Court.  The Deputy suggested I have been paternalistic in my approach and have pushed people towards the tribunal, and perhaps that is the way it comes across.  I said time and again the compensation tribunal is a much better mechanism than the High Court for applicants who are grief stricken and who are stricken with hepatitis C, and I hold that position very strongly. If that comes across as paternalistic and pushing people away from their right to go to the High Court, I do not intend it that way.</P>
    <P>We are all influenced by our past and, as Minister for Justice, I remember the Public Gallery full of people from north Dublin city whose children had been burned in the Stardust tragedy, and there was absolute bedlam here because their cases were tied up in the courts for three, four and five years without a hearing.  After a very emotional debate we decided to put in place the <Col N="588" /> Stardust compensation tribunal.  That tribunal worked very effectively to relieve the anguish of and give access to compensation and justice to the parents of many of the young people burned in that fire.  I brought the Bill into the House to establish that tribunal.  It was a far less sophisticated mechanism than the informal tribunal in place at present and the tribunal we are putting in place under statute, but it was very effective.</P>
    <P>If I have a blind spot about the High Court it arises from the experience of the Stardust case.  I fundamentally believe that in an adversarial system such as ours, for the relatives of victims who died or are injured in tragedies such as the Stardust, or the victims themselves as in the hepatitis C tragedy, the High Court is the wrong place to do business.  It was foreseeable it would lead to grief, and it led to enormous grief in the case of Brigid McCole.  That is why from the start I tried to put in place a mechanism to provide fair compensation through the compensation tribunal. That is why all the time I have urged people to take the option of the compensation tribunal. There are no cost advantages to the State.  Many people would say the cost advantages would accrue in taking the cases to the High Court, except in respect of legal fees.</P>
    <P>I accept I may have appeared at times to push people towards the compensation tribunal, but if that is the case it is because of my experience of the Stardust tribunal and the unsuitability of the High Court and the adversarial system to deal with matters of great tragedy such as this, and that still motivates me in putting this tribunal on a statutory basis.  Between now and Report Stage I will try to get further information and legal advice on whether cases which go to the High Court rather than the compensation tribunal may be dealt with <i>in camera.</i></P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Cowen is out of order because it involves a potential charge on the Revenue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (13), line 3, after &ldquo;Service&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Board, the report of any other Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my amendment No. 4 involves a potential charge on the Revenue it is out of order, but there is nothing to stop the Government putting forward an amendment to deal with the issue. Will the Minister seriously consider this matter between now and Report Stage?  Section 4 states the persons who may make a claim for compensation to the tribunal include a person who has been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C resulting <Col N="589" /> from the use of anti-D within the State.  When originally published, the scheme did not confine the giving of compensation to persons who had become infected within the State.  That was included at a later stage of the scheme and it is repeated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Where is the problem in ensuring the small number of people who have been affected by hepatitis C, as outlined in amendment No. 4, can be accommodated?  The purpose of putting the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Bill on the Statute Book is to provide for fair compensation in all cases.  A limited number of people, one of whom I mentioned on Second Stage, will not be covered by the provisions of this Bill unless it is amended as suggested.  It is not sufficient to say that something cannot be considered because it will involve some extra cost.  The Minister said last night the cost of the hepatitis C scandal in general damage terms is about £200 million and aggravated damages will be another £40 million. It is important as we seek to obtain fair compensation under the terms of the Bill that we include everybody who has been affected.</P>
    <P>At meetings with the Department of Health it has been pointed out by victims that there are circumstances where an individual can be and has been sent abroad for treatment due to the necessary medical services not being available at a particular time in this jurisdiction.  That could be for reasons of lack of finance, expertise or long waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The one specific case of which I am aware, which is not included in the parameters of this Bill, relates to a man who was sent to England for bone marrow treatment in the course of which he received an infected blood product.  He had been referred to England by the Mater Hospital and his expenses were paid by the Eastern Health Board.  He had no choice in the matter and no say as to where he would be treated.  That individual who suffers from the virus and whose condition is well advanced has the hepatitis C medical card and is entitled to all the services to which all hepatitis C infected persons are entitled.  Due to the fact that at the behest of the State he received this treatment in a foreign jurisdiction he is wholly excluded from any possibility of receiving compensation.  I believe there are very few people in this category and such cases should be provided for.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have a serious look at this question because if a claim for compensation is to be limited to those persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C within the State it is excluding a limited number of people who have hepatitis C not as a result of obtaining infected anti-D from the BTSB but because the health system referred them to another jurisdiction to be treated.  They are back in this jurisdiction and have all the medical services available to them which hepatitis C victims have but are not covered by the Bill for compensation purposes. It should not be beyond officials and the Minister to ring fence specifically the limited <Col N="590" /> number of persons in this position, given that it would be the wish of the people we represent, in so far as we possibly can, to incorporate all those victims who have to suffer this life threatening disease as a result of what has happened.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 8, subsection (13), line 3, after &ldquo;Service&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Board, the report of any other Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason I seek to include this amendment is that the Bill refers to those suffering from infection of hepatitis C as a result of infected anti-D blood products and transfusees or the spouses and children of those people can claim.  It does not take into account haemophiliacs and those who have the HIV virus.  Rather than return to this issue again, as we must, when it will be clear people in those categories have been infected in the same way as the Finlay tribunal proved in relation to those being discussed, we should be able to incorporate a section, or part of a section, which confirms that those who have suffered wrongdoing in relation to HIV and haemophiliacs will have the same compensation tribunal available to them to deal with the trauma and seek compensation as expeditiously as those who have been the subject of the Finlay tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is not impossible for the Minister to draft such a section.  It would save much time, work and effort in the future when we will have to revisit this matter and presumably set up another compensation tribunal on a statutory basis to look into the case of HIV victims and haemophiliacs. Will the Minister indicate why he cannot draft an all-encompassing section which would include that category of people in the tribunal, once it has been established that a wrongdoing has been done in those cases by the State and its agencies?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In respect of the discussion on amendment No. 4, the purpose of the scheme is to compensate persons who received blood or blood products in Ireland.  We know the results of Judge Finlay's tribunal and his findings in respect of the BTSB's part in the infection of persons with anti-D product and so on.  In respect of persons who went abroad and got medical treatment, for example, in the United Kingdom, and received infected blood, there is no suggestion of fault with the State or any agency of the State or that any liability lies there.  The difficulty is we do not know if we are talking about a limited number of people.  If we decided to pay compensation to persons who got infected blood or blood product in the United Kingdom, France or Germany we would be paying compensation for persons who got blood through blood banks in, say, England, where they are refusing point blank to pay compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much misunderstanding about the issue of hepatitis C.  I have seen World Health <Col N="591" /> Organisation figures which suggest that between 12 million and 15 million persons in Europe suffer from hepatitis C.  I have seen Health Council documentation in Brussels which shows there are almost 500,000 persons in France who have hepatitis C as a result of blood transfusions and the French Government is refusing point blank to compensate anybody.  International comparisons would show what we are doing in a favourable light.  The difficulty is that if we were to draft a section which would extend it along the lines of amendment No. 4, I do not know how wide we would open the gate or if we would open it.  It may be that it would be for only a couple of persons. Section 4, which deals with the categories of persons who can make a claim at the compensation tribunal, has a paragraph (f) which includes a person referred to in section 9 in accordance with that section.</P>
    <P>Section 9 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by regulations extend the class or classes of persons who may make a claim for compensation before the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>This provides the Minister with a mechanism to include a limited category along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  We cannot know what the category is at present.  If we are talking about hard cases which are omitted, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a Minister would provide that persons referred for bone marrow treatment in the UK could form a category under section 9.  That is preferable to trying to amend the primary legislation.  That is why we included paragraph (f) and matched it to section 9.  If other categories arise we have the mechanism to include them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to amendment No. 5 and the tribunal of inquiry into HIV infection.  The amendment is not being accepted because the State cannot bind itself to the outcome of a tribunal whose report it has not yet seen.  Section 4(13) includes the phrase &ldquo;or any other fact&rdquo;.  We had discussions arising from the heads with interest groups, particularly the Irish Haemophilia Society.  The head on which this was based did not include this phrase.  The new wording would include a report of a future tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 4(13) states:</P>
    <P>In making a claim for aggravated or exemplary damages, a claimant may rely on the facts found in the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board ...</P>
    <P>That is how we drafted the head which was circulated. However, as a result of consultations with the interest groups and particularly to meet the expressed need of the Irish Haemophilia Society, we included the phrase &ldquo;or any other fact&rdquo;.  This satisfies the State's position of not agreeing to accept the recommendations or findings of a tribunal which has not yet been convened.  At the same time, it reassures persons who believe that <Col N="592" /> other facts will be established that those facts can be relied on when they make a claim for aggravated damages.</P>

      <P>(a) subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c) may only make an application to the Tribunal within the period of 3 years of the date upon which she or he first became aware of the fact that she or he may have been diagnosed positive for Hepatitis C or the establishment day, whichever is the later,</P>

    <P>(b) subsection (1)(d) may only make an <Col N="593" /> application to the Tribunal within the period of 3 years of the date upon which she or he first began to incur such financial loss or expenses or the establishment day, whichever is the later,</P>

    <P>My amendment seeks to delete subsection (14) and substitute a new subsection (14).  It is drafted to achieve the objective of Deputy Cowen's amendment.

While I am not accepting the Deputy's amendment, this amendment takes his views on board.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter on Second Stage in relation to section 4(14) and the difficulty created by the three year period.  I have no problem in accepting this amendment if the Minister is correct that the substance is what is required in legal terminology to address the issues in my amendment.</P>
      <P>As originally drafted, section 4(14) provided that an application may be made to the tribunal within three years of the date on which a claimant was diagnosed positive or within a period of three years of the date on which a claimant first became aware of the fact that he or she had been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C.  I can see no reason why wording different from that included in the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991, should not have been included in this Bill.  I do not wish to see a different interpretation of hepatitis C cases than that to which the 1991 Act applies.  If the Minister is confirming that this amendment includes the substance of the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991, it meets my concerns.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure the same period &mdash; three years &mdash; is specified in subsections <Col N="594" /> (14) and (16).  The Minister suggested that subsection (14) is in keeping with the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991.  Subsection (16) makes provision for an extension of the period referred to where a person was under a legal disability by reason of being a minor or of unsound mind at the time at which the claim should have been made.  Under the Statute of Limitations, where a minor is injured and entitled to sue, the limitation period provided for only begins from the date upon which he or she attains the age of majority, in other words, if a person under 18 years of age is injured, the period within which he or she must issue proceedings runs from the date he or she attains 18 years.  Under subsection (16), as drafted, such a person will have only six months in which to make a claim.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment to extend the period specified to three years.</P>

During the debate on the Hederman-O'Brien report concern was expressed that infected product may have been exported by the BTSB.  Happily, we were assured at the time that was not the case and no claims were pending against the State.  Is that still the position?

While those who felt they were at risk went to their general practitioner and were tested, there may be others who will present for blood tests over a period of time. The programme is continuing but it is impossible to give an estimate.  What we can be sure of, however, is that there will be new cases.  As the Deputy is aware, of the 60,000 eligible for testing approximately 57,000 to 58,000 have been tested. There will be new cases but on the basis of present information I expect the numbers to be quite small.</P>

      <P>There is a reference in subsection (1)(f) to section 9 which states that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by regulations extend the class or classes of persons who may make a claim for compensation before the tribunal.  The Minister suggested that it would be possible to provide for limited categories of persons, such as those who have had to travel to the United Kingdom for bone marrow treatment, beyond those categories about which we know who may make a claim for compensation before the tribunal.  He also made the point that it is not possible to estimate the number of persons who may be affected by such an extension. Does he have a timescale in mind within which serious consideration may be given in the Department to the introduction of regulations under section 9 to provide certainty?</P>
      <P>In a vague way, the Bill holds out the prospect that the limited number of persons about whom I am speaking may receive a measure of compensation. Does the Minister have a timescale in mind in which the Department will come to a conclusion as to which categories beyond those about which we know shall be specified in regulations? The limited number of persons about whom I am speaking should be given some indication as to the length of time that will elapse before the Minister and the Department can decide whether they can accommodate them.  It should be possible to introduce regulations immediately covering the categories about which we know to prevent an increased number of claims in future.  We should deal with these matters on the basis of present knowledge rather than on the basis of a promise that as soon as we know what we are talking about we will do something about it.  We may never be able to come to a final conclusion on the number of people who contracted hepatitis C in another jurisdiction through, for example, a bone marrow transplant.  Obviously the number of people in this category would be very small.  It should not be beyond the expertise available to the Minister to devise regulations covering these specific cases without opening up the possibility of a flood of applications.</P>

      <Col N="596" /> I ask the Minister to be more specific as to the timeframe involved in coming to a conclusion on the category of persons who can be accommodated under section 9.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are dealing with an unprecedented situation in the health services. We all agree that this is one of the greatest public health tragedies to have occurred in this country.  In bringing forward solutions to deal with this tragedy I had no precedent to follow either in terms of the health care package suitable for victims or the compensation package.  I have dealt with the issue on the basis of the best judgments I can make and the best information available to me.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons I proceeded by way of an informal compensation tribunal is that it was vitally important at that stage to maintain flexibility to amend the terms of reference as circumstances changed.  I amended the terms of reference of the informal compensation tribunal on several occasions to meet new needs as they emerged.  Even though I have many more facts now than I had two years ago, under the statutory tribunal it will be more difficult for the Minister of the day to meet a new need when it is established as it will require primary legislation.  We are losing some of the advantages which existed by moving to a statutory tribunal at this point. However, we now have the bulk of the facts, unlike two years ago when it was vitally important to maintain the ability to amend the terms of reference of the informal tribunal.</P>
      <P>I am trying to maintain those features of the informal tribunal which were clearly advantageous to the victims.  One of these is the ability to move quickly to amend the terms of reference to meet the needs of an existing victim or to bring in a new category.  I also want to preserve the informal procedure before the tribunal so that Judge Egan and his colleagues can continue to deal with people in a humane and informal way and are not tied to High Court procedures about which I have a blind spot.  This is why I included this catch-all provision in the section dealing with the persons eligible to apply and cross-referenced it to section 9.  This gives the Minister flexibility to move by way of regulation instead of having to introduce an amending Bill, with all the delay that that implies.  That was the thinking behind the provision.  It was not included because a certain category of persons had been excluded. Rather it was to ensure a flexible mechanism in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be difficult to include persons outside the State as this would give rise to all sorts of implications.  If a person contracted hepatitis C through blood received in a London hospital then the liability lies with the health authorities in the United Kingdom.  This is a difficult call to make. If I were to extend the facilities of the compensation <Col N="597" /> tribunal to persons infected outside the State it would be difficult to know where to draw the line.  If I am in the Department of Health next year I might be in a position to call it but I am not in a position to call it at this stage.</P>
    <P>One can immediately see the legal difficulties which would arise.  For example, a person referred by consultants at the Mater Hospital to a hospital in London may be eligible under an Eastern Health Board scheme for a rebate of the amount paid, while in another case a person who was not eligible under the scheme and who was simply referred by a consultant as a private patient to a hospital abroad where unfortunately he or she received infected blood or an infected blood product would be in a different category.  In one case the person would receive compensation from the health board to pay for their medical bills while the other person would not.  This would give rise to all sorts of difficulties.  If we were to extend compensation to persons who received infected blood or blood products abroad could we in the new Europe confine this to Irish citizens?  This is a very difficult issue with which to deal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen's amendment was ruled out of order as it would impose a charge on the Exchequer but it raises very interesting points. Given my present knowledge, I cannot meet the Deputy's request or give him any consolation in respect of the case which he brought to my attention, except to say that there is provision in the Bill to include extra categories of persons if this is deemed proper and necessary.  This would not require the Minister to come back into the House with primary legislation.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of the further difficulty in regard to the Long Title which would make it difficult to include persons outside the State.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 7a:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (8)(a), line 12, before &ldquo;period&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;greater&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 5(8)(a) provides that a claimant will have one month from an award being made within which to decide whether to accept or reject such an award.  The claimant must accept or reject the award in writing.  This subsection is subject to section 5(12) which deals with a claimant who is a minor.  Section 5(8)(a) also provides that the one month period may be varied by regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment will ensure that there is a minimum period of one month in which a claimant may decide to accept or reject an award and the Minister cannot reduce this period by regulation. While the regulatory provision is being included, I want to ensure there is a saver that either I or <Col N="598" /> my successor cannot reduce the period within which a person may decide to accept or reject an award.  Section 5(8)(b) provides that if a claimant neither accepts nor rejects the award within the period referred to in subsection 8(a), he or she will be deemed to have rejected the award.  The amendment in my name to section 5(8)(b) is to align it to my second amendment to section 5(8)(a).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Which relates to section 5(8)(a).  I accept the Minister does not want anyone to be able to reduce the period of one month within which to decide, but the paragraph further states that where one neither accepts nor rejects an award, one is deemed to have rejected it.  Must a formal notification be given before a person is deemed to have rejected an award?  I realise some people would regard a month as a long time but the implications of this are serious in that if a person does not reply within 31 days of the award having been granted, they will be deemed to have lost the award.  Some consideration should be given on Report Stage to requiring the tribunal to put people on formal notice that they have not received an acceptance or rejection, and that they have 14 days within which to accept or reject the award.  That would prevent people finding out they were a day late in accepting or rejecting an award and, under the rules of double jeopardy, there would not be any prospect of going back to court.  We must not assume people will grasp the fact that if they have not made up their minds within a month they cannot go back to the Minister in his constituency clinic and ask him to petition the court to keep the award alive because, under law, it would be lost.  There should be a formal notification procedure, given the severity of the sanction if a person does not respond within a month.  We must ensure that if people did not accept an award, and were deemed to have rejected it, they would have no excuse because of a formal notification they may have received two weeks previously.</P>

It provides a general power to remove difficulties which might arise but which are not foreseen now.  It may be possible under the new section 13 to meet the detail of what the Deputy is talking about.  As I said already, I would like to maintain the advantages of the flexible and informal tribunal we have now, even though we are moving it to a statutory basis and enhancing its provisions.  Section 13 will be a catch-all section allowing a Minister to obviate difficulties which may arise in the process.

I am pleased to accept Deputy Cowen's amendment to section 5(12) because it renders it consistent with the settlement provisions of the Bill.  I am also proposing an amendment to section 5(12) to ensure that in the case of a minor on whose behalf the claim for aggravated or exemplary damages is taken to the tribunal, and whose award of such damages is too low, the High Court may direct that a payment be made from the reparation fund instead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the awards of the tribunal.  On Second Stage the Minister referred to the size of awards, which ranged from five figure sums to large six figure sums.  Every case is based on the facts but there appears to be an extraordinary discrepancy between an award of £10,000 and an award of more than £430,000. Perhaps loss of earnings and other issues were involved.  However, could the Minister inform the House about the tribunal's view of claims, what the average claim would be and what serious cases have come before it which give rise to very large claims being successfully processed?  Can he explain the reason for that range of compensation for people who are suffering from the same disease? Obviously, there are different family circumstances, different stages of deterioration and different prognoses for the victims concerned.</P>
      <P>One hopes the settlement provisions in the Bill will become a serious dynamic in trying to reach conclusions and getting this matter wound up with everybody receiving their compensation as quickly as possible.  The level of award has determined the level of people's confidence in the tribunal. How did the compensation tribunal find the level of performance that has met such wide acceptance?  Apart from the benefits of informality, confidentiality and non-adversarial comment in determining the issues, I am interested to know, from the experience of the Minister and his Department of the tribunal's operations since its establishment, how it has been able to achieve the widespread support it has received, given the traumatic and emotional issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is no precise mechanism to get the information to which the Deputy refers from the informal tribunal.  The tribunal is clearly separate from the Minister and the Department of Health and carries out its functions separately.  However, we receive statistical reports on request, on which basis I can provide information to the House.  The tribunal is now being established on a statutory basis. Section 12 of the Bill requires the tribunal to submit &ldquo;a report of its activities and particulars of its accounts to the Minister at such time as the Minister directs&rdquo;.  Copies of such reports will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There will, therefore, be a formal reporting system and we will have better information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will attempt to answer the Deputy's question in general terms because I cannot comment on how the tribunal measures the amount of compensation it deems necessary.  The tribunal operates in accordance with the law of tort.  It does not measure compensatory damages in any other way than that which would be used before the High Court.  All persons who go before the tribunal, even though they are represented by four different organisations and some are represented by no organisation, have hepatitis C or hepatitis <Col N="602" /> C antibodies.  There is a huge difference between persons who have the virus and persons who have the antibodies.  Deputy McDaid can offer an enlightened medical opinion on that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Of the cohort of 60,000 people deemed eligible for testing arising from the possibility of infection from anti-D, huge numbers tested negative. However, some persons tested positive although they did not have the virus.  In non-medical terms, their immune system was sufficient to have fought the virus.  They still have the antibodies in their systems, which indicates they had contact with the virus, but they no longer have the virus. Persons who are receiving awards of £15,000 to £20,000 are, by and large, people who do not have hepatitis C but who have had contact with it and retain the antibodies.  They are being compensated for that and it explains the lower level of award.  On the one hand, one is dealing with people who have the antibodies and, on the other, with people who have the virus.</P>
    <P>Of the 327 awards to which I referred on Second Stage, about 120 were provisional awards. The type of applicant who will opt for a provisional award is usually a person who has the virus and whose medical prognosis can carry them to a certain point in the future, but who would like to retain the ability to come back to the tribunal if the prognosis was better than the events which subsequently occurred.  That explains another divergence in the awards.  The people who receive provisional awards tend to be people who have the virus.  However, while their awards are significant, they are less than those of people in similar circumstances who opt for full and final settlement by way of a lump sum.  That accounts for another subdivision in the awards.</P>
    <P>There are general damages and special damages. Loss of earnings would explain many of the larger discrepancies among persons of similar health status.  The age of the person is another factor and it is linked to the loss of earnings factor.  A young professional woman in her thirties who goes before the compensation tribunal with the same health status from hepatitis C as an older person who is not suffering loss of earnings would tend to get significantly larger compensation. Some people might deem that unfair but that is how the compensation system works before the High Court as well.  Life expectancy is another issue.  Special damages, loss of earnings, age of persons, life expectancy and so forth are the issues taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said the range from several thousand pounds to several hundreds of thousands of pounds seems large.  The explanation is that the lower end of the range is awarded to people who do not have the virus but have the antibodies and they are entitled to compensation for their contact with the virus.  Persons at the upper end of the range will not only have the virus but would also have strong claims for special damages.</P>

      <P>We have been discussing people <Col N="603" /> who have the antibodies or the virus as a result of receiving anti-D.  Those who received the virus as a result of transfusions are usually people who have another concomitant illness and, as a result of having that condition, they would be deemed to be in greater need.  While the Minister has explained the situation of people who received blood products, are transfusion cases being pursued in the manner the Minister described?  Are they regarded as being in more urgent need than those who received the virus as a result of anti-D? Will the people who received transfusions as a result of having some other condition be given priority?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are four representative groups: Positive Action which represents anti-D mothers; Transfusion Positive which represents men and women who were infected by blood products other than anti-D, normally transfusions; the Irish Haemophilia Association which represents people who were infected by a blood product; and the Irish Kidney Association which represents a smaller number of people, 35 or so, who were infected by blood transfusions.  The members of these different groups have different needs, but they are all eligible applicants.</P>
      <P>The tribunal approaches them all on an equal basis.  In terms of rostering hearing dates, there is no preference given to anti-D mothers over members of other groups.  The only time priority is given is to a person who is seriously ill.  On a number of occasions we were asked to intercede informally when it was feared that a person might die before getting to the tribunal.  We do not determine when persons go before the tribunal. The tribunal has to decide on these issues just as a court has to.  However, if it is brought to the attention of the tribunal that somebody is seriously ill, and particularly that somebody is terminally ill, it will give priority in such a case. Members of all four organisations have been dealt with before the tribunal and, in terms of fixing dates, there is no discrimination between applicants based on the origin of their infection.</P>
      <P>The issue of eligibility for the tribunal of persons with other medical conditions where hepatitis C was a contributing factor was raised.  I will be dealing with that later.</P>

Five or six years may be too late for some of these people.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We had a lengthy discussion on this already.  In the first instance, <Col N="604" /> the tribunal will operate in two divisions and, in effect, double its output.  As well as that we are putting a settlement procedure in place in accordance with the Bill and are working out the detail so that parallel settlements could take place, and that would speed up the process significantly.  It would be untenable and unfair to tell people that if they apply now they will be compensated in five years' time.  It would drive people into the courts with all the anguish that would entail, which I would like to avoid.</P>
      <P>I do not think, however, that we should give priority to one category of victim over another. The tribunal is working very well in a very humane way.  It is working informally, and if it is brought to its attention that a particular person is critically ill, it will take that into account regardless of the organisation to which that person belongs.</P>
      <P>At the start Positive Action was reluctant to recommend its members to apply to the tribunal. However, the Irish Haemophilia Association moved quickly for reasons that are obvious &mdash; its members frequently do not have so long to wait. Members of the Irish Kidney Association applied quickly also.  In terms of numbers, a significant number of people represented by the Irish Haemophilia Association have had their cases dealt with &mdash; up to now, proportionately more of those have been dealt with.  However, here we are dealing with much smaller numbers, just over 100 in the Irish Haemophilia Association and 30 to 40 in the Irish Kidney Association.  Positive Action represents a bigger group of people, but within that category there are more people who have antibodies than have the virus.  The group that have the virus number about 450.  Among the 1,680 there are dependants and carers as well as applicants, and they are also eligible to apply. Three hundred and twenty seven have gone through, so the number of outstanding applicants is down significantly.</P>

    <P>Section 6(3)(a) provides that a person who has already had a claim for compensation determined <Col N="605" /> by the non-statutory compensation tribunal may apply to the statutory compensatory tribunal to hear evidence at the discretion of the tribunal which was not made available to the non-statutory tribunal in calculating the award made to that person.  This provision was requested by the Irish Kidney Association.</P>
    <P>Section 6(3)(b) provides that a person who has already had a claim for compensation determined by the non-statutory compensation tribunal may apply to the tribunal for an award of aggravated or exemplary damages or an amount to be paid to her or him from the reparation fund.  I am not accepting Deputy Cowen's proposed amendment which we are discussing with the amendment in my name.  However, I am proposing an amendment to section 6 which will add an additional subsection to the section which effectively takes account of Deputy Cowen's view on this.  The amendment provides that a person who has had a claim determined by the non-statutory tribunal may apply to the tribunal to hear evidence on any statutory or non-statutory benefits which were taken into account by the non-statutory tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 6(3)(c) provides that a person who has already had a claim for compensation determined by the non-statutory compensation tribunal may appeal an award.

      <P>A copy of amendment No. 9b has just been handed to me by the Clerk.  I will first deal with my amendment and then tease out what the Minister has said.  Positive Action has written to the Minister asking that the amendment which I have submitted be included.  No. 18 of the heads of the Bill was clearly directed to create an entitlement in those who had already been before the tribunal to &ldquo;the benefit of any adjustments to the compensation scheme provided for under this Bill&rdquo;.  In its view section 6 as drafted and now published does not reflect the substance of No. 18.  For that reason they asked me to put down this amendment.</P>
      <P>The whole question here is that of trying to ensure that, in the transition from a non-statutory to a statutory tribunal, people will benefit and that the equalisation will be up rather than down. It is important to try to see why the Minister is not accepting the amendment as set out.  I am at a disadvantage in that I have not seen amendment No. 9b before now.  It proposes that a person who has had a claim for compensation determined by the non-statutory tribunal may apply to the tribunal to hear evidence on any statutory or non-statutory benefits which she or he has received or is entitled to receive which were taken into account by the non-statutory tribunal in assessing an award to that person.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My legal advice is that a person's case in law dies with him or her. Therefore, I cannot accept an amendment that seeks to enshrine in statute a measure that would allow the claim of a person who has died to live on.  Dependants have a right under the Bill to claim compensation even though the deceased may have received damages.  Dependants and carers, as well as those who have been infected, may make claims.  If a person receives an award from the compensation tribunal and subsequently dies there is provision in the statute for the dependants of the deceased to make independent claims in their own right.  They will be dealt with on their merits.</P>

      <P>That does not cover the case to which I have referred on a number of occasions. The dependants of a person whose case has not gone before the tribunal do not have rights. People who did not know they were infected died from hepatitis C prior to going before the tribunal. Have the dependants of such people any rights?  The figure under the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act increased from £7,500 to £15,000 and does not cover these people.  There are two categories of people not covered under this legislation.  The dependants of those who did not appear before the tribunal have a right to seek compensation because they were also the <Col N="607" /> victims of contaminated blood.  People who we know from their files died from hepatitis C should also be taken into account.  Their deaths were expedited by hepatitis C.  Will their dependants be considered under this legislation?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The dependants of a deceased person who have not appeared before the tribunal have a right to claim as dependants.  Those claims are preserved.  There are other issues which Deputy Cowen raised with which we will have to deal on Report Stage.  I cannot concede his amendment because as a general principle a person's case in law dies with him or her and while we can ensure that dependants, as dependants, have a right to claim before the compensation tribunal, the representatives of the deceased person cannot re-enter for increased damages under the provisions of the tribunal.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's point that the dependant may be the personal representative in terms of the estate and may not be applying as a dependant.  On reflection, I accept that is the legal position.  I take it from what the Minister said that provisions elsewhere in the Bill will have a similar effect in that a dependant will be able to apply and receive the same level of additional compensation as a personal representative seeking to improve the assets of an estate based on a civil action while the person was alive.  If I understand the Minister correctly, it is a case of six of one and half a dozen of the other.  What is the position in regard to amendment No. a7a?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The provision that was available for dependants of deceased persons until the implementation of the 1996 Act was £7,500.  Since 1996 the figure has increased to £20,000.  I am trying to construct an amendment that will apply the £20,000 benefit to persons who died as a result of hepatitis C prior to the enactment of the 1996 Act.  This covers a point brought to my attention on several occasions by Deputy McDaid.  If possible we will try to have the amendment drafted before 7 p.m., but if I am not sure of the wording we will have to resume after 8.30 p.m. for a short Report Stage.  I would prefer to be certain about the drafting before tabling a Report Stage amendment which might have implications in the manner in which the High Court would deal with claims of dependants of persons who were deceased prior to 1996.  I want to ensure that what we do is ringfenced in respect of this tribunal and that if something must subsequently be done for other persons affected prior to 1996, it is done in appropriate legislation and is not imported from here.</P>

I am glad the Minister has readily accepted that, <Col N="608" /> as a minimum, people from those families should still be able to claim.  As Deputy McDaid has pointed out, even £20,000 in compensation may not be commensurate with compensation that others will get who may have lived longer than those who died before the coming into force of that section of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 1996.  I welcome the Minister's openness on that point and await his amendment, which should cover the issues raised.</P>

Subsection (2) refers to documents available to the parties which are not to be made available to others.  It seems that there is no sanction if one does not abide by this provision.

Will the Minister outline how the fund will work?

How does the Minister envisage it working and being resourced without impacting on other areas of the health service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section 11 provides for the establishment of a reparation fund to enable payments to be made to claimants as an alternative to applying to the compensation tribunal to assess aggravated or exemplary damages. It is not a fund for aggravated or exemplary damages; it is a reparation fund which is outside the remit of the tribunal and is an option for persons who do not want to proceed or who do not want to process a claim for aggravated or exemplary damages within the tribunal, but that option also remains open to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided that claimants after establishing their claim for damages, that is general or special damages, at the compensation tribunal will have two options.  They can seek to <Col N="611" /> establish their entitlement to aggravated or exemplary damages at the compensation tribunal or they can accept payment from a special reparation fund which will be established by the Government.  That payment will amount to 20 per cent of the total amount awarded in general or special damages made by the compensation tribunal. The reparation fund would have the following advantages for the claimant: simplicity, ease of calculation, certainty of result and early conclusion.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2) provides, subject to subsection (3), that the moneys in the reparation fund may be used at any time, but only for the purposes for which they were voted and shall be issued out of that account only by direction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 11(3) provides that any moneys, including interest, if any, in the reparation fund may be paid into, or disposed of for the benefit of, the Exchequer in accordance with the directions of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 11(4) provides for a claimant's right to have an amount paid to her or him from the reparation fund as an alternative to applying to the compensation tribunal to assess aggravated or exemplary damages.</P>
    <P>Section 11(5) prohibits a claimant who has had aggravated or exemplary damages made to her or him by the compensation tribunal from applying for payment from the reparation fund.</P>
    <P>Section 11(6) provides that the amount paid out of the reparation fund shall amount to 20 per cent of the total amount of the award of general or special damages made by the tribunal or a settlement under section 8.</P>
    <P>Section 11(7) provides that the Minister for Health shall manage and control the reparation fund.</P>
    <P>Section 11(8) provides that the account of the fund shall be prepared in such form, in such manner and at such times as the Minister for Finance may direct, be an account with the Paymaster General, be subject to such terms and conditions as the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Health, may determine and be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Section 11(9) empowers the Minister for Health by order to appoint a day that the reparation fund shall be established.</P>
    <P>In terms of what will happen in practice, an applicant who goes to the compensation tribunal will decide whether he or she wants to process a claim for special and aggravated damages within the tribunal and will see what that will be or will decide he or she wants to apply for general and special damages and does not want the tribunal to assess aggravated or exemplary damages.  In the latter case the applicant would be entitled to an automatic top up of 20 per cent on whatever award the compensation tribunal would make without having to fight the case before it in terms of aggravated or exemplary damages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> The trigger which enables an applicant to draw down money from the reparation fund is a successful application which results in compensation being awarded by the tribunal and the amount is 20 per cent of whatever is the amount of the award.  This is not a mechanism for awarding aggravated or exemplary damages.  It is an alternative mechanism we put in place to acknowledge the hurt done by an agency of the State to many people.  It is an extra amount of payment.</P>
    <P>However, there are a number of alternatives a person may pursue.  A person may go to court, process a claim for aggravated or exemplary damages within the tribunal or may waive the right to do that and, alternatively, be awarded general and special damages and automatically get a 20 per cent top up on that.  The Government decided this will be a separate fund within the Department of Health and will not impact on its general finances.  It should not have any crossover effect on the general Health Estimate.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There was not particularly lengthy negotiation on that.  Most of the talks and consultation with the representatives of Positive Action were about the provisions of the Bill on which they went into great detail. We had a series of negotiations about the heads of the Bill and subsequently about amendments to the draft Bill.  As a result of one of its general meetings, Positive Action's public position on the compensation tribunal was that there should be a top up of 30 per cent.  However, in the process of negotiation &mdash; the Deputy is probably aware of this because he may have seen the documentation &mdash; I put forward a number of alternatives to the representative groups.  One was that the compensation tribunal should adjudicate on aggravated and exemplary damages.  A second option, which did not find favour, was an outside arbitrator to decide a percentage or some lump sum figure which could be added on in terms of reparation. There was also the idea of a reparation fund. What evolved was that persons wanted to maintain their legal right to process a claim for aggravated or exemplary within the compensation tribunal, but they also wanted an easier alternative system, easier in terms of process.  We combined two of the options, the reparation fund and the first option.  Positive Action's opening position was 30 per cent.  The Deputy will be aware that when the Government sanctioned the heads of the Bill, it included provision for 15 per cent. Through a process of consultation agreement was reached on 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process was not long or tortuous.  There were many meetings, but they were not about <Col N="613" /> that.  They were about the content of the legislation before us.  I am glad the consultative process brought about a result which is satisfactory for the interest groups. Some of the amendments tabled today by Deputy Cowen and in my name have brought the position forward and, to a large degree, have met further requests of the representative groups.  While the last amendment we dealt with, to which I will have to come back on Report Stage, one in which Deputy McDaid has been interested for such a long time, does not meet fully the outer range of the request, it is a significant movement forward from what was the position.</P>

      <P>I wish to contribute to this debate because of a number of incidents in recent times regarding the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  I would also like to say a few words on the substantive issue.  A game of cat and mouse has been going on in relation to the hearings of this committee.  Fianna Fáil Members and the media arrived at the committee room at 2.30 p.m. today on the understanding the committee was to meet a matter which had been discussed in the Chamber on a number of occasions prior to that. For some reason, people absented themselves from the meeting, which was not held.</P>
      <P>As a result of that, I wrote to the Clerk of the committee on behalf of Fianna Fáil Members asking that a meeting be held forthwith.  I received a message from the Clerk saying that a meeting of the committee is scheduled for 2.30 p.m. tomorrow. In view of what we seem to know about an election being called tomorrow morning, I take it that no committee meeting will be held at 2.30 p.m. so why has one been arranged?  Perhaps Government Deputies or the Minister of State might enlighten us.  There is a sad irony here in that this Dáil is in its final days.</P>
      <P>In its Programme for Renewal this Government, which came to power by default, said the relationship between Government and the people it serves has been damaged by a lack of openness and that the relationship must be renewed.  The three parties in this Rainbow Coalition pledged themselves to: &ldquo;the reform of our institutions at national and local level to provide service, accountability, transparency and freedom of information.&rdquo;  The document, which has mostly been ignored by the three parties since they got into Government, states that reform of the Oireachtas must be fundamental and radical and must aim at ensuring that the various organs of State and holders of high office in the State are more answerable and accountable to the Legislature and ensuring that Dáil Éireann has real powers to investigate matters of serious public concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government had been in office for some time Geraldine Kennedy of <i>The Irish Times</i> said: &ldquo;John Bruton is presiding over the most closed and least transparent administration for more than twenty years&rdquo;.  This Government does not like telling the truth and does not like being straight with the people.  The Taoiseach has kept <Col N="615" /> away from the people and the media at every turn.  Ministers surround themselves with handlers and press officers at the taxpayers' expense. The record of evasion, economy of truth and incompetence speaks for itself.  It is fitting to quote the Minister for Health, who said in this Chamber in December 1994 that truth is the currency of accountability.  However, accountability does not mean telling cover stories to the Dáil; it means telling the truth even when it is uncomfortable and works against the personal interest of those who tell it.</P>
    <P>In December 1994 the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Every voter is entitled to expect the Government to operate to high standards, to be answerable for every action it takes and to be open.&rdquo;  In November 1994 he said: &ldquo;We have to find the people a Government they will believe in, a Government they can trust and above all a Government of truth.&rdquo;  He also said Ministers must not conceal the truth from the Dáil and that without truth there is no foundation for good Government.  In December 1994 the Taoiseach said the Government must go about its work without excess or extravagance and as transparently as if it were working behind a pane of glass.  How that pane of glass has frosted.</P>

      <P>Not for long.  The Tánaiste said: &ldquo;This is the correct and appropriate place for those who hold public office and are responsible for decisions of public concern to account for their accounts and omissions&rdquo;.  He also said: &ldquo;The key issue, throughout this entire episode is accountability &mdash; the right of the public to secure adequate explanations and the responsibility of the holders of high office to take responsibility for their actions.  Semantic distinctions between responsibility and culpability, however interesting they might be in their own right, do not meet the needs of this case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In December 1994 the Minister for Justice said: &ldquo;At the very centre of the political character there has always resided the principle of accountability&rdquo;. Some months ago when debating a motion on payments by Dunnes Stores and Ben Dunne during which the Government rejected a proposal by the Opposition to hold a tribunal, the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>We must do everything we can to bring all the facts into the public domain and then the action that needs to be taken can be taken.  If it is political action in respect of a matter that is not a criminal offence but which is within the area of political unacceptability, then political steps can be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the McCole case, the Minister for Health made the case that he was obliged to act on legal advice that the State was not liable in negligence.  No legal opinion has the status of law <Col N="616" /> and does not prevent the client, the Minister for Health in this case, from concluding a settlement acceptable to both sides.  Such settlements are routine in the High Court where the majority of cases listed for hearing are settled by agreement between counsel on both sides, although the defendant has formally denied liability in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn adequately instanced how Fianna Fáil endeavoured to raise these issues during 30 debates on hepatitis C and ten debates on the McCole case, not to mention Question Time.  Anyone who suggests we were electioneering in the past week is flying in the face of the truth.  When this issue first arose, it was raised by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I found it annoying and worrying that the State rejected the use of an assumed name by Brigid McCole.  I cannot fathom how any one came up with such reasoning and why they would not allow a woman who was on her deathbed, which the State would have known, that anonymity in her dying days.  I do not understand how there could be a legal strategy in adopting that approach.  Somebody had to give instructions on the rejection of the assumed name by Brigid McCole, on the use of the statute of limitations and on the lodgement.  It is no good saying it was the BTSB because it is not the paymaster.  The paymasters are the Department of Health and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>It was revealing when the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, said on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; that the legal strategy was decided by the Government, that is a question which needs to be answered.  He went on to say the Government made the decision as to how all these things happen. Yet the Government is trying to revise history. It is no use saying the Finlay tribunal dealt with the matter.  The terms of reference were decided by this Government to exclude the fifth question to which the McCole family wanted an answer.  It is a shame on this Government which professed openness, transparency and accountability. At every turn, not only on the McCole issue but on a matter as basic as Dáil reform about which it promised action, the Government changed its mind.</P>
    <P>Shame on this Government.</P>

      <P>I have been involved in this very tragic issue from the time it first came to light in February 1994.  I have been involved in it since then for personal reasons but more especially through my relationship, communication and work with Positive Action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> When the enormity of this tragedy emerged I had three main concerns: first, that proper and adequate compensation be provided to its victims; second, that the best health care this State could provide should be made available to victims and their families and, third, that the truth be established.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have negotiated for some time with the Department of Health on behalf of Positive Action.  While I am glad that the vast majority of that organisation's requests on behalf of victims have been granted, my regret is that it took so long.  Two years later it is difficult to look back and fully realise all the painstaking arguments advanced for what has been granted to date.  As the Minister said last evening, had he known then what he knows today, probably different decisions would have been taken.</P>
    <P>As someone who has been through the mill with victims and their representatives, who has intimate knowledge of all the negotiations, arguments and communications that took place between the Department of Health and Positive Action, I contend Positive Action are due all the laurels.  They never ceased in their determination and were more than realistic and fair in their requests.  While they have obtained 99 per cent of their requests, it should not have taken so long.</P>
    <P>Information became available at different stages.  It is very easy, with the benefit of hindsight, for all of us to say what should have been done two years ago.  I ask all Members to look into their hearts and ask if they would have done better.  Would they have listened to and believed Positive Action?  There is one important message to be learned from this tragic saga not only for politicians but for the general public, which is that people should be believed when they have a tragic case to relate and it should be accepted that they are telling the truth.</P>
    <P>I also want to acknowledge the bravery, courtesy and dignified manner in which members of Positive Action negotiated and campaigned on behalf of its members.  Many of us in politics could learn many lessons from that representative body and all those it represents.  I am so glad it has been successful.</P>
    <P>One cannot speak about this tragedy without referring to the deep hurt and sadness of the McCole family.  Many other families are experiencing similar hurt and difficulties today and will for a number of years to come.</P>
    <P>The hepatitis C disaster must never recur.  We could argue forever who is to blame but, if we do not learn the important lesson that we must never cease to be vigilant about the operations of all the bodies and agencies responsible for the welfare of our people, we shall have failed the community at large.  It is most regrettable that a tragedy of such enormity should have occurred in this State and that its victims will continue to suffer.</P>
    <P>After innumerable inquiries and investigations the truth finally emerged.  Would it ever have emerged but for the bravery of the late Mrs McCole?  We must now look forward because the <Col N="618" /> many victims want to get on with their lives whatever the quality.  It is our duty to ensure that they are given all the resources to enable them do so. Positive Action will become part of the history of this country.  Theirs was a very brave campaign from which all of us can learn.</P>
    <P>Had it been predicted that such a tragedy could have occurred, I am sure none of us would have believed it possible.  In the future it will probably be difficult for people to understand the reason it took so long to establish the truth and obtain the benefits, resources and help for the victims.  One would almost have had to experience it to accept that it could occur in this State.</P>
    <P>We must take every possible precaution to ensure it never recurs because any tragedy that affects the health of our people is most serious. We cannot undo what has occurred but, through our vigilance and continuous scrutiny, we can ensure it will never recur.</P>
    <P>The other important point is that we should believe people when they raise concerns and suspicions. That is imperative.  Those responsible for this enormous tragedy should have to answer for their negligence.  The victims continue to suffer but as yet nobody has had to answer for the cause of this tragedy.  While that would be of no real help to those suffering from contamination with anti-D, in the interests of justice we must ensure that those who may have contributed to this disaster pay the price.</P>
    <P>As a Parliament, as a society, I am concerned that we learn from this enormous tragedy.  Within the lifetime of the next Government, if other issues do emerge or are raised by the victims, they must be treated in a very sympathetic, caring manner.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time I have contributed to debates on this enormous scandal but it is the first time I have spoken on a motion that addresses an individual case.</P>
      <P>All of us in this House should pause and consider carefully what it is we do.  Much of our time is expended on scoring points or coldly dissecting the merits or demerits of a proposed plan of action, whereas this evening and yesterday we have been required to confront something often omitted from our business.  We must remember that our actions here have an impact on everybody within our society.</P>
      <P>As a female Member of Dáil Éireann, I feel the anguish and pain visited on many families as a result of this affair.  No amount of money or remuneration can repair the damage done to those people's lives.  We must acknowledge the level of pain, sorrow and anger which exists as a result of what happened.  Of all the subjects and topics I have dealt with since I was elected to the Dáil five years ago, I have found this matter to be the most harrowing and painful.  This has not been an issue for normal political debate.  It challenges all in this House to remember that we are human beings working for human beings.  Even now, I am still unsure about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> This is obviously an issue of public significance and policy but we, as public representatives, must deal with the issue in a sensitive and humane manner.  Attacking Deputies on the other side of the Chamber is inappropriate but we must not allow courtesy to the victims and their families get in the way of a rigorous examination of what must be done.  As the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, said to the Labour Party regional conference in Cork last October and before the tribunal began its work, &ldquo;We are all damaged by our inability to say we are sorry.  Of course, there are legal constraints but there are human imperatives too.  We are a community, each dependent on one another.  As a community, we have seen hurt and suffering where it should not exist and we should be able to express regret for that in a human way&rdquo;.  These sentiments express how I feel about what has happened.  This issue has caused great pain and anguish to many women and families.</P>
    <P>Since the tragedy first became public, there has been a long and comprehensive judicial investigation chaired by the former Chief Justice, Mr. Thomas Finlay.  The Government accepts the findings and has given a solemn commitment to implement all the report's recommendations.  The Government must make every resource available to ensure our blood supply is not open to known infection or contamination ever again.  We owe it to the victims of the hepatitis C affair to ensure the integrity and the quality of the blood supply is beyond question.</P>
    <P>I know what this is about.  I was ill for 13 months, faced theatre five times and waited for blood five times.  I had to have confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board and I want people who are in accidents tonight, who are haemophiliacs or who must go into theatre, to have confidence in the blood supply.  Anyone who receives blood does so in good faith.  The country's blood supply is an integral part of our health service.  The blood many patients require in the form of transfusions must be of the highest standard known to science at any given time.  We must ensure people who need these emergency supplies can have faith in the blood they receive.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the women of Positive Action for their perseverance and strength in voicing the case of their members.  I welcome the Government's decision to enact a Bill which puts the hepatitis C compensation tribunal on a statutory footing.  It will not be for whatever Minister is in power to play around with it.  The tribunal will not go away in a few months and the victims will not have to depend on the colour of the Government of the day.  As the Minister for Health said last night, this has been the worst tragedy ever in our health service.  In what is probably my last contribution to this 27th Dáil, I sincerely hope I never have to take part in a debate like this again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I find no joy in contributing to this debate which has come <Col N="620" /> on the heels of what has just been described as the greatest tragedy ever in the health service.  Its history dates back to the mid-1970s but the full horror and import of what took place has only recently become known.  It is extraordinary the Blood Transfusion Service Board could be the subject of so many blunders in such awful and tragic circumstances.  It is a lesson to us all about what can happen when a culture of secrecy pervades the discovery by such a body that it is doing something wrong.</P>
      <P>We have devised a political system in which whoever is at the top takes the blame.  In this case, the Minister for Health has taken some very unfair pillorying in recent months.  He has dealt with it with great dignity although he was subject to the most abusive verbal vilification in this House by leading Opposition spokespersons. Everyone knows the history of this dates back much further than the tenure of this Minister, probably to the tenure of the previous four Ministers for Health.  This emotive debate has been unfairly politicised.</P>
      <P>We all apologise and feel greatly diminished when we face the people who have been affected by this tragedy.  Words cannot express sympathy to Mrs. McCole's family but genuine regret is felt in this House and by the public.  We share a part of the guilt, being Members of this House and being so much an integral part of Government. Therefore, it is disgraceful that, when an issue such as this arises, the debate conducted should be politicised and political advantage should be seen to be gained.  It is appalling and does no credit to the spokespersons of the Opposition parties who have tried to exploit this issue for base political ends.</P>
      <P>I was delighted the Minister clarified many things in his speech.  This debate has become clouded because of the slants put on so many of its salient points.  Because so many people tried to blame him and his Department, the Minister clarified that, in the case of the late Mrs. McCole, the Blood Transfusion Service Board admitted liability and settled the case with the representatives of her family.  The BTSB is a separate legal entity with its own legal advice and insurers and is distinct from the Department of Health.  The Minister went on to say the State had independent legal counsel at all times who advised it had no liability and that remains its position.  It is important these matters be re-emphasised.  The Minister said court cases are conducted according to legal rules governing civil liability and they are presented in accordance with the adversarial rules in cases of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the letter from the solicitors for the BTSB to the solicitors for Mrs. McCole, which offered a settlement, included provisions whereby the BTSB accepted it would pay the costs of the State and the National Drugs Advisory Board. Many commentators and political spokespersons have suggested for mischievous reasons that this shows collusion between the State, the BTSB and the National Drugs Advisory Board.  That is <Col N="621" /> wrong and those who suggested it know it to be so.  There may be a misunderstanding of what was involved and the record should be put straight. As I understand the law, where a plaintiff sues a number of defendants, only one of whom admits liability, by settling with that party the plaintiff may face a claim for costs by the other defendants who have not admitted liability.  They could say that since they are innocent the plaintiff must pay the costs.  For that reason a plaintiff settling with a guilty defendant will require, as a usual condition, that the guilty defendant pays the plaintiff's costs and the costs of the innocent defendants. That is an established rule in such cases. Only by securing that agreement, which is customary, can a plaintiff ensure he will not lose out in claims for costs by innocent defendants.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board accepts liability and it also accepts that neither of the other two defendants is liable.  It is important to re-emphasise that there is no implication of contact between the State and the BTSB or that Mrs. McCole's advisers were not prepared to settle unless they were given protection against the cost of claims from the State or the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>It is no pleasure for any Member of this House to engage in this debate.  We are dealing with a disaster and all of us know people who have been affected.  At least ten people in my constituency infected by anti-D have approached me.  Many of them have lost their health and their quality of life while others are in failing health and know that their lives are shortened.  The quality of life for those people is greatly diminished and in many cases destroyed.  It is a great tragedy, and we must never allow it to happen again.</P>
    <P>The Government, particularly the Department involved, must be vigilant at all times, and independent boards such as the Blood Transfusion Service Board must be more answerable and accountable to the Department and this House for their actions.  Independence is important in the commercial semi-State area.  Nevertheless, with independence comes major responsibility. There must be accountability and systems must be put in place by which bodies are made accountable so that when things go wrong they cannot hide.  Mistakes should be revealed early.</P>
    <P>This tragedy has been compounded by the fact that the truth was not revealed in time.  Too many people ran for cover.  Unfortunately, we have a system by which such people can find cover.  That position must be changed.  I hope the incumbent Minister will be back in the Department because he has been an excellent holder of that office.  He has been innovative and adventurous and has solved many problems in the health area, such as long waiting lists and shortage of beds and facilities in hospitals, yet he has endured much grief on this issue which has nothing to do with him. Because the buck stopped with him, he had to deal with the issue, and he dealt with it very well. We must never allow this to happen again to the victims or to the people who have ultimate political <Col N="622" /> control.  I hope, in passing legislation to put the compensation tribunal on a statutory footing, the outcome will be comprehensive enough to deal with all future eventualities.</P>

      <P>Yesterday and today we addressed the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Bill.  There was a protracted battle to ensure that Bill was brought before the House and, even at this late stage, I welcome it.  For the past two years and four months it has been evident that the best approach to this sad and tragic case would be to set up a statutory tribunal.  The putting in place of such a tribunal may be seen as a major victory for the victims of hepatitis C. Nobody in the House appreciates the tremendous pain, suffering, insecurity and anxiety felt by the victims of hepatitis C.  Neither can we understand the pain and suffering of their families since this tragedy came to light.</P>
      <P>The setting up of Positive Action should be acknowledged.  That group has done tremendous work with dignity and professionalism on behalf of hepatitis C victims.  It must have been very difficult for it to fight this case given that the circumstances were so tragic and emotional.  It took part in every level of debate with the Minister, whether on television or radio, without allowing emotions to take over.  I take this opportunity to extend to Positive Action my gratitude.  I recognise the tremendous work it has done.  At this late stage, after many months of difficult battles on behalf of its members, the Government is listening to its arguments and action, however little, is being taken.</P>
      <P>The concerns of Fianna Fáil about this Bill were addressed by our spokesperson on Committee Stage.  It was most unfortunate we had to wait so long for initiation of the legislation.  We are talking about the greatest scandal the State has faced.  I have underlined the distress, anxiety, fear and feelings of hopelessness experienced by victims and their families, which is palpable.  Therefore, the Government has an obligation to address this problem not only in a legal fashion but in a humane way.  Why has it been so difficult for the State to apologise to the victims and ensure their future, financially and medically, is secure?  Why has the Government been so secretive about its legal dealings in the late Mrs. McCole case?  Where are the tests of openness, transparency and accountability of the Taoiseach and the Government on the whole hepatitis C scandal?  All we have heard from the Government has been hollow rhetoric as far as openness, transparency and accountability are concerned in the tragic McCole case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should not have been necessary to table numerous Private Members' motions on the matter during the past two and a half years or to table Priority and Oral Questions.  Immediately on learning of this tragedy, the Minister and the Government should have given a full, open and true explanation.  Unfortunately, we are still trying to find the truth with regard to the legal strategy <Col N="623" /> employed by the Government in the McCole case, hence this debate.  All the Opposition is trying to do is find out the truth for the victims of hepatitis C and what brought about the offensive legal strategy which has been employed by the Government against Mrs. McCole and her family. Why have we had a cover up and an unwillingness to come clean on the strategy?  Why have the Minister for Health and the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, not been prepared to speak up?  Why do they insist on hiding behind their claim of privilege, especially in this specific case?  Our spokesperson, Deputy Cowen, who has a legal training, has pointed out that the debate on privilege can be got around quite simply by looking at a specific case, in this instance the McCole case.  The arguments put forward by the Government and the Minister seem to be an opportunity to hide behind the question of privilege rather than finding a comparatively simple way of getting over that hurdle.</P>
    <P>The hepatitis C scandal is due to blood transfusion negligence and not in any way to the victims. Since the whole tragedy came to light, many victims of hepatitis C have been made to feel it has been due to some error on their part.  This feeling has created even further difficulties, concerns and anxieties for the victims and their families. That is why an early apology and an open approach to the problem by the Government may well have helped to ease the anxieties that have developed during the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>Surely the victims have suffered enough without the Government contributing to further delay and anxiety.  Positive Action, on behalf of its members, sought a number of simple things: health care &mdash; physical and psychological &mdash; compensation and the truth.  On listening to Members on the opposite benches, it is distasteful to hear them accuse the Opposition parties, particularly Fianna Fáil, of making this sad situation a political football.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Government must recognise that any Opposition has an obligation to seek the truth. We have an obligation to fight on behalf of the people whom we represent to ensure the Government is questioned closely on each and every issue.  Equally the Government has an obligation to ensure such answers are forthcoming.  It is distasteful that this charge should be thrown at the Opposition when we have an obligation to seek the truth on this and every other issue.  It is most disconcerting to listen to some Opposition Members' remarks on the issue of hepatitis C.  In many ways, and especially from the medical point of view, it is a complicated issue.  What we do not want is a debate which further clouds the issues. That has happened in regard to many aspects of this debate and the debates we have already had. That has been due to the lack of clarity by the Government.  Why will the Government, through the Minister for Health, not state the facts and give the answers which the family of the late Mrs. McCole and the public have a right to know?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> We are all aware of the Minister's reference to question 5 and that it has not been answered.  I hope, even at this late stage, the Minister for Health will recognise the right of the people, but particularly the right of the hepatitis C victims, to hear the whole story with regard to the political and legal approach to this case.  This could be done by attending the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  The members of that committee wish to question the Minister and perhaps others. If that was done it could clear the air and we would know the truth.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in trying to discuss the whole question of privilege, is trying to get the Government off the hook by saying the main thrust of the case was between the legal teams.  As our spokesperson said, the lawyers were representing the State and, therefore, had to consult their clients, namely, the Government, before any action was taken.  It is not a simple question of allowing the public to believe that lawyers went off without having a particular strategy from their client.  We want to know what that legal and political strategy was.  There is such a thing as political responsibility and accountability.  It is sad, in a tragic case such as this, that any excuse is given, whether it be privilege or otherwise, to try to prevent the truth coming to light.</P>
    <P>Anyone who listened to Brigid McCole's daughter, Brid, giving her statement last Sunday was moved.  Her statement was quoted by the spokesperson for health earlier in this debate but I would like to refer to it again.  She said:</P>
    <P>Today I am speaking to the press on behalf of my family to ask the Minister for Health to give us answers as to why our late mother, Mrs. Brigid Ellen McCole, was threatened because she pursued her compensation claim through the courts.  I have come from my home in County Donegal today to ask the Minister and the Government to give us the answer to that question.  Many other issues have been resolved in recent weeks but our fifth question has not been answered.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Health and the Government to answer that question so that this issue can be resolved for the McCole family.  It would help them to get on with living the rest of their lives &mdash; I am sure in great sadness &mdash; and in some small way would alleviate much concern and sadness.  By so doing, the Government would make up for the tremendous distress which has been caused by the delay and its attempts at a cover up.  The Minister and the Government have an obligation to the McCole family and the other victims.  They have an opportunity to show some humanity by answering the questions asked by the family which every other victim of hepatitis C and their families wish to hear.</P>

      <P>Cuireann se brón orm mar Theachta Dála don cheantar bheith anseo arís mar gheall ar cás Bhean McCole go mórmhór toisc an brú a chuir an Stáit ar a clann.  People do not realise where the McCole family comes from or the type of life and simplicity to which they have been accustomed.  They come from a remote part of Donegal outside Crolly, two or three miles from the nearest road.  Like 99.9 per cent of the population they are simple people.  However, for the last two years or more, it is distressing that we have had to discuss <i>ad infinitum</i> the pressures imposed on the family and the entire crisis of hepatitis C and related health issues.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has been accused of political opportunism by raising this matter prior to a general election.  I take umbrage at such remarks.  If every Member of this House was doing his or her job there would be no need for the Opposition to pick holes in the Government's actions.  Our job is to ensure that the Government does its best for the people.  Only for the Opposition and the women in this House this matter would not have reached any conclusions.  This has been achieved in conjunction with the voluntary lobby groups, particularly Positive Action, who have given of energies they cannot afford in trying to ensure that truth emerges.</P>
      <P>I will not get involved in political bargaining across the floor of the House.  Before Mrs. McCole died she asked the State for answers to five questions.  That is not a huge burden on the State.  However, we have to come into this House in the final throes of this Dáil to try to get the answer to the fifth question.</P>
      <P>Most Members are not legal experts and would not appreciate the minutiae of legislation. However, we have more legislation and less justice. Justice is all that people are seeking.  One has to see what many ill people go through in Donegal, particularly those whose illness is not of their own making.  One sets off for Letterkenny at 6 a.m. and then on to Beaumont Hospital where one sits about for a couple of hours and is in very bad form.  One then has to return home, by which time it might be 11 p.m. or midnight. Such a routine increases the pressure on physical and mental health and the ability to cope.</P>
      <P>With all due respect to Cork people, I heard it said in this House that they had to cross a bridge to go to a hospital.  This took five minutes.  It takes at least seven hours to get to Dublin from Crolly.  One must appreciate that trauma for a patient.  There is also the trauma of not knowing why one was ill for so many years while trying to look after and rear one's family.  Mrs. McCole could be proud of the resilience and independence of her family, her daughters in particular, in pursuing the truth.  It is pathetic to have a young woman go before the media on a Sunday evening trying to put pressure on the Government and raise public awareness of what is their natural right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tried to address the problems of hepatitis C in this House.  Some years ago we pleaded with <Col N="626" /> the Minister to establish the tribunal on a statutory basis.  It was only after the distress of the victims became known that legislation was introduced. It was the same with the setting up of the tribunal in the first place and the admission of liability.  I implore the Minister to look at this case again and to take a non-legalistic but humane decision to tell the McCole family why their mother was pursued with such vehemence on her death bed.  This was very wrong.  No one expects the State to put pressure on its citizens against their constitutional rights.  It is a sorry day, not just in this crisis but in many other aspects of life, if that is the way we run this State.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's speech and heard what he had to say over recent years.  We have to realise the human aspect of this crisis.  We have to appreciate that people are unaccustomed to legal jargon.  I spoke to a woman from Donegal who went before the tribunal.  She recounted the discomfort of having to sit before a judge with lawyers present of not being asked to make a contribution and not being able to ask consultants for medical reasons for her illness.  That is also wrong.</P>
    <P>We have to appreciate where people are coming from and the trauma they and their families are experiencing.  We need to provide a forum in which they can make their claim in the simplest form yet still receive justice.  Will the Minister provide the McCole family with that justice?  Will he answer the fifth question and allow them to mourn realising that they have the truth and that they were able to obtain something on behalf of their mother?  I know the family and Donegal people and if it takes to the ends of this earth they will ensure that they get the truth and the answers.  They should not have to pursue this in such a vigorous way to get the answers they deserve.</P>

      <P>I am astounded that Government speakers have accused the Opposition parties of turning this into a political issue.  It has been raised in the Dáil only because the family of the woman concerned and Positive Action want to know the truth.  She was forced to take legal action in the courts to have her rights vindicated. The people will never forget the trauma she and her family had to endure.  She showed exemplary dignity and determination and was an example to each and every one of us.  We were all humbled by her.</P>
      <P>Mrs. McCole was perplexed, she did not know what was wrong with her.  She was tired and lethargic. When she discovered she had contracted hepatitis C as a result of receiving infected anti-D she became even more focused in seeking the truth.  The appalling manner in which she and other sufferers were treated brought nothing but shame on the Government and the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Theresa Ahearn asked if anyone else would have done better.  I would have thought <Col N="627" /> that is the last question any Government Deputy would ask at this late stage.  Have Members on the opposite side of the House learned anything at all?  On Sunday the Taoiseach apologised with reservations.  It was insensitive in the extreme to ask that question.  The Minister, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Social Welfare and every other member of the Government have also shown insensitivity.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Ahearn recall the Minister's statement in the House at which the members of Positive Action were so outraged that they walked out?  Does she recall the Minister's refusal to allow the woman concerned to retain her anonymity, forcing her into the open into the glare of the media?  Does she find it easy to forget that the Government and the Blood Transfusion Service Board threatened to take legal action against the woman concerned in her last week of life and pursue her for the ensuing costs?  Why has she not referred to the report of the Hederman-O'Brien committee which could not get at all of the facts? Is she aware the tribunal of inquiry could not address the question of the responsibility of politicians &mdash; the missing link &mdash; in particular the responsibility of the Minister, his predecessor and the Government?  Does she recall the statement made by Deputy Kathleen Lynch in which she accused others of trying to make money out of this?</P>
    <P>Last Sunday, the Minister, having listened to a grieving child indicate what she and the other members of her family wanted to achieve on behalf of their mother, linked this plea to political opportunism.  Is he living in the real world?  Does he know he has brought nothing but shame on the Government and has caused nothing but embarrassment for the rest of us?  The member of the family concerned said it was her mother's dying wish to get at the truth and that her family will not rest easy until the wishes of her mother have been met.</P>
    <P>The victims have a right to know.  They cannot grieve until they know the truth.  The woman concerned acted not alone on her own behalf but on behalf of all those who have suffered.  The Minister should consider letting the McCole family and the members of Positive Action know who directed the action against helpless people.  Until that is done, he will stand indicted forever within the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my sympathies to the McCole family and fully understand the anguish and distress experienced by them and the other victims as a result of this major public health disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of all the contributions made to this debate, it is necessary to reiterate some of the salient facts in this case.  In law, the BTSB is a separate legal entity.  It had its own legal advice and insurers.  The BTSB admitted liability in the <Col N="628" /> McCole case and settled the case with the McCole family representatives.</P>
    <P>The State, following normal practice, took independent legal advice from eminent legal counsel.  Counsel advised that the State was not liable in this case and that remains the State's position.</P>
    <P>There was, and is, an available alternative to court action for claimants, namely, the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal.  This alternative, which has been available since December 1995, removes the adversarial element and ensures privacy for the claimant.  However, any claimant is entitled to opt for the court system, if she or he so wishes.  The rules which govern cases generally cannot be ignored or broken for cases brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>A letter issued from the Chief State Solicitor on 21 July 1995 which set out the State's legal position on the legal cases in question.  The letter did not issue to the late Mrs. McCole.  However, the solicitors who acted for the late Mrs. McCole also act for Positive Action.  The late Mrs. McCole was a member of Positive Action.  The letter was issued in response to a letter from the solicitors on behalf of their client, Positive Action.  It was issued to inform the solicitors for Positive Action in clear terms in July 1995 of the State's legal position so that no client of theirs would embark on litigation against the State under any misapprehension as to the fact that the State intended to fully defend any litigation initiated.</P>
    <P>Our courts system is adversarial by its nature. The hepatitis C compensation scheme was introduced to avoid the victims having to go through all the conflict, stress and risks associated with litigation.  The Bill to place the scheme on a statutory basis is passing through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In the motion Fianna Fáil has called on the Government to waive the claim of privilege in the McCole case, to divulge in full the circumstances in which the State's defence of the McCole case was devised and executed, and to lay before the House all documentation giving the state of knowledge of the Government.  The instructions given to a lawyer by his or her client or the advice given to the client by his or her lawyer is based on legal professional privilege.  It is not appropriate that the State's legal advice be made public or that the management of litigation be analysed in the Dáil, particularly when similar actions are at various stages in the courts.</P>
    <P>All litigants, including the State, are entitled under law to conduct their litigation in any lawful way they see fit.  Any attempt by the parliamentary system to insist on inquiring into the instructions given or advices received in the conduct of the case would be an interference with the independent administration of justice and would constitute a breach of the doctrine of the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>The Government set up the compensation tribunal because it did not consider that the <Col N="629" /> courts were a suitable vehicle for awarding compensation in circumstances where there is a large number of claimants with broadly similar cases. However, if a claimant opts to take legal action against the State, as he or she is perfectly entitled to do, the State is obliged by law to conduct its litigation in accordance with the same rules as any other litigant.  It is also entitled to take advice and is required to work in an adversarial system in the courts to the same extent as any other litigant.</P>
    <P>The State is a defendant in thousands of cases each year and each of them involves important concerns for individual citizens.  Any attempt to develop a parliamentary scrutiny of the conduct of any individual case by the State would set a precedent whereby the State would be substantially impaired in its ability to conduct its litigation. This would place the State at an obvious disadvantage in relation to any other litigant.  I am sure all Members fully appreciate that the Government could not waive its claim to privilege in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The State, through the Chief State Solicitor's office, conducted the defence case on behalf of the State parties, namely the Minister for Health, the Attorney General and Ireland, and did not issue any policy directive or exercise any control or management of the defence cases which were being separately defended by the BTSB and the NDAB.  It is also clear to anybody who has read the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the BTSB that the State and the BTSB had very different cases to answer.</P>
    <P>I want to re-emphasise that the BTSB conducted its defence of the McCole case in accordance with the legal advice it sought and received independently of the other defendants in the case. The BTSB did not receive any policy advice or directives from the Minister for Health or the Government.  It conducted its defence in accordance with the rules of the court.  The State took the legal position that it was not liable in this case and it has maintained this position.  The BTSB took an initial position which it changed following a full review of the case.  In doing this, the BTSB acted no differently from many other persons or bodies.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to fully comprehend the devastating effect the hepatitis C infection of the anti-D product and the blood supply has had on the health and everyday lives of the persons affected. The fact that the injury was caused to them by a blood transfusion system in which they had previously placed their trust and confidence makes it more difficult to come to terms with.  Again, I sympathise with the McCole family and with all the families affected by this tragedy.  While recognising that nothing can ever fully compensate the victims of this tragedy for being infected with hepatitis C, the Government and the Minister for Health will continue to do everything in their power to assuage the pain and suffering of all the hepatitis C victims and their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>During this important debate the Government has unfortunately continued the same line, which is not defensible and is legally inaccurate.  To add insult to injury, the Minister for Health dispatched a letter today to the Select Committee on Social Affairs in which he said he was not in a position to accede to the request to give details of the litigation in question &ldquo;for the cogent and fundamental reasons which have been outlined by the Chief State Solicitor in his letter of 7 May 1997 to the Select Committee&rdquo;.  The Minister suggested in his letter that he was very busy but said &ldquo;of course I am prepared to attend the committee to explain my position directly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil asked the chairman of the Select Committee on Social Affairs to organise a meeting for later tonight or first thing tomorrow morning. I was informed this evening that the meeting will not take place until 2.30 p.m. tomorrow, hours after the Dáil has been dissolved and the committee has been disbanded.  Does the Government think it can treat this Parliament with such contempt and expect to get away with it?  It must regard the public as an idiot if it thinks it can get away with this stunt.</P>
      <P>This is sharp practice and risible behaviour by a Government which claims to be open, transparent and accountable.  It is contemptuous treatment of an Oireachtas committee.  We have an arrogant Executive which does not care for issues of major public concern and which has completely lost touch with reality.  Fianna Fáil will raise this evasion of accountability in the McCole case with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business tomorrow.  The Taoiseach who was the champion of Dáil reform in Opposition is prepared in Government to preside over this cynical ruse to evade a committee of the House.  The Taoiseach was invisible throughout the hepatitis C scandal until last Sunday when he offered a limited apology to the victims.  If they thought things were about to change at Government level in relation to hepatitis C then they did not have to wait long to find out they were wrong.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will give a commitment in its manifesto which will be published on Friday morning that if it is returned to office it will publish in full all the relevant correspondence on the McCole legal strategy and investigate the matter in full. The McCole family deserve to have question No. 5 in its letter answered.  It is in the public interest that this should happen.  In his pre-emptory letter to the Select Committee on Social Affairs today the Minister attempted yet again to present his legal argument on why privilege cannot be waived as incontrovertible.  This is not the case, and his argument is contested not only by Fianna Fáil but by senior legal figures.  During a radio interview yesterday one of those figures said there was nothing to prevent a client waiving privilege in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Health treated us to another instalment of Noonan's law.  He stuck to a mantra of legal inaccuracy and tried to blind everyone with his own form of science.  The bottom <Col N="631" /> line is that there is nothing to stop the Minister for Health and the Government from freeing the Chief State Solicitor in relation to the McCole case.  The Minister has sought to argue that what we want to do is to get the advice the Chief State Solicitor gave to him.  However, this is a misrepresentation of our position.  What we want to establish is who authorised the legal strategy.  We have been told by the Minister for the Environment that the Government was behind it.  We want the Chief State Solicitor to appear before the committee so that we can question him about who gave him instructions in the case.  We want to know what the Minister for Health or his predecessor told the State's legal team to do on his behalf.  For example, did the State take medical advice as to the likelihood of the death of the late Brigid McCole?  Did the Minister and the State make an evaluation of Mrs. McCole's state of health before proceedings began?  I want answers to those questions.</P>
    <P>I have been told that there was such an evaluation, but I am loath to believe that any Government would engage in such despicable carry on. The implications of the medical assessment are that the Government was into risk management on the McCole case.  It appears the Government was trying to establish how long Mrs. McCole would live and whether a case would come to court by then.  If it is true, it is the lowest moment in this tragedy.  It shows that the Minister for Health not only had lost sight of his role as the defender of the public interest but was attempting to determine whether his cover would be fully blown if Mrs. McCole's case came to trial.</P>
    <P>The late Mrs. McCole's case was the single most important event in the hepatitis C affair.  It is the reason for the judicial inquiry and a statutory compensation tribunal, and why victims got aggravated damages of 20 per cent on the general award.  The discovery of documents in the McCole case exposed for the first time that the report of the expert group was flawed.  The discovery, which produced the dockets that showed the BTSB knew in 1976 that patient X had infective hepatitis, shattered any chance of the BTSB having a defence in the McCole case.  The Minister was informed of this in March 1996 but he did not act on the information and maintained an appalling collusion with the BTSB in the cover-up. Liability was not admitted until Mrs. McCole lay on her deathbed, and the rest has now gone into the annals of how the State and a state agency got it so wrong.</P>
    <P>Minister Noonan is still on the run in regard to this issue and is hiding behind a flawed legal argument.  Last night, the Chief State Solicitor sent me a letter claiming he had addressed in his original letter the issues I raised about privilege being a matter for the client and that it could be waived by the Minister for Health.  This is not correct. The Minister suggested last night that the Government was some how in the thrall of lawyers in this affair who were in an ivory tower <Col N="632" /> deciding everything in relation to the Mrs. McCole action.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the case that he was obliged to act on legal advice.  A legal opinion does not have the status of law and it certainly does not prevent the client, the Minister for Health in this case, from concluding a settlement.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting the lawyers were deciding policy in this case?  He casts the State as putty in the hands of advisers and the whole trend of his contribution was that the State can have no input to a case.  His mantra is: &ldquo;We have had advice, what else could we do?&rdquo;  He also persists in presenting as fact that privilege cannot be waived.  This is a point in contention and one that we categorically deny.</P>
    <P>Given that the Minister has admitted the hepatitis C scandal was unprecedented, and that the McCole case was also unprecedented, does he not believe there are circumstances in which the State should disclose all the facts?  Last night, the Minister said legal personnel should not be subject to scrutiny if they acted lawfully, but the McCole action was not a case that was morally defensible by the State and the BTSB.  Both parties knew this for months but they maintained the cover-up in relation to the information.  That was a self-protection mechanism for the Minister for Health and the Government.  A Government that came to office on a platform of openness and accountability has put a blackout on all debate or questioning about the legal strategy in this case.</P>
    <P>Where have the Tánaiste and the rest of the Labour Party been throughout this scandal?  Why are they so silent?  Why are they not asking questions? Is it another self-protection mechanism because of the exposure of Minister Howlin's disastrous handling of the crisis at the Finlay tribunal? <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> reported on 6 October 1996 that the Tánaiste put the Minister for Health under pressure and urged him in the early summer of last year to get the BTSB to settle the Brigid McCole case.  That story came from a Labour source and has never been denied by the Tánaiste.  It implies that the Government had knowledge of what the BTSB was doing in the early summer of 1996, long before the matter came to a head in September-October 1996.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil calls on the Tánaiste to confirm that he spoke to the Minister for Health at that time about the McCole legal action and the plan to make a lodgement in the case in an effort to put pressure on Mrs. McCole in relation to costs. If the Tánaiste was aware a lodgement was being made, it confirms the Government was deciding the legal strategy.  The lodgement was made and this means the Tánaiste also acquiesced in the legal strategy employed, and the attempts to force Mrs. McCole to go to the compensation tribunal rather than having an admission of liability in the courts.</P>
    <P>The leadership of Democratic Left has also been silent and we call on its members to say what they knew.  A matter that would have occupied all their time when in Opposition is glossed <Col N="633" /> over now by Democratic Left in Government.  Its backbenchers, who claim to represent the marginalised, have treated the hepatitis C victims with contempt.  Deputy Kathleen Lynch made a most insensitive speech on the issue last June which greatly angered the victims.  Deputy Lynch's message to the victims was that they should accept the charity they were being given by the Government and shut up.  She suggested the victims were in the grip of those who wanted to peddle fear and to see the establishment of another beef tribunal.  Deputy Lynch has not apologised for those insulting remarks, and I call on her to do so before the end of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Despite everything that happened, the Minister for Health was still in defensive mode last night. He listed a litany of reasons he could not act, and rewrote some of the history.  He suggested the BTSB only found out it had no defence in September 1996 and then immediately admitted liability. This is not so.  The BTSB and the Minister knew this six months before and throughout those six months they put Mrs. McCole through the wringer in the hope she would not continue her case before the courts.</P>
    <P>Minister Noonan suggested last night it was par for the course that the statute of limitations issue arose and that the sole reason for this was to allow Mrs. McCole's lawyers to particularise her case.  This is a falsehood.  The statute of limitations does not become an issue unless it is pleaded, and it was pleaded by the State as part of the &ldquo;harass Mrs. McCole&rdquo; policy.  It is ludicrous for the Minister to say the only reason the statute came into play was that Mrs. McCole could particularise her claim.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister listed many of the other tactics used against Brigid McCole such as contesting her anonymity application, the challenge to the date for an early hearing, the making of a lodgement to raise the spectre of costs, the refusal to admit liability and so on.  The sad reality is that each of these legal bully-boy tactics was used when the State and the BTSB knew they had no defence.</P>
    <P>In its amendment to the motion, the Government has continued the fiction that the BTSB and the State remain as separate legal entities.  The Minister tried to highlight this by saying they had separate insurance.  In a response given to the Dáil on 16 October last, the Minister told the House: &ldquo;Since the summer of 1996 the State has carried the insurance for the Blood Transfusion Service Board&rdquo;.  If the State and the BTSB are separate legal entities, did the State serve notice of indemnity on the blood bank in the McCole case?  This is normal in cases where there are three defendants who are completely and genuinely independent of one another and where one party claims they are not guilty.  The Minister continues to ignore the fact that under paragraph 22.6 of the 1965 Statutory Instrument establishing the Blood Transfusion Service Board, there is <Col N="634" /> provision for him to take over any legal action by the board, especially when he knows it has no defence.</P>
    <P>This is the end of the 30th debate in the hepatitis C affair.  Many have wondered why the issue has not gone away.  It has not gone away because hepatitis C does not go away for victims.  While the cover-up continues, the Government will be haunted by this controversy.  I call on Deputies on the other side of the House, who have expressed concern for the victims, to vote with the motion so that the truth can finally emerge.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that the Taoiseach today was at variance with the Minister for Health.  The Taoiseach suggested there were no circumstances in which the Minister for Health could come before a parliamentary committee of this House today, yet we received a letter at 2 o'clock this afternoon from the Minister for Health stating he would come before a committee of the House but that he was busy in the plenary session of the House, as I have been.  The Select Committee on Social Affairs is available immediately after Report Stage of the Bill setting up the statutory compensation tribunal, with which we have co-operated in full and to which we have tabled amendments to improve the lot of the victims; those amendments have been accepted by the Government.  It is available tonight, tomorrow morning and certainly before the dissolution of this Dáil to insist upon political accountability to a parliamentary committee of this House.</P>
    <P>Not many years ago we listened to the people who are now on the opposite side of the House lecture us about accountability and the withering of democracy.  Are they so arrogant and stupid as to think this Parliament will allow itself be demeaned by a claim that a meeting will be held of a parliamentary committee in the full knowledge that this Dáil will have dissolved by then?  Will anybody accept that type of nonsense from a Government that is running so scared it now resembles a deer facing into the headlights of a car careering down the road?  The people will decide this issue if the Government is not prepared to face up to it before the election.</P>
    <P>I do not seek to make the problems of a family an election issue.  The way this issue has been handled and the arrogance and contempt the Government holds for a committee of this House will be the issues.  That is the essence of public and political accountability.  When will the Government's rhetoric meet the reality?  The political hypocrisy of this Administration has been exposed for what it is in the dying hours of this Dáil.  Fianna Fáil will stand up for the truth which will emerge when the next Government is formed under the leadership of Deputy Bertie Ahern. Those on the other side of the House who were responsible for that truth had better be ready for the consequences.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 13, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&mdash;(1) If in any respect any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Minister may be regulations do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of removing that difficulty, for bringing that provision into operation or for securing or facilitating its operation and any such regulations may modify any provision of this Act or any other enactment so far as may appear necessary or expedient for the purposes aforesaid.</P>
      <P>(2)  No regulations may be made under this section after the expiration of one year after the establishment day.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am proposing a new section 13 in amendment No. 12 to ensure that should any difficulties arise in bringing any provision of this section into operation the Minister for Health may, by regulation, do what is necessary or expedient for bringing that provision into operation.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to a typing error in the amendment on the second line of the new section 13(1); the word &ldquo;be&rdquo; at the end of the line should read &ldquo;by&rdquo;.  I understand I have to mention this so that it will be automatically corrected in the Bills Office when the text is produced. The amendment should read, &ldquo;If in any respect any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Minister may by regulations ....&rdquo;.  This matter was discussed earlier.</P>

      <P>This is a sensible amendment which gives the Minister power to remove difficulties. That is an appropriate power to give the Minister in the context of this Bill.  As he stated earlier, the subject matter of this affair is unprecedented, it tested the qualities of the Minister and this Administration.  To insert an amendment which places the tribunal on a statutory basis and cleverly anticipates difficulties which may arise in the future marks a maturity in the Administration which, unfortunately, was absent when the matter was being dealt with in the past.  This is an appropriate power given the vulnerability of the people with which this Bill is concerned.  I am pleased this element of flexibility is included.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I apologise for not being briefed on this matter in advance.  I was informed it had been ruled out of order but it has now been established that was not correct.  Transfusion Positive brought to the attention of the Department that in some emergency cases in rural areas the donor is bled in hospital and the donation used immediately.  In such circumstances, blood would not be sourced through the BTSB and Transfusion Positive is concerned the Bill would not cover a person infected by such a donation.  The Bill does not refer to the source of blood, it simply refers to blood received within the State.  There is no need for wider definitions in this section.  It includes all blood and blood products transfused to recipients within the State regardless of the source of supply. I understand Deputy Cowen was responding to representations from Transfusion Positive in this regard, but the amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section and section 2(2) of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 1996, section 49(1)(b) of the Civil Liability Act, 1961 (as amended by section 2(1)(a) of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 1996) shall have effect in respect of a claim made pursuant to section 4(1)(e) of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I said I would submit a suitable draft on this matter on Report Stage.  The amendment takes account of the views expressed by a number of people outside the House, but in particular the views expressed by Deputies Cowen and McDaid in the House, that the Bill does not put a cap of £7,500 on awards to defendants. Under the Bill the cap will be £20,000 per family.  The Civil Liability Act caps the award for mental distress at £7,500 and £20,000 from December 1996 per family.  There may also be a payment for loss of support to a dependant under this Bill.  The cap under the 1996 Act relates to families.  Under this Bill we retrospectively raise the amount to £20,000 in accordance with the provision of the 1996 Act.  The provisions of this Bill will apply retrospectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister accepted the principle argued by people inside and outside the House.  Members of families died from hepatitis C before they had an opportunity to go before a tribunal or a court to litigate in regard to the wrongdoing perpetrated against them.  While we do not suggest this will fully meet the compensation required for the trauma from the loss of a family member, we are somewhat circumscribed by the Civil Liability Act.  The position prior to this amendment being accepted was that relatives of those who died before the enactment of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 1996, would not have been able to get more than £7,500 for mental distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While retrospective legislation should be introduced carefully on principle, the Minister has shown an ability to reach out to meet the case made by those people.  The additional £12,500 is not a lot of money but the recognition is <Col N="640" /> important, as is the fact that we are prepared to do what we can within the limited room for manoeuvre under law.  That sends a positive signal to those people that they are not forgotten as we set up a tribunal to have their claims considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I also express my gratitude that the Minister has accepted this.  The problem has been going on for some time and because I have some cases, I see the suffering of these people in three dimensions.  They felt excluded because their loved one had died and they had gone through the worry those now receiving compensation are suffering.  The Minister should clarify that those dependants are still able to take a case for loss of earnings if the deceased was the wage earner.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We discussed the provisions to preserve privacy, confidentiality and anonymity within the new statutory compensation tribunal.  I said if this could not be done in accordance with the terms of the Constitution in High Court cases, we should consider whether High Court cases in respect of hepatitis C victims should be taken <i>in camera.</i>  I have had this examined and have been advised that we would not be in a position to bring forward an amendment on this tonight.  It would need considerably detailed examination from a legal and constitutional perspective.</P>
      <P>The preliminary advice is that it cannot be done in the timescale available if it can be done at all.  However, I will pursue this and write to the Minister for Justice and indicate that an appropriate Courts Bill sponsored by her Department might be able to make a provision along the lines suggested.  That might have wider import than that suggested by the Deputy in respect of these cases and might include further categories of cases where the issue of privacy would be paramount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said.  This is an issue where there is a slight inequality of treatment between those who go to a tribunal and those who go before a court. Anonymity is guaranteed in the tribunal but not in court.  The purpose of the tribunal is to provide an alternative and that does not close off the court option.  The loss of anonymity in going to court is a major factor for those opting for the tribunal.  It is important that people be allowed vindicate their rights in whatever forum they choose and that they be facilitated in whatever choice they make.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement that it cannot be dealt with in the timescale of this Bill.  It can be dealt with in the Seanad and I accept his assurance that the Minister for Justice will be asked to take this on board with even wider ramifications than the limited number of cases that are the subject of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are on Fifth Stage, and it is the end of a long road for a lot of people in terms of ensuring State recognition of the need to confront the wrongdoing done and facing the facts established by the Finlay tribunal.  I recognise the difficulties the Minister has contended with.  There have been many criticisms, some of which will remain until this matter has been cleared up to everyone's satisfaction.  In relation to this matter, he and his officials have worked under great pressure to come forward with a proposal for a statutory tribunal.  The criticism is that he did not go down that route far sooner.  He has argued his case as to why he did not and we will have to <Col N="642" /> respectfully differ on that.  In a case such as this, there was clearly no contributory negligence on behalf of individuals and, unfortunately for the State, 100 per cent liability had to be admitted by an agency under the Department's aegis.  That is because of the incomprehensible failure to confront the mistake made initially and the fatal compounding of that error by suggesting the situation would somehow go away or that subsequent ramifications would not develop.</P>
    <P>This has been a major tragedy for all concerned, the BTSB, the Department of Health and those involved in the profession.  The State in many respects is seeking to recover from the shattering blow this debacle has represented.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board is under new management.  Since I have taken up the health portfolio I have been careful to ensure that we do not lose confidence in our blood supply which is a prerequisite for the provision of a modern health care system.  I have been quick to point out the deficiencies of the past and the need for us as a democratic institution to put right the wrongs that were done and perpetrated in the name of our citizens, to confront that issue, to be manly enough &mdash; or whatever is the proper politically correct term &mdash; to stand up and admit an error and set about constructively putting it right.  This statutory compensation tribunal has been sought by the victims for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  I am coming to that point.  The Bill has sought to cover all the angles to meet the demands of those who have suffered. It provides for the setting up of the tribunal, its manning and resourcing, the need to provide flexible procedures and to ensure there is a speedy route to justice and compensation so that people can try, in so far as they can with their families, to pick up their lives and face the future with some degree of fortitude.  The statutory compensation tribunal is a good attempt by the State to provide the legal framework now available which recognises in law formally through the enactment of legislation by the Oireachtas, rather than simply on an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion, that this issue is being put right in a just and fair way and seeks to give compensation for the wrongdoing perpetrated in the past.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the people in the background and, having been a member of Government, I know how hard they work.  We have great expertise available to us and are lucky to have those people.  The amendments tabled this evening were technical in nature and some were substantive, but the general body of legislation proposed after the consultation process has, in fair measure, sought to address the magnitude of the issue which confronted the State, the Government and the Minister.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This complex Bill was produced under a certain degree of time pressure.  We consulted the interest groups, produced the heads of the Bill, negotiated settlements and produced the text of the Bill.  I very much appreciate the help of Deputies Cowen, McDaid and O'Donnell tonight.  On the second last day of this Dáil, this House has been seen to work as it should with Deputies on both sides combining to give thorough scrutiny on Committee Stage to complex legislation.  They combined their efforts and talents to improve the Bill in circumstances where it was produced during a short timeframe and the skills and talents of Deputies on all sides were necessary to do that.  We have done a good evening's work.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies Cowen, McDaid and O'Donnell for their work here and over the years. Deputy Cowen is new to his position as spokesperson on health, but he is an experienced and well respected figure.

      <P>We are at the end of a saga in terms of the genesis of this Bill.  The matters with which we were concerned were unprecedented in terms of public administration and the challenges they posed to it and for politics.  They were very traumatic for all concerned, the victims and their families and the politicians who had to deal with those matters in the Dáil.  The debate from the beginning has been marked by a certain amount of trauma and acrimony and the fact that Dáil Éireann was unable to discover the full facts of what happened is depressing for our parliamentary democracy.  We had to establish an independent tribunal of inquiry to discover facts that were at all times in the possession of the State. We now have a situation which is to the satisfaction of the victims and that is what is most important.  This statutory tribunal will adjudicate and compensate adequately the persons who have been so affected by this tragedy.</P>
      <P>Monetary compensation will only go a certain way; it will take a long time for the wounds to heal, as we saw recently in a display of emotion by one of the victim's families.  All the families affected have individual tragedies and stories.  It will take more than law and this legislation to help them recover.  I commiserate to a certain extent with the Minister for being in charge of this portfolio at this stage in our political history. His officials have worked hard with him to get it right and I congratulate them on that work and putting up with all the trauma which is part of the cut and thrust of the political process in dealing with a matter as serious as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also thank Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn for the work she did on this matter in tabling motions and calling for the establishment of the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis.  Work on that <Col N="644" /> has been ongoing for a long time and people have contributed to that work here tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter.  It relates to a tragedy in the Point Depot on 11 May 1996.  On that night a great tragedy struck the O'Brien family from Shanagarry in County Cork when young Bernadette was killed in a crush at a concert.</P>
      <P>Following that sad event we were promised by the rainbow coalition Government that regulations would be drawn up which would ensure there would not be a recurrence of such a tragedy.  On numerous occasions I have called for those regulations to be drawn up and at long last this afternoon I received a copy of the draft regulations. They place the onus, particularly on the promoters of concerts and on the venue owners, for the control of the events to ensure they are run in a safe fashion, but it is a voluntary code.</P>
      <P>This approach is far too weak.  The promoters must be obliged to ensure safety.  A voluntary code is not sufficient to do that.  It is self-evident that the regulations in existence at the time were not enforced.  Teenagers with seat tickets on the balcony walked unhindered down to the dance hall area, which caused the crush that night.  The problem was further compounded by the serving of alcohol to underage concert goers, who flouted the fire safety regulations by sitting on the ground around the bar area, and they were allowed to do so.  It brings to mind the Stardust tragedy which could have been revisited on that tragic night.</P>
      <P>After the Stardust tragedy the Fire Safety Act, 1981, was introduced in an attempt to prevent a recurrence of such an event.  The safety and lives of our young children cannot be compromised for the profit of the promoters of such events.  This Government of openness, transparency and accountability will not explain to the parents of Bernadette, who was tragically killed that night, why nobody will be charged as a consequence of her death.  It is criminally negligent for anybody to allow the overcrowding which occurred at the Point Depot that fateful night.  Nobody has been made accountable.  On that occasion up to 90 other children were injured.  I have been led to believe that this is a common occurrence at concerts at this venue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a human tragedy and since it is the main obligation of any Government to protect the lives of its citizens, the least one might have expected is that an explanation would be given to the <Col N="645" /> heartbroken parents of Bernadette as to why nobody will be held responsible for the death of their daughter.  It gives me no pleasure to say this but everyone knows this is not the first or the last time the Rainbow Coalition behaved insensitively and without concern for the injured parties.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to tell the heartbroken parents of the late Bernadette O'Brien why it will not ensure the matter is fully explained and why it has not introduced legislation to protect the lives of young people at entertainment venues.  Those responsible for allowing the overcrowding and the mayhem resulting from same were criminally negligent and the insensitivity of this Government in its approach to this affair is an appalling indictment of its arrogance.  I call on the Minister to ensure that all the relevant information requested by the family will be made available to it or its legal representatives immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to respond to the issues raised by the Deputy and to draw attention to the initiatives taken by this Government to enhance public safety at concerts.  The death last year of Bernadette O'Brien, which we all regret, was very sad, and both the Government and the promoters of concerts have a responsibility to ensure that such a tragedy does not occur in the future.</P>
      <P>For that reason, in October of last year the Taoiseach asked me to take responsibility for the development of a voluntary code of practice for safety at indoor concerts.  The intention was that the code would provide advice and guidance on the matters involved in the safe organisation and running of an indoor concert.</P>
      <P>A working group has been examining this issue for some months.  Comments on the issue were invited from the public, as well as promoters and technical experts.  Following examination of these comments, an initial draft code of practice has been produced, and was in fact issued earlier today.  The draft is available to the public &mdash; I made it available to the O'Brien family &mdash; and I have decided that a two month consultation period should be allowed to facilitate examination of the recommendations before a final document is produced.</P>
      <P>Let me put the document in context.  This code is the third in a series, two of which have already been prepared by me and published by my Department.  These codes were long overdue and I started work on them immediately after taking office.  These are the code of practice for safety at sports grounds and the code of practice for safety at outdoor pop concerts.  The code for safety at indoor concerts reflects the general principles of safety and the organisational parameters set out in the other codes.  All reflect the recommendations in the report of the Hamilton Committee on Crowd Control which were left sitting for some time before I dealt with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of this new code is to help all involved <Col N="646" /> in the organisation of indoor concerts to plan and manage events safely.  The primary responsibility for safety at indoor events rests with the promoters and this document will assist them in meeting that responsibility.  Indoor concerts take place in a wide variety of venues and cover a wide range of events.  For that reason, the guidance is set out in broad functional terms and promoters will be expected to meet the minimum requirements while adapting the requirements to the needs of a particular event.</P>
    <P>The parameters dealt with include event planning and management, crowd management, crowd control, the use of barriers, fire precautions and fire safety, structural matters, electrical installation, emergency medical services and communications.</P>
    <P>The issue of crowd control is central to the safe running of these events and detailed guidelines on these subjects are contained in the code.  Promoters are being advised on a wide range of matters relevant to crowd control such as maximum audience size, management of crowds through barrier systems, stewarding arrangements, etc.</P>
    <P>A key recommendation of the code is that for reasons of comfort and safety, all seated audiences should be the preferred option at indoor concerts.  Where audiences under 16 years of age are concerned, the code recommends even more strongly that these audiences should always be seated.  While this initial draft code is being considered, I have asked promoters to have regard to them at any concerts held in the short-term.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should emphasise that the code is envisaged as a voluntary one.  The history of and experience with the two previous codes is that the voluntary flexible approach has worked well.  I would hope promoters of indoor concerts will equally take a positive approach to this code and that the implementation of its recommendations will provide the safety the public expects and deserves.  Again, I stress that this is an initial draft code and I hope the public and interested groups will react speedily.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State will be aware of Gaelscoil an Teaghlaigh Naofa, Ballyphehane, and any examination of it will show that conditions at the school need to be urgently addressed.  Although an application was made in 1992, nothing has materialised since.  Negotiations with the Department have been ongoing. Recently a representative of the Department indicated that the project was not a priority, much to the disappointment of the school.  That proposal would be totally unacceptable and not feasible, in the opinion of the schools inspector, the INTO, teachers and parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> The Minister of State will also be aware that the Gaelscoil in Ballyphehane, whose enrolment increases annually, is located in a designated disadvantaged area.  It serves the parishes of Ballyphehane, Togher and Turner's Cross and is attended by children from as far away as Blackrock and Douglas.  Therefore, it will readily be seen that an additional building is sorely needed.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the erection of a permanent structure comprising a general purposes room, a new classroom, an office, hall and toilets.  The last-mentioned are a necessity since ten teachers and six FÁS workers share one toilet.  The accommodation provided for the principal and secretary would be laughable if it was not so serious.  They share a room of eight feet by eight feet, without ventilation or windows, which could be described only as a cupboard.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the constant danger of children crossing a very busy road to engage in physical education in the community centre.  The Minister of State will readily appreciate the fears of teachers and parents that, each time they cross, these children put their lives in danger.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to pay attention to the plight of its teachers, pupils and parents. Since this school has been designated as disadvantaged and the amount required is not enormous, every effort should be undertaken to provide the necessary facilities there.  At a time when there are many charges that Cork itself is being neglected by this Government, they will not be slow, nor will I, to point out that this is another such example.</P>
    <P>On the eve of a general election I appeal to the Minister of State to make the necessary finance available.  He will be well aware that if these pleas were made in respect of Tralee, Dún Laoghaire or Galway, represented by Labour Ministers, they would be throwing money at them.  Let us avoid the hassle that will ensue in the course of the general election campaign, get over the neglect of Cork by remedying the neglect of this Gaelscoil in Ballyphehane and provide the requisite funding if only by way of a dying kick on the part of a dying Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government will not kick anybody. This problem has existed since 1992.  I am surprised the Deputy's party when in Government did not provide the requisite funding, its lack of commitment was obvious between 1992-4.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has afforded me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister, to outline to the House the Department's current position regarding the provision of a permanent structure at Gaelscoil an Teaghlaigh Naofa, Bóthar na mBuarcíní, Ballyphehane, Cork City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the school is staffed by a principal, eight assistants with shared remedial and home-school liaison teachers and that its principal operates in an administrative capacity.  Its current enrolment is 198 and its <Col N="648" /> classroom accommodation is comprised of eight rooms.</P>
    <P>The school management applied to my Department for a permanent structure to include a general purpose cum classroom but, due to the level of contractual commitments on hand, it is not in a position to provide funding for a permanent structure at this school.</P>
    <P>I should place the current financial position in context, which will highlight the neglect of earlier years when the Deputy's party was in Government. When the Minister assumed office in 1993 she was faced with an accumulated backlog of 300 urgent major school projects consequent on substantial cuts in capital funding for primary schools having been implemented between the years 1988 and 1992 when the Deputy's party was in government. In the past four years this Government has increased schools' capital funding significantly and substantial progress has been made in reducing that backlog.  There is a continuing need to maintain tight control on public spending as a consequence of which it is not possible to fund all deserving projects simultaneously.</P>
    <P>However, I assure Deputy Batt O'Keeffe that the needs of this school will receive every consideration in the context of future capital allocations and I intend to be around and have an input.  I thank him for affording me this opportunity of outlining the real position rather than one that became urgent only when he found himself in Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before raising an important issue, I thank the Minister of State on having provided £7,000 in well-deserved lottery funding for my local parish hall.  I want to raise the problems of primary education in Mallow, County Cork, the largest town in the county outside Cork city.</P>
      <P>There are many schools, like that in Cork city to which Deputy Batt O'Keeffe referred, in dire need of replacement and in respect of which many efforts have been undertaken to obtain the requisite capital funding.  There are five national schools in the parish of Mallow, one in Rahan. Within the past week I understand that two facilitators from the Department of Education travelled to Mallow and created quite a stir and annoyance to pupils, teachers and management of the three schools located in the town.  It appears they spoke of a threatened closure of St. Patrick's national school and a rationalisation programme, which I take to be the hidden agenda, which further exasperated the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> On Sunday last ten parents travelled to my home to discuss the serious position which has arisen and the threats to their schools.  These are parish schools and, since Mallow is an expanding town &mdash; approximately 900 houses and apartments are being built there with an excellent environment, close to Cork City, with good infrastructure, all laid by my party in office, including a modern railway station, roads and so on &mdash; I fail to understand the apparent reluctance of the Department to invest in its educational facilities. Indeed the county planners who had predicted that Cork city would spread in another direction have been surprised at its expansion in the direction of Mallow.</P>
    <P>Of course, this spreading population adds to the numbers of children seeking primary school places in Mallow.  Special classes are held in St. Oliver's, in the local Convent of Mercy, with others for the travelling community in the three schools under threat.  St. Patrick's National School in Mallow has 194 pupils and ten teachers. Scoil Iosagáin has 113 pupils, four teachers and six classrooms and the Convent of Mercy has 284 pupils and 16 teachers.  Therefore, I cannot understand the Department's failure to allocate extra funding for primary school purposes in this area.</P>
    <P>Since we are on the eve of a general election, when we shall be engaging in other business, I want to be fair and get the message across to the Department.  I appreciate that the Minister of State always has to substitute for the Minister who appears to be reluctant to face issues here.  I do not want to add to his problems but, if his party wants to continue in office in Cork East, I advise him to take urgent action to rectify this deficiency of national school facilities.</P>
    <P>Gaelscoil Thomais Daibhis presents a real problem &mdash; which local people believe has put pressure on them and exacerbated their difficulties &mdash; the proposal is that it should be replaced by one of the other schools.  The clear message conveyed to me is that that will not be tolerated and the pupils, teachers and parents of Mallow will not stand for it.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well and thank him for his efforts on behalf of my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ned O'Keeffe for allowing me a few moments to comment on the educational problems experienced in the town of Mallow.  As the local Deputy, I am aware of the difficulty with educational facilities in the town.  Many people who went to Deputy O'Keeffe on Sunday morning had come to me on Saturday evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new gaelscoil is urgently required.  The unanimous view of parents and teachers is that it must be provided at the earliest possible date on the new vocational education committee site available.  If that is done, all other schools will have the time and space to expand.  Mallow is thriving under the economic boom which we all enjoy.  Planning permissions in the town are at a <Col N="650" /> record level and its population is growing at a rate not previously experienced.  In future, it will require additional teachers and space.  We must ensure the educational future of the town is protected by providing for a gaelscoil on a new site at the earliest possible opportunity and that the other schools are allowed develop and expand in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues in Cork East, Deputies Bradford and O'Keeffe for giving me a brief opportunity to speak.  It is ironic that my last words in this Dáil will be about a matter just outside my constituency but which is of concern to constituents of mine who are in the catchment area for these schools.</P>
      <P>Like previous Deputies, I was contacted on this matter.  I place on record the strong views conveyed to me by teachers in the existing primary schools that the solution rests in facilitating a new building for Gaelscoil Thomáis Dáibhís on the site of the proposed new Davis College.  This would facilitate the creation from it of an all-Irish second level school.  I hope the Minister ensures logic prevails as this would be the strong view of all primary schools in Mallow.  The projected demographic trends suggest the solution of a greenfield site is the most acceptable and the most suitable arrangement in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for his kind words and positive attitude.  I thank the Deputies for raising the matter because it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position on behalf of the Minister.</P>
      <P>There are six primary schools in Mallow, including a gaelscoil and a Church of Ireland school.  There are a number of major issues relating to the future development of primary education in the town which the Department has to address as a matter of urgency.  First is the need to provide satisfactory permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Thomáis Dáibhís which is located in unsatisfactory prefabricated accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two possible options for the provision of permanent accommodation for the school.  One would be to provide capital funding for a greenfield site and a new school building. However, due to the level of resources available and prior commitment to other projects, it could be some time before new accommodation could be provided for the gaelscoil.  In view of the urgency of the need for permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Thomáis Dáibhís, the Department is examining the question of the acquisition of a site.  A potential site, identified by the board of management of the gaelscoil, has been inspected by a Department architect and is considered generally suitable.  However, while there has been contact with the owners regarding its availability, it has been established that the site does not have direct road access and the question of arranging such through an adjacent site is being examined.  A second option would be to <Col N="651" /> seek agreement for the reallocation to the gaelscoil of existing accommodation in other schools which has become surplus to requirements due to declining enrolments.</P>
    <P>The second major issue which needs to be addressed by the Department is the significant decline in enrolments in a number of Mallow schools, which raises the question as to the optimum future course of development for those schools.  It was considered that a consultative process involving all parties associated with the Mallow schools was called for to identify the most appropriate educational structures for the town and to make the most effective use of existing accommodation.</P>
    <P>It was also considered that such a process would be best handled by an independent facilitator who would have an open brief to consult all parties and to put a set of proposals to the Minister for future action.  An independent facilitator, Mr. Don Herron, assisted by Mr. Pat Diggins, was accordingly appointed to consult the local educational interests and provide a report and recommendation in the matter.  Both have extensive experience in this area.  Pending the outcome of the facilitation process, a decision will not be made on the development of primary education in Mallow.  The process is about the delivery of the highest standard of primary education for the Mallow area and I know Deputies O'Keeffe, Bradford and Creed would have that interest at heart on behalf of the people of Mallow and surrounding areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter on the Adjournment.  The first time I spoke in this House was on an Adjournment issue relating to the neglect of County Mayo.  I am glad we have reversed that since then and we will spell that out during the election.</P>
      <P>I have been contacted by a number of fishermen in the Porturlin area near Belmullet in north Mayo.  I was disturbed to learn that large trawlers from Donegal and elsewhere are damaging these people's crab pots and, consequently, their small fishing industry.  Crab pots are very expensive and many have been damaged.  North Mayo has been ravaged by unemployment for many years.  Mayo people depend for their livelihoods on their crab pots and whatever fishing they can do near the shore.  Major trawlers, some of which are grant-aided, are coming from Donegal and elsewhere and disturbing that.  We were told some of these trawlers are little factories capable of going out to sea to fish.  It is wrong that they are coming into north Mayo, damaging a small industry created by people who have invested heavily in it in an attempt to create employment in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister for the Marine, the Government and the Navy protect this small industry in the west?  I have seen how hard these people work and the effort they put into making a living. <Col N="652" /> It is wrong that these big trawlers come in and try and take away their livelihoods.  These people need the protection of the Navy.  Some of them pointed out that, if they did not fish during the time of the year allowed by the Government or the Western Fisheries Board, the Navy and fisheries officers would bring them to court.  They ask the Government and the Navy for protection for their livelihoods.  Many of them have lost valuable crab pots in recent years and action will be taken by them against the trawlers if nothing is done.  I ask the Minister for the Marine to make the Navy monitor the situation which is affecting these people's livelihood.</P>
    <P>They do not ask for much, only that the 12 mile limit be observed, by these trawlers.  It is not too much for which to ask and it is time they were protected.  They may not have the resources of the big trawlers but they should be protected by the State so they can make a living for their families. The Navy should monitor the situation and these trawlers should be tackled if needs be.  The sea is big enough.  These trawlers have received sufficient grant aid and they complain loudly when the Spanish and others fish their stocks. They should not try to take away the livelihood of the small man.  I hope the Government responds to protect those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss this matter in the House and I thank Deputy Ring for raising it.  As the Deputy may be aware, certain categories of larger fishing vessels are precluded from fishing within 12 miles of the base lines.  For example, all vessels licensed under the special whitefish scheme are prohibited from fishing within 12 miles of the base lines.  This restriction also applies to the refrigerated sea water &mdash; RSW &mdash; boats operating mainly out of Killybegs, except during the horse mackerel fishery.</P>
      <P>It is neither practical nor realistic to ban all trawling activity in every area where crab pots or other static gear may be deployed within the 12 mile limit.  Difficulties arise in consequence from time to time.  I am aware of a number of incidents over the years which have resulted in damage or loss of gear owned by lobster and crab fishermen as well as static gear employed by driftnetters. Understandably, this has been the cause of considerable tension between local crab and lobster fishermen and trawlermen.</P>
      <P>The Department has consistently encouraged a non-confrontational approach to resolving the problem and has actively promoted dialogue between both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the premise that peaceful co-existence among fishermen is in their own interest, the Department introduced a mutually agreed code of practice for both local fishermen and trawlermen designed to minimise the risk to crab and lobster pots from trawling activities.  The Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation and the North West Lobstermen's Association were both <Col N="653" /> involved in the negotiation of the code of practice and supported its introduction.</P>
    <P>The main features of the code of practice are as follows: communications between both sets of fishermen are to be made in the first instance on channel 16 or 70 and all further discussions are to be continued on channel 70; all static gear is to be shot in a north-south direction; at night a light is to be placed on the north end of all gear; at all times a single red flag is to be placed on the north end of the gear and a single black flag at the south end; the maximum length of any one set of static gear is to be restricted to one mile; the registration number of the owner's boat is to be marked clearly on all buoys and pots; trawlers are to give all static gear a wide berth; trawlers are to retain all lifted gear and request the Department to contact its owner if identifiable; if gear is lost it must be reported to the Department in normal circumstances within 24 hours; the Department will act as arbitrator in all related matters; and the owners of all gear should make a sworn affidavit giving details of all gear lost and give the affidavit to the Department.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the code of practice has widespread support and has been effective in substantially reducing the levels of lost or damaged gear. I would stress that compliance with the code of practice by all sides is the best way to minimise difficulties which arise.  In addition to securing agreement on a code of practice the Department has established an informal procedure whereby lobster and crab fishermen who claim to have incurred loss or damage to gear can pursue compensation from the sector of the fishing industry concerned.  The compensation procedure is of an informal nature and the Department simply fulfils the role of facilitator between the parties.  I am advised this agreement has worked satisfactorily over the past two years and offers a means of <Col N="654" /> ensuring that grievances can be equitably resolved.</P>
    <P>In practical terms the arrangement involves the investigation of incidents by the local sea fishery officer who acts as an honest broker between the two sides.  The sea fishery officer examines each claim on its merits and works out an agreement on a suitable level of compensation to be paid to the injured parties by the trawler owners concerned. This compensation procedure was reaffirmed as satisfactory at a meeting in the Department last year between the parties concerned.  I am satisfied these arrangements offer the fishermen concerned scope for peaceful co-existence and clearly acknowledge the rights of all sides to expect that their legitimate interests will be respected and their livelihoods protected.  I am, however, conscious of the need to keep the matter under review and if particular incidents need attention I will be glad to hear from the Deputy. Such incidents will be carefully investigated and every effort made to facilitate a fair and equitable resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>The issue the Deputy has raised highlights the need for all concerned at local level to respect the rights of other users of the shared marine resource.  I emphasise again that this is a co-management issue which is best resolved through co-operation and dialogue on the ground within the framework of the code of practice.  The Department will continue to play its part in facilitating that process.  An approach which is based as far as possible on local consensus and problem-solving is preferable to the imposition of solutions by central administration on fishermen in localities. I encourage all concerned to work within the code of practice and use the established procedures within that framework to resolve difficulties as they arise.  I ask Deputy Ring to communicate this advice to the local people.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15 May 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 26, 27 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>On the matter of road safety generally, I refer to the reply to Question No. 5 on today's Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Motorcyclists are clearly a high risk category of road user.  In the years 1991 to 1995, some 14 per cent of road fatalities, and some 10 per cent of injuries, involved motorcyclists, although motorcycles make up only 2 per cent of the total vehicle fleet.  This situation gives rise to serious concern about the manner in which these vehicles are used, expecially by young males.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU directive on driving licences, which is the basis for the regulation of driving throughout the Union, does not require that motorcyclists receive mandatory tuition prior to undergoing the driving test.  Current Irish driving licensing regulations, <Col N="657" /> which provide that persons under 25 years of age are required to gain a minimum of two years' experience on lower-powered motorcycles not exceeding 125 cc before being allowed to progress to higher powered motorcycles are probably the most restrictive arrangements governing access to driving motorcycles among the EU member states.</P>
    <P>Amending driver licensing regulations will be made later this year to provide for further changes to our driver licensing procedures necessitated by the requirements of the Second EU Directive on driving licences.  These will include the introduction of a separate written theoretical test for all new drivers entering the driver licensing system, including motorcyclists.  I do not at present propose to introduce mandatory tuition for motor cycles but I will keep the matter under review.</P>
    <P>Enforcement by the Garda of road traffic law generally, including speed limits and the wearing of helmets, must continue to be a major element in improving the motor cycle accident record.  So too must constant reminders to all road users, including motorcyclists, by the National Safety Council of the dangers of excessive and inappropriate speeding, and drinking and driving.</P>
    <P>Special measures are already being taken to assist visitors in their understanding and appreciation of driving, cycling or walking on our roads. These measures include special multi-lingual road signs, introduced last year, and multi-lingual information leaflets provided by the National Safety Council.  Both the signs and the leaflet focus on the requirement to drive on the left.  In a Seanad debate last month, I undertook to consider that further measures, additional to those already in place, might be introduced in an effort to minimise the involvement of tourists in road accidents.  I also undertook to support, in whatever way I can, any proposls for the fitting in hired cars of signs or devices which I understand are being developed.</P>
    <P>A traffic signs manual which I published last December covers all aspects of road signage and is designed to ensure that there is an effective and well-maintained traffic sign system which will benefit all road users, including tourists.  A copy of the manual is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 18, 22 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>Regulations made under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, prohibiting the marketing, sale and distribution of certain solid fuels in areas of Dublin and Cork, designate Forbairt as the body to provide relevant local authorities with a solid fuel testing service.  For bairt has experienced commercial difficulties in continuing to provide this service and my Department is currently examining the options for providing local authorities with access to more widespread fuel testing facilities. This forms part of a wider review, in consultation with the local authorities concerned, of the effectiveness of the existing regulatory arrangements.</P>
      <P>Preliminary analysis of monitoring results for the 1996-1997 heating season demonstrate satisfactory air quality in all monitored areas, relative to the statutory standards for smoke and sulphur dioxide.  I have no immediate plans to extend controls on bituminous fuels to urban areas beyond Dublin and Cork but I will review the matter when I receive a detailed analysis from the Environmental Protection Agency of the full air quality monitoring results for the 1996-1997 heating season.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>It is not the case that I have indicated that I do not favour incineration as a disposal option for all waste streams or in all circumstances.  On the contrary, in reply to a number of questions tabled on 7 November 1995, I stated that &ldquo;On-site incineration of hazardous wastes, subject to strict Environmental Protection Agency licensing, and export of remaining limited quantities of wastes requiring off-site high-temperature incineration, represent satisfactory environmental management options for this waste stream&rdquo;.  I also stated on the same occasion that &ldquo;Incineration of waste with energy recovery is recognised as a valid source of alternative energy&rdquo; and I noted that the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications had announced details of a special initiative to promote the production of electricity from biomass &mdash; including forestry, agricultural and other wastes.</P>
      <P>In reply to Questions Nos. 34 and 76 of 9 October 1996, I explained that consideration by the Government Departments concerned of incineration as a possible option to deal with cetain animal waste materials was not in conflict with policy decisions being implemented in relation to the separate streams of health-care waste.</P>
      <P>The optimum waste management option for any waste stream must be determined by reference to all relavant environmental and economic considerations.  Waste incineration is one such option: it is used extensively within the OECD countries and is regulated by a number of EU Directives.  Irish environmental legislation, in particular the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for the licensing of waste incineration activities on the basis of best practicable standards, including relevant EU requirements. Licences for both industrial and hospital waste incineration have been granted by Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>As regards arrangements for health-care wastes, these are now being upgraded on foot of new Environmental Protection Agency licensing requirements which I have extended to all existing hospital incinerators and on foot of a joint North-South approach to the market, in which the Department of Health is fully involved, for improved arrangements for the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of this waste.  Details of this initiative were recently set out by the Minister for Health in reply to Question No. 56 of 7 May 1997.</P>

      <P>Under the national CO 2 abatement strategy, Ireland has been committed to limiting its CO 2 emissions for the year 2000 to +20 per cent over their 1990 level.  It is now projected that CO 2 emissions in 2000 will be well within this target. For the purposes of the current negotiations to strengthen the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Ireland has adopted an indicative national objective of limiting the growth in total emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide by the year 2010, to 15 per cent above 1990 levels.  This national objective, which is the most ambitious adopted by a cohesion member state, is in the context of an EU proposal to reduce overall Community emissions of greenhouse gases by 15 per cent compared to 1990 levels and to press for other developed countries, individually or joinly, to take similar action.</P>
      <P>Ireland's objectives in this area are consistent with the EU climate change strategy which recognises that member states are entitled to have CO 2 and-or other strategies corresponding to their economic and social development, while improving the energy efficiency of their economic activity and contributing to the overall Community objective; and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change which recognises the need to take into account differences in parties' starting points, economic structures and resource bases, the need for strong and sustainable econommic growth and other individual circumstances.</P>
      <P>A major study is also under way to identify and evaluate the scope for intensifying existing policies and measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> Following the recent enactment of the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, my Department is preparing a series of measures to support implementation of the new legislative provisions by local authorities and the Garda.  Regional briefing seminars are being arranged for local authority officials and comprehensive written guidelines are also being finalised with particular emphasis on enforcement provisions.  I intend shortly to bring the Act into operation and to make regulations to support the operation of on-the-spot fines.</P>
    <P>Information on the numbers of litter wardens employed by local authories is set out in a table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  In summary, there were 21 full-time and 66 part-time litter wardens employed by local authorities in 1996.</P>

      <P>Waste water treatment plants providing secondary treatment for Cork, Galway, Limerick and Dublin, are due for completion by 31 December 2000 to comply with the provisions of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.  The treatment plants are at various stages of planning and are all due to commence construction by the end of 1998 or early 1999.  The current estimated costs of the treatment plants are: Cork £60 million; Galway <Col N="663" /> £25 million; Limerick £27 million; and Dublin £170 million.  In advance of the completion of the detailed design of the projects, it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the annual running costs of the plants.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements for funding local authorities, which I announced at the end of last year, provide for the yield from motor taxation to become a dedicated local authority revenue source, commending in 1997.  This source of funding, with other revenues raised by local authorities such as commercial rates and commercial user charges, will be used to meet the cost of providing local services generally, including the operating and maintenance costs of waste water treatment plants.</P>

      <P>As part of the analysis of the task force, some 64 recommendations in the Commission's report are considered to be of relevance to my Department and/or local authorities.

      <P>The Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994, were made primarily for the purpose of transposing into national law Directive 90/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms and Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. The fundamental objective of the directives and regulations is the protection of human health and the environment.  The operation of these legislative controls in relation to the planting of genetically modified products is a matter for the <Col N="664" /> Environmental Protection Agency and I have no power to intervene in particular cases.  I have no current proposals to amend the regulations so as to prohibit the planting of genetically modified products; such an approach would not be consistent with Community legislation.</P>
      <P>In the light of scientific knowledge, technical advancement and practical operational experience since the directives were adopted in 1990, there are now a number of developments at EU level, which are supported by Ireland, to update the legislation, particularly in relation to the labelling provisions for products containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms.</P>

      <P>International experience in relation to the application of speed limits lower than 30 mph is mixed, particularly where such speed limits are applied without physical restrictions on speed. Local authorities are empowered, under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, to provide traffic calming measures where they are considered to be desirable; such measures may be used to reduce the speed of vehicles to a level below the 30 mph speed limit, where required.</P>

      <P>An Bord Pleanála has a statutory objective under section 2 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, to determine appeals generally within four months.  In 1996, 93 per cent of appeals were dealt with within that period. Due to strong economic growth, there has been a continuing increase in the number of planning applications and, as a consequence, an increased number of appeals to the board.  In response to this, my Department has agreed a range of measures with the board, including the employment of extra staff, to enable the board to restore performance to a satisfactory level.</P>
      <P>An Bord Pleanála already has arrangements in place to identify and prioritise appeals relating to proposed developments that are considered to have significant employment potential.  In addition, my Department is in regular contact with the industrial development agencies regarding the operation of the planning system generally. As indicated in Partnership 2000, the possibility of further changes in the system is to minimise delays and uncertainties will be considered; any such changes, of course, would have to ensure a continued high level of protection for the environment and amenities, and have regard to established rights to public participation in the planning process.</P>

      <P>My strategy paper on local government reform &mdash; Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change &mdash; acknowledges that there is a clear gender imbalance in the management levels in the local authority service, notwithstanding the fact that local authorities have adopted equal opportunity policies and that some progress has been made in recent years.  A number of measures are now proposed to further promote equality of opportunity in the local authority service at management and other levels.  Guidelines on the introduction of active equality policies and programmes in each local authority are nearing completion, and I expect to issue them to local authorities very shortly.  A special development programme is to be established for women managers. This and other matters related to promotion of equality of opportunity are being developed by the Local Government Management Services Board, with the input of the local authority personnel officers' network.  The Local Appointments Commission, which conducts recruitment to senior management and professional posts, is committed to the continuous <Col N="666" /> improvement of its selection processes, and has already made considerable strides in ensuring that there is increasing participation of women on its interview boards.  Local authorities are being asked to place considerably greater emphasis on this important aspect of recruitment policy too.</P>

      <P>The Local Government Provisional Orders Confirmation Act, 1955, <i>inter alia,</i> extended the Waterford city boundary to take in part of County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>Waterford Corporation made an application in 1979, pursuant to the Waterford City Management Act, 1939, for an extension of the city to take in part of County Kilkenny.  The matter did not proceed due to lack of agreement between the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>The procedure to be followed for making boundary alterations has changed since then.  The legal framework for all local authority boundary alterations is now contained in Part V of the Local Government Act, 1991, and associated regulations.  Under these provisions, it is open to any local authority to make a proposal for a boundary extension.  The legislation enables all the issues in relation to a boundary alteration to be thoroughly considered in the first instance by the local authorities involved and it includes provision for public advertisement and consulation. When this local process is complete, an application for a boundary alteration can then be made to the Minister for the Environment and there is also provision for the establishment of an independent committee to report and make recommendations.</P>
      <P>There is no record in my Department of an application from Waterford Corporation under the 1991 Act.</P>

      <P>The rate of house price increase reflects the remarkable progress of the economy in recent years including low interest rates, increased incomes and unprecedented employed growth, with changing demographics.  New house building has been at record levels since 1995.  Our 1996 level of new housing output, relative to population, was the highest in Europe and at 33,725 completions exceeded the forecast housing demand of 31,000 per annum for the period 1996-2001 contained in the recently published ESRI Medium Term Review.  It is clear, therefore, that the supply of housing is responding well to the increased demand and in fact, housing completions in the first three months of 1997 are 12 per cent ahead of the same period in 1996.  I consider that the increased level of supply, with action being taken by other public authorities, should help to moderate the rate of house price increases.</P>

      <P>My Department does not receive any national lottery funding.  In relation to local development funding, I refer the Deputy to the information provided in the replies to Parliamentary <Col N="674" /> Questions Nos. 81 &mdash; 23 January 1996 &mdash; and No. 9 &mdash; 26 November, 1996.</P>
      <P>All but four of these grants were paid in 1996. The allocations were not drawn down by the following organisations &mdash; (1) Grange-Frankfield Community Associations Cork; (2) Togher Pre-School and Family Centre, Cork; (3) Turners Cross Community Association, Cork; (4) Inner City Renewal Group, Dublin &mdash; as they had not completed their financing packages and the projects could not commence on a viable basis in 1996.  No grant allocations have been made to date in 1997.</P>
      <P>Information in relation to other grants sanctioned by my Department is outlined in the following schedule:</P>

    <P>In 1996 the Famine Commemoration Committee made a grant of £2,000 available to the Bantry Bay Summer School which was dealing with the theme of the French Revolution and its relevance to Ireland which was especially suitable for 1996 as it is the bi-centenary of the arrival at Bantry Bay of the French Armada carrying Wolfe Tone.</P>

      <P>This week marks the third anniversary of the ceasefire in the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnically Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan. Ireland, with its partners in the European Union, is concerned to see that the ceasefire is developed into a comprehensive, peaceful and lasting settlement.</P>
      <P>The OSCE Budapest Summit in December 1994 established the OSCE Minsk Conference on Nagorno-Karabakh.  Since then the Minsk Group has been the principal vehicle for international efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. Despite intensive efforts by the Minsk Group and others it was not possible for consensus to be reached at the OSCE Lisbon Summit last December on the principles for a possible solution to Nagorno-Karabakh.</P>
      <P>Following the failure to reach agreement, Ireland joined the majority of OSCE members at the Lisbon Summit in declaring, on behalf of the European Union, its full support for the principles for a settlement which had been proposed by the OSCE chairman in office and the co-chairmen of the Minsk Conference.  These principles are territorial integrity of the Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Republic; legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh defined in an agreement based on self-determination which confers on Nagorno-Karabakh the highest degree of self-rule within Azerbaijan; guaranteed security for Nagorno-Karabakh and its whole population, including mutual obligations to ensure compliance by all the parties with the provisions of the settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> In February this year, Russia, the United States and France were appointed as co-chairmen of the Minsk Group.  In April last, the group met with the parties in Moscow.  Although little progress was reported on the main issues discussed &mdash; the Lachin Corridor to Armenia, and the Azeri enclave of Shusha &mdash; progress was made on the issue of prisoner release.</P>
    <P>The Minsk Group is currently working to encourage regular direct contact between the parties. <i>Ad hoc</i> meetings of the parties in the margins of international conferences and telephone contacts between the two Presidents have been helpful in the past in resolving specific problems such as the recent incidents of ceasefire violations.  The group hopes to build on these precedents.</P>
    <P>Ireland and our EU partners have expressed full confidence in the three co-chairmen of the Minsk Group and the efforts being made by the group to achieve a lasting political settlement to the conflict, based on the principles enunciated at the Lisbon Summit, and including the right of return of refugees and displaced persons.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland negotiated with the agent handling <Col N="681" /> the sale of the property and reached agreement, subject to contract, on terms for its purchase. The Chief State Solicitor, in the course of investigating the title, raised certain pre-contract queries on the vendor's title to the property and informed the vendor's solicitor of other standard requirements where the State is purchasing property. The vendor's solicitors did not respond to the queries but stated that their client had decided not to proceed with the sale.</P>
      <P>The agent who was dealing with the property was advised that the Commissioners of Public works are still interested in the possibility of acquiring it.  He indicated that it is no longer for sale.  The commissioners are actively pursuing the provision of a new Garda station at Kilmacthomas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that for the purpose of encouraging home ownership the State provides considerable assistance towards the purchase of private homes. There are a number of important reliefs and exemptions from stamp duty on house transfers which are primarily aimed at assisting house buyers to purchase new homes.  There is a full exemption from stamp duty for purchases of new houses with a floor area of below 125 square metres.  This exemption is estimated to have cost between £50 and £55 million in 1996.  Purchases of new houses with a larger floor area attract stamp duty based only on the site value, subject to a minimum site value of one-quarter of the full house (plus site) value.  The relief in respect of these larger new houses is estimated to have cost approximately £6.5 million in 1996.  The targeting of these stamp duty reliefs in favour of new houses takes account, <i>inter alia,</i> of the fact that most new house sales are subject to VAT at 12.5 per cent, whereas sales of second-hand houses generally are not.  These reliefs are also designed to encourage the building of new houses, and thereby to support employment in the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also 100 per cent mortgage-interest tax relief for first-time buyers of both new and second-hand houses and a reduced rate of relief for other mortgage holders.  In addition, there is a generous £3,000 new house grant available for first-time buyers of new houses.  All these exemptions-reliefs <Col N="682" /> and grants help to moderate the cost of housing generally and play an important role in promoting employment within the construction sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to further reductions in the rates of stamp duty it is by no means certain that such reductions would be passed on to the purchaser of a property, particularly in the current buoyant property market.  The likelihood is that, in such circumstances, reductions in stamp duty would accure largely to those selling secondhand properties and would not benefit home buyers.  In fact, I believe that the current levels of stamp duty on the transfer of secondhand houses serve, to a very real extent, to protect the housing market against property speculation.  This is supported by commentators within the property market itself.</P>
    <P>Finally, in framing policy in this area the Government must have regard to the budgetary implications of changes in the stamp duty code. Stamp duty on the transfer of land and buildings is a very important source of Exchequer revenue and in 1996 the estimated yield from this source was over £194 million.  The yield from stamp duty represents a large component of the overall yield from capital taxes and makes a very significant contribution towards the cost of implementing the Government's important social and economic programme.  Introducing an exemption from stamp duty for first time buyers of second-hand houses would be very costly and could be of the order of £30 million per annum.  Consequently, I have no plans at present to introduce further reliefs in this area.</P>

      <P>Discussions at health board level on mental health services relate to reviews of progress on service development and on the formulation of service plans.  In this context the philosophy espoused in Planning for the Future is very much to the fore in the boards' determination of their future service developments.</P>
      <P>A Green Paper on Mental Health was published in 1992 and reviewed, <i>inter alia,</i> the progress being made in the development of the mental health services as recommended in Planning For The Future.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The dental services are being developed and improved in accordance with the dental health action plan.  This action plan was developed in line with the national health strategy as set out in the document Shaping a Healthier Future.</P>
      <P>The dental treatment services scheme is part of the dental health action plan and private dental practitioners, under contract to health boards, are significant providers of services under the scheme.  Under the dental treatment services scheme which was introduced by my Department on 1 November 1994 dental treatment will be extended to all adults with medical card eligibility on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>In the initial phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 November 1994, emergency dental treatment was made available to all adults. Routine dental treatment and priority full denture treatment was made available to persons 65 years of age or older.  Under the second phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 June 1996, routine dental treatment was extended to persons in the 16 to 34 year age group and full denture treatment was extended to all edentulous persons. Routine treatment will be extended to persons in the 35 to 64 year age group at a later stage and will be considered in the context of the funds available to me for the development of dental services. All health boards also operate a priority waiting list for dental treatment for medically compromised persons who are given priority irrespective of age on production of a letter from their general medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>The concept of a six monthly dental check up in dentistry is outmoded.  This is especially true for a county like Ireland which has experienced a dramatic decline in the prevalence of dental disease. Unlike the United Kingdom we have over 70 per cent of the population covered by water fluoridation and this fact has a major bearing on recall intervals for patients in dental schemes operating in this country.  Health boards will be evaluating the impact of the dental treatment services scheme on the oral health of medical card holders and any relevant findings will be incorporated into any review of the scheme.  As the provisions of dental treatment to eligible persons in County Offally is the statutory responsibility of the Midland Health Board I have asked the chief executive officer of the Midland Health Board to investigate the position in relation to the individual referred to in the question and to reply to the Deputy directly as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that there was an increase of 42 per cent in the level of demand for services at Athlone Law Centre between 1995 and 1996, which resulted in a significant increase in the number of applicants waiting for legal services from the centre. However, the opening of the law centre at Tullamore earlier this year facilitated the transfer of some of those applicants, particularly those from the Offaly area, to the Tullamore law centre, which helped considerably in alleviating the pressure on Athlone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of this and other initiatives taken by the Legal Aid Board, waiting times at Athlone have fallen from eight months in January 1997 to 2.5 months at the end of April.  In the circumstances there are no proposals to increase the frequency of the &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; which is held at the parttime law centre in Mullingar, a location which is <Col N="689" /> well situated in relation to a number of law centres, which include Athlone, Longford, Tullamore and Navan.  I should add, however, that waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and where they become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action, as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 23 of 11 March, 1997 (Vol. 476, No. 2, cols. 312 to 313).  I have nothing further to add to that reply other than to say that the court is obliged whether or not a legal or judicial separation is in place on granting a decree of divorce to be satisfied that proper provision having regard to the circumstances exists or will be made for the spouses and any children.  But in deciding whether to make any ancillary orders in support of spouses and children the court must, in the divorce proceedings, also have regard to the terms of any legal separation that is in place and where ancilliary orders arising from judicial separation proceedings are in place they may be discharged or continued in force by the court.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that rules of court, which prescribe procedures for applications in divorce proceedings, are a matter for the relevant court rules committees and the Minister for Justice concurs in their making.</P>

      <P>Environmental priorities for Dublin Bay are principally set out in the Dublin Bay water quality management plan, jointly prepared and adopted by Dublin Corporation and the other local authorities concerned.  This establishes objectives for maintaining and improving water quality in areas of major recreation and conservation, including bathing areas.</P>
      <P>The major contribution to these objectives will come from improved waste water treatment facilities which are being progressively implemeted with benefit to Dublin Bay.  The largest of these schemes is Dublin Corporation's proposal to upgrade and expand the existing waste water treatment plant at Ringsend, at an estimated cost of over £200 million.  Construction on the interim sludge contract, which forms part of this overall project, is due to commence by end 1997.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, the making of a development plan, including objectives relating to the use of land for particular purposes, is a reserved function of the local authority.  My programme for the renewal of local government, &ldquo;Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change&rdquo;, includes proposals for the preparation of strategic planning guidelines for the regions, which would inform the development plans of the constituent local authorities.  This process is to start with the Dublin and mid-east regions and, accordingly, I have written to the relevant city and county managers and regional authority secretaries, setting out how such guidelines might be drawn up and asking them to initiate the process.  These guidelines will address all of the relevant socio-economic, infrastructural and environmental factors and provide a comprehensive overall framework for the physical development of the Dublin and mid-east regions over the next decade or so.  As to the issue of rural resettlement, I refer to the reply to Question No. 11 on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <P>Limerick County Council submitted an application under the small schemes programme for a grant of £40,000 in 1997 for the provision of a new groundwater source at Athlacca to replace the existing well which, the council have advised, is subject to occasional slight pollution, possibly of septic tank origin.  As already announced, responsibility for the administration of this programme in 1997 and future years has been devolved to the local authorities, subject to existing commitments on foot of approvals issued by my Department.  It is, therefore, a matter for local authorities to decide on priorities locally within the block grant allocations for 1997 which issued to local authorities on 26 March.</P>

      <P>Under a new devolved grant scheme which came into operation this year, each school is receiving a basic grant of £2,000 plus £9 per pupil, for improvement works to buildings, services and furnishings. The school referred to by the Deputy will be paid the grant within the next week and it may use the funding to improve, or replace the windows.</P>
      <P>The position on disadvantaged status is that since becoming Minister for Education, I have included an additional 104 primary schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  This brings the total number of primary schools in the scheme to 320.</P>
      <P>Detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  The studies noted that the disadvantaged areas scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
      <P>In line with the findings of these studies, I recently launched the breaking the cycle initiative which seeks to target a special package of supports on selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as suffering serious levels of educational disadvantage.  The selected schools were identified by the Education Research Centre on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of criteria devised by the centre.</P>
      <P>The operation of this new initiative will be closely monitored by my Department's Inspectorate and the scheme will be evaluated by the Education Research Centre.  The outcome of this evaluation will provide a basis for the future development of supports for disadvantaged status.  In the event of such further development being undertaken, the needs of the school in question will be considered.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, only eligible children may be counted towards the establishment or retention of a service. A school transport service may only be established or retained where the number of eligible children living in a district locality offering for transport to the nearest national school is sufficient to ensure that the minimum daily number of eligible pupils conveyed each term would not be less than ten.</P>
      <P>The service in question concluded at the end of the Easter term as there were no eligible children offering for transport from the relevant locality. All of the remaining pupils on this service to Kilgobnet national school were ineligible for transport under the terms of the scheme.  The Department's decision to allow the service be terminated followed long and detailed consideration of the case.  Care was taken to ensure that all relevant parties were notified in advance.  Accordingly, I do not intend to intervene in this matter.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the average time spent in prison by an offender is not readily available.  To provide it would require the manual examination of a large number of prisoner files and the collation of the information. Such a use of staff resources would not be justified at present, because of the existing pressure on the staff concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will see from these figures that the big increase in committals to prison actually took place in 1992.  Committal figures have in fact remained on a plateau since then.  However, over the period 1970 to 1995 an enormous growth occurred in the number of sentences in the two years to life range &mdash; from 30 in 1970 to 550 in 1995.  It is the committals in this category which have contributed most to the demand on prison spaces.  The prison building programme now under way will increase our prison capacity by some 800 spaces and is designed to address this problem.</P>

      <P>Records are not maintained in a way which would allow the provision of the information sought by the Deputy.  The indications from an expert sociological study conducted in 1996 on the Mountjoy Prison population is that the rate of recidivism among our prisoners is high.  The study showed, for example, that about 77 per cent of the prisoner sample profiled had previously served a custodial sentence.</P>
      <P>Recidivism is a recognised phenomenon in all criminal justice systems.  It is very much associated with dysfunctional personalities &mdash; substance abusers, homeless persons and persons with a social background which is disordered.  Recidivism is also, of course, associated with so-called professional criminals such as bank robbers and fraudsters who commit crime as a way of life and seem quite prepared to accept the associated risks of detection and punishment.</P>
      <P>Measures which are in place to address recidivism include the provision of a wide range of training and educational facilities relating to both academic and practical and vocational subjects where inmates are concerned and the availability of non-custodical options, particularly for potential young offenders through the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  The juvenile liaison officer scheme has been particularly successful, with a quadrupling of the numbers cautioned over the last six years.  More importantly, 89 per cent of these have not reoffended within their two year supervisory period.</P>

      <P>In 1994, the latest year for which accurate figures are available, 3,733 individuals were granted full temporary release.  Exact figures for 1995, 1996 and 1997 are not yet available.  Indications are, however, that the number of full temporary releases granted in 1995 and 1996 was in the same region as 1994, approximately 4,000 per annum.  I will, of course, be happy to make the figures available to the Deputy as soon as they have been compiled.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question yesterday from Deputy Callely, no polls have been undertaken or commissioned by my Department since December 1994.</P>
      <P>As regards qualitative research, the position is that a firm of occupational psychologists, Messrs. Saville and Holdsworth, have been commissioned by my Department on two occasions to carry out research on the improvement of selection procedures when persons are being recruited to the rank of garda and to the post of court stenographer. The research in relation to the rank of garda is not yet completed.  The cost incurred by my Department in relation to the court stenographer post was £4,589.</P>
      <P>While it is not possible in the time available to confirm that no other research of this nature was undertaken since 1994 in the Garda area, I have asked the Garda authorities to let me have information on any such research which I will forward to the Deputy when it comes to hand.</P>
      <P>Other research also has been commissioned and carried out for my Department &mdash; for example, in relation to the prisons &mdash; but these do not, I believe, come within the ambit of what the Deputy had in mind when he refers to &ldquo;qualitative research&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Under the legislation, a person who claims disability-injury benefit or an unemployment payment is not normally paid for the first three days, which are known as waiting days. Where, however, the person had a recent claim in respect of any of these schemes, payment may be made from the first day of the claim.</P>
      <P>Waiting days have been a feature of these schemes since their inception and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many countries.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise, however, that people who need financial support are not left without such support during those days.  A person who has no other income may claim supplementary welfare allowance in respect of the days in question.</P>

      <P>The establishment of special savings accounts for old age pensioners and the associated costs are not matters for which I have any direct responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that this year's Social Welfare Act provides for a significant improvement in the method of assessing capital for old age pensioners.  Under the existing arrangements, an initial disregard of £200 is allowed, the next <Col N="708" /> £375 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.  The new capital assessment arrangements for the old age (non-contributory) pension, which will come into effect from October, provide that the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded, the next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000, if any, will be assessed at 15 per cent. These new arrangements, which will cost £4.3 million in a full year, mean that single old age non-contributory pensioners will qualify for the maximum rate of payment where they have capital of up to £6,160.  The equivalent amount of capital for a couple will be £12,320, i.e. an increase of £6,345 on the existing provisions.  An old age non-contributory pensioner will still qualify for a reduced rate pension where he-she has capital of up to £35,500 in the case of a single person, or £71,100 in the case of a couple.</P>

The decline in the number of long-term unemployed is expected to be around 123,000 by the end of 1997.</P>

      <P>The cost of the consultancy report on payment practices in the public sector was £20,267.50</P>
      <P>I commissioned the report in order to provide reliable information on pay practices to support decision making in this area.  While there has been a good deal of anecdotal evidence of payment practices in the public sector there was very little firm or comprehensive information in this issue.  A widely quoted survey undertaken in 1992 was not comprehensive as it was based on responses from only 11 companies.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the survey is twofold; first, it is intended to provide reliable information on existing payment practices; second, and most importantly, it is intended to establish a benchmark for measuring progress in reducing payment periods and in assessing the effectiveness of this legislation in eliminating the problem of late payment in the public sector.</P>

      <P>My Department has not commissioned or carried out any polls during the period since 1994.  With regard to qualitative research, the Deputy will appreciate that the carrying out of such research is a normal feature of day-to-day departmental administration and it would not be practicable to provide detailed information on every study and review commissioned or requested by me in the period since 1994.  However, I have endeavoured to furnish a comprehensive reply.</P>
      <P>In cases where the study or review is mainly comprised of an outside consultancy assignment, it is possible to provide the information requested and this is set out in Table 1.</P>
      <P>A number of other major policy reviews were also initiated by me and are listed in Table 2. These were, or are being, carried out mainly internally in my Department with some limited external consultancy input.</P>

Following a major recommendation in the Report a special working group was established to advise the Government on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal.  The working Group has consulted all the relevant representative bodies and groups and has finalised its report on this aspect of its work.  The Group is proceeding to the second stage of its assignment i.e. to look at alternative systems to the tort system of delivering compensation for personal injury.</entry>

      <P>The person named applied for 40 mountain breeding ewes and five hogget ewes under the 1996 sheep headage scheme.  As she does not have mountain grazing, she is not eligible for payment on the 40 mountain breeding ewes.  Payment of £60, which included £10 sheep headage top-up, issued in respect of the five hogget ewes on 25 April 1977.</P>
      <P>She applied for 45 ewes under the 1996 ewe premium scheme.  At an inspection carried out on 18 April 1996, only 37 ewes were presented. Consequently, a penalty of 100 per cent was incurred.  However, due to an oversight, a payment of £877.53 was made and this amount will have to be recouped from future entitlements.</P>

      <Col N="722" /> An application was made under the 1996 cattle headage scheme on 21 animals but, when inspected on 20 September 1996 nine animals were absent.  Consequently a penalty of 100 per cent was incurred.</P>
    <P>This person applied for the October 1996 suckler cow scheme under his own herd number.  The application could not be processed as an application had already been received on 5 June 1996 for the 1996 suckler cow premium scheme for small-scale milk producers under a different herd number, of which the person named became one of the joint registered herd owners on 5 July 1996. Only one application is allowed under the suckler cow premium scheme each year.  He and his mother will, however, receive payment under the 1996 suckler cow premium scheme for small-scale milk producers.  Payment will issue within the next week.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124, 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already informed the Deputy in reply to Question No. 148 on this subject on 17 April my Department received a significant number of REPS applications which included high proportions of leased commonage lands, some of which were entirely leased commonage.  My Department has to ensure that these applications are genuine and comply with the terms of the relevant regulations.  The European Commission have been asked for advice on the matter and a reply is still awaited.  Where it is clear that applications meet the conditions of the scheme, these have been processed.</P>
      <P>In County Mayo, REPS payments have issued to 52 farmers who had leased commonage lands included in their applications.</P>
      <P>The number of farmers nationwide who have received REPS payments in respect of leased commonage lands is 138.</P>
      <P>The number of farmers who, it has been established, have included leased commonage and are awaiting REPS payment in respect of same is 93 nationwide with 68 of these in Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is being made to arrive at a fair and equitable solution in these cases bearing in <Col N="723" /> mind the Department's responsibility to ensure the highest standards of accountability for all expenditure on REPS.</P>

      <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme began in 1975 with the designation of almost 58 per cent of the land area of the State as less favoured. Since then, there have been five reviews of the boundaries which were originally established.</P>
      <P>As a result, by 1991 73 per cent of the country was designated.  An independent appeals panel was then established to give farmers an opportunity to have their areas reassessed.</P>
      <P>Using data derived from a survey of farmers in the appealed areas, the appeals panel recommended areas for designation as disadvantaged. Following negotiations with the EU Commission, I was pleased to announce in May 1996 that some 128,000 hectares had been approved for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that this latest review involved a very comprehensive examination of areas for disadvantaged status, and increased the less favoured areas in Ireland to almost 75 per cent of the total land, I do not see any purpose in initiating a further review of disadvantaged areas in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>The disadvantaged areas appeals panel was set up in 1991 to assess areas for designation as disadvantaged or reclassification as more severely handicapped.  Its task was to invite appeals from farmers or groups who felt that their areas had not been adequately assessed in the previous review, and to gather data from farmers which could be used as a measure of the stocking, income and tillage levels of the appealed areas.</P>
      <P>The panel carried out a thorough examination of the data received, and recommended certain areas for designation as disadvantaged.  The final meeting of the panel in May 1996 coincided with my announcement of the new areas which had been approved by the EU.  As the panel had completed its task, it was then disbanded.</P>

I am prepared, however, to allow the Army nursing service personnel concerned express their views through their representative association, and a meeting between officials of the Department and the Irish Nurses' Organisation will be arranged at an appropriate time.  In the meantime I am happy that the rostering arrangements which are currently in place satisfactorily meet requirements at the Curragh hospital.</P>

      <P>The individual referred to applied in December 1996 for a licence in respect of a particular vessel which he intended to purchase at that time.  However, the vessel in question was subsequently purchased by another fisherman.  Should the individual wish to apply for a licence in respect of another vessel, the application will be considered in accordance with current licensing policy.</P>
