      <P>It is proposed to take the report from the Select Committee on Legislation and Security on the Decommissioning Bill, 1996; No. 12 &mdash; the motion concerning the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Testing Ban Treaty Organisation; No. 13 &mdash; a motion concerning the approval of the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices; No. 14 &mdash; a motion concerning the European Convention for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage and No. 20 &mdash; Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach join me in expressing, on behalf of the Members of the House and the nation, our utter repudiation of the senseless and brutal murder of a soldier last night in Bessbrook, which only further endangers peace on this island?  Does the Taoiseach agree that it is long past the time when Sinn Féin should show political leadership and declare whether it is seriously interested in a peaceful settlement and whether it will ever play a useful part in the ongoing talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I condemn the outrage committed in Bessbrook by the IRA.  This murder is anti-Irish and antithetical to the interests of all Irish people.  It is an expression of something we wish to eradicate from our society, the use of violence to achieve political ends.</P>
      <P>The ending by the IRA of its ceasefire was a profound mistake.  During that ceasefire of 18 months tremendous progress was made.  A forum was established to allow republicans an input to political dialogue.  There were numerous meetings for republicans with the Irish Government, the British Government and the Government of the United States.  The report of the international body was published which resulted in the removal of the Washington Three precondition.  After the ceasefire ended a fixed date, which had long been sought, for all-party talks was achieved.  Those talks opened and the only reason republicans were not represented at them was because the IRA insisted on continuing its campaign of violence which has brought so much hardship and failed so miserably in its objectives over 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach and the Leader of Fianna Fáil in condemning the outrageous murder of Stephen Restorick.  The leader of Sinn Féin described it as a tragic event and spoke about it as if it was something that was bound to happen, but it was not bound to happen. Somebody pulled the trigger and carried out a cold-blooded murder.  It is time we sent a message to that movement which believes the only method of communication is through the barrel of a gun. The Government and its officials should slam the door on Sinn Féin until the IRA ceasefire is fully restored.  We must ensure that politicians seize the initiative and leave the men of violence trailing in their wake.  We must prove the talks can work.  We must ensure we create a partnership society in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my party, I extend to the family of the late Stephen Restorick our deepest sympathy. This murder will outrage every decent-minded person, North and South.  Nobody who respects democracy or believes in peace can for one moment condone what happened last night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach saw reports &mdash; there is one in this morning's media &mdash; about the number of recent suicides.  It has been stated by one of our most eminent professors of psychiatry that there has been no comprehensive <Col N="1499" /> report on that matter since 1974.  Will the Government examine this matter?  The figures have increased year after year and it is an area that merits radical reform.  Perhaps a report should be carried out since those in the profession believe that is the correct thing to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter should be related to legislation promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, if there is a report, it will lead to legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Suicide is the ultimate tragedy not only for the person concerned but for the family and loved ones who are so violently and permanently affected by the decision of the person to take his or her life.  A task force has been established to report on the causes of suicide in Ireland.  It has presented an interim report and a final report is awaited.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that a solution to the problem of suicide will not be found solely in official action or communications.  The profound loneliness and isolation felt by many young people in society at present is linked to social changes such as urbanisation which cuts people away from the supports that may have helped them in the past to overcome crises in life.  It is important to recognise that loneliness, a sense of being alone and not being able to comprehend the world or to master one's life and destiny, is at the heart of the reason for suicide.  That requires everybody in society to be understanding and to change the way we live so that people will not take this desperate and destructive act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We read in today's papers that the Cabinet has decided to set aside the planning laws in the interests of Esat.  Will the health and safety aspects of the antennae be taken into consideration? Will planning permission no longer be required?  It is suggested in a Government press release that existing masts as well as Garda masts will be exempted from planning permission.  Does the Taoiseach plan to bring in legislation to change the position?</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that under the Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill, the Child Pornography Bill which is currently before a committee, or under the Children Bill, the Government will act quickly to deal with the position where in Dundalk District Court yesterday a person was convicted and fined only £250 for solicitation of a 16 year old boy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious incident and this practice should be stamped out quickly. Rather than wait for the Children Bill, a comprehensive Bill which will take some time to pass, <Col N="1501" /> will the Government amend the Child Pornography Bill to give immediate effect in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to bring into law at the earliest possible opportunity the Children Bill which is currently before the House.  This comprehensive legislation, in an area where legislation has not been reformed since 1908, has been promised by successive Governments since the mid-1970s and I am glad this Government will pass it into law after a delay of 20 years.</P>

I acknowledge the validity of the concerns expressed by Deputy Ahern and assure him that issues concerning child pornography will be dealt with comprehensively. Concerns expressed on a radio programme this morning about issues that cannot be prosecuted will be dealt with in the legislation and the amendments to it, which the Government will carry through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have another matter to raise and I cannot think of any more formal way of raising it than on the Order of Business.  On promised legislation, does the Government intend to address the serious anomaly and blatant <Col N="1502" /> discrimination perpetrated against rural communities by the Minister for the Environment in the forthcoming legislation he has promised this House?  The Minister has created a serious anomaly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the resolution establishing the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation, passed by consensus on 19 November 1996 in New York at a meeting of the States Signatories of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices as amended on 3 May 1996 (Protocol II as amended on 3 May 1996) annexed to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects.</P>
      <P>Ireland was privileged to hold the Presidency of the European Union at a time when significant progress was achieved in two important areas of disarmament.  I refer to the adoption and opening for signature of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on the one hand and a range of activities which culminated in the UN General Assembly's call for an international agreement to ban anti-personnel landmines on the other.  As Presidency, Ireland saw to it that the European Union as such as well as individual members were instrumental in a practical way, with others, in securing these notable advances.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to move two motions today, one directly related to the CTBT and one related to a measure whose adoption indirectly gave impetus to the move towards a total ban on anti-personnel landmines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By adopting the CTBT with a resounding vote before the close of the 50th session of the UN General Assembly last September, the international community secured at last, a legal instrument which bans all nuclear weapon test explosions and all other nuclear weapon test time.  The question of halting nuclear testing had long been a major preoccupation of the General Assembly.  In 1993 it had put aside earlier differences and unanimously mandated the Conference on Disarmament to negotiate a multilateral and verifiable nuclear test ban treaty.  Following the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, it <Col N="1506" /> had set 1996 as the deadline for the adoption of a treaty.</P>
    <P>Two days before Ireland assumed the EU Presidency, the 1996 spring session of the Conference of Disarmament concluded without formally adopting a treaty, thus jeopardising the aim of opening the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for signature in late September at the start of the 51st session of the General Assembly.  Ireland immediately signalled its readiness, as Presidency, to take any action which partners deemed appropriate for the realisation of an objective to which the European Union, successive Governments and all political parties in Dáil Éireann attached the highest priority.  During the brief summer session of the conference, the Presidency issued two Declarations on behalf of the Union and Associated States, 30 countries in all, urging acceptance of the draft treaty then on the table and seeking to impart to the proceedings in Geneva the sense of urgency to conclude which was felt by the international community.</P>
    <P>When the draft treaty was vetoed by India in late August, Australia, a CD member from the Asia Pacific in which region all five nuclear weapons states had at some point conducted a nuclear test, assumed the onerous responsibility of leading the drive to secure the timely adoption of the treaty by the General Assembly.  Ireland, as EU Presidency, worked closely with Australia and others in orchestrating demarches in African, Asian and Latin American capitals, some 100 countries in all, in a period of barely two weeks, to convey the unequivocal support of the European Union for the draft treaty and to invite support and co-sponsorship.  It was imperative that the window of opportunity to end nuclear testing for all time should on no account slip away.  Ultimately, a total of 126 states co-sponsored the draft Resolution whereby the General Assembly, on 10 September, adopted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by an overwhelmingly positive vote: 158 in favour, three against &mdash; Bhutan, India and Libya &mdash; and five abstentions &mdash; Cuba, Lebanon, Mauritius, Tanzania and Syria.  The depth and breadth of the positive vote showed the strength of international feeling against nuclear testing and the desire of the vast majority of states to see a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in place.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste was among the first group of Heads of State and Government and Foreign Ministers who signed the treaty at United Nations headquarters in New York on the day it was opened for signature, 24 September 1996.  To date, 141 countries have signed the treaty.  The preparatory commission for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation, CTBTO, which will be based in Vienna and will monitor implementation of the treaty, has begun its work with a view to ensuring that the verification regime will be capable of meeting the requirements of the treaty at entry into force.</P>
    <P>In authorising the Tánaiste to sign the treaty, <Col N="1507" /> subject to ratification, on behalf of Ireland, the Government on 18 September also agreed to participation by Ireland in the preparatory commission for the CTBTO subject to approval by Dáil Éireann which is not at this time called upon to approve the treaty, this will arise prior to ratification.</P>
    <P>In essence, the treaty is a non-discriminatory agreement which will prohibit any nuclear weapon test explosion and any other nuclear explosion thereby constraining the development of nuclear weapons; through its preamble, it places the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the context of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament initiatives; it provides for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation, CTBTO, to be established in Vienna on entry into force following advance work by a preparatory commission; it establishes the Conference of State Parties and an Executive Council comprising 51 members drawn from six regional groups to direct the work of the CTBTO; it establishes a global non-discriminatory verification regime comprising an international monitoring system, IMS, with seismic, radionuclide and infrasound monitoring stations together with an on-site inspection regime designed to ensure effective verification while preventing excessive intrusion on the one hand and abuse on the other; it will enter into force 180 days after the date of deposit of the instruments of ratification of 44 named countries but in no case earlier than two years after its opening for signature.</P>
    <P>The listing of 44 countries means that entry into force requires the participation of all nuclear capable countries, including all those which have tested nuclear weapons.  India's opposition to the adoption of the treaty and its declared intention not to sign or ratify it means that a special waiver provision is likely to be invoked in the event that the treaty has not entered into force three years after its opening for signature.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding uncertainties surrounding its entry into force, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is already invaluable in that it establishes a new international norm against all nuclear testing. It represents one of the most sought after nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament measures in the history of the United Nations. While certainly not the end of the process of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, its adoption was the essential next step.  It behoves Ireland as a long time advocate of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to lose no time before contributing to the preparatory commission which will lay the foundation for implementing the treaty.  In this spirit, I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said earlier that support grew rapidly last year for an international agreement to <Col N="1508" /> ban anti-personnel landmines.  I was extremely disappointed at the outcome of the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention Review Conference which ended early in May.  Nevertheless, it opened the way to a significant shift of focus in international action in this field.  Without disavowing good faith efforts to regulate the use of anti-personnel landmines so as to minimise their cruel and indiscriminate effects on civilians, major countries set about building international support for moving towards a ban on these weapons, Ireland associated itself enthusiastically with these endeavours.  Canada, through the October Ottawa Conference, and the United States in leading on a new landmines Resolution in the First Committee of the General Assembly at UNGA provided essential focus for the growing international momentum towards a ban on these weapons.</P>
      <P>On 8 May, just after the amended Protocol II was adopted, the Tánaiste and I spoke about the desirability of ending for all time the scourge of anti-personnel landmines.  I am glad of this opportunity to inform the Dáil briefly about the role Ireland has been playing since then in key developments in the total ban movement and on other aspects of the landmines issue.  As chairperson of the Council of Development Ministers, I made a ban on landmines one of the key objectives of the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency succeeded in achieving agreement at the General Affairs Council on 1 October on a new joint action articulating European Union policy on anti-personnel landmines. The joint action solemnly enshrines, for the first time, the commitment of the Union to the goal of the total elimination of anti-personnel landmines and its pledge to work actively towards the achievement at the earliest possible date of an effective international agreement to ban these weapons worldwide.  The existing EU common moratorium on exports of APLs is extended in scope to cover the export of all APLs to all destinations. An EU financial contribution to international mine clearance is envisaged on an ongoing basis, with an amount of 7 million ECUs provided for initiatives to be launched in the period up to 1997; this is separate from European Union action in the field of mine clearance and from the bilateral contributions of member states on the issue.</P>
      <P>Ireland was privileged to serve as one of a half dozen core group countries that worked with Canada in advance of the international strategy meeting on banning anti-personnel mines which Canada hosted in Ottawa from 3 to 5 October. We were asked to be part of that core group because of the leading position we have taken at a number of international conferences on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attendance of delegates from the mine affected states of Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Mozambique was a feature of that conference, but our critical contribution was to position the EU as such, through the joint action, in the vanguard <Col N="1509" /> of the total ban movement.  All 15 member states eventually elected to be among the 50 full participants at the Ottawa conference which was undoubtedly a landmark event.  In the Ottawa Declaration, these 50 countries agreed to work together to ensure the earliest possible conclusion of an international agreement to ban anti-personnel landmines; to ensure progressive reductions in new deployments with the urgent objective of halting new deployments altogether; and to promote regional and sub-regional activities in support of a global ban.  An agenda for action adopted on the responsibility of the chairman of the conference listed concrete actions ahead in all regions, designed to move the process forward in preparation for a follow-up conference to be hosted by Belgium at the end of June 1997.</P>
    <P>Hard on the heels of the conference the United States, in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly, canvassed an ambitious new resolution urging States to pursue vigorously an effective, legally binding international agreement to ban the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines with a view to completing the negotiations as soon as possible.  This welcome change of heart by the United States Government was brought about by the consequences of the US forces in Bosnia encountering some three million landmines and a number of fatalities and serious injuries rather than the immense suffering of hundreds of thousands of adults, particularly children, in countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola and Mozambique. As EU Presidency, Ireland worked very closely with the US, Canada and others to help shield this inherently challenging initiative from hostile amendment by building the widest possible level of support and co-sponsorship for it.  No fewer than 155 countries cast a positive vote for the total ban proposal in the plenary vote on 10 December; ten countries, admittedly including some major players in this context, abstained; none voted against.  Our major objective at this point is to consolidate, in a new and no less difficult phase, the political advances made during our Presidency in enlarging support for an early total ban agreement.</P>
    <P>Progress is clearly being made in building political support for a global ban.  What purpose would then be served, it might be asked, by Ireland's signifying its consent to be bound by the Amended Protocol II?  The answer, essentially, is that translating political support into a new legally binding norm prohibiting anti-personnel landmines remains a very big challenge.  Pending the establishment of that new norm, Amended Protocol II to the CCW Convention contains the most far-reaching legally binding restrictions yet agreed on the use and transfer of these weapons. It is important that the 20 ratifications needed to bring these restrictions into force are secured at the earliest possible date.  EU member states are committed under the new joint action to ratify quickly.  As the architect of the joint action, Ireland ought to be among the first to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> Second, not all countries have joined the global ban process.  The parties to the existing Protocol II include countries which are, or which have the potential to be, the world's largest exporters of landmines to developing countries, particularly as most developed countries now operate moratoria on such exports.  We want, for example, to encourage these countries to accept the Amended Protocol, thus copperfastening the modest concessions they made in the review conference.</P>
    <P>Third, the Protocol contains a number of advances: its scope extends to internal conflicts where the most serious problems caused by landmines have arisen; it bans the use of non-detectable anti-personnel landmines, thereby reversing the trend of recent decades towards non-detectable devices; it includes technical restrictions on long-lived mines; it affords stronger protection to UN peacekeeping missions whose commanders will be entitled to receive from the parties to a conflict comprehensive information on mines and minefields which they have laid; and it introduces a ban on the transfer of prohibited mines with immediate effect and generally restricts transfers to states which accept the constraints of the new instrument.</P>
    <P>The amended Protocol II includes a provision for annual consultations among state parties.  This will create a forum for putting pressure on those parties to the Protocol who do not subscribe to a complete ban, to take further measures to eliminate the scourge of landmines.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.  Having raised this issue originally when I became chairperson of the Development Council, I am extremely disappointed there is not now a total ban on the use of landmines, nonetheless we have made substantial progress, but we must bear in mind the thousands of children who lose arms and legs because work on this is moving so slowly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken regularly in this House on the need to conclude a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and to prohibit conclusively the use and sale of anti-personnel mines.  I warmly welcome the opportunity provided for this debate, albeit brief, on the important issue before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prohibition on the use of landmines is a cause dear to members of Fianna Fáil and one which my party has been very active in pursuing. On 8 May last year I, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, introduced a Private Members' Bill on the prohibition of landmines.  It proposed the prohibition of the production, procurement, transfer, sale, repair, stockpiling, import and use of anti-personnel landmines in this State.  It also proposed the destruction of all anti-personnel landmines held <Col N="1511" /> within the State for purposes other than mine clearance training by the Irish armed forces.</P>
    <P>At that time the Government was of the opinion that the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972 was sufficient to contain the use of anti-personnel landmines and the Government's reaction to the Fianna Fáil prohibition of landmines Bill demonstrated its failure to recognise the gravity of the landmines issue and the concurrent need for all nations to demonstrate their position on this critical issue.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that Ireland stands in an ideal position to take a leadership role to mobilise the objectives of a total ban on landmines in the international arena.  In May last year the opportunity for leadership was presented when Fianna Fáil proposed the prohibition of landmines Bill. The Government insisted that its legislative programme was too cluttered to enact primary legislation on the issue and the opportunity for leadership was lost.  As a second rate alternative the Government brought the landmines order before the House on 19 June 1996 and I welcomed that as a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall that an estimated 110 million landmines contaminate 70 countries worldwide and an estimated 26,000 people are maimed by landmines every year, running at about 500 per week.  Landmines have an equally devastating economic effect.  For example, Cambodia has a population of approximately 9.3 million and an estimated ten million mines are laid on its soil.  Cambodia imports in excess of 200,000 tonnes of rice since the land cannot be farmed due to the presence of mines.  Figures for 1993 suggest that approximately 10,000 mines have been removed worldwide at a cost of $70 million. Ironically, during the same period, between two and five million landmines were laid throughout the world.  Landmines indiscriminately kill innocent men, women and children.  Their use must be prohibited.  I make this rational appeal to each Member of the House.</P>
    <P>It will cost an estimated $33 billion to remove all the landmines already laid.  Until that time, because of them fertile land will be left barren and unproductive making impossible economic reconstruction, the resettlement of refugees and the post-conflict redevelopment of society.</P>
    <P>The call to prohibit the use of landmines across the globe has recently gathered momentum. The number of countries calling for a total ban has grown from four to more than 40 in 1997. We must maintain this momentum by supporting the motion before the House.  Subsequently, we must strive to achieve the goal shared by each Member of this House &mdash; a worldwide ban on the manufacture, sale, stockpiling, importation, transfer, sale, repair and use of anti-personnel landmines.</P>
    <P>In recent years, particularly during the political aftermath of the French nuclear tests at Muroroa Atoll in September 1995 and during the Irish EU Presidency, I have called on the Tánaiste and the <Col N="1512" /> Government to unequivocally declare Ireland's stance on nuclear testing and the wider issue of nuclear disarmament.  That opportunity is now afforded to each Member of the House.  We must support this second motion before the House.</P>
    <P>On 22 April last year an EU declaration stated:</P>
    <P>The European Union attaches the highest priority and is strongly committed to the conclusion, before the end of the spring session of the Conference on Disarmament, of negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty which will prohibit any nuclear tests, explosion or any other nuclear explosion so as to enable its signature by autumn at the outset of the 51st UN General Assembly.</P>
    <P>The spring session of the Conference on Disarmament ended on 28 June without formally adopting the treaty.  However, despite this setback the United Nation's General Assembly decided to open the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty for signature in New York on 24 September.</P>
    <P>The treaty does not mark the end of the process of nuclear non-proliferation by any means, nor is the treaty conclusive in its treatment of the issue of nuclear weapons testing.  EU members are not completely satisfied with the treatment of some of the key issues in the treaty, but it represents a concrete step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>As a militarily neutral nation committed to the principle of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, Ireland has a vital role to play in providing leadership on this important issue, particularly within the framework of the European Union.  Situations such as that which occurred in September 1995 during the French nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific must not be tolerated or repeated.  The EU must not be allowed to develop as a military superpower committed to the use of nuclear deterrents.  Ireland must remain steadfast on these issues.  We cannot abandon the principles of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation which are held so dear by the Irish people.  We must continue to work towards these goals and not be satisfied with less. A ban on nuclear testing is a step in the right direction but it must be followed by other braver steps and more hard work.</P>
    <P>We must also work to ensure that non-military nuclear installations such as THORP and Sellafield are closed.  We must not allow the nuclear dump to be developed at Sellafield.  The number of tragedies involving cancer victims along the east coast, including my own area of north County Dublin, provides significant evidence of the dangers posed by Sellafield, which must be closed down.</P>
    <P>I call on each Member of the House to support both motions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for sharing his time with me.  I welcome both motions introduced by the Minister of State.  In common with all Members of the House, I have condemned <Col N="1513" /> nuclear testing carried out in recent times by both the French and Chinese authorities.  There is great hypocrisy in some of the statements that have been issued by both the French and Chinese Governments.  I remember receiving a statement from the embassy of the People's Republic of China after the nuclear test on 8 June 1996.  Such countries commit themselves not to use nuclear weapons and call for a moratorium on nuclear testing, while at the same time claiming they need to carry out one more test to ensure the safety of nuclear weapons.  These statements, coupled with the tests, resemble the actions of a chronic gambler playing with people's lives.  I welcome the Minister's statement that we can look forward to having no more testing.</P>
      <P>On the landmines issue about which the Minister has often spoken in the House, I raised this issue on the Order of Business in relation to legislation which was due to follow from the debate on 8 May.  I understand an order was made in June and the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, signed an order on 3 December. There was a delay in getting the order signed.  The Control of Exports Order makes the export of military goods, including mines, subject to the issuing of a licence from the Department of Tourism and Trade.  Despite the delay in signing it, I hope the order is now in place.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are discussing both motions, particularly the one concerning landmines which are appalling weapons.  The number of such weapons manufactured worldwide is appalling.  While they are manufactured cheaply they cost a great deal of money to detect and remove.  It is one of the great contradictions that while the European Union funds the clearance of mines, some EU states continue to sell them throughout the developing world.</P>
      <P>There has been a change of policy in some countries and the situation in Belgium is particularly welcome.  However, it is appalling that these indiscriminate weapons have caused the deaths of so many people &mdash; children playing as well as people harvesting crops and collecting firewood.  The situation was brought home to us by representatives from Angola who attended a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  More than nine million mines have been laid in Angola, whose representatives spoke about the horrific injuries these weapons have caused.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke mentioned Cambodia which is always cited as an example of a country where there is one landmine for every citizen.  It has the highest percentage of landmines in the world.  It is difficult to carry out any development in a country where landmines are so prevalent.  The Government must press for a worldwide ban on all mines.  The United Nations spoke about the urgency of mine clearence operations and has urged that savings on military expenditure should be redirected to mine clearence.  That makes sense because up to now the humanitarian aid budget has been spent on mine clearance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> I welcome the Minister's comments on landmines and internal conflicts.  This will now be covered by the convention.  We are told there are more than 100 internal conflicts throughout the world.  I hope we will be able to monitor the situation in these countries and review the inhumane weapons convention.  The horror of landmines was brought home to me on seeing the situation in Cambodia after the elections there when 350,000 refugees returning home could use only 8 per cent of the land because the rest was mined. There is no such thing as a humane landmine. The Minister is to be congratulated on moving this motion.  I hope the Government will continue to press for a total and world-wide ban on all landmines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these two motions in so far as they go and I am pleased to support them.</P>
      <P>I will deal first with the motion on the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation.  This motion really only deals with a quite minor preliminary point. I am somewhat disappointed that the treaty itself which was signed in September is not before the House for ratification.  There is no reason it should not.  I have no doubt that we will ratify it, and we should ratify it at the earliest date.  While the approval of this preparatory commission is also necessary, I feel strongly that we should set a headline by ratifying the treaty.</P>
      <P>Apparently legislation will be required to implement the provisions of the treaty.  I do not know how detailed that legislation will be but if the treaty is very complex, it may itself be complex. I hope there will not be a long delay.  Frequently we have seen such conventions signed on behalf of Ireland with a great fanfare and, four or five years later, we have still not ratified them.  It would be preferable if all these things could be done together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the whole question of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was signed by the vast majority of world states in September, we should not look just at those countries that did not sign it.  India's opposition to it is well known. The vote of Bhutan against it is not significant because Bhutan is essentially a colony of India, and Libya is a maverick that would probably vote against everything anyway.  There are five countries listed among those who supported it about whose bona fides I would be very doubtful in this context of nuclear weapons.  They are China, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Israel.  All five of those either have or are believed to have nuclear weapons and to have tested nuclear weapons to one degree or another.  The fact that they may sign a treaty of this kind is of little value to the human race if they are not observing its spirit.  We need to bear them in mind if we are to have a realistic view of what is happening on the ground, and what is happening on the ground is not what happens with a flourish at the United Nations in New York in any given September; it is what various <Col N="1515" /> countries like these are doing.  Those five constitute a threat to the future depending on what they do and continue to do.</P>
    <P>Two other countries that give rise to concern in regard to nuclear weapons are the Russian Federation and the Ukraine, both of whom have stockpiles of very substantial quantities of nuclear weapons, both of whom are financially <i>in extremis</i> and each of whom is known to have sold nuclear weapons to states who should not get them.  I do not wish to be unsympathetic to the financial and economic plight of people living in Russia and the Ukraine but, at the same time, there should be an effective ban on the sale of these weapons that can be properly monitored.  We know that such weapons are being sold, and every effort should be made by the international community to discourage their sale because if they are sold, the real tragedy is that ultimately they may well be used by somebody.</P>
    <P>On the nuclear side, and particularly in relation to the military aspects of the nuclear question, we cannot forget in a motion like this the position that exists at Sellafield.  The aspect that should concern us is the evidence that has come to light in recent weeks about the Nirex site which is only about four miles from the Sellafield complex.  Evidence has now come to light &mdash; I think it was leaked rather than officially published, but its accuracy is apparently not denied &mdash; that the Nirex site is seriously unsuitable for the storage of nuclear waste.  The nuclear waste arising at Sellafield is not just the conventional waste arising from used uranium, but includes elements of plutonium which are manufactured in the Sellafield complex, at least partly for military purposes. A meeting is due to take place in the House this afternoon of Committee D of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body, of which I am a member.  Unfortunately, I cannot attend as I have to go to Limerick this afternoon, but I have written the chairman a letter drawing attention to the fact that the draft report of that committee on the Sellafield question and the question of the contamination of the Irish Sea is now out of date because of what has come to light in recent weeks in relation to the Nirex site.  I do not know how the chairman proposes to deal with it, but it is something we cannot accept and that gives rise to a great deal of concern.</P>
    <P>To turn to the other motion on prohibitions and restrictions on the use of mines, booby traps and other devices, again one enthusiastically supports it.  However, when one reads the Protocol, it is enormously disappointing, as I am sure the Minister will agree, because most of the text is taken up with exceptions and exemptions.  There are a few statements at the start of each article that X is prohibited and then it goes on line after line, paragraph after paragraph, to detail the exemptions and exceptions to the overall prohibition. The result is that the prohibition is relatively limited and not at all as extensive as one might think at first sight or as one might wish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> We have debated the question of landmines before in this House on more that one occasion. There is certainly universal revulsion not just in this country but in most civilised countries in the world at the use of such appalling devices which invariably cause injury almost exclusively to civilians rather than to military targets.  The civilians injured are predominantly women and children who are permanently maimed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said all European Union member states have agreed to a total ban on exports.  If that is correct, it is an advance because some of our dear colleagues in this cherished Union were making and exporting these appalling mines until recently.  Will the Minister of State give a categoric assurance that they have stopped and are not just saying they have because they are under pressure to say so?  Some have substantial stocks of these mines and I hope they will destroy them because if they are kept, I fear they will be used at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to three mine affected countries &mdash; Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Mozambique to whom we have given help.  I hope she is not implying that they are the only countries affected.  There must be 20 countries seriously affected by mines.  Unfortunately, they are all Third World underdeveloped countries with poor people living at subsistence level who must go into certain areas for their subsistence to try to stay alive.  It is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>The cost of removing a mine is about 100 times greater than the cost of making and planting it.  If there was ever something which should be universally and without exception or exemption banished from the face of the earth, it is these wretched anti-personnel mines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and their welcome for these two measures.  The Irish position on landmines and on the comprehensive abolition of nuclear weapons has been made clear for a long time.  In both these areas, the international movement is extraordinarily slow.  With like minded countries, such as Canada, we have sought to build a global coalition which will get anti-personnel landmines banned, but there are grey areas.</P>
      <P>The European Union has slowly moved to a more advanced position, specifically the moratorium on exports.  A significant number of European Union states have defence industries and are involved in the production of landmines.  It was only as a consequence of what happened in Bosnia where the American Joint Chiefs of Staff had a rapid change of heart on the issue of landmines that they became like swords &mdash; outdated weapons which were no longer necessary from a military and tactical point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time the Minister of State referred to the American change of heart.  President Clinton deserves more credit than she is giving him for his commitment and <Col N="1517" /> that of his administration to the abolition of landmines. Although his case may have been strengthened by the experience of the American military, he deserves greater credit.  He campaigned for the abolition of landmines before Bosnia and had voiced his strongly held humanitarian view that they should be banned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the American position helpful. While everybody, like St. Augustine, seemed to want to rid the world of such things, no will or mechanism was found for the expression of the act of will until generals and soldiers came forward to say we did not need them and that the main victims were not the other combatants in the war, but civilians, including children.  Influential people in the British military have taken the same position, although the British Government continues to have a reserved position on this issue, as do a number of other EU Governments. The recent visit by Princess Diana to Angola will do more to inform British public opinion than, unfortunately, the campaigning by the various NGOs.</P>
      <P>As a neutral country and a member of the European Union, we have given a lead in that we are one of the key countries trying to build this worldwide coalition.  The event being held in Belgium in June is positive.  Belgium, which has a long association with landmines, will host the next conference that seeks to take us a step further down this road.  The Ottawa conference was a mechanism outside UN structures dealing with weapons.  In many instances, amending the various conferences, including the test ban treaty on nuclear weapons or the conventions on conventional weapons, takes years.  As Deputy O'Malley said, when one reads the small print of what we are signing up to and sees that it took several years of conferences and detailed discussions with hundreds of people from different countries, the end result is small.  The main way in which landmines will pass into the realm of swords and other discarded weapons of war is by the continued campaign by NGOs, including Trócaire and Pax Christi, to rid the world of these weapons.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy O'Malley's point on the comprehensive test ban treaty, particularly in relation to India.  We have given a clear lead in calling for a total ban on nuclear weapons.  The measures before the House today are another step on this road.  We all understand the politics of India's position.  This is the 50th anniversary of Indian independence and it would be nice if it marked the celebrations by fully signing up to the comprehensive test ban treaty.  India has said it will not sign up until there is an agreement by all nuclear states to the total elimination of all nuclear weapons.  While we want this to happen, this is a step in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will know there is a Cabinet sub-committee which reviews issues in relation to Sellafield on an ongoing basis.  Information which has become available on Nirex will be the subject of a detailed submission from my colleague, the <Col N="1518" /> Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Stagg, to the British authorities.  That information provides scientific validity to the expressions of not only concern, but deep fear about the proposal.  The Government's objective is to seek the closure of Sellafield and that the Nirex proposal does not see the light of day.  We will continue to work to achieve that objective.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the European Convention for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage revised at Valletta on 16th January, 1992, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 9th day of January, 1997.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis seo a bheith agam an Coinbhinsiún seo a thabhairt faoi bhráid na Dála. Tá údarás an Rialtais fáighte agam chun rún a chur os comhair na Dála ag glacadh le téarmaí an Choinbhinsiúin.  Beidh an tAire Gnóthaí Eachtracha ag déanamh ullmhúcháin chun an Coinbhinsiún a cheangail, faoi réir aontú na Dála don rún atá á mholadh agamsa anois.  Táim ag tnúth le tacaíocht a fháil ó Chomhaltaí an Tí seo don rún.</P>
      <P>The convention, known as the Valletta Convention, is one of the results of work by the Council of Europe on the co-ordination of policies on the protection of the archaeological heritage. It is a revised and updated version of the original convention signed in London in 1969, to which Ireland was not a party.  Details of its signature and ratification are as follows: it was open for signature in Valletta, Malta, on 16 January 1992; it was signed by Ireland on that date; as of 7 January 1997, 27 out of 40 member states of the Council of Europe had signed the convention; of the member states which have signed, 11 have ratified; one non member state, the Holy See, has signed; and the convention entered into force on 25 May 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Archaeology is concerned with the study of past societies through the material remains left by those societies and the evidence of their environment. The archaeological heritage consists of such material remains and environmental evidence and forms a resource which allows us to investigate and attempt to understand the past. The material remains of past societies in Ireland, dating from the earliest human occupation of Ireland at the end of 8th millennium BC right through to relatively recent times, take a wide variety of forms, including settlement and industrial sites and structures, field systems, ritual and funerary monuments and also artefacts, but collectively this archaeological resource should be seen as an archive which allows many fundamental <Col N="1519" /> aspects of the story of the people who have lived in Ireland over the past 9,000 years to be investigated and better understood in a way and to a degree which would not otherwise be possible.</P>
    <P>As a resource, the archaeological heritage is a finite and non-renewable one.  Given its importance and non-renewable nature it is essential to secure its protection and proper management. This does not mean preserving <i>in situ</i> all the material remains of the past, but it means we should try to ensure that, as a minimum, material remains of past societies which can contribute to our understanding of the past are not destroyed without appropriate archaeological investigation and recording, and that such destruction should not take place without good reasons, be they for the sake of archaeological research or to allow development necessary in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The ratification of the Valletta Convention at this time is an important statement of our continuing commitment to the protection of the archaeological heritage.  The convention provides member states with a means of proclaiming common principles for the protection of the archaeological heritage of Europe.  It lays down European standards for the protection of this heritage and sets out a range of obligations which signatories undertake to implement.  These obligations relate to the identification of the archaeological heritage to be protected, the implementation of statutory protection procedures and technical co-operation in matters relating to the archaeological heritage between parties to the convention.</P>
    <P>The formal purpose of today's debate is to comply with Article 29 of the Constitution, which requires Dáil approval to international conventions which involve a charge on public funds.</P>
    <P>The main undertakings to be given by states ratifying or acceding to the convention are: (1) to institute a legal system for the protection of the archaeological heritage &mdash; which is defined as all remains and objects and any other traces of mankind from past epochs, the preservation and study of which help to retrace the history of mankind and its relation with the natural environment and for which excavations or discoveries and other methods of research into mankind and the related environment are the main sources of information, and includes structures, constructions, groups of buildings, developed sites, movable objects, monuments of other kinds, as well as their context, whether they are situated on land or under water &mdash; and to make provision in that protective legal system for: the maintenance of an inventory of the archaeological heritage and the designation of protected monuments and areas; the creation of archaeological reserves for preservation and future study; and the mandatory reporting to the authorities by finders of the chance discovery of elements of the archaeological heritage and making them available for examination; (2) to apply procedures for the authorisation and supervision of excavations and other archaeological activities <Col N="1520" /> in order to: prevent any illicit excavation or removal of elements of the archaeological heritage; ensure that non-destructive methods of investigation are used where possible, that elements of the archaeological heritage are not left uncovered or exposed during or after excavations without provisions being made for their proper preservation, conservation and management and that excavations are carried out by qualified, authorised persons; ensure that the use of metal detectors and other detection equipment for archaeological investigation is subject to prior authorisation; (3) to make provision for: the acquisition or protection by other appropriate means by public authorities of proposed archaeological reserves; the conservation and maintenance of the archaeological heritage, preferably <i>in situ;</i> and for appropriate storage places for archaeological remains which have been removed from their original location; (4) to ensure that: archaeologists participate in planning policies designed to protect and conserve sites of archaeological interest, and in the various stages of development schemes; that archaeologists and planners consult one another to permit the modification of development plans likely to have adverse effects on the archaeological heritage and to allocate time and resources for appropriate scientific studies of sites and publication of findings; environmental impact assessments and resulting decisions take full account of archaeological sites and their settings; elements of the archaeological heritage found during development work are conserved <i>in situ</i> when feasible; and the opening of archaeological sites to the public, especially any structural works necessary for the reception of large numbers, does not adversely affect the archaeological character of such sites and their surroundings; (5) to provide public financial support for archaeological research, increase the resources for rescue archaeology, ensure that provision is made in development schemes for covering, from public or private resources, the total costs of related archaeological operations, and provide in the budgets for development schemes for preliminary archaeological study and prospection, for a scientific summary record and for full publication and recording of the findings; (6) to facilitate the study of, and dissemination of knowledge about, archaeological discoveries, make or bring up to date surveys, inventories and maps of archaeological sites and take all practical measures to ensure the drafting, following archaeological operations, of a publishable scientific record before the publication of comprehensive studies; (7) to facilitate national and international exchange of elements of the archaeological heritage for scientific purposes, promote the pooling of information on archaeological research and excavations and contribute to international research programmes; (8) to educate the public in the value of archaeological heritage and the threats to it, promote public access to important elements of this heritage, and encourage public display of selected archaeological <Col N="1521" /> objects; (9) in the prevention of the illicit circulation of elements of the archaeological heritage to: arrange for the relevant public authorities and for scientific institutions to pool information on any illicit excavations; inform competent authorities in the states of origin of any offers suspected of coming from illicit excavations or unlawfully from official excavations; ensure that museums and similar institutions whose acquisition policies are under State control do not acquire elements of the archaeological heritage suspected of coming from uncontrolled finds or illicit excavations or unlawfully from official excavations; convey the text of the convention to museums and similar institutions whose acquisition policies are not under State control, and make every effort to ensure that such bodies respect the same principles in acquisition of elements of the archaeological heritage suspected of coming from uncontrolled finds, etc. as apply to museums and similar bodies whose acquisition policies are under State control; restrict by education, vigilance and co-operation the illicit circulation of elements of the archaeological heritage; and (10) provide mutual technical assistance through the exchange of information and experts in matters concerning the archaeological heritage, and encourage, under relevant legislation or agreements, exchanges of specialists in the preservation of the archaeological heritage, including those responsible for further training.</P>
    <P>The convention also provides that a committee of experts will monitor the application of the convention and report periodically to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, and that the European Union or any state not a member of the Council of Europe may be invited to accede to the convention.  I am satisfied existing legislation and practice are adequate to give full effect to all of the obligations the convention will impose on the State on ratification.</P>
    <P>The programme, A Government of Renewal, contains a number of commitments in the heritage area, many of which have been implemented during the past year and a half.  The most notable of these are the establishment of the Heritage Council on a statutory basis in 1995 and the completion of the transfer of responsibility for heritage services to my Department last year.  The Heritage Act, 1995, under which the Heritage Council was set up, provides for the establishment of a standing committee on archaeology, which effectively replaces the National Monuments Advisory Council in so far as the archaeological side of that body's responsibilities are concerned.</P>
    <P>The programme also contains a commitment to continue work on a full national audit of archaeological sites.  This work is being carried out by the national monuments and historic properties service of my Department under the Archaeological Survey of Ireland programme.  This work commenced in the 1960s.  In 1992, there was a programme of compilation of known archaeological monuments and sites was completed with the <Col N="1522" /> publication of the sites and monuments records, SMRs, on a county basis.  The SMRs identify archaeological sites and monuments by reference to maps and townlands of location.  A complementary urban archaeological survey of medieval and plantation towns, which has been incorporated in the SMRs, was completed in 1995.  The SMRs are distributed to planning authorities and to various other agencies concerned with local and national development issues to ensure that those involved in large scale land use are aware of the existence of archaeological sites and so avoid damaging them.</P>
    <P>The next stage of the survey, the compilation and publication of an archaeological inventory for each county based on extensive field work, is in progress.  To date, inventories have been published for nine counties, while inventories for seven counties will be published this year or early next year.  Work is well advanced on the remaining counties.</P>
    <P>Article 7 of the convention obliges parties to it to promote archaeological research.  Discovery Programme Limited is carrying out very valuable work in the archaeological research field.  The Discovery Programme was established in 1991 with the twin objectives of carrying out focused archaeological research on Ireland's past and making this available to the academic community and the public at large.  In January 1996 it was established formally as a non-profit making company, funded by way of an annual grant from the Heritage Council.  At present it has four major projects under way, each looking at different aspects of the late prehistoric period.  These are Tara, North Munster, the Western Stone Forts and Ballyhoura Hills.  An additional £80,000 was made available to the Heritage Council in the budget to enable Discovery Programme Limited to continue its work on the Tara project.  This additional allocation to Discovery Programme Limited increases its 1997 funding to £0.63 million.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to welcome this motion.  The convention was signed in Malta in January 1992 by my colleague, the then Minister of State with responsibility for cultural heritage, Deputy O'Donoghue.  As our recent document on heritage shows, Fianna Fáil has a very strong commitment to the development of the archaeological heritage.  The Discovery Programme in Archaeology was established by a Fianna Fáil Government.  In its heritage document &ldquo;Caring for our Heritage&rdquo;, Fianna Fáil renews its commitment to funding the Discovery Programme in <Col N="1523" /> Archaeology.  This programme, first inaugurated by a Fianna Fáil Government and Taoiseach, has generated great excitement at international level and is the envy of many countries.  According to reports, the projects are showing tremendous results and are contributing in major ways to our understanding of the past and the archaeological landscape.</P>
      <P>The Discovery Programme is in many ways the jewel in our archaeological crown.  It has received praise from many international sources and is the envy of many archaeologists and international programmes.  As a result of major capital investment, it has enabled Irish archaeology to acquire the best of equipment and to develop its expertise in ways which were impossible previously.  It has also enabled major research projects to be undertaken, something which could not be attempted previously because of the scale of the work involved.  It has advanced our understanding of humankind's interaction with the landscape from the earliest times and has allowed important surveying and research to be carried out on sites of major social and cultural importance.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has supported the Discovery Programme from the beginning.  It was due to the vision of the then leader of the party that the programme was first initiated.  The continuance of the programme is vital in piecing together our cultural and heritage jigsaw.  The programme will give us much cause for pride and excitement in the years ahead as it continues to develop our understanding of our early identity.  We must not underestimate the benefits of such a programme in terms of the well-being and sense of identity of the nation.  It adds greatly to our sense of pride in who we are and in our roots.</P>
      <P>Irish archaeology has made great strides in recent times but it has had to cope with major areas of concern.  The continued rapid rate of destruction of archaeological sites is a cause of major concern.  Greater economic development and expansion, urban renewal, land reclamation, forestry programmes, road development and the jettisoning by the rural population of many old superstitions and beliefs have all had a sorry effect on the archaeological heritage.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the sites and monuments records, the county inventories and other archaeological surveys we now have a much better picture of the archaeological landscape.  Planners, local authority officials, farm advisers and development agencies now have much better resources available to them than in the past.  Fianna Fáil believes people have a much greater sense of the importance of their archaeological heritage and the challenge is to ensure the systems of government and development provide greater protection for this heritage.  We need to ensure that local authority development plans take full account of the archaeological heritage and that all important sites receive as much protection as possible.  We also need to introduce a process of education and training for public service officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> Fianna Fáil in Government will commit itself to the development of an increased sense of the importance of the archaeological heritage and of its increasing fragility.  We propose the Department should adopt an increasing watching brief in terms of development plans and plans for economic and transport infrastructure and seek, through the local authority liaison unit in particular, to increase the awareness of the archaeological heritage and of the need for archaeology friendly development.  This can be achieved in a number of ways, for example, by ensuring at the planning and development stage archaeologically friendly development of the roads network in terms of the stripping processes, on-site monitoring etc., by providing specialised training for public service engineers and planners, by general education and by the promotion of knowledge of the archaeological heritage.</P>
    <P>The staggering results and success of the gas pipeline archaeological project show how archaeology and development work can proceed happily hand in hand.  In this case the development of the pipeline and the need for archaeological monitoring and surveying unveiled rich archaeological treasures previously undetected.  In the future, early consideration of the archaeological implications of major developments and the inclusion of measures to deal with these will ensure that archaeology and development can happily coexist.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that we need to look very closely at the effects of urban renewal on urban archaeology. The resolution of archaeological difficulties has posed major problems for archaeological services, local authorities and developers.  It has become clear there can be archaeological implications for a development project that should have been carefully considered at the start.  In many cases developers have been more than willing to pay for archaeological investigation and excavation but time constraints and unforeseen problems have led to complications.  All urban renewal programmes and developments in historic urban areas need to have their archaeological implications carefully assessed at an early stage.  Developers should not be under any illusions as to the State's commitment and that of local authorities to protect the archaeological heritage.  Goodwill, imagination and careful planning will advance archaeology and prevent any brake being put on development.</P>
    <P>When one takes the longer view, the proposed development in an urban area of archaeological importance is just the latest in a series of developments. Our understanding of what went before needs to be enhanced and the site's archaeological story deserves to be explored and mapped as far as possible.</P>
    <P>A Fianna Fáil Government will commit itself to a major review of the effects of recent development policy on urban archaeology.  It will also seek to expedite the production of the remaining county inventories so that we will have as full a picture as possible of the archaeological heritage <Col N="1525" /> in our temporary care.  Fianna Fáil has already stated that local authorities must have access to trained professionals, and the availability of archaeologists in the Planning and Local Development Plan system must be a priority.</P>
    <P>Future generations will judge us harshly if we do not protect what was always revered and often given sacred standing and cultural protection. Our pride as a nation demands that we protect and celebrate our astonishing archaeological history which provides us with vital pieces in the jigsaw of the long and extraordinary story of this land since the first Mesolithic hunter-gatherers came here, or even some visitors from times further back.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil also recognises the difficulties that apply to access to a significant number of monument sites and the complicated issues involved in that.  It is hoped that as structures are put in place, and as a greater degree of information and consultation applies, many of these difficulties will be sorted out before a stand-off occurs.  It should be the task of local authorities and heritage service professionals to ensure this kind of contact.</P>
    <P>Where particular difficulties persist, Fianna Fáil will examine the access issue in the context of constitutional reform and changes to the sections which apply to private property rights.  A balance must be achieved between the individual rights of property owners and the rights of citizens where access to the nation's archaeological heritage is concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to industrial archaeology, many communities and local groups have become conscious of the presence of neglected mill complexes, warehouses, small industrial complexes, dockyards, labourers' accommodation, smaller mills and associated works in their localities. These features of the architectural and archaeological landscape have featured prominently in the plans of local communities to preserve and develop their heritage, to provide tourist and craft facilities and to reuse these complexes for general community purposes.</P>
    <P>These buildings and sites have been neglected in the past but local communities have given a lead to Government and to regional and local authorities.  We need to develop a classification system and an inventory for these buildings and sites.  This should take place in the context of the wider and better resourced brief being given to the National Inventory of Architecture.</P>
    <P>It is important that good representative samples of different examples of the industrial archaeology be preserved and restored.  County development plans offer a good vehicle for ensuring there is a planned approach on a local basis to preservation and development.  The heritage services can offer valuable advice to local authorities and to local communities in developing their plans.  Fianna Fáil wants to see these often neglected buildings and complexes brought back into the centre of community life.  We want the twin aims of conservation and finding new uses for old buildings to work hand in hand to guarantee <Col N="1526" /> the protection of our industrial archaeology and to breathe new life into these buildings which were not designed to sit idle.</P>
    <P>I agree with the statement in the convention that archaeological heritage is essential to the knowledge of the history of mankind.  Our heritage is seriously threatened with deterioration because of an increasing number of major planning schemes, natural risks, clandestine or unscientific excavations and insufficient public awareness.</P>
    <P>The convention also aims to protect archaeological heritage as a source of the European collective memory and as an instrument for historical and scientific study.  The heritage is to include structures, constructions, groups of buildings, developed sites, moveable objects, monuments of other kinds as well as their contents, whether situated on land or under water.</P>
    <P>Each party to the convention undertakes to institute a legal system for the protection of the archaeological heritage to preserve it, implement measures for its physical protection, ensure archaeologists participate in planning policies, arrange public financial support, disseminate knowledge and pool information and experience on illicit excavations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been quick to blow his own trumpet about what he has done in this area.  He has often engaged in that despicable political act of saying he has done more than those in Government before him, but self praise is no praise.  Why has nothing been done about this convention? The Minister was appointed at the end of 1992. The convention must have been one of the first matters to greet him, yet it has not been dealt with until now.  At least this convention is from this decade; the last one to be ratified was a 1985 convention on the protection of Europe's architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>According to the latter part of this convention it was agreed at the Third European Conference of Ministers to adapt a European plan for archaeology. This was to raise public awareness of the roots of European civilisation and values through a campaign focusing on the Bronze Age; establish thematic networks, particularly of ancient theatres, amphitheatres and arenas, using a multi-disciplinary approach; set up a working party to carry out a comparative study of the urban archaeology of the country's of greater Europe, with a view to publication; and institute an international study of documentation and inventory techniques aimed at defining common standards for an inventory of the archaeological heritage. The working party on archaeological documentation decided in 1992 to focus on sites and monuments of the Bronze Age and, as a pilot programme, to produce a multilingual glossary of the Bronze Age in Europe to be issued by the middle of 1994.</P>
    <P>Has there been any action on the proposals in the convention?  If so, it has not impinged on members of the public who should be aware of these matters.  Conventions are no substitute for <Col N="1527" /> real action.  In its comment at the time of the signing of the convention, the magazine <i>Archaeology Ireland</i> noted a gap between theory and practice &mdash; we have the laws but not the resources to enforce them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, as the Minister is not with us, to ensure the staff and funding needed to implement the terms of the convention will be forthcoming immediately.</P>

      <P>My party approves the ratification of the terms of the convention.  The Minister of State's contribution included a list of worthy objectives with which no right minded person would seek to be at odds; the objective of the convention must be supported.</P>
      <P>We are nearing the end of another century, a time when people take stock of what is worth protecting and preserving for the next generation. We have three and a half years to examine our consciences in respect of our archaeology and to look back on our track record since this country attained independence in the early part of this century.  Our track record in that regard has been patchy.  At official level it has improved significantly in recent times.  The legislation introduced following the discovery of the Derrynaflan Chalice was a watershed in our history in terms of our approach to ownership of archaeological matters. While significant strides have been made in a number of areas since then, we are not particularly good at recognising the importance of our archaeological history.  Were it not for the great voluntary work done by local historical and archaeological groups since the beginning of this century, many priceless items would have been lost through official neglect or downright plunder. Items that should be the birthright of this and future generations were plundered and traded for monetary value and nobody shouted &ldquo;stop&rdquo;. There is an obligation on all of us to ensure that appropriate laws and resources are put in place to prevent this happening in future.  In areas where there is a strong sense of archaeological and historical value important items are preserved and are a source of local pride.  That type of attitude should be fostered in all areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not forget the sense of excitement I felt when I visited the Céide Fields while attending a summer school in Ballina a few years ago.  Even though I had heard the Minister, Deputy Kenny, talk about them, I did not have any idea what was involved.  There is a great story behind their discovery.  They were discovered by a national school teacher whose son is now the head of the Department of Archaeology in UCD.  That school teacher had a conviction that there was something of great importance in the area, but his views were ignored by official Ireland.  His son, obviously inflamed by the enthusiasm and conviction of his father, undertook to explore the area and the great story about the discovery of fields and their preservation is explained in a lovely interpretative centre.  It is one of the great gems <Col N="1528" /> of our country of which we can be justly proud. It is regrettable that some of the other interpretative centres which are based on flimsy pretences did not follow the classic example of the Céide Fields.</P>
    <P>My party believes there should be a properly resourced structured and scientific approach to the preservation of our archaeological remains. We are a small nation with only a few key items worth preserving.  Our clean and green environment &mdash; although it is not as clean and green as it should be &mdash; is worth fighting for and the same applies to our archaeology.</P>
    <P>The shortfall in our cultural thinking should be addressed by way of education.  While we are passionate about our songs, slogans, banners and flags and have a civil war about the meaning of a word, we are not so passionate about our tangible archaeological remains.  This stems, to some extent, from a shortfall in the way in which we teach history, particularly local history.  I taught history before being to this House.  I can, still quote the various battles of the Thirty Years' War and the terms of the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, but I do not know the history of many parts of this country.  We fail to pass on to our young people a body of knowledge about the importance of the physical fabric of their localities and the archaeological remains that are found in every parish.  If the worthwhile aspirations of which we speak this morning are to become a reality, our young people must be taught how to appreciate archaeological items and how to play their part in protecting and preserving them.  As they get older they must appreciate that it is worth paying taxes to put in place resources to protect our archaeological heritage.  Every local authority should have a permanent archaeologist and conservation officer and if I have a say in the next Government, I will make that a priority.  It will form part of my party's election manifesto.</P>
    <P>Under the guise of urban renewal a great deal of destruction has taken place in recent times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible to operate an urban renewal scheme in conjunction with the protection of archaeological items and the conservation of important buildings.  I know the Minister believes that philosophy because, as a Clare man, it is bred in his bones.  It is possible to do both, but it is unacceptable that hard earned taxpayers' money should be lashed out to developers who are not required to preserve matters of archaeological importance.  That is unacceptable to me as a taxpayer and a citizen.  It is not beyond my wit and wisdom to know that both can be done.  I hope that answers the question of the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk about the need to preserve special areas of conservation and to compensate farmers to enable us to sign the relevant EU Directive.  The matter was discussed in <Col N="1529" /> great detail on the last occasion the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht took questions and he appeared to accept the Opposition's viewpoint. Consequently, I expected him to allocate a sum of money in the budget to pay compensation to farmers to enable him to sign the directive, but expectation was in vain.  I despair when I hear members of the Government speak fine words but this does not provide resources to translate them into action.  I ask myself if this is all.  It is a dance of words, a verbal exercise.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that progress has been made and significant good work has been done recently.  However, more is needed because unless the objectives we discussed this morning are implemented locally and sufficiently resourced they will remain aspirations.  In fact, it may well be left to another Government to implement these fine objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Minister for State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey) Minister for State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions and their support for the ratification of this convention.  It is no more than I would have expected given the support for the protection of heritage which Deputies indicated in their contributions.  I appreciate and share the concerns expressed on a number of different issues, some of which I intend to refer to in the limited time available.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that in the budget £23 million was allocated to the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service.  Many capital projects involving archaeological excavations were included up to a total cost of £22 million.  A sum of £1 million was set aside for specific archaeological excavations and surveys.  One example of a capital project from the £22 million is Trim Castle which will cost £700,000.  There is investment in this area.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the work done by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael Higgins.  He has put emphasis on this area since the Department was established and great progress has been made.  He has not adopted the stance of being a Minister for good news which was the view taken by Deputy de Valera.  He has championed the cause of the Department and has been effective in progressing matters in the area of archaeology.  One example is the legislative framework provided by the National Monuments and Planning Acts which provide an effective framework to protect archaeological heritage.  The Department liaises with local authorities when planning applications are made.  Some Deputies made torrid representations to the Department to withdraw heritage or archaeological objections to some of these applications.  People in this House are well aware that the Department is active in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Deputy de Valera's support for the convention and agree with her positive views on the work of the Discovery Programme and the importance of its findings.  I also share the Deputy's view of the planning system, especially where <Col N="1530" /> archaeological heritage is concerned.  I am pleased to assure the Deputy that excellent co-operation between the Heritage Service, my Department and the planning authorities continues to exist.  The question of access to archaeological sites and monuments was also raised by Deputy de Valera.  My Department is committed to affording the greatest possible access to our shared heritage.  I welcome the number of developments in the area of industrial archaeology. The establishment of the Industrial Heritage Association and a report produced by the Heritage Council on an inventory of industrial archaeology were most welcome too.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the unqualified support of Deputy Quill for the ratification of the convention. She mentioned the plundering of our heritage in the past.  Unfortunately, this is true. However, the work of the Heritage Service, the planning authorities and the Heritage Council is aimed at ensuring the preservation of our shared heritage for future generations.  I am satisfied that the legislative, administrative and financial resources are adequate to ensure the protection of our archaeological heritage and to meet future requirements of the convention.</P>
    <P>The aim of archaeology is to increase our understanding of past societies.  The convention lays special emphasis on education and dissemination of information on archaeological heritage. Archaeological sites will help to develop our tourism industry, especially in the west.  People are becoming more educated about the positive role of these artefacts and areas such as the Céide Fields mentioned by Deputy Quill.  This Department has produced an archaeological map of sites to encourage people to visit these areas and the map is also to be used by the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>In the long run, the ratification of the convention will assist the Department towards improving matters in Europe.  Deputy de Valera mentioned that there seemed to be a reluctance to bring the convention before the House.  There are over 40 countries in Europe and only 11 have ratified this convention to date, so we are among the first third.  We are anxious to see the convention ratified further.  As Deputy de Valera will know, much examination must occur between Departments to evaluate how the convention would affect them.  Prudent advancement has been made and I am delighted that this convention will be agreed to today.</P>

      <P>Bhí mé ag caint ar an gcáin-fhaisnéis an lá deirneach agus is mian liom inniu tagairt a dhéanamh do roinnt ghnéithe nach raibh sa cháin-fhaisnéis chomh maith le rudaí a bhí ann.</P>
      <P>I express, on behalf of the Green Party, my support for the motions which have just been debated.  Would that I had more time and resources as a single Deputy because, if I were in a party, I would be able to more fully express that support.  I ask the Minister of State's indulgence in taking what I say now as an indication of that support.  In relation to the European Convention for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage, I ask him to take on board the announcement in regard to Luggala and to consider whether it might be time to return the Mullaghmore site to its natural state.  No other solution will be acceptable from a heritage point of view, but that is an argument I would like to make more fully at a more appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The motion on nuclear test bans relates to the budget although it might not initially be apparent. I support the Government's efforts in this regard and in regard to landmines.  I add my concern to that of Deputy O'Malley's in relation to the stockpiling of landmines.  That matter must be addressed but this has not happened if the manufacture of landmines is anything to go by.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a number of economic choices internationally and there are also the wider issues of human rights and development.  They go beyond the issue of condemnation, which appears to be the most comfortable position adopted by Government spokespersons with regard to the nuclear industry and landmines, if one is to judge by the two who spoke this morning.  Obviously condemnation counts for something, but it should generate further thought about this country's economic system and how we spend moneys raised in taxes.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, the funding paid by this country to EURATOM.  EURATOM is a European Union institution and one of its objectives is to promote the nuclear industry.  The Irish taxpayer, whether he or she is aware of it, supports that institution by virtue of this country's membership of the EU.  That is a choice made by the Government; it is not a matter of saying we have no choice.  The people who produce landmines, who were involved in nuclear testing and who still produce arms and who indirectly but by their own choice, cause much destruction and misery throughout the world, also claim they have no choice.  They claim it is an employment issue and is part of their economic system so they are stuck with it.  There is an obvious comparison in this regard which requires further examination.  It puts demands on us and, unfortunately, gives rise to difficult decisions, which must be contemplated in the context of our funding of EURATOM, if we are to be consistent and not hypocritical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland contributes a portion of its taxes to EURATOM.  How much do we contribute?  What percentage of our contribution to the EU does it account for?  Are we prepared to put our money <Col N="1532" /> where our mouths are, in effect, and stop funding the nuclear industry?  There is a deafening silence on that issue, a silence that must be broken.</P>
    <P>The economics of the nuclear industry are, in many ways, similar to the economics of the drug trafficker or the landmine manufacturer.  Its success or otherwise is measured by profit margin criteria.  It does not measure quality of life or general well-being and future prospects.  It concerns itself with end of year profits.  This country's Government operates under a similar set of criteria &mdash; the end of year profit margin and GNP and GDP figures.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I wish to start an alternative economic debate.  The real issue is to look at alternatives to GNP based growth economics, or the type of economics whose priority is a sustainable future, quality of life and equitable social justice.  Those factors are not measured in the GNP/GDP figures which were discussed yesterday at Question Time.  In calling for this debate I am in a minority of one and I would prefer if that were not the case.  All debates on economics, in the context of the budget and on other occasions, discuss how effectively GNP/GDP growth economics can be organised and not whether they are good in themselves, if there are alternatives, how damaging they are or where the benefits lie.  The debate is simply about how to do something in a different way or more efficiently and that, unfortunately, does not get to the root of the problem.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy Bertie Ahern asked the Taoiseach if GNP figures could be released more frequently by the Central Statistics Office.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, replied.  I asked a supplementary question about indicators other than GNP and GDP, but the Minister of State's answer praised GNP and GDP and did not refer to any alternative indicators.  I have put down a question to the Taoiseach on foot of that reply because a more extensive reply is warranted and I did not receive it.</P>
    <P>If the answer to my parliamentary question has not been drafted, I might be able to help by providing some of it in this debate.  The &ldquo;New Scientist&rdquo; magazine discussed in detail the deficiencies of GDP and GNP figures as indicators for measuring progress.  Its editorial stated:</P>
    <P>A rapid increase in GDP is a sign of a healthy, booming economy, a source of national price and envy by others.  Right?  After all, graphs showing GDP always decorate reports from government and big international agencies where they paint a vivid picture of economies on the slippery slope or heading exuberantly upwards.  And there is nothing like some good GDP figures to send the financial markets into a frenzy.</P>
    <P>But a simple faith in the joys of growing GDP is to be avoided.  For the man or woman on the street, the effects of economic growth are a lot more complicated.</P>
    <P>There are lots of bizarre ways of boosting GDP.  A really good crime wave can help by <Col N="1533" /> creating a massive new security industry, supplying everything from private guards to bolts and locks.  And a bit of inconvenience does wonders, too.  If your giant new supermarket or hospital is sited well out of town, you'll have to drive and pay for the fuel to get you there.</P>
    <P>Or what about a nice environmental disaster? The <i>Exxon Valdez</i> oil spill scored a magnificent double-whammy for GDP.  All the oil that was spilt had to be replaced at extra cost. And then there were those extra billions that had to be spent on the cleanup.</P>
    <P>GDP is, after all, merely a measure of total national expenditure (or income).  It doesn't discriminate between expenditure you might enjoy (eating better) and that which you'd prefer to avoid (having to buy big new padlocks).</P>
    <P>That sets the theme for the debate which ought to be happening in this House, a debate on whether we are following a false set of indicators to the exclusion of all others.  I have many questions about other indicators and I hope the Government will come forward with answers and outline what other indicators it looks at when measuring social progress and economic welfare.</P>
    <P>Last year in Britain the office of national statistics established another indicator aside from GNP and GDP.  It set out an accounts system to set environmental costs of different sectors against their contribution to GDP.  This is a step on the road towards recognising that there are alternative ways of measuring progress.  Three years ago the Department of Commerce in the United States set out an indicator called the &ldquo;economic environmental accounting framework&rdquo;.  This recognised the limitations of the economic system under which the USA had worked and under which we still work.  Both indicators, while they recognise a need for change, are far too broad to point out the specific policies which would be required to complement any changes which ought to be undertaken.  It is not enough, for example, to know the damage being done by one's economic policies.  It is vital that there be pointers towards the changes that need to be made.  It is not enough simply to consider the environmental effects of an economic system.  There is a whole range of elements which are not environmental such as unpaid work, parenting, general work in the home, youth clubs, in which the Minister will be particularly interested, and growing food. They are vital to society but are negative in terms of GDP and GNP in that they cannot be measured in the economics practiced at present.</P>
    <P>To set parameters of new indicators would be a step in the direction towards green economics, which is the only real alternative to the proposals put forward by other parties.  The best known indicator internationally is the GPI, the genuine progress indicator, which covers work done in the home, voluntary work such as neighbours looking after each other's children, the effects of crime and what is known as defensive expenditure, that is expenditure incurred as a result of unfortunate incidents such as car accidents.  It also covers destruction of the environment, loss of resources, <Col N="1534" /> the unequal distribution of income, the amount of time off from work and so on.</P>
    <P>The new indices are far from perfect, but Governments, including the present Government, ignore them at their peril.  The GPI gives a close assessment of the economic health of a nation.  It is only one of many indicators internationally &mdash; others can be seen in Sweden and other Nordic countries.  I hope the Taoiseach will provide information on the indicators the Government is considering to measure economic progress.</P>
    <P>A second step towards green economics relates to taxation.  We must remove our dependence on labour for income tax from the nineteenth century model when human labour was scarce and it was difficult to get a job in a factory.  That is no longer the case.  Now labour is plentiful and there is a scarcity in the area of energy, where the taxation burden ought to be heaviest.  That is not simply Green Party policy, it is supported by the ESRI, the European Commission and many independent commentators in the area of tax reform. Those commentators do not simply say, as the Government does, that we must wait until every other country moves in that direction.  The ESRI, in its report, found that tax reform of the type to which I referred would be consistent with a unilateral move on Ireland's part.  It would be consistent with maintaining competitiveness on the international stage, with an employment driven economy, an economy which encourages job creation and would result in the well-being in which the Government claims to be interested but is not prepared to take the decisions to bring about.  I urge the Government to take that on board.</P>
    <P>The car scrappage scheme and dependence by local government on car tax flies in the face of that shift in policy.  It is contrary to the policy of encouraging more people to use public transport and provide a comprehensive system of cycle ways.  The Government is penalising itself in that regard.</P>
    <P>Step three along the road towards more sustainable economics relates to work sharing.  Some work has been done in this regard, but it is largely voluntarily undertaken by companies who believe it is worth taking on board.  The Government has a greater role to play in encouraging job-sharing. Step four relates to merging the tax free allowance system with the dole payment system to bring about a social payment called guaranteed basic income which would apply to all citizens.  It would encourage work-sharing and greater participation in the workforce and would contribute to better parenting and care facilities in society. It is regrettable those matters were not included in the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proud the record of this Government in terms of education is an excellent one.  We have broadened the horizons of educational opportunity for young people at every level and targeted resources at those in society who, through a variety of circumstances, have been unable to take advantage of those opportunities in the past.  The recent publication of the <Col N="1535" /> Education Bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to fundamental reform of the education system which will underpin the huge investment being made in our young people.  This investment is more than justified given that our young people represent the future of social, political, cultural and economic life.  It is all the more important, therefore, that while we strive to enhance the academic development of our young people, we do not lose sight of the need to provide, in parallel, for their personal and social development.</P>
      <P>Members of the House will be aware of the social pressures that nowadays confront young people in every strata of society. What community has not felt the consequences of family breakdown, unemployment or the omnipresent scourge of drugs?  How do we ensure our young people who are emerging into this vastly changing society have the essential values and competencies to deal with and surmount these challenges?  Alongside, and no longer in the shadow of our formal education system, voluntary youth organisations, youth clubs and community youth projects provide valuable opportunities for the social and personal development of young people.  Youth work is a non-formal educational process where young people acquire in a practical way the qualities and skills they need to realise their potential as individuals and as active and responsible members of their communities.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State with specific responsibility for youth affairs, I have endeavoured to secure resources to enhance and expand youth work provision.  Voluntary youth organisations, which provide the bulk of youth work opportunities through their network of clubs and volunteers, continue to receive substantial grant aid for their activities under the youth services grant scheme.</P>
      <P>I am particularly conscious of the special developmental needs of those young people who, for a variety of reasons, find themselves on the margins of society.  In 1996, I provided significant additional resources for this area, which benefited most of the projects, almost 200 in all, supported under the grant scheme for special projects to assist disadvantaged youth.  In addition, I was able to provide for the establishment of seven new special projects, the first ever expansion of this order since the scheme was introduced in 1988.</P>
      <P>I also examined the needs of youth information centres which, by providing young people with a wide range of information resources, promote personal autonomy and encourage active participation in society.  Two new centres received funding from my Department in 1996 and I provided additional financial support for the introduction of up-to-date computer systems throughout the network.  All these areas of youth service provision are in need of constant review and development.  In 1997, I intend to consolidate the expansion secured in 1996 and examine the scope for further improvement of the youth work services provided for our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> I am strongly of the view, however, that the provision of financial resources is not, in itself, sufficient to sustain the level and quality of youth services necessary to equip young people for the challenges and opportunities that are emerging as we reach the threshold of a new millennium. Since my appointment as Minister of State, the development of policy has been the central item on my youth work agenda.  It is vital for Ireland to get its youth work policy right for the simple reason that people under 25 years of age &mdash; 43 per cent of the population &mdash; represent a higher proportion of the inhabitants of this country than any other member of the EU.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that a legislative framework for the provision of these services is essential and am pleased to report to the House that work on a youth work Bill is now nearing completion.  I anticipate that the Bill will be published in a matter of weeks.  We are, therefore, on the brink of a new era as far as youth work is concerned.  The enactment of legislation for the development of youth work has been an aspiration since the early 1980s, and before much longer, this key mission should at last be accomplished.  The planned legislation should place our youth work services on a sound statutory footing and ensure the provision of comprehensive, high quality, effective and efficient youth work services.</P>
    <P>The importance of consultation has been borne out by the process which my officials and I undertook with youth organisations and other relevant bodies.  In addition, the usefulness of research was shown by the worthwhile learning gained from our examination of the legal and administrative framework for youth work in Northern Ireland and England.</P>
    <P>The desirability of a proper system of assessment of youth work was also highlighted by our work.  The proposed provisions for assessment in the planned legislation should support the development of good youth work practice, confirm that public funds expended on youth work services are spent efficiently and effectively and assist in attracting additional resources for youth work.  Our work also identified the need for a mechanism for consultation at national level and we propose to include provision in the legislation for the establishment of a national youth work advisory committee.  We intend that the committee should include nominees of the national body recognised as representing the views of the voluntary youth work organisations and nominees of all the relevant Departments.  The Bill will include regionalisation of the services in the truest sense.</P>
    <P>The service will not develop without safeguarding volunteerism, the bedrock of our youth service which plays such a significant strengthening role in the web of Irish society generally.  Our work affirmed our belief in partnership decision making at regional level between the statutory and voluntary sectors and our belief in significant representation in this context for voluntary youth councils of local voluntary youth work organisations. <Col N="1537" /> I believe that the legislation will help to demonstrate the value for money of youth work and will permit the provision, within available resources, of an optimum level of youth work services through a real partnership between the voluntary and statutory sectors.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Sport, I would now like to address the issues relating to this area of responsibility. Next Tuesday, 18 February, I will be publishing the national strategy for Irish sport.  This will be the culmination of over 12 months of the most intensive and extensive work carried out by the sports strategy group, under the chairmanship of John Treacy, and the officials of my Department. During the course of the year there were detailed discussions with the national governing bodies of sport, Departments and agencies, vocational education committees, local authorities and education interests.  In addition, public meetings were held where local clubs, volunteers and members of the public contributed to the process.  Over 300 written submissions were also received by the group.</P>
    <P>The strategy team also consulted the political parties in the preparation of the strategy document. When the strategy is published it will be seen that the views of the sports organisations, the social partners and the general public have been taken into account.  This process of consultation in the preparation of policy is totally without precedent in the history of Irish sport.  The strategy will map out the road ahead for the coordinated and effective development of sport into the next century.  It will help deliver a new deal for sport in Ireland.  It will set out new structures and procedures which will help ensure a greater involvement of all the sporting partners in the decision making process and will introduce a greater degree of openness and transparency in the funding of Irish sport.</P>
    <P>The extensive consultation which was carried out highlighted the special needs which exist in a number of areas in Irish sport.  The strong message which came through loud and clear from the people was that the area of children's sport, physical education and school sport is in need of special attention.  The strategy will propose a variety of measures to tackle this sector of Irish sport.  It will also outline measures which will enhance and strengthen the key role of the national governing bodies of sport; the early identification and ongoing support and development of our outstanding and elite sports people; the co-ordination, planning and provision of sports facilities; the training, qualifications and development of coaches and volunteers and the effective promotion and expansion of sport for all and recreational sport.  The Government has provided £1.6 million in this year's budget to enable work to begin on the implementation of the strategy.  This funding will enable me to put in place the structures and systems necessary so that the key elements of the strategy can be put into effect without delay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1538" /> The provision of this £1.6 million in addition to the moneys already allocated in the Estimates is a clear and positive indication of the Government's commitment to sport and to all those organisations, clubs and individuals in Irish sport at all levels, who contribute so much to our country and to our social and community development. This is a particularly challenging time for sport. There are many new demands and pressures coming from within and outside sport.  After a century of relative stability the old traditions and practices are being challenged and over-turned.  It is vital that sport is organised, strengthened and coordinated so it can operate effectively and positively in this new environment.</P>
    <P>We must achieve a balance between the essential role of the volunteer and the need for increased professionalism and efficiency in the administration and running of Irish sport.  We must fully appreciate and take on board the economic impact of sport and its huge potential in terms of sports tourism and job creation.  Sport also has a very important and significant role to play in the health and social well-being of our society.  A key element of the Irish Presidency of the EU was the tackling of drug abuse in society. As Minister of State with responsibility for sport, I introduced the role of sport in combating drug abuse, crime and social isolation, particularly among our young people.  I put this key role for sport onto the agenda at European Union level and I am determined it will remain at the centre of all future policy development in Europe.  Co-operation at community level between sports organisations, schools, youth services as well as other statutory and voluntary services can have a major effect in improving the quality of life, particularly of young people at risk.</P>
    <P>The provision of appropriate sports facilities, with funds being directed to special programmes, can result in young people becoming involved in a challenging, interesting way in positive activities to the advantage of the individual and community involved.  Sport plays a major part in the interests and activities of Irish people.  Our international competitors and teams have performed with honour and distinction throughout the world and have won many accolades on and off the field for their ability and qualities of sportsmanship and fair play.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sport for All&rdquo; remains at the core of our policies and initiatives and we seek constantly to achieve an ever increasing involvement in fun sport and healthy physical recreational activities. The development of the strategy has entailed a radical examination and critical review of every detail of our present system.  The work is built on wide consultation and research, including studies on the economic impact of sport in Ireland and the first ever national survey on participation in sport.  We have also studied sport systems in Europe and further afield.  I am confident that with this new coherent strategy the promotion and development of Irish sport will flourish in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the co-operation of my Cork colleague.</P>
      <P>As it is some considerable time since the Budget Statement was delivered in the House, it is appropriate to adopt a reflective approach to the question of budgetary procedure.  I rarely agree with Mr. Vincent Browne but on this issue I am in total agreement with his assertion that it was a farce.  It is time to change the basis on which it develops.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, there were reasons for secrecy as in olden days measures announced in the budget could materially affect the Stock Exchange and business decisions but that is no longer the case, the world has changed.  There is a need for openness and transparency rather than secrecy.  This applies to the budget as to almost every other issue.</P>
      <P>Budget secrecy is honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  It is no longer a one man operation; many parties and officials contribute to the process.  There is a need to radically change the procedures so that a draft budget is produced to be followed by an effective debate on the options available.  Any decisions announced in the draft budget would be crystallised on taking into account the views expressed in the debate. This would place an onus on parliamentarians to produce constructive rather than simplistic proposals. In suggesting changes they would specifically have to indicate how they would be financed, possibly by cutbacks in other areas.</P>
      <P>We should aim to have income tax rates of 45 per cent and 25 per cent in the next two to three years.  I am delighted that some progress was made in this direction in the budget in which the standard rate was reduced.  There are other changes I would be prepared to substitute, for example, service charges.  On balance I would favour further cuts in income tax but under current procedures that is not possible.</P>
      <P>In referring to people who pay income tax rates of 45 per cent and 25 per cent, I am not talking about financial fat-cats but the 500,000 people who pay tax at the top rate.  They should have more encouragement.  We should aim to have a system under which it would be a case of £1 for Caesar and £1 for the individual.  It would be necessary to cut the top rate of tax to achieve that biblical balance.</P>
      <P>I will refer to the reaction of the parties to the budget and focus on one specific area which has been given little publicity.  The Progressive Democrats, as usual, trotted out the old canards about the need for further cuts in public expenditure and had great ideas about what could be done with the extra money.  The phoney nature of their approach is illustrated by the fact that when it comes to focusing on the specific items to be cut they become very reticent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This can be seen clearly in their approach to the nurses' dispute.  On the one hand, there is the McDowell approach, that is, to keep the lid on public expenditure, and, on the other, the caring approach.  I am delighted the Government has <Col N="1540" /> accepted the decision of the Labour Court which is both fair and reasonable.  It appears to be the right formula but it involves an extra £80 million in expenditure.  It is, however, justified in this case.  In six months time the Progressive Democrats will still talk about the need to cut public expenditure.  That is a phoney approach, they cannot have their cake and eat it.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats remind me of a famous German Lutheran theologian in the early part of the century, Dietrich Bonhoeffer whose name became associated with the concept of &ldquo;cheap grace&rdquo;.  This was defined as an attempt to acquire the grace of God without making any effort.  The cheap rhetoric of the Progressive Democrats, in the context of their approach to politics and public expenditure, equates with cheap grace.  Unless they are prepared to focus on identifying specific items to be cut and take the political fall-out, they should stop trying to cod us.  Their cheap rhetoric, like cheap grace, is a debased and devalued commodity.  I wish to deal with Fianna Fáil's approach to the budget and to fiscal matters generally.  When I was elected to this House in the late 1970s, Martin O'Donoghue was the guru on fiscal matters.  We are only now recovering from the ill-effects of the infamous Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977 which advocated a policy of spend, spend, spend.</P>

      <P>When Fianna Fáil came to office at that time the national debt was £3,600 million.  This is more revisionism.  In six years it managed to treble the debt figure which then stood at £12,000 million.  Further increases were used to pay off the very high interest repayments at rates driven wild by inflation which was out of control.  That is the history of it.</P>

      <P>I will deal with Fianna Fáil's attitude to this budget.  If it had been fortunate enough to have been involved in the good management of the economy evident during the past few years and to confront the figures which faced this Government in January, the budget it would have introduced would not have been so different from this one.  That balanced approach was the way to proceed.  The people think this is a great budget.  There have been changes with increases in some areas and decreases in others.  However, Fianna Fáil would not have been in a position to produce this budget because we would not have had the stability that led to the figures that presented themselves during the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> I want to focus on the inability of Fianna Fáil to provide the stability that this country needs. We have a coalition Government.  We have had a number of them and we will have many more of them.  It is patently clear that the twice divorced Fianna Fáil Party is an utterly unsuitable partner for any other party and any coalition arrangement it might enter into would be inherently unstable.  That was proved in the past.  As the saying is, by their fruits ye shall know them.  That was the case when it was in partnership with the Progressive Democrats.  The comments made at the beef tribunal blew that partnership apart.  We all know the intransigent approach that led to the bust up of that partnership.  In the years ahead people will be faced with a choice of parties. There is no major difference between the economic or fiscal approaches of any of the parties in this House.  All parties are coming towards the centre, they may be centre, centre right or centre left.  It is important to be able to provide a stable Government, particularly in an era of coalition Government.  Fianna Fáil is inherently incapable of providing that.  That is its record on which it will be judged in the forthcoming election.</P>
    <P>The old mindset of Fianna Fáil became evident again in the past few weeks when I had a verbal tussle with an old friend, the Fianna Fáil Whip, Deputy Ahern.  He talked about the Progressive Democrats and said that, in any arrangement with that party, Fianna Fáil would be in the driving seat and any contribution by the Progressive Democrats would be very insignificant and that it would be an insignificant part of any coalition.  It reminded me of the famous Kanturk declaration of the former Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Reynolds, when he talked about the temporary little arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the mindset of Fianna Fáil and why it will not be able to provide stable Government.  Some people occasionally speak of the remote possibility of Fianna Fáil and Labour cosying up together again, but that was dealt with by the Fianna Fáil Front Bench.  A leading member of that Front Bench, the spokesperson on the environment, Deputy Dempsey, recently paid a visit to Cork and was asked about that possibility en route to a function.  He was very firm about it.  Asked about the Labour Party and its leader, Deputy Spring, he said that they have had a number of deals with him all of which he broke and that he certainly would not trust him in a political context.  That is the basis on which Fianna Fáil suggests and will be suggesting it is a suitable partner for a future coalition Government.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> Apart from the Ministers involved, most Deputies do not take any notice of one aspect of our economy of particular concern to me for historical reasons and because I come from a coastal constituency &mdash; the standard of our fishing fleet which is very old.  Only 6 per cent of our fishing fleet is under ten years old, 24 per cent of it is more than 30 years old and 11 per cent is more than 40 years old.  That applies particularly to our white fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>The mackerel fishing fleet off the north west coast has been modernised and is one of the best in Europe but the white fishing fleet which is much larger and more centred off the south and south-west coast is, by European standards, very out of date.  That creates problems not only in terms of the fish catch but also from the point of view of safety.  The year 1995 was disastrous for our fishing fleet.  Many ships were lost and 19 fishermen were lost at sea.  This problem cannot be ignored.  It is being tackled and the report of the fishing vessel safety review group was submitted. The white fishing fleet must be renewed.  It will involve the purchase of new or good second-hand vessels.  Finance must be made available to fund the renewal of that fishing fleet.  I am not calling for a Government handout.  Such renewal could be financed by grants.  Three to four months ago I prepared a scheme, presented it to BIM and asked it to consider it from the point of view of establishing a business expansion scheme to fund new vessels which would not impose a major cost on the Exchequer other than foregoing the tax on a BES scheme.  Given that there are other such schemes, why can one not be set up to renew our fishing fleet?  By providing grants and/or a business expansion scheme we can begin the necessary process of renewing our white fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>I got some publicity for that proposal and I was delighted Fianna Fáil put forward a fishing proposal yesterday that incorporated this idea.  It can learn.  I agree with it on this idea about which I have spoken for months.  I will be happy if it is incorporated in its policy paper on this area.  The renewal of our white fishing fleet will be an ongoing process and I ask that this area be addressed.</P>

I am slightly amused also that his strong views in relation to the fishing industry were not reflected definitively in the budget.</P>
      <P>The budget debate provides an annual opportunity to evaluate the performance of Government and to assess its vision &mdash; an important word in any country &mdash; as reflected in its budget.  The performance of the Government is at best unspectacular.  Its vision is but a mish-mash of ideas from the minor parties in the coalition.  This is not surprising as the Taoiseach's sole priority seems to be self-preservation.  He is apparently prepared to sacrifice whatever economic priorities his own party might have for the expedient of personal survival.</P>
      <P>Loyalty to a principle is not this Taoiseach's strong suit.  In the past he had the reputation of being dull and colourless, but decent.  He is indisputably dull and colourless in his role as Taoiseach, but his decency is obviously more a softness to capitulate to the demands of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Taoiseach, Deputy &ldquo;Brutal&rdquo; Bruton, is not a man with whom I am impressed.  As he made clear in the Dáil last week, he is not my best friend, and I rejoice in that.  He was the avowed best friend of Deputy Lowry until it became expedient to cut him adrift. <Col N="1544" /> What kind of vision or performance can be expected from a Government led by this man? Unclear vision and muddled management is what you would expect, and the budget is clear testimony that that is what we are getting from this brutal Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister, Deputy Quinn, commissioned a report on how it could be implemented and then there was a report setting out the Government's response to the report on the Culliton Report.  At the end of the day, we had a report on a report on a report, a classic Labour fudge.  It did not like the central theme of the report which was less taxes, less Government and, consequently, less interference in people's lives.</P>
      <P>In 1996 this Government was presented with a major strategic report on the economy by Forfás. The report is a credit to the team who prepared it.  One of its central themes &mdash; again &mdash; is less taxes, less Government and, consequently, less interference in people's lives.  What has happened to this report?  I asked the Taoiseach this morning if there were any legislative or non-legislative proposals in response to this report from the Government, but all I got was fudge.</P>
      <P>The Culliton and Forfás reports make the point that servicing our national debt is absorbing too much of our tax revenues.  In 1996 over half the income taxes raised were spent in this way.  The solution that Culliton and Forfás put forward was to reduce the national debt thereby freeing tax revenues to allow tax rates to be lowered but this Government ignored the advice.  We all know that taxes are flowing into the Government's coffers, but it should stop spending it like it is going out of fashion.  The Government cannot believe its luck; it has got its hands on the loot and is blowing it like snuff at a wake.  Remember, it is not the Government's money, it has been entrusted to it by the people for the specific purpose of forging their destiny, not the Government's. The taxpayers themselves know how best to spend this money.  Why not control public spending and really reduce taxes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> This Government cannot resist the temptation to spend.  Whenever anyone has the audacity to point this out to the Government, the stock response is &ldquo;But what would you cut?&rdquo;  This is the response of a Government that is totally out of its depth.</P>
    <P>It is not as if we are getting value for money for the billions it is overspending.  The Government is like a spending junkie that has deluded itself into believing it can spend its way back into Government. I challenge the Government to study the fact that every major western economy is reducing state interference in people's lives.  They are reducing spending and taxes, so why is the Government going in the opposite direction? This patchwork quilt coalition is piggybacking on the sound financial management of previous Fianna Fáil Administrations.  Let us face it, the economy did not become successful the day after the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, stabbed Deputy Bertie Ahern and Deputy Albert Reynolds in the back.</P>

      <P>The truth is hard to take at times.  Successive Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, such as former Deputies Charles J. Haughey and Ray MacSharry and Deputy Bertie Ahern, had the vision to take the necessary, if sometimes most unpopular, action to put the basics in place and permit the economy to realise its potential.  The growth we are now experiencing is no accident, nor is it due to the spending excesses of the present Administration.  It takes time for the seed to develop and grow.</P>
      <P>It is downright insulting to people's intelligence to hear the continual bragging of Government backbenchers and Ministers who claim they are personally responsible &mdash; by working their fingers to the bone &mdash; for reducing the dole queues and getting our economy to grow.  How insulting and naive.  The Government seems to be rewriting history and, in the process, ignoring the great vision and strategies of its predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All economic commentators agree that the economy is experiencing an amazing period of growth.  We are going through a golden age; an unusual and unprecedented economic period.  It was brought to my attention recently that if the Government had managed to curtail its spending frenzy to 2 per cent above the level of inflation it would now have £1.6 billion to spare.  That is a huge amount of money.  If any economic commentator or financial guru wants to challenge that, I will take him on.  The former Minister for Finance, Ritchie Ryan, would have given his eye teeth back in 1977 to have had such an amount, or even to have had the opportunity of releasing it back into the economy.  The Government of which he was a member would probably have <Col N="1546" /> been re-elected, irrespective of what Deputy O'Keeffe said.</P>
    <P>What concerns me most is the haste with which our economic commentators, financial experts and stockbroker elite rush to the barricades to praise the budget.  I am only a humble graduate of the 1970s UCD school of economics, nevertheless I challenge them in that regard.  One would have thought it was their professional duty to challenge the reckless and irresponsible overspending of so many Government Departments. We have phenomenal growth, almost zero inflation and money is pouring in from Europe at a rate never before experienced and never likely to be repeated.  It is not coming in buckets or in oil tankers, it is coming in shiploads.  In this context the Government had a clear duty to take a radical step in the management of our economy.</P>

      <P>The professionals, to whom I referred earlier, had an even clearer duty to publicly challenge the Government on its abject failure.  Last night, and again this morning, I trawled through the daily papers and the Sunday editions that were published from budget day onwards.  Apart from a serious article on tax reform in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, an article by Mark O'Connor in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> in which he said it was hardly a give-away budget and that it failed where it should have succeeded, and Kevin Daly's headline that economists' warnings should be heeded, I have yet to find any serious debate in the print media challenging the folly of this budget.</P>
      <P>Having £1.6 billion to spare would have created the long-awaited opportunity to radically reform our tax system.  Four out of five of our people could now be paying tax at 25 per cent.  The top rate of tax could have been reduced.  Incentives could have been given to businesses to expand and create jobs, especially for those who go straight from school into the jobs market and who are neglected and, in some cases, end up turning to drugs.  The Government could have dealt with pensioners and carers in a meaningful way.  It could have dealt with those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves on social welfare. The marginalised, the poor, the socially excluded could have had their quality of life significantly improved if the Government really cared.</P>
      <P>The Conference of Religious of Ireland aptly put it in their response that the Government had the resources to impact dramatically on poverty unemployment and exclusion &mdash; any financial guru who denies it is telling lies; that in the interests of the common good different choices should and could have been made to reduce social exclusion; that a golden opportunity has been lost and that the divisions in our society will deepen as a result of this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> Why did this reasonable policy with 2 per cent growth in expenditure, obviously favoured by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, not materialise? Was it bad policy making, bad management, bad choice of options?  I have no doubt the Department of Finance tried its best to dissuade the Ministers from the minority parties from overspending, but what can the public service do at the end of the day with personalities like the Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, the man who thought he could broker peace in Northern Ireland but has floundered without the guidance of Deputy Albert Reynolds, and whose party puts the rights of criminals above those of law abiding citizens; Deputy Pat Rabbitte, the man with the fictitious letter that would rock the foundations of the State; Deputy Nora Owen, the Minister for vanishing portfolios; Deputy Brendan Howlin, the man who was advised to set up a tribunal but who said that he knew better; Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach, the great and formidable rezoner of education and Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, the man who is hiding his excessive spending behind a charade of cracking down on fraud?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, has a vision.  I do not mind admitting it publicly. However, in this budget, his vision has been slaughtered on the altar of election expediency. Can anybody imagine any of these monstrous egos taking advice from public servants on an issue as sensitive as controlling public spending? This Government did not take the advice of Culliton, of Forfás, or of its public servants.  As a result, the taxpaying public are paying too much tax.</P>
    <P>This Government has failed in its management of the economy.  It has also failed in its desperate attempts to cover up its mismanagement.  This Government has been driven from the back seat. It is no wonder they trip over each other to praise their Fine Gael colleagues and the wonderful leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton. What leadership?  Public transport workers are being asked to surrender thousands of pounds from their individual pay packets without knowing the strategy being proposed for their employers and their industry.  Nurses almost went on strike for the first time in the history of the State because they were reckoned to be a soft touch.  A Minister is forced to resign because of dubious financial arrangements, and the Taoiseach, his forever friend, with the support of certain high profile journalists, is seen to unashamedly defend his actions.</P>
    <P>Is this the real cosy cartel?  Taxpayers are being ripped off because of excessive Government spending.  I firmly believe this budget was drafted not by the Minister, not by the Taoiseach &mdash; I have said not by the Tánaiste, although I have a suspicion it was &mdash; but by the Tánaiste's spin doctors with an eye to the opinion polls.</P>
    <P>It is time to call an end to the photo opportunities for Ministers, to call an end to the mad scramble to give some sort of good news to the <Col N="1548" /> press every day.  The Government is deluding itself in hoping that the opinion polls will eventually move in its direction.  They will not.  The voters can see the Government for what it is, a Government of monstrous egos.  Everybody in it wants to lead but none of them knows where to go.  They should go to the country now and let the people have the final say on their reckless, irresponsible overspending Administration.</P>

      <P>I, in common with previous speakers, condemn the atrocity in south Armagh. Coming from a Border area that has harboured the hope of peace in recent years, this is a shattering example of what we face in that region.</P>
      <P>A valid criticism that we on this side of the House could make about the budget relates to the Government continuing to increase our national debt, now in excess of £30 billion.  With the availability of additional funding, there should have been a commitment not to borrow any further.  The time has come for the Government to peg the debt at £30 billion.  Until 1973 the books were balanced at budget time.  The previous speaker on the Government side spoke about what Fianna Fáil borrowed, but the really heavy borrowing happened between 1982 and 1987 when the debt was increased from £12 billion to £24 billion.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned the provision of jobs should be the priority of any Government.  The Government Ministers, the Taoiseach included, are making great play of job creation, but jobs are not being created in the region I represent.  Jobs are being created in a very selective way.  During the budget debate the Minister for Finance said that 100,000 jobs had been created and that unemployment had fallen by 31,000.  My constituency has a static population. The population of one of the counties increased a little between the last two censuses while that in the other dropped by 100.  Despite that static population, between 1 January 1995, nearly in line with the Government coming into power, and 31 December 1996, 402 more people have registered as unemployed in Monaghan and 49 more in Cavan.  From the time this Government went into power until December unemployment in County Monaghan increased from 3,073 to 3,475.</P>

      <P>How many people have come into the workforce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1549" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few.  How could people come into the workforce when the population remains static?  Over the past two years there has been much talk about reconstruction.  There was the famous Washington Conference and partnerships and strategic alliances were set up with North American firms, but unemployment has increased.  This region has hosted many meetings, conferences, lunches, photo-calls and interviews in the past two years.  Ministers' Mercedes cars were as common as school buses in the Border counties yet Ministers have delivered nothing.</P>
      <P>The Border region has good reason to fear a Fine Gael-Labour based coalition Government. In 1983 duty on petrol was increased resulting in the closure of petrol stations and devastating the retail grocery trade in places like Belturbet and Clones, which became ghost towns.  There was a similar hike of over 11p on a gallon of petrol in this budget.  This region was returning to normality due to action taken by Ray MacSharry and other Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance after it was returned to power in 1987.</P>
      <P>This Government has presided over the demise of the pig slaughtering and processing industry, which provided much employment.  There is no pig processing plant in the six Border counties. Hundreds of job have been lost in an area where 0.5 million pigs are produced annually, although they have been created in Newry and Belfast.  The Government and State agencies have done nothing to rectify the situation.</P>
      <P>Between 1994 and June 1996 the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael Higgins, provided £9 million to County Galway for cultural development initiatives and schemes. He has not given one penny to Cavan-Monaghan for projects put forward.  The recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, about group water schemes was unwise and ill-advised.  The £5 million plus the £10 million block grant he proposes to allocate for the takeover of group water schemes would be sufficient for only half a dozen counties.  Half that figure could be used in Cavan-Monaghan alone.</P>
      <P>Group water schemes were set up voluntarily and have ensured that most rural households have an adequate supply of running water.  With higher quality standards, many schemes needed to have treatment plants installed.  Water has been provided at a reasonable cost and the management of group water schemes are loath to hand them over to local authorities in the knowledge that prices will increase substantially.  I formed a small group water scheme, read meters and paid the county council.  All manual and clerical work was done free of charge.  It was a great community effort, the decision of the Minister for the Environment is wrong and he should reconsider it.  The response to a parliamentary question I tabled indicated that the Minister had no contact with local authorities or group water schemes in advance of making this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> Despite Ministers and State agencies trying to put a brave face on the economy of the Border counties, the figures speak for themselves.  IDA-supported companies claim to have created 13,179 jobs in 1996, 100 of which were in three counties in the north east &mdash; Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  While there was a 16.4 per cent increase in the east, there was an 11.4 per cent reduction in the north east.  Only one other region, north west Donegal, showed a slight reduction.  If funding is available, why is it not being used to better advantage by the State agencies involved to prevent an increase in unemployment and a reduction in our workforce?  The IDA announced a total of 17,725 new jobs in 1996. Connacht-Ulster, which receives so much lip-service from the Government, commanded only 152 jobs, less than a 0.85 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach appointed a Minister of State to prepare a report on funding arrangements in the Border region which was published in July 1996. I welcomed that report because I pressed the Taoiseach to carry out such a study.  Now that he has the figures, he should act on them.  The report states that the operational programme, 1994-9, and INTERREG, 1994-9, provided £9 million for the six Border counties for major investment planned projects, none of which was in County Monaghan.  Some £924,000 was allocated to Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Louth for cross-Border business and cultural links under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund. From that allocation, the four counties with the worst performance in terms of job creation, Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo and Leitrim, received less than 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>A company in County Monaghan applied for a grant to generate electricity from waste, which was expected to be successful.  Fianna Fáil introduced a scheme but with the change of Government, this area was neglected.  The idea is to generate electricity from farm waste.  Some 30 megawatts have been set aside for a competition in which there are a number of applicants.  We understood we would be heavily involved in this but others had taken the lead.  I appeal to TDs and Senators in the constituency who have been vocal in other areas to make their voices heard and ensure counties Monaghan and Cavan are successful in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> Deputy Leonard referred to the national debt. The rot started in 1977 with the promises made by Fianna Fáil in Government &mdash; Mr. Martin O'Donoghue gave a commitment to eliminate unemployment and Mr. Jack Lynch promised that if it went above 100,000 it was a resigning matter.  Jack Lynch did not resign, he was pushed out.  Perhaps Deputy Fitzgerald who made an extremely wild bombastic speech, full of waffle, which signified little and who was involved in a later push against Mr. Charles Haughey will give us some information on what was happening behind the scenes in Fianna Fáil at the time.  Certainly it was not of any benefit to the economy and nothing was done to reduce the national debt or unemployment, both of which increased enormously.</P>
    <P>This is a good Government and it has tackled unemployment.  Some 100,000 jobs were created in the past two years.  That is a sign of prudent management of the economy.  The wild statements by Deputy Fitzgerald conceal the lack of ideas and vision of his party on the economy and on unemployment.  They conceal the pain that Fianna Fáil does not have its hands on the levers of power when the economy is doing so well, so that it could dole out the taxpayers' money to its cronies in various sectors of the construction industry and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have had prudent management of the economy, which is now probably the strongest economy in the European Union and one of the strongest in the world, an economy which fulfils all of the Maastricht criteria of low inflation, high growth, high productivity, increased exports and a strong currency in the international arena.  We are known as the Celtic tiger on the world map and our debt ratio, this year alone, is reducing at a rate of 8 per cent in the GDP debt ratio.  We are now close to the 60 per cent rate which is the requirement at the end of the century for the first tier of European countries in terms of the Maastricht criteria and bonding Europe together in the economic market.</P>
    <P>All of this has been done while we have maintained spending in all the critical areas such as education, health and in respect of the homeless, the old, the disabled and the unemployed.  What would happen if the Progressive Democrats &mdash; the new partner for Fianna Fáil &mdash; was in power? It has only one objective, to cut the tax rate from 48 per cent to 40 per cent in one fell swoop for the better off who do not have to think about job losses, endemic unemployment and the cost of education, health and so on, and to reduce the standard rate to 20 per cent.  It is the wolf at the door and let us keep it away as long as possible.</P>
    <P>Some £12 million has been allocated to services for the mentally handicapped and the disabled, this includes increases which had been unheard of in previous Administrations.  Under the back to work allowance scheme 100 jobs have been specifically earmarked for the disabled and there is a commitment to have 3 per cent in employment <Col N="1552" /> in all public services by the end of the year. More money than ever before has been provided to reduce hospital waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In education, the number of changes in recent years has been phenomenal.  The early start scheme for pre-school children, operated on a pilot basis, has proved successful.  Under the breaking the cycle scheme there has been a focused targeting on areas of disadvantage and where the pupil teacher ratio has been reduced from 50:1 to 25 or 26:1 in blackspot areas it is proving a phenomenal success.  It has been done on the advice of the Combat Poverty Agency and we hope it can be extended as more funds become available.</P>
    <P>Free fees have been introduced at third level and this has opened up education at all levels. There have been many innovations in curriculum development.  New leaving certificate courses have been put in place and the transition year, which is a unique innovation in the education world, has been introduced across the board. Other countries in the international arena are looking to this as a model for their education systems and at how our education system compares and is reflected in the jobs market in the multinational companies who locate here largely because of the perception that we have an attractive, well educated, intelligent, young workforce. This results in no small measure from the prudent funding of the various sectors of education in the past two years.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare benefits have been increased by 4 per cent, more than twice the rate of inflation. The family income supplement has been extended considerably, based on net rather than gross income.  The rate for child benefit which has doubled in the past two years has been maintained. Those who find it difficult to manage their lives are receiving substantial supports.</P>
    <P>In terms of the environment &mdash; Deputy Leonard referred to the potholes in Cavan and Monaghan &mdash; the Minister for the Environment has provided £750 million over a five year period for non-national roads.  Deputy Leonard did not refer to this funding which will solve the pothole problem in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>The Government has eliminated service charges which had to be introduced as a result of the recklessness of Fianna Fáil in 1977.  It took much courage and vision to deal with this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for protecting me from the Deputies opposite. This is an eminently capable Government and it will deal with all issues in time.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this positive and prudent budget which will ensure that the economy continues to progress.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has made the biggest ever investment in the economy.  This has been achieved within the context of a planned budget surplus, which is expected to continue in 1998 and 1999. Critics, some of whom are on the benches opposite, said this could not be achieved but the Government has proven them wrong.  Since 1994 more than 100,000 new jobs have been created, while an unprecedented 25,000 people have been taken off the live register during the past six months.  It is important to acknowledge that there are now more people at work than at any time in the past.</P>
      <P>The Minister has increased child benefit by 50 per cent over the past three years.  While the budget will stimulate growth in the economy I am concerned that it will not be distributed evenly. The measures in the budget will enable us to continue the attack on the scourge of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment which must be kept at the top of the agenda.  Many parts of my constituency suffer from a high level of unemployment. In addition, communities are being devastated by the scourge of hard drugs.  Many communities have taken it upon themselves to fight drug pushers.  These mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and children are guarding their communities against drug barons and deserve the support of the local authorities, the Garda and other State agencies in doing this.  However, this support has been slow in forthcoming in many instances.  These communities have little or no resources, yet they are prepared to take on drug pushers.  We must listen to what they say and build on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has taken a number of measures in the war against drug pushers.  I particularly welcome the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau which has specific powers to take decisive action against professional criminals and drug barons.  We must ensure that drug barons who seemed up to recently to enjoy their ill-gotten gains with impunity are properly dealt with.  The assets and property seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau must be placed in a special fund which is targeted solely towards the fight against drugs.  In my constituency houses owned by drug pushers had to be taken off the market after the intervention of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The equine centre in County Kildare owned by Mr. Gilligan, the self-confessed prime suspect in the assassination of Veronica <Col N="1554" /> Guerin, and similar assets which would yield only a limited return on the open market &mdash; many people would not like to buy property owned by drug pushers &mdash; should be held by the State and transferred to, say, the Department of Health which could use them as centres for the socially deprived or disabled or as drug treatment centres. These are the sort of measures which must be taken if the public is to be satisfied that we are deeply concerned about the drugs problem and willing to fight it.  In cases where money is seized it must be used for the benefit of the local community to lift morale.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, to extend the local employment service to Ballyfermot which recently lost the very valuable Semperit factory which employed approximately 600 people.  Even though Walsh Western International recently opened a factory which employs 100 people, there is a great need for further industry in the area.  The local employment service will be an added boost to the area as it will focus directly on the long-term unemployed.  The resources of the State agencies will be pooled to provide guidance, training and job placement services for those seeking work.  I very much welcome this development.</P>
    <P>This is the best budget ever introduced by a Minister for Finance.  The economy is in good hands and I hope this will continue in 1988, 1999 and into the next millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Costello for sharing his time.  Unlike him, I will not devote much time to political point scoring or referring to what happened in the past, except to say that I believe all those involved in politics accept that the 1977 manifesto was a disaster.  Even though they do not say so publicly, I believe Fianna Fáil Deputies privately accept this.  The economy is recovering from that diabolical manifesto which offered the nation a bribe which it accepted. However, this is water under the bridge.</P>
      <P>This is an outstanding budget and acknowledged as such by all independent observers.  It is stated that a rising tide lifts all boats.  The tide is now at a very high level and all parties have shared in the benefits provided by it.  We have the best economy in Europe and it is only nitpickers who could find fault with the budget.</P>
      <P>I regret the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to abolish stamp duty on houses under £50,000.  In recent years there has been a decrease in the building of local authority houses and greedy landlords have been the beneficiaries of the enormous sums of money made available through housing subsidies.  We all know who they are, they are in every town in the country.  I am concerned that those vultures can get away with charging single parents £100 to rent their houses. That is unfortunate but it is typical of human nature and the practice is widespread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has the highest level of home ownership in Europe.  It is nice to see a young couple <Col N="1555" /> buying their own home but it is a costly exercise in terms of taking on a large mortgage.  Stamp duty is often an impediment to buying a second hand house and I hope that problem will be addressed in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>To be parochial, I regret the refusal of the Department of Education to sanction the extension to the De La Salle College in Dundalk.  I do not understand the reason behind that and I have made a personal plea to the Taoiseach in that regard.  Considering the amount of money spent on County Meath, it is natural for the people of County Louth, who have experienced difficult economic circumstances for many years, to look askance at the money spent on adjoining counties.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy that one of the leading colleges in Dundalk has been by-passed.  I was certain the college would be given approval for the extension because of its continuing success over a 20 year period.  One class is currently being held in a coal shed.  That is a disgrace and I appeal for the decision to be overturned on educational and common sense grounds.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to support the proposal to establish a ferry service across Carlingford Lough between Greenore in County Louth and Cranfield in County Down.  This project is supported by the east Border committee which comprises the county councils of Monaghan, Louth, Newry and Mourne.  Unfortunately, the proposal is meeting some resistance from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  This ferry service would link the scenic areas of the Mourne countryside with the Cooley Peninsula.  It would also be a means of strengthening ties between the two counties, North and South.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the social welfare aspect of this budget.  We all want a caring society but, despite the country's economic success, I wonder about the direction in which we are going.  All Deputies are aware of the break up of family units and the staggering increase in the numbers of single parents, some of whom are little more than children.  The problem has now reached crisis level but can it be said that we are creating a caring society when we pay these girls to be promiscuous?  I am not a moralist but I believe society is heading into an abyss.  In ten to 20 years brothers will be marrying sisters because of the dreadful problems in society today.</P>
    <P>I do not begrudge single mothers payment from the State but it should be limited to two children, not five or six.  In doing that we are encouraging promiscuity under the guise of a caring concept.  I question that caring concept.  All political parties should be aware of this problem which is of national concern.  They should agree on a common policy to address what will become the major problem facing our society.</P>
    <P>Two months ago the management of a leading Dundalk factory expressed concern to me about difficulty in getting workers.  Over the past 20 years unemployment in Dundalk has been double <Col N="1556" /> the national average.  Those figures are unacceptable.  A person visiting the supplementary welfare offices is met with queues forming outside the doors, yet the management of this factory cannot attract workers to the plant.  That is alarming.</P>
    <P>People are not prepared to take up employment and instead of creating a caring society we are creating a lazy one.  A boy or girl of 18 years of age should not be given £65 per week to do nothing.  They should be required to work and, if they refuse, they should lose their social welfare payment.  Every Deputy knows that what I am saying is correct.</P>
    <P>There must be a limit on social welfare payments. People should be rewarded for work.  In that context I welcome several of the initiatives taken recently because they are pro-work.  I welcome also the return of the work ethos in social welfare policies.</P>
    <P>The initiatives that will be of benefit include the increase in funding for the back-to-work allowance scheme which will embrace a greater level of participants in the scheme.  The scheme encourages unemployed persons to resume employment or become self-employed and gradually wean off their dependence on social welfare support while, at the same time, retaining a proportion of their primary entitlements and all secondary benefits such as medical cards.</P>
    <P>Any scheme that encourages and rewards work is a boost to the economy while restoring dignity to the unemployed person who can engage in worthwhile economic activity.  It also offers an alternative to persons engaging in the black economy while remaining on gradual social welfare payments, leading eventually to full participation in society.</P>
    <P>The deployment of additional funding to the partnership boards in each of the core urban areas identified in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress in another pro-work initiative that should be applauded.  For those at work earning medium to moderate wages, the social welfare system can be a disincentive to remain in employment as the net effect of PRSI and PAYE deductions can have the serious effect of lowering net take home pay to a level just above or equal to the equivalent social welfare rate.  To address that problem, the Minister has reduced the PRSI rate for those employees by 1 per cent and for the employer by half of 1 per cent.  Allied to the PAYE reduction of 1 per cent, this serves to broaden the wedge of take-home pay for those on equivalent social welfare rates.  The increase in the threshold for family income supplement and the alteration from a gross to a net basis in the assessment for this allowance is also a useful incentive to keep people at work and to encourage those on social welfare to resume employment, even on a part time basis.</P>
    <P>I also welcome certain aspects of the new measures which help to alleviate poverty and encourage a caring society for the elderly.  Of particular significance in this regard are the changes <Col N="1557" /> in the eligibility conditions and increases in payment for those in our society who are required by necessity to care for more than one elderly relative or friend.  The carer's allowance is a much needed payment which recognises the contribution made by many people in our society who choose to stay at home and care for their elderly and incapacitated relatives.  The improvement in the rates of payment signals that social welfare policy is leaning towards a more caring society.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my Budget Statement, the Government is studying the appropriate corporation tax structure for the long-term, bearing in mind the importance of the 10 per cent rate for inward investment and the International Financial Services Centre.  I am conscious of the need to clarify this issue at an early date and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in due course.  Under present legislation, the 10 per cent rate is due to continue until the end of 2005 in the case of the IFSC and until the end of 2010 in the case of manufacturing industry generally.  The primary objective of the review which is currently under way is to provide for a corporation tax structure after these deadlines which will ensure that Ireland remains a competitive location for <Col N="1558" /> internationally mobile investment.  The review will also take due account of the importance of maintaining the very constructive and good relations which we have enjoyed with our tax treaty partners abroad.  The particular concerns which other EU member states have raised up to now in regard to our existing corporate tax regime have been addressed generally in the context of the established tax treaty provisions with such countries and it is intended that this will continue to be the case in so far as the tax regime post 2005 and 2010 is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter concerns a large number of companies and I am sure the Minister received representations from IBEC in this regard.  Large multinationals make decisions years in advance and some industries have a long lead-in timescale.  While the years 2005 and 2010 may appear to be a long time away for many of us, that is not the case for multinational companies who must start planning now for those years. What is the Government's strategy on this matter? Will it approach the Commission on the basis that it can be decided under our taxation policy or will the concerns of the Commission and other countries, who regard our tax structure as a State aid, be taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Two separate but related tax rates apply.  The rate that will apply up to 2005, with specific reference to SFADCo and the IFSC, is regarded by the Commission as a State aid and a derogation was obtained.  The general rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing and internationally traded services is not a State aid.  It has been our rate of corporation tax for many years.  We are conscious of the concerns in the multinational and indigenous sectors and of the demands from non-10 per cent paying companies to address the issue to facilitate medium to long-term planning. We are in the process of formulating a strategy but have not yet concluded its components.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister's phrase &ldquo;in due course&rdquo; radically different from &ldquo;in the next two months&rdquo; which I read in the newspapers recently in terms of when a document in this regard will be published?  Does he agree it is important, as IBEC has suggested, to show incoming industry that we are committed to applying rates as close as possible to the current base rate?  Does he agree we must engage in a substantial overhaul of the ordinary corporation tax rate to place ourselves within shouting distance of a uniform rate that would not be significantly different from the rates that already obtain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope &ldquo;in due course&rdquo; is as soon as possible.  As I believe in forward planning, I would like to be in a position to publish the document in two months.  Irrespective of the final position, our objective is to apply a corporate tax rate as close as possible to the current base rate of 10 <Col N="1559" /> per cent.  Corporation tax has been reduced by one-third for more than 50 per cent of companies who paid 40 per cent corporation tax when the Deputy's party was last in office.  The tax rate that applies to companies reporting profits of £50,000 or less will reduce to 28 per cent after 6 April.  In the course of three budgets we have reduced the corporate tax rate by one-third for primarily small and medium sized Irish companies.  We are moving in the right direction and I would like to maintain that momentum.</P>

      <P>It would be a foolish politician who would.  Has the Minister noted recent comments by the German Finance Minister, and others, who are casting envious glances at our corporation tax rate?  The German Minister for Finance more or less implied that the matter should be considered as part of European Monetary Union discussions?  He wants the matter examined in the short-term.  This has sounded alarm bells for people who invest here as well those who operate here.  I urge the Minister to review the matter as quickly as possible and give clear signals in this regard.  As large numbers of people are employed by these companies, the matter is of national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments of my colleague, the German Minister for Finance, should be set in the context of the domestic politics in Germany.  A coalition of parties, that included his, defeated my sister party, the SPD, on a claim that Germany could be reunified without increasing taxes.  That proved a lie for the Conservative Party in Britain and, consequently, corporate and general taxation rates in Germany are high.  They are now trying to address that problem and, in doing so, referring to other European Union countries.</P>
      <P>I accept the validity of the claim of prospective investors already located here who are contemplating expansion and the indigenous sector, both the 10 per cent and the non-10 per cent, that they need some sense of certainty in so far as any Government can provide it.  It is my intention to provide that and I would like to be in a position to do it within two months or something of that order, but within a short timeframe, not an openended one.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the deadline of 2005 must be urgently addressed?  Having a standard Irish tax rate of 10 per cent for financial services could be one way of dealing with the domestic and international financial service markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, does the European Union regard the 10 per cent manufacturing rate as a <Col N="1560" /> matter which need not be addressed on an EU level in 2010, except in the context of the general alignment of tax rates?  Is it, therefore, possible that we could have a general tax rate of 10 per cent on financial services in the Irish economy from 2005 onwards?  Is that one way of addressing that problem without prejudice to the general issue of what happens five years later?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The 10 per cent rate which applies to the IFSC and Shannon, where the level of activity is small, is specifically recognised by the Commission as a State aid.  The status of the 2010 deadline is in a different category.  I would have to take advice and examine the implications of what the Deputy proposes.  As we move closer to market harmonisation, the Commission would have a strong view on all taxation issues.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the way in which he proposes to meet the commitments laid down in Partnership 2000 in relation to keeping current Government spending increased as close as possible to 2 per cent in real terms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4008/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The limits on expenditure growth set out in Partnership 2000 are an integral part of a balanced fiscal policy which will promote the continued growth over the medium term of a strong, competitive economy.  As the Deputy is aware, in my Budget Statement I said that constraining the growth of public expenditure will be central to achieving the Government's medium term budgetary goals.  I acknowledged that, to date, we have not been as effective in this area as we would wish and that it is essential to improve our performance.  The key to making this improvement is to manage expenditure properly in a medium term budgetary framework.  Work on creating that framework has been under way for some time.</P>
      <P>The way to manage public expenditure better is to implement the wide-ranging programme of financial reforms set out in &ldquo;Delivering Better Government&rdquo;.  This will involve moving to a devolved, medium term approach to expenditure which will underline the primary responsibility of spending Departments for managing their expenditure programmes within settled allocations and taking accountability for the results achieved.  We need to settle expenditure priorities and to examine the rationale for existing programmes in changing circumstances.  To meet this need, I announced in the budget that a rolling programme of expenditure reviews will begin this year.  This will lead to evaluation over a three year period of all major departmental spending programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second key step is to create the medium term budgetary framework within which expenditure will be managed.  I announced in the 1996 <Col N="1561" /> budget the introduction of a multi-annual planning framework designed to assist the Government, in settling the annual budget, including its expenditure dimension, in taking account of the medium term budgetary effects.  The first steps in this initiative were taken during 1996, culminating in the publication with this year's budget of projections for 1998 and 1999 of the main budgetary aggregates based on the provision of the existing levels of service and of the additional Partnership 2000 commitments on spending and taxation. Further development of the multi-annual budgetary approach is now under way and the intention is to publish expenditure projections for 1999 and 2000 with the 1998 budget based on existing levels of service disaggregated to Vote Group level.</P>
    <P>Multi-annual budgeting will put in place a strategic expenditure control framework under which there will be agreement on overall expenditure limits.  Settling departmental financial allocations will act as a major incentive for Departments to improve the management of programmes, to reorder priorities and to ensure that value for money is obtained.  Under the new system the Government will retain its responsibility for settling the annual Estimates.  The ultimate responsibility for ensuring that spending remains within the Partnership 2000 limits rests with the Government and it is determined to meet that responsibility. A significant reduction in the rate of growth of public expenditure since 1990 will be required.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Government is determined to meet the targets for public expenditure growth set out in Partnership 2000 and we are already advanced in designing and constructing the necessary improved arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it mean that gross current spending can increase by 20 per cent, as happened over the life of this Government, as against a cumulative inflation rate of 6 rate which certainly does not amount to 2 per cent in real terms?  What is the Minister's interpretation of &ldquo;as close as possible to 2 per cent in real terms&rdquo;? Does it mean an overspend of 0.5 per cent or does it mean anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It means precisely what it says, as close as possible to 2 per cent.  That is what the real growth should be and no more.  Adhering to that target has not been possible for reasons which I have stated on a number of occasions in this House.  I await suggestions from critics on the other side as to where cuts could be made to achieve that target.  No one would for one second suggest that it is an easy task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that it therefore means as much as the stated aim in A Government of Renewal of inflation plus 2 per cent which meant nothing at all.  Does the Minister not agree that to be almost 300 per cent out in the last few years is not &ldquo;as close as possible&ldquo;?  If English is to mean anything, does he not agree that, by being out by nearly 300 per cent during the life of the Government from the 1994 programme's targets, means &ldquo;as close as possible&rdquo; can mean to be out by 300 per cent during the life of Partnership 2000, or does it mean something else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To be out by that rate would distort, if not destroy, all other figures which are contained in the macro-economic forecasts and predictions for Partnership 2000.  I accept the valid criticism that we have exceeded the target we set ourselves.  If we had not set such a target, the growth in expenditure would have been higher.</P>

      <P>The Partnership 2000 document was published a few days before the budget. It was announced on budget day that post-budget gross spending would have to increase by another 1 per cent from pre-budget figures, from 6 to 7 per cent, which would be an increase of 16 per cent if one wished to be pedantic about it.  Is that the idea of keeping as close as possible to 2 per cent?</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister's assertion that, if he had not set the target of inflation plus 2 per cent in 1994 growth in public spending would have been worse.  It could not have been worse, and the Minister knows that.  I am not saying he could have controlled his colleagues better if he had laid down other criteria, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The treaty makes provision for coordination of economic policies among member states, and this will be intensified with the commencement of European Monetary Union and the coming into effect of the stability and growth pact and the new exchange rate mechanism.</P>
      <P>A formal stability council is no longer under consideration in the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers &mdash; ECOFIN.  It is now widely accepted that such a council would be outside the terms of the treaty.  The treaty does not provide for separate ECOFIN councils for the participating and non-participating member states. Although it identifies areas where it is appropriate that, within ECOFIN, only the member states participating in economic and monetary union may vote, all member states would have a seat at the table.</P>
      <P>It has, however, been suggested that there may be occasions where it would be useful for the Finance Ministers of member states participating in economic and monetary union to informally discuss matters of common interest, and that an informal stability council could provide a forum for such discussion.</P>
      <P>There might be benefits from an informal stability council, whereby euro-area Finance Ministers could informally exchange views on matters of common concern to them.  I am, therefore, prepared to consider any proposals which may be brought forward.  Nevertheless, in considering proposals for such an informal stability council, I would be anxious to ensure that any such arrangements would not be divisive.  In particular, they should not undermine ECOFIN or detract from its work.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's reply but conflicting statements on this issue are emerging from Germany and France.  It appears to be degenerating into a row about the independence of the proposed European Central Bank and whether there will be any political input into that institution.  What are the Minister's views on the European Central Bank?  Should there be an informal stability council or some other mechanism or should the European Central Bank be independent of national governments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy tabled a later question on the independence of the European Central Bank and I have given a comprehensive reply.  I hope that question will be dealt with during Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like a European Union institution that is outside the treaty.  The framework of the treaty <Col N="1564" /> has served both small countries and the Commission well.  The impetus for the establishment of non-treaty institutions tends to come from larger countries.  That is not in this country's interest nor is it in the interest of the evolution and operation of the European Union as currently constituted.  While I am prepared to consider proposals which might emanate from these discussions and which have been reported from time to time, my preference is for a council which is constructed within the terms of the treaty.  That would ensure, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Commission plays an integral part in the deliberations of such a council.  Current proposals for an informal council would, by definition, tend to exclude the Commission and that is not in the interest of the Union or of small countries.</P>
    <P>I support the independence of the European Central Bank and, as I said earlier, I have offered a more substantial reply on that issue in a later question.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that there must be grave reservations about extratreaty institutions?  By definition, they are institutions in which the rights of small countries are least capable of being protected.  The Minister should also take on board the growing sense of unease in this country with the notion that the &ldquo;big boys&rdquo; in Europe are setting an economic agenda, even with regard to tax matters, which threatens our ability to create jobs on the periphery of Europe.  Many people are becoming, if not euro sceptic at least euro realist, in that they realise out interest in this issue is not the same as that of France and Germany nor is it the same with regard to the political direction or nudging of the European Central Bank in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  The treaty is the guarantor for the success of the European Union.  The last time the &ldquo;big boys&rdquo; in Europe tried to rule the Continent on their own terms there were world wars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The indications emerging from Germany and France in recent months on the concept of monetary union appear to imply that the dates are more sacrosanct than the criteria. We were told that we must abide by the criteria in order to join.  However, it appears some countries will be unable to meet the economic criteria and the &ldquo;big boys&rdquo;, as the Minister describes them, have decided to change the rules.  Does that not indicate that smaller member states will be sidelined in many areas and that we must be increasingly vigilant, particularly in the period preceding the delivery of monetary union if it takes place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been a worrying feature in European developments in the past 18 months.  It is not a <Col N="1565" /> party political matter and there is universal agreement that the Minister should make it known that we do not wish to see any further developments in that regard because we, along with other countries, will be sidelined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views articulated by Deputy McCreevy and Deputy McDowell.  During the Irish Presidency, I made explicit reference to the unique contribution small countries have made in the course of their Presidencies to advancing the European project.  At the press conference in Dublin Castle on 13 December, I said it was a consequence of the Irish Presidency, followed by the Presidency of the Netherlands and with the help of the Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Luxembourg which will succeed the Dutch to the Presidency, that we had managed to put in place a key element of the European single currency project.  The role of small countries, therefore, cannot be discounted or ignored if the large countries of Europe want a peaceful successor to their hegemony on the Continent over the last two centuries.</P>

      <P>The European Council in Madrid in December 1995, and the subsequent European Councils in Florence and Dublin, confirmed that the starting date for the third stage of economic and monetary union &mdash; European Monetary Union &mdash; will be 1 January 1999, the latest date envisaged in the Treaty on European Union.  It is Government policy that Ireland should qualify for participation in European Monetary Union from the outset.</P>
      <P>Article 109L4 of the treaty provides that, at the starting date of the third stage and by unanimity of the member states participating in European Monetary Union, the Council of Ministers, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Central Bank, will adopt the conversion rates at which participating currencies will be irrevocably fixed against the euro.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this debate on previous occasions and the Minister is aware of my views on setting a date.  It will lead to an inordinate amount of currency speculation in the preceding period.  I stated my view in the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, of which Deputy McDowell is also a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain amount of volatility in exchange rates at present and I predicted this some months ago, as Deputy McDowell will recall.  Is it the view of the Minister and the Government that a date can be set so far in advance and met without large speculative movements against currencies taking place in the preceding period?  Will <Col N="1566" /> a small country such as Ireland, whose currency is not traded extensively in international terms, not be seriously disadvantaged if the &ldquo;big boys&rdquo; start to position themselves in the knowledge that the commencement date is 1 January 1999?  It will be a combination of luck and an act of God if Ireland joins the exchange rate mechanism at favourable exchange rates.  The Minister must give consideration to this issue.  I predict the situation will deteriorate in the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the Deputy in terms of the premise on which his argument is based.  As we move closer to 1 January 1999 there has been increased currency volatility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the present position.  There has been less currency volatility up to the recent surge in the value of sterling, which is largely attributed to an anticipated increase in interest rates.  It is generally conceded by most specialist commentators that if the British, like other member states in the EU, had an independent central bank, as we have, the speculation about an increase in interest rates in Britain would not exist because the decision would have been taken previously.  From published comments by the Governor of the Bank of England, an extra 0.5 per cent would have been put on sterling, which would have dampened speculation.  Part of the increase in the value of sterling &mdash; these are multi-factorial issues &mdash; is attributed to speculation because interest rates in Britain are fixed for political considerations exclusively rather than for economic considerations.</P>
      <P>The second change in relative currency values in recent times relates to the German currency which has been driven down in value by the Bundesbank to accommodate the economic concerns of the German economy.  I do not accept that current volatility in currency, which causes difficulties for exporters to continental Europe, relates to anticipation of 1 January 1999.  There is need to find a formula in which to fix irrevocably the exchange rates as against the Euro of participating countries in such a manner as to minimise the possibility for speculative turbulence and disruption &mdash; I am acutely conscious of that, as, not surprisingly, is every other Minister for Finance in ECOFIN.  The manner in which rates are to be fixed and the announcement is to be made are related issues of concern, and active, positive and constructive consideration is being given to that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context I take it consideration is being given by the Government to support some mechanism which would entail averaging exchange rates over a period.  Consideration is also being given to the proposition that a date for all exchange rates to be fixed would not be set but that there would be an <Col N="1567" /> option over a period of time so that speculators could not count on any particular timeframe to make a quick killing and put pressure on the Irish pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of both Deputies.  There are two issues involved.  First, we must ensure the rates at which national currencies are fixed irrevocably against the Euro relate realistically to the value of the currency in the medium to long-term rather than to a particular point on a particular day.  That leads to the logic of ensuring that economies participating in the single currency are truly convergent in every sense of the world.  The five criteria in the Maastricht Treaty are simply a measure, but not the total measure of such convergence.</P>
      <P>The second concern is that exchange rates must be fixed in such a way as to minimise any window of speculative opportunity for substantial currency trading.  We are not talking about caricatured sole traders of the kind we read about from time to time.  Every pension fund in the world participates in this kind of activity.  The volume of speculative money is of such a size that not a single central bank or combination of central banks could sustain a massive onslaught.  Following the surge in the autumn of 1992, there is a body of experience &mdash; not necessarily a body of knowledge &mdash; that wants to minimise and avoid that.  It would be irresponsible of me to openly discuss the way in which that might be done.  The risk is understood and measures are being considered to minimise the possibility referred to by Deputies McDowell and McCreevy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter should be dealt with by announcing fixed rates.  Not enough thought has been given to this matter by the Irish Government or all countries in Europe.  They fail to recognise that men and women all over the world managing pension funds to the best of their ability spot these things.  I advised a long time ago that a date cannot be set and I am glad the Minister has given some credence to that aspect today.</P>
      <P>The debate on sterling in recent months has reinforced the message that other markets perceive the Irish pound as a sterling clone currency. The Minister said the Bank of England should be an independent central bank, but his colleague, Ken Clark, said on television recently that he has ignored the advice of Mr. George, and he ignored it before.  Mr. Clark said that in the last year he was more correct than the Governor of the Bank of England.  The Irish pound is at the top of the grid as against the French franc and approaching a level where something will have to be done by the Central Bank.  That is a result of sterling following the dollar and the Irish pound being perceived as a sterling clone currency.  Does that not highlight the difficulties that will face the Irish currency if the UK stays outside economic and monetary union?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the precise dictionary definition to hand but I believe that a clone is a body or entity that mimics the behaviour of the body to which it is cloned.  If that were the case we would be much higher up the band on the ERM than we currently are.  Taking that definition, it is wrong to say the Irish pound is a clone of sterling.  The sterling market will, for the foreseeable future, remain the most important market. Sterling has come down significantly since the period prior to 1973, but considering that there are five million people in Ireland and 57 million or 58 million in Britain, it will certainly remain a significant market.  Our dependent relationship with that market will have a significant impact on the value of the Irish pound.  We are correctly perceived as having a strong relationship with the sterling market, but it would be wrong to say the Irish pound is a clone of sterling. The facts do not suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties have been well outlined. When we reach the stage of fixing the currency, those who stay outside economic and monetary union &mdash; I speak of the UK &mdash; will have inside knowledge that could suit them in terms of the rate of sterling as against the Euro.  Is it the case that when the decision is made in principle about those who will form monetary union, the decision of how and when will remain with those who are in as opposed to those who have decided to opt out?  It would be grossly wrong if those who are inside but not partaking were aware of everything taking place.  Inside knowledge could give them a competitive advantage, having taken the decision to stay out in the first place.  Is that prospect being considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are only two countries who have an opt-out clause as regards currency, Britain and Denmark.  We have to form a view as to the likely attitude of the UK Government, which will probably change after the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have another debate on that in due course.  It is a matter for the sovereign British people to decide.</P>
      <P>The remaining 13 states do not have opt-out clauses.  All of them, including the United Kingdom, are obliged under the existing treaty provisions to manage their currency having regard to the impact on other member states.  I do not foresee, for example, as regards the kind of discussion which would take place at ECOFIN, the UK authorities inside the EU but outside the currency zone having access to market sensitive information which would enable them to take competitive advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of the European Central Bank is distinct from the board of the ESCB which embraces all 15 member states.  The operation board of the ECB will only be comprised of those <Col N="1569" /> member states who participate in the single currency. They would not have formal access to market sensitive information.  They are obliged by the treaty to manage their currency in a manner that has regard to its impact on their neighbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>When it is decided who meets the criteria the movement towards the formation of the central bank will begin.  That group will take the decision and I presume that those who either for their own reasons decide to opt out or are not able to proceed, will not form part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the present difficulties regarding exchange rates <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish pound, sterling and franc highlight the need for exceptionally tight rules as regards the relationship between those who are out and those who are in.  We will be faced with an unusual circumstance where interest rates may be forced to fall as a result of the Central Bank intervening, at a time when that would be the totally wrong fiscal stance for Irish economic policy.  This is increasingly likely to be the case if the UK remains outside and we stay in.  Strict rules would have to be enforced for those outside and inside the bloc.  I predict that in the next few weeks we might see a decision on interest rates which will not necessarily be in the best interests of the Irish economy. It is a result of our relationship with sterling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>Yes.  Everything I have read to date emanating from across the water indicates that the objective economic logic of the situation will compel the UK authorities to join the single currency in the best interests of their economy. Everything I have read, with the exception of an extreme group of English nationalists, whose agenda is much wider than the question of single currency, leads me to believe that later if not sooner, Britain will join the single currency.  It will be in the best interests of the British economy. Today, Neil Fitzgerald, the chief executive of Unilever has all but stated this, following the footsteps of the president of Toyota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>In the current tax year 1996-97 it is estimated that a single employee, full rate PRSI contributor, earning the average industrial wage, will pay almost 29.3 per cent of his or her earnings in income tax, PRSI and levies.  This is referred to as the average tax burden.  Such a taxpayer will pay the 48 per cent income tax rate on £1,719 of his or her earnings and PRSI on £10,409.</P>
      <P>A single self-employed taxpayer, on the same income level, will pay 32.6 per cent of his or her earnings in income tax, PRSI and levies.  The self-employed taxpayer will pay the 48 per cent income tax rate on £2,519 of his or her earnings and PRSI on £13,529.</P>
      <P>As a result of the improvements announced in this year's budget, it is estimated that the average tax burden for a single employee on the average industrial wage will fall to below 27.2 per cent in 1997-98, even after allowing for wage increases. The amount of his or her income subject to the 48 per cent income tax rate will decline to £1,406. For a single self-employed taxpayer the comparative figures are 31.1 per cent and £2,206.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy in relation to taxation is set out in the programme for renewal. The programme stresses the need to reform the tax system, in particular to relieve the tax and PRSI burden of those on low incomes.  Tax reform will favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap, aim to reduce the tax wedge and encourage enterprise development.  The Deputy will also be aware that section 3.9 of Partnership 2000 states: &ldquo;The Government will introduce personal tax reductions to the cumulative value over the three years of £900 million on a full year cost basis&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first steps towards implementing this undertaking were taken in my recent budget.  The measures introduced include increasing personal allowances by £250 in the case of a single person and £500 for a married couple, the largest increase in personal allowances since 1984; increasing the general income exemption limits by £100 single and £200 married; reducing the standard income tax rate by 1 per cent to 26 per cent; widening the standard rate tax band by £500 single and £1,000 married; reducing by 1 per cent the employee full rate PRSI contribution, which is paid by slightly over 70 per cent of PRSI contributors; increasing the income threshold for payment of the health and employment and training <Col N="1571" /> levies by £500 to £10,250 or to £197 per week. These measures will continue to reduce the tax and PRSI burden on employment and the average tax wedge, thereby making employment more attractive.</P>
    <P>Of course more needs to be done, and it is the Government's policy to continue, within responsible budgetary parameters, the process of reducing the tax and PRSI burden on earned income as an important element in overall strategy.  The personal tax reductions introduced in this year's budget amount to £393 million on a full year cost basis.  The remainder of the £900 million agreed for personal tax reductions under Partnership 2000 will be provided in the 1998 and 1999 budgets. The precise measures to be introduced in those two budgets are, of course, a matter for consideration by the Government in the run up to each of those two budgets.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for providing those figures and also for the unusually non-propagandistic way in which they were delivered on this occasion.  I thought I would hear about what happened in 1989-1992, which normally happens when we discuss these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reciprocate in coming months.  Is the cost of the 1 per cent reduction in PRSI, which affects 70 per cent of PRSI payers, included in the £900 million tax package; in other words, is PRSI now considered to be a tax?  If so, it amounts to a confirmation for the first time that it is a tax.  In this context, is it not alarming that a self-employed person &mdash; we are supposed to be in favour of self-employment, although we sometimes forget this &mdash; earning the average industrial wage is asked to give one third of his or her income in taxes and that there is such a significant differential compared with an ordinary PAYE employee?  While we are always told the self-employed person has the advantage in being able to put his or her money aside and pay his or her tax at the end of the year &mdash; this is not such a huge advantage &mdash; will the Minister agree that, in order to calculate their tax bill, many self-employed persons have to pay a significant amount of money to accountants?  This is an additional cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is subject to confirmation but I think the cost of the PRSI reductions is included in the £900 million tax package.  I will communicate directly with the Deputy on that point.

      <P>That is the point.  To take 30 to 33 per cent in taxes and PRSI from somebody earning the average industrial wage, be they self-employed or employed, is a huge reduction. Assuming the cost of the 1 per cent reduction in PRSI is included in the tax package, will the Minister agree the logic is to keep hacking away until PRSI is removed?  If it does not amount to social welfare insurance, as the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, argues it is, but a tax, it is the most regressive employment tax in the State.</P>

I am aware one cannot factor in numbers and figures for quality of life considerations which are a matter of perception depending on where an individual lives and so on, but am I right in thinking the Progressive Democrats &mdash; the Deputy is their official spokesperson on Finance &mdash; would like to drive down the figure even more?  The Deputy asked me earlier to drive down the level of corporation tax.  That, presumably, implies a forfeiture of revenue, if not in the long-term, in the short-term.  If one drives down the level of corporation tax and personal income tax rates, where would the consequences be felt in the provision of services?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if the Finance Bill, 1997 will include appropriate provisions to deal with the taxation of cross-Border workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4001/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to include any provisions in this year's Finance Bill relating to the taxation of cross-Border workers.  As I have explained on numerous occasions in the House, the issues involved in the taxation of cross-Border workers were thoroughly investigated by an interdepartmental committee I established in 1995. This committee found that the treatment of cross-Border workers for the purposes of income tax is fair and reasonable <i>vis-á-vis</i> other Irish taxpayers. Consequently, the committee felt there is no justification for any special income tax treatment of these workers as compared to any other category of Irish resident taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> The committee however, made other recommendations, most notably to exempt cross-Border workers from the health and employment and training levies.  As the Deputy is aware, I announced such an exemption in last year's budget and this was introduced in last year's Social Welfare Act.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommended that cross-Border workers should avail of the direct debit system as a means of paying their Irish tax liability and this now applies for the preliminary tax payment which was due on 1 November 1996 and which will fall due on 1 November of subsequent years.  Full details of this system, including an explanatory leaflet, are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>A further recommendation of the committee was that there should be consultation between the Irish and UK revenue authorities on the scope of Article 18, which is concerned with the taxation of governmental employees.  Discussions between the two authorities on the scope of Article 18 and whether it should be amended to make it clearer what categories of employment are covered have been in progress for some time and, it is hoped, will be satisfactorily concluded shortly.  This possible amendment would, however, cover only a small class of Government employees and the position of cross-Border workers generally will not be affected by the outcome of the negotiations.  It is important to add that the 1976 Irish-UK Double Taxation Agreement is a bilateral one and any changes must be agreed to by the UK Government.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister address the anomaly whereby those who work across the Border pay tax in the jurisdiction where the highest rate applies and that the State benefits irrespective of whether one lives in the North and works in the South or <i>vice versa</i>?  Has this issue been addressed at European Union level to ascertain if equity prevails in the treatment of people who cross frontiers of EU member states to work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister does not appear to accept there is a problem in this regard.  Does he accept wage levels are lower in Northern Ireland?  Does he agree with the concept of equal pay for equal work and, if so, does he believe a solution to this problem can be found through taxation or other means to ensure that people from Donegal, where there is a high level of unemployment, who travel across the Border to secure work are not discouraged because of lower wage levels?  What does the Minister propose to do for such people in the event of Britain not joining economic and monetary union?  People living along the Border in Donegal are already dealing in two currencies. What exemptions will apply to Government <Col N="1575" /> employees?  In April or May last year the Minister spoke about inviting interested people to form a committee to discuss this matter, but I heard nothing more about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised three questions. I agree with the principle of equal pay for equal work, but that is difficult to effect when two jurisdictions are involved.  A policy of low wages and low direct income tax has prevailed in the conservatively-run United Kingdom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will wait and see.  We cannot do anything about that.</P>
      <P>The changes in the structure and formalities of employment in the United Kingdom, and consequently in Northern Ireland, adversely affected primarily teachers and health care workers. Those categories of workers are currently the subject of discussion under article 18.  If possible I will forward a more detailed reply to the Deputy at a later stage.  She is correct in suggesting that I indicated it would be useful to organise a meeting of interested parties to consider our position and the progress made on this issue since we last spoke about it.  On foot of her representations today, I will be happy to convene such a meeting on a consultative basis to update all concerned. Changes in respect of article 18 are subject to agreement by both Governments.  Unfortunately, we cannot unilaterally make those changes on this side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there provision in the bilateral agreement on double taxation between Ireland and the UK for a periodic review, particularly having regard to the variable terms of the sterling-punt exchange rate?  The level of remuneration received by a teacher living in County Louth and teaching in Crossmaglen or Newry may vary from time to time.  Does the bilateral agreement provide for a review to take account of those matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the answer to the Deputy's question.  I presume any such agreement would contain a review clause, but I will get that information for the Deputy.  The best way forward would be to convene a meeting of all the Deputies and Senators directly concerned.  Discussions will take place on 26 and 27 February on Article 18 and related matters, following which we may have further information.  We should be able to brief Members on the up to date position in mid-March, subject to the normal courtesies and availabilities.</P>

      <P>We are aiming for Wednesday of Holy Week, 26 March.  In accordance with last year's practice I intend to publish fairly soon a list of the Bill's contents giving a title description of each section of substance.  Deputies will be contacted about the preconsolidation measures. Subject to advice from the Attorney General we hope to publish a White Paper outlining the consolidation measures, which will be published in quasi legislative rather than draft legislative form at an early stage to facilitate consultation with all sides.  The Revenue Commissioners will hold an information seminar on this matter in the near future.  It is hoped to publish the White Paper in mid-April and when the Finance Bill, which will give effect to the budget, is enacted, we will incorporate those measures into the draft consolidation legislation.  That will require the setting up of a joint committee of both Houses.</P>

      <P>On a previous Finance Bill, a sub-committee of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party went to great lengths to prepare a draft amendment to address the question of cross-Border workers, but because the Bill was guillotined we did not have time to deal with the amendment. Will the Minister give his view on that or an alternative amendment to the committee he sets up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to unnecessarily penalise cross-Border workers.  The intensity of feeling in Donegal was obvious from the by-election Deputy Keaveney contested.  Senator Maloney and other Deputies, particularly from the Dundalk region, have raised this matter with me on a number of occasions.  Those two posts tend to be the most acute points of transfer and cross-Border activity.  I have no desire to be restrictive or mean in regard to this issue.  It is a question of finding a formula that does not offend other categories of Irish taxpayers.  At the committee I convene I will listen to proposals from all sides of the House to ascertain how we can address these intensely felt injustices.</P>

      <asker>Mr. B. Ahern</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>whether notifications of grant-aid assistance under the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation have issued for 1997; and, if so, if he will give details in this regard.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2766/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission task force, following its own widespread consultations in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland, strongly recommended that as much as possible of the implementation of the programme be developed to local delivery mechanisms. Because of the objectives of peace and reconciliation and the paramount importance of the need to combat social exclusion, it was considered that implementing mechanisms independent of Government and closer to the grassroots offered <Col N="1577" /> the best means of achieving these goals.  The emphasis was to be put on bottom-up development arising from community-based actions.  The Commission, in adopting the report of the task force, required the respective administrations to draw up proposals putting these recommendations into effect.</P>
      <P>Given the particular nature of the programmes &mdash; demand-led and bottom-up &mdash; applications for assistance for eligible projects fall to be considered throughout the programme period.  The Deputy's reference to notifications for grant-aid issuing at this stage in 1997, therefore, is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>What process is in place to monitor this programme?  Is the Minister satisfied that the ADM and Combat Poverty are the best agencies to implement the programme?  It appears that a substantial amount of the money has yet to be spent.  I would like them to identify some flagship projects for social inclusion where they could do good work.  Even at this stage, will the Minister look at the possibility of representatives of the business community, elected representatives and representatives of voluntary and community groups being involved, as is happening on the northern side of the Border to good effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>About 58 per cent of the programme's resources has now been committed, although not drawn down.  The monitoring will be done by the Commission in consultation with both Governments, including the local administration in Northern Ireland.  The programme was originally signed on 8 December 1995, and I think the Deputy was present at the joint ceremonies, one of which took place in Monaghan. Maybe it is time to review that process involving wider public representative bodies across the Border counties on both sides.  I would certainly be prepared to look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister look at the question of an integrated approach?  As he is aware, a substantial number of agencies is involved in the Border area without any great coordination between them.  They include county partnerships, county enterprise boards, INTERREG, and the special programme for peace and reconciliation in the Border region.  Is there some way that they could all be co-ordinated or integrated into one body to do this work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to look at that but the Deputy will recall that questions of this nature have been tabled in the House before.  The structure I described, involving ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency on the southern side of the Border, IBEC, the CBI and Co-operation North on the northern side, was a prerequisite of the Commission whose funding is involved. Against the constraints that are clearly there, I <Col N="1578" /> would be prepared to look at the idea of better co-ordination, which is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy O'Hanlon said in this regard.  Without casting aspersions on any of the organisations involved, there is a grave danger that much of the money which could be used will be lost.  While there is no lack of will among those concerned in the Border region, including business people, the way the terms of reference are being interpreted on this side of the Border is far from narrow.  The danger is that funds which could become available will not be utilised to any lasting effect.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take on board what Deputy O'Hanlon has said; perhaps some changes are necessary.  I am not casting any reflection on the organisations involved, but better use could be made of some of the funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  I am quite happy to look at it in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this matter at various times in the House.  At one stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, indicated that we would have a mid-term review of the programme. When can we expect decisions arising from such a review?</P>
      <P>There is a need for greater integration not alone with other agencies but also with State agencies like the IDA.  Ardee, a small town in County Louth, has a severe unemployment problem. Industrial land is available there, which happens to be owned by the North Eastern Health Board.  The IDA will probably be in a position to put a package together to develop that site but, because of a lack of resources, it is only able to buy it.  The greatest benefit the Peace and Reconciliation Fund could confer on Ardee would be to make resources available to develop the industrial site thus allowing the IDA and Forbairt to market the town.</P>
      <P>The objective of social inclusion is a worthy one, but in five or ten years' time will there be tangible evidence that this money has been spent?  That is the bottom line.  If, under the criteria, that sort of thorough examination of investments is not made, we will have to look at this in the longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>This has arisen before and Deputies will be aware of my concern and commitment in this area.  We have been told informally by the Commission that the programme is primarily about reconciliation and, as such, cannot be seen as a substitute for other kinds of activity that the Government or the regional authorities in Northern Ireland should be doing anyway.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's first question referred to a medium term review.  This agreement was signed in December 1995.  We are looking at the mid term review of the main CSF structural programmes which is coming up for June or July 1997.  Against that background we will see if it can be done in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues, although I am not as familiar with the Border situation as they are.  While the involvement of people in ADM is well meant, we are getting involved in ephemeral matters.  There is no tangible creation of structures and money is not flowing into building projects that would benefit the community.  The administrative structure has expanded and seminars are being held, yet I cannot see anything productive occurring.</P>

There are vast sums of money involved &mdash; I am not casting aspersions and do not wish anybody to interpret it that way.  They are doing their best with it but there should be the open accountability that is required of us, together with some professional direction.</P>

We want to bring all that activity into a properly democratic and accountable forum. Since the early 1990s different administrations have allowed the development of such bodies. There is a need to bring them back into a framework to which we as elected representatives who <Col N="1580" /> are ultimately accountable to the electorate can have access.  We have bypassed, and consequently devalued, the role of local authorities in many of these areas.  That imbalance has to be re-examined, and that is the trust of the Bill published by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello referred to the contribution to politics of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch.  When other Members are long forgotten, Jack Lynch will be remembered at local level in Cork and at national and international level.  He led this country at a crucial time in the history of the State, and we are all proud of him.  As his successor in Cork North-Central, I am glad and proud to put the record straight.</P>
      <P>The Minister's 1997 budget contains a number of proposals covering a range of areas.  I will discuss some of these later in my contribution. Initially, however, I would like to consider the overall background to the budget, and the realistic expectations we had of the Minister as he drafted his proposals for 1997.</P>
      <P>It is vital to assess the current economic climate.  It is only too easy to forget the overwhelming sense of doom and gloom which developed during the term of office of the disastrous 1983-7 Fine Gael-Labour Coalition when almost everything they touched seemed destined to fail.  One has only to think of their performance in key areas such as unemployment, the national debt and Northern Ireland to clearly recall their terrible legacy to the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might be interested to know what his constituents have to say about him.  Many of them are not very happy with him.</P>
      <P>However, a series of excellent and responsible administrations from 1987 to 1994 reversed the slide into economic and social disaster which was provoked by gross government shortcomings during the period 1983-7.  From a situation of escalating national debt, public spending and high interest rates, order was restored to the State's finances by a number of sensible, skilfully crafted and courageous budgets and supplementary corrective measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enormous achievements of the 1987-94 period required a major joint effort on the part of the people at central administration.  Each and every sector of society played its part in this process of recovery.  Perhaps the single most important development during this crucial time was the acceptance of the vital need for social partnership if any substantial improvement was to be achieved in the face of enormous odds.  The fact that such a partnership was created and built upon as a vital core of trust developed between the partners is perhaps the single most encouraging example of the potential of our society to overcome appalling problems such as unemployment and social divisions.  As a result of the successes <Col N="1582" /> of this period, it became clear that Irish industry can and does achieve world class industrial performance given a sympathetic and positive operational environment.</P>
    <P>Thus, coming to power over two years ago, the rainbow Coalition was presented with an unprecedented and sustained level of industrial growth, a balance of payments surplus to the State's finances and, of vital importance, extremely low interest rates.  There were also, of course, a number of problems to be addressed, in particular an unacceptably high level of unemployment and the persistence of social deprivation and poverty for many Irish families.  The needs of the homeless, victims of domestic violence and abuse, and the travelling community, immediately come to mind in this regard.</P>
    <P>Having studied the rainbow Coalition's third budget in an excellent economic climate, it is almost impossible to believe that it has made so little use of these unique opportunities to reduce the gap between poor and rich.</P>
    <P>What overall impact has the Coalition Government had on society?  Has it given quality leadership and provided encouragement to those with the most serious social and economic problems in our community?  What specific groups have significantly benefited from its policies?</P>
    <P>I make no apology for continuing to stress the need to assess the impact of this Government's policies on those most in need in our society. These include the elderly, the unemployed, lone parents, widows and those suffering from persistent illness and disability.  We must never forget that the overall cohesion of society is particularly dependent on the quantity and scope of the social welfare system.  The need for a clear indication of support for social welfare recipients has never been as profound, given the climate of growth and expansion in our economy.  How has the rainbow Coalition responded to this challenge?  In particular how has the Minister for Finance performed in his three budgets?</P>
    <P>I accept that the budget includes positive features. While they may be small in real financial terms, the above inflation increases in certain personal welfare payments are welcome.  Similarly, relatively small but useful changes have been made in the family income supplement, the carer's allowance, eligibility for the adult dependent allowance, and treatment, maternity and adoptive benefits.  Proposed changes in the qualifying conditions for free electricity and the free telephone rental allowance are a move in the right direction.  It must be an ongoing priority of all Governments to improve the administration and operation of all schemes in the public sector.  This applies not only to the Department of Social Welfare, but to all other Departments and State agencies.</P>
    <P>The back-to-work allowance scheme facilitates the transfer of unemployed people into the active labour force.  While the Minister has provided for an increase in the number of participants in this scheme and has reserved some of the extra places <Col N="1583" /> for those receiving disability allowance, his overall level of commitment to this key scheme is extremely disappointing.</P>
    <P>I welcome increases in the level of child benefit payments since it involves an explicit acknowledgement by the State of the individual importance and rights of each person from birth.  Furthermore, the direct payment of such allowances to mothers guarantees at least a certain level of income each month irrespective of other financial and social factors affecting individual families.</P>
    <P>While it must be acknowledged that the increase in child benefit has been significant over the lifetime of this Government, it is also important to note that the child benefit scheme is one of the few State programmes which is totally neutral in terms of targeting poverty.  Its impact is spread across all income levels.  While any real improvement in the level of payments represents a welcome gesture of support to mothers and children, its impact on narrowing the gap between the poor and the affluent is minimal.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it brings to mind perhaps the most substantial educational policy of this Government, namely the abolition of third level fees. While this is an important and welcome step for middle income families, its ultimate effect is to further shift educational expenditure from families who are most in need and who, unfortunately, have the lowest participation rates in third level education.  This problem is highlighted in research findings, which point out the strong association between educational level and the likelihood of obtaining full-time employment.</P>
    <P>How are we to fairly judge the performance of the Minister for Finance over the past three years?  Any assessment of the Minister and his colleagues since they took up their duties must take on board three crucial factors.  By 1994 the State finances had been rescued from the disaster of the early 1980s, 1983 to 1987.  Furthermore, the economy had been prudently built up to record growth levels while interest rates had been dramatically reduced.</P>
    <P>The remaining major social and economic problems facing the Government were obvious. Principally, it was critical to make significant progress in terms of net job creation with the needs of the long-term unemployed of particular urgency.  Equally, a major attack was urgently required on the level of poverty which remained in our society despite substantial overall economic growth.  Clearly, the rising tide was not lifting all boats equally.</P>
    <P>It cannot be forgotten that two of the three Government parties &mdash; Labour and Democratic Left &mdash; had a long record of verbal commitment to those most in need.  Since these two parties controlled key ministries such as Finance, Social Welfare, Health and Education, the Government had every opportunity to provide clear-cut evidence of its commitment to the poor and socially deprived.</P>
    <P>What has happened during the past three years <Col N="1584" /> of a Labour and Democratic Left dominated Government?  Any fair assessment can only conclude that this Government has recklessly and selfishly wasted the massive potential for improvement in the State's finances.  Instead of the rising tide being used to benefit those most in need, the Government has indulged in what is the most profound and prolonged example of widespread mismanagement and self-serving policy-making in the history of the State.  As Ministers have been overcome by difficulties of one type or another, the vital business of Government has become almost irrelevant in a frightening atmosphere of self-preservation at all costs.  Unfortunately, the unbelievable sequence of self-inflicted disasters which have become the only notable feature of the Rainbow Coalition have been disastrous for the country.</P>
    <P>As we try to identify the positive impact, if any, of the three budgets of the Minister for Finance, we see that a tremendous chance to change society in a positive way has been thrown away for short-term, narrow and unworthy political gain.  The only coherent strategy behind various Government policies seems to be an ill-fated attempt to regain power at the forthcoming general election at all costs.</P>
    <P>For a Minister of Deputy Quinn's ability, it is extremely disappointing to see that the only clear plan in his three budgets has been based on electoral considerations.  To maximise the give-away nature of the 1997 election budget, pathetic increases were provided in 1995 and 1996.</P>
    <P>The level of manipulation of the State's finances, particularly in the social welfare area, is only now obvious.  The most deserving social welfare recipients have been cynically deprived of increases, which the State could afford, for more than two years simply to satisfy the electoral interests of the Rainbow Coalition parties.  This can only be termed a gross abuse of the most vulnerable sectors of our society and does not sit easily with the many expressions of social concern and care which up to now have been the public face of the Labour Party and Democratic Left, in particular.</P>
    <P>The extent of the inadequacy of Government policy towards social welfare recipients was evident when the Minister boasted that &ldquo;an elderly person will be £7 a week better off from the increases of almost 10 per cent in the old age contributory pension in my three budgets&rdquo;.  If the Minister even matched the approximate £11 per week increase in the child benefit from a much lower base, there might be some shred of credibility to his claim.</P>
    <P>One can only bitterly regret the lack of caring and effective policy-making which has become the trademark of this appalling Government.  The potential of this country is too great and the needs of the people too important to be left in the hands of such a weak Administration.  While it is little consolation to many people who have been let down over the past three years, it is perhaps understandable that a Government made up <Col N="1585" /> of parties of the far Left, Centre and far Right cannot be expected to arrive at anything approaching effective and caring policies.</P>
    <P>In the current era, it is extremely important that our democratic institutions work effectively, otherwise the sense of public cynicism regarding the professionalism and integrity of our democratic structures will grow.  Such a trend is extremely negative and unhelpful for society and must be reversed as a matter of urgency.  The only meaningful way in which this can be achieved is through a dynamic and clearly evident process of policy reform and implementation throughout our political system.  Obviously, the Government of the day must lead the way in this regard.</P>
    <P>The disastrous failure of this Government to use the record level of economic growth to achieve a breakthrough in terms of tackling profound social deprivation must not discourage us from ensuring that profound change takes place in society for the benefit of all.  If that message emerges in the aftermath of this budget, some good will have come from what has been an extremely cynical and shallow exercise.</P>
    <P>Our future well-being requires a combination of cohesive policy-making and the provision of caring and targeted State supports.  We must ensure all State programmes are fully audited with related ongoing feedback.  The economy must be managed prudently and all possible steps must be taken to encourage the widespread development of indigenous industry.  In Government, Fianna Fáil will ensure that such measures are in place to protect the well-being of the nation's citizens as we approach the 21st century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> When talking about the budget, one must reflect on the hype preceding budget day.  For weeks we heard about the goodies which would be given to all sections of society and that everybody would be better off as a result of substantial increases in social welfare and tax cuts.  Unfortunately it was only hype. Three weeks on, little is being said about the budget because it did not have much to offer anybody. Most people would be disappointed at the way in which the Minister failed to deliver.</P>
      <P>We have a two tier society where the rich are getting richer and the poor are standing still. Surely at a time when the economy is booming this should not be the case.  A Government that is awash with money should have taken the opportunity to improve the lot of the less well off. The Minister for Finance and the Government failed in this respect.  As it is an election year the Government was more interested in giving a little everywhere and satisfying nobody, instead of targeting specific areas of the economy.  It did not do a great job in allocating the funds at its disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are major problems but unemployment is probably the most serious one.  It is a problem not only for the Government but for all of us as elected representatives.  We must bring about a solution to the high unemployment which exists particularly in large urban centres and in rural <Col N="1586" /> areas.  Some 60 per cent to 70 per cent of those living in large housing estates are unemployed.  In families where neither the father nor mother go out to work the son or daughter on reaching the age of 18 usually seeks unemployment assistance. In some of those housing estates there are second and third generations who never had the opportunity of going out to work.  These are the areas we must target.</P>
    <P>Every day we hear about the number of jobs being created and that 1996 was a record year. Some 80 per cent of those are based in Dublin. The IDA and Forbairt say that the majority of computer companies want to base themselves in Dublin.  There should be a more even spread of jobs because rural areas are not getting their fair share of the jobs.  It is time the Government and State agencies ensured a more equitable and fair spread of the jobs announced on a daily basis by the IDA and Forbairt.  It is important that centres of high unemployment are targeted for job creation.</P>
    <P>Different Governments, including that of which I was a member, have created various quangos: Leader, county enterprise boards, county development boards, area partnerships, FÁS, CERT and so on.  It is time some Minister said enough is enough and those agencies were brought under one umbrella.  They are all working in different directions and creating their own empires and at the end of the day there is little, if any, benefit to the man or woman seeking employment.</P>
    <P>In Wexford town we have an area partnership office, a county development office, a Leader office, a county enterprise board office; in Enniscorthy an area partnership office, a FÁS office, an extension of the county enterprise office while another agency wishes to open in Gorey.  All those offices use up large sums of the allocation each year when there should be one umbrella organisation in each county, preferably under the role of the local authority, where people could go to a one stop shop and get the best advantage for job creation in the county.  All the agencies are protecting their own empires and do not want to lose out in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, to examine the operation of those agencies to ensure they are meaningful to those seeking employment and that they do not look after their own empire at the expense of others.  We all want to see the maximum number of jobs created for the huge number of unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed. What different Governments had in mind for those agencies when they were set up was that they would specifically target the long-term unemployed.  That is not happening.  In Enniscorthy we still have high unemployment rates, particularly in the housing estates and this must be specifically targeted.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister talked about improving the take home pay of workers.  I am sure it will improve a little in some areas but we <Col N="1587" /> are only tinkering with the tax rates and the tax system.  We give a little here, take a little there, reduce the 27 per cent rate by 1 per cent, allow the 48 per cent rate stand, widen the tax bands a little and think the people in the workforce will be happy and content for another year.  The people who are working are not happy with the tax system and see little incentive to work.  It is disgraceful that over the last three years when there was an ideal opportunity to reduce the tax rates we did not do so.  When the various levies are added to the high tax rate of 48 per cent, people pay about 51 per cent of their wages in taxation.</P>
    <P>A single person with few allowances or claims on a salary of £12,000 can be eligible for this high rate of taxation.  One is not talking about well-heeled, high paid salaried people but ordinary people doing a decent day's work who reach the higher rate of tax very quickly.  The Minister should look seriously at how the 48 per cent rate can be reduced to a more realistic rate of 40 per cent and the 27 per cent rate reduced further. Take home pay is what will give people an incentive to remain in the workplace.  Surely we do not want people leaving the workplace as there are already too many people unemployed.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member 14 years ago social welfare has improved.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s when everyone was asked to tighten their belt social welfare increases were in line with inflation.  When Fianna Fáil was in office, first with the Progressive Democrats and then with the Labour Party, there was a 9 per cent increase over a three year period.  We now find under Labour Party and Democratic Left who say they are the soul of the less well off and the under-privileged, that despite a booming economy, low inflation, low interest rates and all the money accruing from taxation, an increase of only 7.5 per cent was given.  That increase is an insult to the old and the sick who depend on social welfare. The Labour Party and Democratic Left side of the Government have let down the ordinary people who are on social welfare.  They should be ashamed of themselves that they did not give at least a 3 per cent increase per year, or more when times were good.</P>
    <P>I have a direct interest in the position of disabled people as one of my children is disabled. Successive Governments have neglected people with disabilities and given very little priority to their needs.  It is important to recognise the role played in society by people with a disability and their entitlement to live an independent life the same as everyone else.  Will the Minister for Finance consider allocating funding in the Finance Bill for disabled people who attend centres for independent living?  We take our independence for granted but disabled people need help and support.  I welcome the opening of the centre for independent living in Wexford town, but the scheme must be put on a proper footing.  I am sure that like me, the Minister, Deputy Higgins, <Col N="1588" /> and Deputy Creed, have been contacted by disabled people, many of whom have protested outside Leinster House.  As they are not large in terms of numbers we tend to forget about them. It is important for politicians from all parties to make a strong case to the Minister for Health to put pressure on the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet to allocate funding to centres for independent living so that they can expand, and, more importantly, survive.  If the Government does not allocate sufficient funding to these centres in the near future they will have to close down.  These centres have given disabled people an opportunity to do something for themselves and all political parties must adopt a positive attitude towards them.</P>
    <P>I have lost faith in the Minister for Education in so far as County Wexford is concerned.  This debate gives me an opportunity to highlight the problems being experienced by schools in County Wexford, particularly in the Enniscorthy area. Given her reluctance to give a commitment to refurbish schools in County Wexford, I sometimes think &mdash; I hope I am wrong &mdash; the Minister for Education is at loggerheads with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.  For the past two and a half years I have been making a case for St. Joseph's primary school, Kilmuckridge, St. Margaret's national school, Curracloe, and the gaelscoil, The Ballagh national school and St. Aidan's primary school in Enniscorthy.  However, I have had very little success.  When I table parliamentary questions on these schools all the Minister says is, &ldquo;I am looking into the matter and the project has been submitted for planning approval&rdquo;.  No action has been taken on these schools during the past two and a half years.</P>
    <P>The people of County Wexford and, in particular, the Enniscorthy area, which is represented by the Minister, Deputy Yates, are fed up with the Minister's attitude towards the pupils, parents and teachers.  As recently as last Monday, 1,000 people marched through Enniscorthy to protest at the lack of action.  Some of these people travelled by bus to Dublin today to the Department of Education to hand in a petition signed by more than 5,000 people.  This petition calls on the Minister to honour the commitment given to St. Aidan's primary school in 1994 when Enniscorthy CBS and the Presentation Convent School were amalgamated.  A commitment was given at that time that the school would be upgraded and refurbished if the amalgamation proved successful. However, this commitment has not been honoured three years later.  When I raised the matter on the Adjournment last week all I got from the Minister was gobbledegook.  I again ask her to think seriously about the commitments given in 1994 to St. Aidan's primary school and the position of St. Joseph's primary school, Kilmuckridge, St. Margaret's national school, Curracloe and The Ballagh national school and gaelscoil in Enniscorthy. The Minister has abandoned her responsibilities <Col N="1589" /> to the parents, teachers and students of schools in the Enniscorthy area.  We are not prepared to accept this and I assure the Minister that she will have to face some major battles during the lead-up to the general election.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, should also take note of this warning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is normal during budget debates for Deputies to give their views on the overall performance of the economy and to make some general observations.  I will try to weave between both.</P>
      <P>The reaction to the budget has been varied.  I am not surprised by the varied reactions of the Opposition parties to it.  Given the general consensus outside the House about the Government's good management of the economy, it is difficult for the Opposition to put forward an alternative view which makes any sense.  I listened to the two previous speakers and the glaring contradictions in their contributions are almost laughable.  For example, Deputy Browne referred to missed opportunities and excessive public expenditure and then went on to criticise the Minister for not spending enough money in his constituency.  Deputy Wallace also made contradictory statements in his contribution.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with Fianna Fáil as we were in a similar predicament not so long ago.</P>

      <P>The Government and the social partners have agreed on the terms of Partnership 2000 and I have no doubt we will see that agreement through to its conclusion.</P>
      <P>Opposition Deputies have suggested that this is an election budget.  If this was the case then the Government would have thrown out money like confetti.  The only election budget I can recall is the 1977 one.  I did not intend to adopt a revisionist approach until Deputy Wallace referred to the performance of the 1982-7 Government.  The slogan used in 1977 was, &ldquo;There is a better way&rdquo;. However, we spent most of the 1980s trying to rectify the costly mistakes made in 1977.</P>
      <P>The social partners, farmers, employers, trade unions and representatives of small business, have more or less given a thumbs up to the budget.  Of course they would all like more for their sectors but they have given a general welcome to the improvements, while advocating additional concessions which would further sweeten their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The breach of borrowing guidelines was criticised <Col N="1590" /> by Deputy McCreevy in particular in his response to the budget.  That criticism is inconsistent when one compares it with his appearance on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last Monday night during which he seemed to invite pressure groups to submit their shopping lists to Fianna Fáil between now and the general election.  If that is his approach the public will rue the day Deputy McCreevy gets control of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to hold the line when political deadlines are looming but the Government has done well, particularly in terms of adhering to the external restrictions imposed on it by way of economic and monetary union and the Maastricht guidelines.  Difficulties arose which required additional expenditure, including the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>The crime package introduced by the Minister for Justice has been successful and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Criminal Assets Bureau which I acknowledge was established at a cost.  The CAB has been successful in identifying the beneficiaries of crime and seizing their assets. I concur with a statement made by one of my Government colleagues in recent days that proceeds seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau should be used to benefit areas that have suffered as a result of crime and drugs.</P>
    <P>Another issue that affected the Government's self-imposed targets was the hepatitis C compensation tribunal, but it must retain its capacity to respond to crises as they develop.  Fianna Fáil would have preferred if the Government had failed to respond to the BSE and hepatitis C crises because it could have pointed the finger of Thatcherism at this side of the House.  The Government has responded well to day to day issues that have had an effect on public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The performance of the economy in recent years has been exceptional.  Growth rates are higher than any of our EU counterparts and growth in employment has been extraordinarily high; there are 100,000 more people at work than when this Government first came into office.  That is one of the many statistics that can be quoted in defence of the Government's economic record. The other indicators that are important from the point of view of business confidence, such as inflation and interest rates, are moving in the right direction.  I accept previous Administrations put in place some of the building blocks for this success but we as public representatives must acknowledge that this success did not happen by accident.  Unless we continue along the path of prudence and restraint, we may kill the goose that laid the golden egg.</P>
    <P>The hypocrisy of Deputy McCreevy in criticising the budget while inviting pressure groups to submit their shopping lists to Fianna Fáil before the next general election flies in the face of previous experience and has all the shades of 1977 when votes were bought.  Thankfully, by its endorsement of the Maastricht Treaty and other referenda, the public has imposed a type of external <Col N="1591" /> discipline on us, regardless of what Deputy McCreevy believes will sweeten the voters in the next general election.  We should learn the lessons of the past in terms of economic management and refrain from budget electioneering and raising false expectations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the budget to encourage job creation in the economy.  In handing out credits for job creation it is easy to forget companies like Apple, Gateway 2000 or Yamanouchi which have created hundreds of jobs.  Of approximately 40,000 new jobs created last year, almost 30,000 were created by small indigenous companies.  Regardless of whether those companies are stand alone or linked to the large multinationals now located here in significant numbers, we should not lose the opportunity to acknowledge what is being done by the small business and services sector in terms of job creation and sustaining growth in the economy. These companies are far more committed than many of the major multinationals who often pull out of Ireland when the going gets tough.  We have seen the consequences of that on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>It is to the credit of the Government and the Minister that they have acknowledged the role of small business and I welcome the further concessions in the budget in relation to the area of corporation profits tax.  I welcome also the movement in PRSI although further movement in that area is necessary.  It could be said that the Government did not go far enough in that regard but I hope the Minister, in forthcoming budgets, will continue in that direction.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the geographical imbalance that exists in terms of job creation which requires urgent Government attention.  I notice the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Higgins, is in the House.  A county colleague of his, Mr. Seán Hannick of Killala Precision Components Limited, carried out a detailed study of job creation in 1996.  That was an interesting analysis because the findings are stark.  Of 17,725 new jobs announced by the IDA, 71 per cent were in the greater Dublin region with 7 per cent in Cork, 6 per cent in Limerick, 3 per cent in Galway, 2 per cent in Waterford and 0.86 per cent in the west.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Government is investing enormous amounts of money in infrastructural improvements around the country including roads, regional airports and water and sewerage schemes, it is illogical that we are not prepared to put a regional dimension on job creation policy. Unfortunately, the areas whose infrastructure has been improved are not benefiting from it because the life blood of their communities, the people, are moving to large urban areas, particularly Dublin, which suffers most from this regional imbalance.  Even though approximately 46,000 new jobs were created in Dublin between 1992 and 1996, the unemployment figures have decreased by just under 1,000.  That encapsulates the problem created by the geographical imbalance. <Col N="1592" /> If one adds to that the cost estimated by various commentators of £1 billion per year in lost efficiency because of the increasing gridlock in the Dublin region due to traffic congestion, it points to what is almost a crisis that necessitates a review of this area.  I have been in contact with the IDA on this matter in the past few days.  I would like the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to seriously consider it.</P>
    <P>The companies being attracted to invest here are not the large scale multinationals that invested in the 1960s in the Lemass driven era. We are now attracting high skill, high tech investment that does not have high volume input-out-put in terms of the end product.  The product of large scale multinationals dealing with information technology is imported and exported by means of telecommunication.  The standard of our telecommunications infrastructure is such that the standard in Achill is similar to that in Dublin, west Cork and Donegal.  An argument can be sustained that such large scale multinationals could as easily be attracted to invest in rural locations, where large amounts of money have been invested in building roads, airports, water and sewerage schemes and developing telecommunications, as in Dublin where there is nearly a crisis in terms of social problems associated with overcrowding, environmental problems due to congestion and its consequent cost factor to industry estimated at £1 billion.  I appreciate it is not possible for the IDA to dictate where companies will locate, that they largely retain that authority and it is a bonus if they decide to locate here.  Nevertheless, a regional incentive structure should be built into IDA incentive and grant packages that would go some way towards tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural sector the Government handled the BSE crisis well, particularly in negotiating at EU level and in its financial response by providing additional resources as required.</P>
    <P>Granting milk quotas to small producers was a major problem in agriculture in my constituency in the past year.  I would like the Minister for Finance to seriously consider submissions from the IFA and Macra na Feirme on making additional milk quotas available to small scale producers. Tax incentives should be given to farmers who lease their milk quota to encourage them to lease it through a temporary leasing scheme with the co-operatives rather than leasing it privately.  If such an incentive was given, the margin of advantage would fall in favour of leasing through the co-operatives and they would be obliged to redistribute such milk quotas to small scale producers.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the inconsistencies in Deputy Wallace's contribution.  He referred to and castigated the track record of the 1982-87 Government, particularly on Northern Ireland.  That Government's achievement through the Anglo-Irish Agreement enabled it to get its foot in the door for the first time since the partition of the State in terms of obtaining legitimate and recognised <Col N="1593" /> access to the British Government in terms of being able to raise with it matters of interest.</P>
    <P>It was also interesting that the Deputy criticised the social welfare increases.  One of the new social partners, the INOU, has endorsed what was done in the budget.  The report of the commission on social welfare has hung like a millstone around the necks of successive Ministers, but now all payments are approximately 98 per cent of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter to ensure the money and property seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau is channelled into a special fund dedicated exclusively to the fight against drug abuse.  All the moneys and properties confiscated by the Criminal Assets Bureau under the Proceeds of Crime Bill from the drug barons should be used in the fight against crime.  I hope to table an amendment, if necessary, to the Finance Bill to establish a fund into which the proceeds of all seizures of property and cash confiscated from the drug barons could be deposited and used exclusively in the fight against drugs.  I hope the Minister is receptive to that idea.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau was one of the Minister's ideas and was set out in a Labour Party policy document.  I compliment the Minister on being so forceful in ensuring it was brought forward and enshrined in legislation.  It is the primary plank of the Government's fight against the drug barons.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has put the drug barons under pressure.  No longer are the newspapers full of stories about their fine lifestyles and disregard for the law.  Houses in my constituency put up for sale by the drug barons prior to fleeing the country have been withdrawn on the direction of the bureau.</P>
      <P>We have a long way to go to win the war against drugs, but the results in this context are extremely promising.  It is important to hit the drug barons where it hurts most, in their pockets. At present many of the major drug barons have fled to England, Spain or the Netherlands and we know they are feeling the squeeze because their regular source of income is no longer easily available.</P>
      <P>We must use the proceeds of the activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau to put life back into communities where drugs have been a scourge for so long.  The tax assessment of assets seized under the new legislation is in the region of £3 million. The equestrian centre in Jessbrook alone is valued at approximately £4 million.  The Criminal Assets Bureau is in the process of dealing with substantial sums of money.</P>

    <P>A case could be made for continuing to use Jessbrook as an equestrian centre for the benefit <Col N="1594" /> of socially deprived or disabled young people or to turn it into a treatment centre for recovering addicts or children who might be exposed to drugs.  That is an eminently suitable use to which to put that facility.  It would be valuable if the money seized from drug pushers was seen to filter down to local authorities for use at local level. For example, local facilities in disadvantaged areas, such as sports and play facilities, could be used to a greater degree and more facilities could be put in place.  There are approximately ten play centres lying idle in the Dublin Corporation area. The local health board councillors and so on could use such facilities as treatment centres in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of funds have been directed towards the fight against drugs.  Allocating resources in this manner from the seized proceeds of crime would signal our determination to fight the drug barons and it would show we were united in our efforts to use such funds for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion by Deputy Costello concerning the utilisation by the Government of assets seized from criminals.  This matter has recently given rise to public debate and comment and the motion will allow me the opportunity of explaining the current legal position on this matter and its rationale.</P>
      <P>The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, provides that any property which was directly or indirectly the proceeds of crime or which was acquired with such proceeds may be transferred by the High Court to the Minister for Finance and that any such funds should be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, contains similar provisions in respect of the confiscation or forfeiture of the assets of criminals.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of these two Acts is not to raise money for the Exchequer but to deprive criminals of the assets gained or acquired through criminal activity.  Some of the assets acquired in this way may be the lawful property of other persons and the legislation enacted by the Oireachtas allows a court to dispose of such assets accordingly. It is only where a court directs that such assets should be transferred to the Minister for Finance that such funds accrue to the Exchequer. The legislative provisions requiring me to dispose of seized criminal assets for the benefit of the Exchequer are in line with the principles governing the handling of Government revenues.  In general, all State revenues and receipts are paid into the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution requires and Government accounting principles provide that public moneys be spent only as voted or approved by Dáil Éireann, unless otherwise provided by statute. The so-called earmarking of certain Government revenues for specific Government expenditure purposes is generally avoided.  If the approach suggested was adopted, it would mean that the <Col N="1595" /> treatment of drug victims would be financed, in part at least, by uncertain and variable revenue sources.  Under the Proceeds of Crime Act, it could be up to seven years from the time illegal assets are seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau or the Garda Síochána before any funds are transferred to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, I have every sympathy with what Deputy Costello has proposed.  I agree in principle with the approach he suggests and I will explore his proposals in the context of the constraints I have just mentioned.  If the Deputy wishes to table amendments to the Finance Bill, I would be prepared to entertain them.</P>
    <P>There is a reason for doing this.  If ordinary citizens, many of whom have unique and critically important information, feel that their information and co-operation with the Garda and other authorities would bring about a conviction and a utilisation of the ill-gotten gains for the purposes of the rehabilitation of the victims of drug abuse or prevent other drug barons profiting on the backs of young people, it might ensure a greater level of compliance with the security forces and the Garda and a higher conviction rate in the courts.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, I welcome the spirit of the matter raised by Deputy Costello.  I am disposed in principle to positively investigate it.  There is a public message to be conveyed which will strike a good and responsive chord with ordinary people and I will investigate it accordingly on those terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise this matter and to have a senior Minister to respond.  He has also welcomed Fianna Fáil legislation which was decried not so long ago.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to have to raise this matter in the House, but I have raised it at every other possible level.  I speak on behalf of a family which includes a mentally disturbed 37 year old male whose condition may even be psychotic.  There are two other adults in the family, aged 31 and 32, who also need care.  Their parents are in their 70s and unable to cope with the mentally disturbed male. He requires at the very least respite care for the sake of the parents.  A place in Bawnmore Centre would be the ideal solution but that is currently not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, he is effectively being controlled by medication, but I am concerned that this may not be sufficient.  His parents live in constant fear of what might happen.  I understand that all places in Bawnmore are occupied and that this individual cannot be accommodated. However, the family do not want to have him permanently accommodated and would be satisfied if respite care were provided.  There ought to be another location to which a person such as this could be sent.  Although the staff at the local psychiatric hospital would say that his condition <Col N="1596" /> is not appropriate to their services or facilities, the health boards should make an exception in this case where the elderly parents are unable to cope and accommodate him for two or three weeks.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the handling of the affair over the last two to three weeks.  I have been in constant contact with the health board and the Minister's office.  These people have effectively been abandoned with three mentally disturbed adults in the house, one of whom is behaving in such a manner that the elderly and frail parents are fearful.  The parents feel that the State services have abandoned them and have asked me to pursue on their behalf any avenue open to me.  I am sorry it has come to the stage that I must raise it in the House, but it is a serious matter and warrants a much stronger response from the State than we have had heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this reply on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Shea.  The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in County Clare is a matter, in the first instance, for the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister of State, that the Mid-Western Health Board informed his Department that the person concerned has been assessed as functioning within the moderate mental handicap range and he also has a communication disability.  Both he and his brother attended the Brothers of Charity services approximately seven years ago for several months.  Both men were offered places in the workshop again in 1996, but both declined to accept the placements.</P>
      <P>Although the person concerned is currently living at home, the Minister of State understands from the board that his family have now indicated that they are seeking a day placement as distinct from a residential placement.  He also understands from the board that the person concerned was assessed by the registrar in psychiatry this morning and that he is receiving appropriate medication for his condition.  The board is hopeful that he will be able to avail of a day placement within a few weeks.  It is intended that he will be placed in the Brothers of Charity day services as requested by the family.  If it is subsequently found that he requires a residential place, appropriate arrangements will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap. Additional funding of £56.8 million was invested in the services in the period 1990-6 which has enabled health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential-respite places and 2,300 day care places.  The Government is satisfied that this additional annual funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting services.  An additional £12 million is being made available for <Col N="1597" /> services to persons with a mental handicap in 1997 and £2 million is being used to meet identified needs in existing services.  The remaining £10 million will be used to provide additional services in 1997 including new residential-respite services, new day care services and the continuation of the ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from inappropriate care settings.  The Minister of State is satisfied that this additional funding will again reduce the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting services.  However, he is aware that more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>He has asked the Mid-Western Health Board to keep the Deputy informed of any further developments in the particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the 20,000 of my constituents who live in the Ballymun area I am quickly running out of patience at what seems to be endless delays in deciding the future of the Ballymun estate.  There are 2,800 flats in Ballymun, all of which are over 30 years old.  They comprise 15, eight and four storey blocks.  All the flats have reached the end of their useful lives.  The roofs are in poor condition and several flats on the top storeys have had to be de-tenanted because of their poor condition.  Some of the flats on the next floor have had to be vacated for the same reason. Water is running down the walls and the panels on the fronts of the buildings are cracked.  Water has ingressed into many flats on all floors while the lifts are continuously out of use.  All services are problematic and there is no security in the complex.  The open and high rise nature of the complex renders it impossible to manage properly or to secure in an acceptable way by today's standards.</P>
      <P>Many of the tenants living in Ballymun could be said to be living in third world conditions.  I regularly marvel at the success people in Ballymun make of their lives.  They are up against the odds and it is incredible that so many manage to survive and remain sane in such appalling physical conditions.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Minister of State have taken the trouble to visit Ballymun to view the poor condition of the flats.  Anybody who has visited the flats cannot deny that Ballymun is an urgent project that needs Government attention.  A pilot refurbishment was carried out on part of the estate.  It was considered to be reasonably successful but, at this point, people are of the view that refurbishment is not an option.  The scale of the structural and social problems in the estate is such that only demolition and the building of new housing and low rise flats is an option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation has researched this option thoroughly and has consulted widely by seeking the views of all residents.  The overwhelming view is that it should proceed with the demolition programme. Much of the ground work in that regard has been carried out by Dublin Corporation and <Col N="1598" /> the community fully supports its proposals.  In addition, the other agencies which work in the area are enthusiastic about getting a comprehensive programme for Ballymun under way.  We are not talking about just structural change; we are seeking the type of high quality services that are required in an area such as Ballymun which the people have been denied for so long and to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation and the other agencies involved are poised to commence development. Lack of Government decision is holding back the development.  It is easy to consider this issue in academic or theoretical terms, but insufficient consideration is being given to the people who are living in the horrendous conditions of Ballymun and who have been left in limbo for the last five years while nothing has happened in terms of improving their housing conditions.  Morale in the estate is low.  Governments have neglected the area for many years and there do not appear to be grounds for hope or for expecting better treatment in the system.  That has a devastating effect on the morale of a community.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to make an urgent decision on the future of Ballymun.  The proposals from Dublin Corporation have been with the Government for several months.  They are comprehensive and well researched and they are supported by public representatives in the area. Doing nothing is not an option.  Sooner or later a crisis will arise which will pose a serious threat to people's lives.  That could happen within the next year or so because of the poor condition of the flats.  A decision from the Government is urgently required.  It should give the proposal the goahead. The people of Ballymun deserve nothing less.  Virtually no costs will be incurred this year because, even if the Government approved the proposals today, it would be two years before anybody would get a key to a new home.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister of State to use all her influence to ensure an early decision is made by the Government on this most important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to speak in support of the case made by my colleague, Deputy Shortall, on the need to make an urgent and public decision on the future of Ballymun.  The level of frustration and anger in the community is rising daily because the progress of Ballymun has been stalled for almost four years.  Added urgency has been given to the case by the reports on the condition of the buildings which were made public in the past two weeks.  They indicate that chunks of the panels of the buildings are falling off.  They are sufficiently large to cause danger to the inhabitants.  No matter what we do about Ballymun it will be uninhabitable in a relatively short period of time.  Extra securing and supervision of the buildings will be required in the short to medium term.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has been closely involved with this issue and I look forward to a substantial decision on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>No one doubts the need to improve the Ballymun estate.  Dublin Corporation and the local community have expended considerable effort and energy over the years in developing initiatives for the estate which have helped to maintain a good community interest and involvement in the area.  The problems, however, are complex and require a far-reaching solution.</P>
      <P>The Ballymun estate was constructed in the late 1960s as an urgent response to a critical housing shortage.  It consists of 3,214 dwellings and is unique in Ireland in terms of its scale and construction. Originally intended as a new town, it has failed to reach that status and remains primarily a large housing area beset with many social problems, including a high level of unemployment. The nature of the development and its associated maintenance and management problems have added to the decline of the area.</P>
      <P>A first attempt to tackle the physical problems of the estate was made in the early 1990s, following extensive consultation with the residents.  A pilot improvement scheme for 282 flats, costing almost £7 million, was completed in 1993.  At the instigation of my Department, the corporation appointed consultants to evaluate the pilot scheme and its appropriateness as a solution for the remainder of the estate.  Following the consultants' report, and in light of continuing extensive consultation with the residents, Dublin Corporation in January 1996 proposed to demolish six of the seven tower blocks, replace them with new housing and refurbish the remaining flats in the spine blocks and walk up blocks, at a total cost of about £110 million.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the corporation commissioned an examination by independent engineering consultants of the immediate and long-term structural condition of the precast concrete panels. The consultants concluded that, while the panels are structurally sound, their external leaves require remedial measures to overcome certain defects and to protect against entry of water. They recommended &ldquo;stitching&rdquo; back all the panels in the short-term, within two to three years and, for the longer term, a programme of over-cladding. The extra cost involved in rectifying this would bring the total to £144 million.</P>
      <P>The corporation now believes that refurbishment is no longer an economic option and favours demolition of all the tower and spine blocks, their replacement with new housing and the refurbishment of the walk-up blocks.  Necessary remedial work to the roofs and to &ldquo;stitch back&rdquo; the panels would have to be carried out in the short-term.  The corporation's revised proposals, including necessary remedial measures, are estimated to cost £179 million over a period of eight years.  The proposals are currently under consideration and a decision will be made as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No time will be lost in bringing this matter to finality.  However, it must be recognised that we <Col N="1600" /> are not dealing with a straightforward proposal for the improvement of a housing scheme.  We are considering a major social project which will have implications not only for Ballymun but for the city as a whole.  Housing based proposals alone will not resolve the underlying deficiencies and weaknesses of Ballymun as a major urban area. A more strategic approach is required to secure the future of Ballymun for its community and for the people who will live and work there in the future.  The residents of Ballymun and other local interests are entitled to no less and they will continue to have a role in decisions affecting the future of the community in Ballymun.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise the blockade of Irish hauliers in Spain.  I endeavoured to raise it on the Order of Business this morning but was ruled out of order.  I renew my call to the Minister to request the Department of Foreign Affairs, if it has not already done so, to immediately contact its counterpart in Spain about this serious issue.  A similar problem of hauliers seeking better pay and conditions arose less than three months ago in France.  It is an ongoing issue on the Continent and many of our nationals are caught up in the protests.  As with the French blockade, the blockade in Spain has a severe effect on hauliers who daily go to the Continent.  A large compensation claim has been lodged with the French authorities and something similar may happen in regard to the protest near Bilbao.</P>
      <P>A number of lorries from my constituency are involved, one was in a serious incident in which all the tyres of the lorry were slashed even though the lorry had not been used to try to break the blockade.  The Minister should use her good offices to intervene in this dispute.  The Irish Road Haulage Association is monitoring the matter. It was involved in the French blockade and is also involved in this case.  A diplomatic approach is called for to solve the problem for Irish nationals who are not involved in this dispute but are being used as pawns in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Deputy's concern about this matter and I wish to express my deep concern. The level of violence being used against persons and property is unprecedented and serious.  The level of violence and the number of blockades have increased in recent days.  It has been reported that a Spanish national died this morning following an incident involving a lorry at a blockade.  The details are unclear, but the situation is clearly worsening.  In the light of what is happening there, we must seriously caution Irish haulage companies to carefully consider the situation before embarking for Spain.  Those Irish <Col N="1601" /> companies who have drivers detained there should advise those drivers to exercise caution in the interests of their own safety.  My colleague in the Department issued a statement this morning advising Irish hauliers intending to travel to Spain to contact either the Irish Road Haulage Association or his officials before doing so.</P>
      <P>The strike in Spain began on Thursday, 6 February and was at that stage mainly confined to parts of northern Spain where the union which has taken the industrial action is strongly represented. Border crossings with France and Portugal and some secondary roads were picketed. The action has now become more widespread and the effects are being felt by industry and services throughout the country.  There are serious shortages of fuel and components in the north and food markets are likely to be affected soon.  The origin of the strike is the proposed restructuring of the road haulage industry in Spain.  There have been negotiations with a view to settlement of the dispute.  I understand that representatives of the Spanish administration and transport organisations met today in Madrid, but as yet I have no details of the outcome of today's meeting.</P>
      <P>I realise that major difficulties have been encountered by trucks in entering Spain and reaching their destinations.  I understand from my contacts with the Irish Embassy in Madrid that Irish truck drivers are experiencing delays and that some vehicles have been damaged.  The Irish Road Haulage Association estimates that some 20 Irish lorries are blocked.  Our ambassador in Madrid has had high level contact with the Foreign Ministry to express concern at the effects of the action on Irish drivers and he has been informed that our concerns are being transmitted to the Ministry of the Interior.  On learning of specific delays or damages sustained which have affected Irish truck drivers, the embassy will bring to the attention of the appropriate regional authorities our expectation that the Spanish authorities will take appropriate action to ensure the free and safe circulation of Irish citizens.  Under Spanish law, protection of the freedom of movement of foreign transport is the primary responsibility of regional governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have raised the question of compensation. I expect that the question of compensation <Col N="1602" /> for non-Spanish hauliers held up in Spain will arise.  Claims by Irish hauliers affected by the French blockade last November are being processed by the Irish Road Haulage Association, which has engaged a firm of solicitors and accountants to ensure a uniform, professional approach to the processing of claims.  This approach is designed to give each claim the best chance of success.  All records relating to disrupted journeys are being submitted with each claim.  I expect that the Irish Road Haulage Association will adopt a similar approach in the event of Irish lorries suffering losses in Spain. Experience gained in dealing with the claims against the French authorities will be invaluable in preparing claims against the Spanish.  As regards the statutory situation on compensation in Spain, my understanding is that there is a 1984 law which can be interpreted to provide for compensation for economic losses caused by delays arising out of pickets and demonstrations on roads and borders.</P>
    <P>A major problem for us is the question of how best to effectively intervene in these disputes.  It is a worrying trend that, within the European Union, we are in our third period of disruption in a very short timespan.  It is also of concern to see individuals blocking roads and disrupting trade in pursuit of claims.  Nobody disputes that workers have the right to withdraw their labour in pursuit of legitimate claims but we have a right to expect that such action remains within the law.  Individual worker's rights must be balanced by the rights of others to go about their legitimate business. Clearly, there is a dilemma for Governments faced with the problem of widespread road blockages. Lessons can be learned from the French blockades which took place last November.  In essence, the French dispute was between employers and employees and the French Government was reluctant to force the issue in a contrived way, which might have exacerbated the situation.  The handling of that dispute was satisfactory in hindsight.  I hope that the Spanish authorities adopt a similar approach and that the dispute there is quickly resolved.</P>

      <P>The increase of £685 million in the national debt to which the Deputy refers was a cumulative one composed of an increase of £983 million in 1995 and a decrease of £298 million in 1996.  Thus, not only was the growth in the national debt contained in 1996, it was actually reversed &mdash; the first such fall in the absolute level of national debt in almost 40 years.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, however, that it is not the trend in the absolute level of the national debt which is the most important indicator of debt but the trend in the ratio of debt to GDP or GNP.  The debt ratio measures the relative burden of debt on the economy and the economy's capacity to shoulder it.  On this basis, Ireland's performance in recent years has been exemplary.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the prudent budgetary policies pursued by this Government, and the strong economic growth they helped to generate, the ratio of national debt to GNP fell from 94 per cent at end-1994 to 82 per cent at end-1996.  Over the same period, general Government debt as a proportion of GDP, which is the wider measure of debt relevant for Maastricht purposes, has fallen from 88 per cent to 73 per cent.</P>
      <P>For the future, the Government intends to continue to adhere strictly to the fiscal criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty, a commitment reflected in the 1997 budget which provides for a general Government deficit of just 1.5 per cent of GDP. In this way, the downward trend in the debt burden will be maintained into the future.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the conditions governing the availability of capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of multi-storey car parks are different depending on the location of the car park.  These arrangements can be distinguished as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  The Customs House Docks Area: Sections 41 and 42 of the 1986 Finance Act require that <Col N="1604" /> any car park in this area be &ldquo;...wholly in use for ...members of the public generally...&rdquo;.  Therefore, capital allowances will not apply if parking spaces are rented in corporate blocks on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>2.  The Temple Bar Area: Section 55 (1) of the 1991 Finance Act requires that the car park be &ldquo;...wholly or mainly in use for ...members of the public generally...&rdquo;.  In this context, provided that no more than 49 per cent of spaces are available for renting on a corporate basis, the Revenue Commissioners accept that the term &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; is satisfied.</P>
    <P>3.  Other Designated Areas: Section 41 of the 1994 Finance Act allows relief on the construction or refurbishment of a &ldquo;qualifying premises&rdquo;. Under the terms of this section, a car park is a qualifying premises.  There is no requirement that spaces be made available for the public generally as a condition to granting relief.</P>
    <P>4.  All other areas: Section 41B of the 1994 Finance Act provides capital allowances for multi-storey car parks, either inside or outside the designated areas, where the relevant local authority certifies that the car park has been developed in accordance with criteria laid down by the Minister for the Environment.  The legislation also states that the car park should be &ldquo;...wholly in use for ... members of the public generally ...&rdquo;. Therefore, capital allowances will not apply if parking spaces are rented in corporate blocks on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>Any capital allowances claimed are subject to audit by the inspector of taxes.  The law permits the withdrawal of relief if the claim to capital allowances is not justified.  The Revenue Commissioners are not aware of any breaches of the conditions along the lines referred to by the Deputy.  If the Deputy has specific information that a particular car park is not in use in accordance with the conditions imposed by legislation, he should forward the details to Direct Taxes Administration, Incentives Branch, Dublin Castle, who will have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a suggestion that Ireland might delay its entry into economic and monetary union until whenever the UK decides to join, in return for further EU funding.  The article attributes this suggestion to unidentified sources, who in turn are described as reflecting the supposed <Col N="1605" /> views of unidentified &ldquo;senior German officials and central bankers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Irish Government has received no suggestion to this effect.  The Maastricht Treaty sets out the criteria for taking the decision on which member states will qualify to join Economic and Monetary Union.  Speculation which suggests that this decision will be taken on criteria other than those in the Treaty is groundless.</P>

      <P>The provisions of EU Directives 91/680/EEC and 92/12/EEC, agreed as part of the tax measures establishing the EU Single Market, authorise the continuation, until 30 June 1999, of duty free shopping facilities for intra-Community travellers. This arrangement was agreed to allow the duty free operators time to diversify their activities. In the absence of a proposal from the Commission and an agreement at Council, duty free sales for intra-Community travellers will cease on 30 June 1999.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to terminate duty free or tax free sales for travellers to non-EU destinations in 1999.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is monitoring all aspects of Ireland's position in relation to eligibility for Structural Funds after 1999 and, in this connection, the Government has given close attention to the results of the ESRI estimates of regional GDP for 1991 which were based on an ESRI regional accounts study commissioned by the CSO.  These estimates were published in November 1996 and the main findings of the study were that six of the eight regions examined had <i>per capita</i> incomes below 75 per cent of the EU average in 1991.  However, recent figures indicate that the position has changed significantly since then and that the number of regions below 75 per cent of the EU average would now be fewer.</P>
      <P>In relation to the possible implications of this study for future structural funding, regional accounts are only one element in the situation and the Government is examining all the main aspects, including the use of other measures of income and prosperity, unemployment and the continuing development needs of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current round of structural funding expires at the end of 1999.  Negotiations on the future financing of the EU, in the form of the financial perspective, for the period 2000-2005, will commence when the Intergovernmental Conference concludes, probably in mid-1997.  The detailed negotiations on the Structural Funds will follow and are likely to be protracted.  The Government is developing its strategy for these negotiations to ensure the best possible outcome for Ireland. Ireland has made very good use of Structural <Col N="1607" /> Funds, a fact recognised throughout the Community. However, we still have some way to go before we attain the level of development of the more prosperous regions of the Community.  We will in our negotiations with the Commission and the member states strive to ensure that Structural Funds continue to play an important part in achieving the economic and social cohesion which the Treaty requires and in consolidating the progress already achieved.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Ireland will continue to benefit from Structural Funds after 1999.  It is the Government's intention to ensure that Ireland will adjust to post-1999 with minimum budgetary dislocation.  In this regard, I refer the Deputy to my Financial Statement on the occasion of the budget on 22 January this year where I identified the uncertainty regarding the precise level of EU structural and cohesion funding after the current financial perspective expires in 1999 as an important factor bearing on our future budgetary position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty on European Union sets out the detailed legal framework within which the European Central Bank (ECB) will operate.  In particular, the Treaty provides that the primary objective of the ECB shall be to maintain price stability.  Without prejudice to this objective, the Treaty requires the ECB to support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community: briefly, these are to promote sustainable and non-inflationary growth, a high level of employment and social protection, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among the member states.</P>
      <P>The Treaty also provides that when carrying out its tasks, the ECB shall neither seek nor take instructions from Community institutions, from member states' governments or from any other body.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the ECB is independent in pursuit of its objective of price stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty includes provision for democratic accountability of the ECB.  The president of the ECB must present to the European Parliament an annual report on the activities of the ECB and of the European system of Central Banks.  The report must cover the monetary policy of both the current and the previous year.  The European Parliament is empowered to debate this report.  In <Col N="1608" /> addition, the president of the ECB and the other members of its executive board may, either at the request of the European Parliament or on their own initiative, be called in front of relevant committees of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the president for the time being of the Council of Ministers and a member of the European Commission may participate at meetings of the governing council of the ECB, though they will not have the right to vote.  The president of the council may also submit a motion for deliberation to the governing council.  Finally, there will also be a role for the President of the ECB in relation to meetings of the Council of Ministers, in that he or she will be invited to participate in such meetings when the Council is discussing matters relating to the ECB's tasks and objectives.</P>
    <P>A single currency requires a single monetary policy across the area of the currency, and it is generally accepted that the best contribution which monetary policy can make to maximising sustainable economic and employment growth is to deliver price stability.  It is clearly desirable that the body charged with doing so should be independent of outside influence in the discharge of its duties.  I am satisfied in this context that the provisions of the Treaty represent a reasonable balance between ensuring the democratic accountability of the ECB on the one hand and providing it with the necessary independence on the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest relevant information available on income tax receipts is in respect of the calendar year 1996. The percentage of the combined income tax receipt in 1996 from the PAYE, farming and other self-employed sectors as contributed by each sector was 86.5 per cent from PAYE, 1.7 per cent from farmers and 11.8 per cent from other self-employed.  These figures do not take account of receipts of deposit interest retention tax for which a breakdown between particular classes of taxpayers cannot be ascertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure for PAYE covers more than tax on wages and salaries.  For example, tax paid by directors of close companies is included, as is the tax on other income of employees such as rent and other investment income.  After adjusting for these factors, tax on wages and salaries normally represents about 68 per cent of the take from income tax, excluding deposit interest retention <Col N="1609" /> tax.  The figure for PAYE also includes the tax paid on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>The figure for other self-employed includes tax paid on income from trades and professions other than farming, together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income. It also includes withholding tax on professional fees.  The yield in 1996 from this sector was reduced by approximately £35 million as a result of implementing a High Court ruling to the effect that withholding tax on professional fees should be allowable as a credit against income tax liability on a current year basis.</P>
    <P>The percentage figures given must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in each of the sectors mentioned, which are estimated for the income tax year 1996-97 to be 886,300 in PAYE, 32,000 farmers and 99,500 other self-employed.</P>
    <P>The average individual tax payment from each of these sectors in 1996 is estimated at £4,408 for PAYE, £1,104 for farmers and £4,067 for other self-employed.</P>
    <P>The relevant information available on completed random audits relates to the position at 10 February 1997.  The random audit programme began in 1992.  No new random cases were selected in 1993 for audit due to concentration of resources on work related to the tax amnesty and major restructuring of the audit programme.  The total number of random audits of tax returns from all self-employed persons and companies which were initiated in the years 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1996 was 448.  Some 371 of these have been completed up to 10 February 1997 of which 294 are in respect of all self-employed persons, including farmers.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the random audit is only one element in the overall audit programme. The vast majority of cases selected for audit are selected on the basis of perceived defects in their tax returns or supporting accounts and not on a random basis.  The total number of these comprehensive self-assessment audits initiated since inception in 1990 to the end of 1996 &mdash; excluding companies &mdash; was 14,899.  These are in addition to normal PAYE &mdash; employers and VAT audits. The purpose of the random element of the audit programme is to demonstrate to taxpayers that there is a risk of audit for every self-assessing taxpayer even where incorrect returns have the appearance of being correct.  However, experience suggests that taxpayers' behaviour is influenced more by the perception of Revenue's ability to detect suspect tax returns in a systematic way, rather than by the risk of random selection of a return.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that all their audit programmes, including the random programme, will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are continuing with their overall approach to compliance which has worked so well in recent years &mdash; to make procedures easier for those who are trying to <Col N="1610" /> meet their tax obligations and to pursue people who do not pay on time or at all &mdash; using the various powers available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the post budget estimate for capital gains tax revenue in 1997 is £67 million.  In regard to the cost of a single 20 per cent rate the Revenue Commissioners estimate that this would cost the Exchequer £31 million.  However, it should be pointed out that this reduction in revenue is based on the current level of disposals and takes no account of any behavioural changes which might happen if a single 20 per cent rate replaced the standard 40 per cent and the reduced 27 per cent rates.</P>
      <P>While the nominal rate of capital gains tax might appear high, the reality is that, when account is taken of indexation and other reliefs, the effective rate of capital gains tax is often well below the nominal rates.  A number of reliefs, including the 27 per cent reduced rate of CGT for disposals of equity in certain small and medium sized trading companies have been introduced and extended in the last few years to encourage enterprise and job creation.  These targeted concessions are felt to be more effective than a general rate reduction.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's reference to existing tax avoidance, it is unclear what specific concerns the Deputy has in mind.  On the issue of a single low rate of capital gains tax, in addition to the significant potential reduction in Exchequer revenue the Government must take tax equity considerations into account and the rate should bear a reasonable comparison with the rates applying to earned income, i.e. the prevailing income and corporation tax rates.  A single low rate of CGT would create a real possibility for tax avoidance and consequent loss of revenue to the Exchequer by the conversion of income into a capital gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I remind the Deputy that in my budget this year I cut the reduced rate of CGT from 27 <Col N="1611" /> per cent to 26 per cent.  This reduction will apply to disposals on or after 6 April 1997.</P>

      <P>The level of penalty will vary with the type of audit, the nature of the adjustments to tax liability that may be required, whether they are of a technical nature or more serious, and the degree of co-operation received from the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The 4 per cent average penalties mentioned by the Deputy related to 1994 audits.  In conjunction with the statutory interest charge, which is of a penalty nature, interest and penalties amounted to 23 per cent of the additional taxes collected following audits completed in 1994.</P>
      <P>The 4 per cent average penalty had increased to 10 per cent in 1995 and 12 per cent in 1996. When taken with the statutory interest charge this brought total interest and penalties up to 32 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, of the additional tax liabilities involved.</P>
      <P>This level of penalty imposition is quite significant. Where audit settlements cover a number of years, the capacity of the taxpayer to pay the tax outstanding in addition to a very high amount of statutory interest may be at issue.  Many of the audit settlements are from borrowed funds.  This puts considerable strain on the liquidity of the business concerned.  With the penalty level mentioned the impact of a tax audit is sufficiently significant as to ensure future tax compliance.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the level of penalties is kept under review in conjunction with the various other measures they are taking to promote compliance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the new relief for pre-trading expenses which I announced in the budget. Expenses which are wholly and exclusively incurred for the purpose of a trade or profession not more than three years prior to the commencement of trading and which would have been allowable had they been incurred after trading commenced, will be deductible against the trading income of the business once it commences trading.  I announced in the budget that the relief would be available to businesses which commenced trading on or after 1 April 1997.  Since it was intended to have the details concerning the operation of the relief contained in the Finance Bill which will be published in March, a starting date of 1 April was chosen because it was felt that, as this was a new relief, new businesses which would benefit from it should be aware of its precise application before seeking to avail of it.</P>
      <P>Having considered the matter in light of various representations received since the budget and, in keeping with this Government's commitment to enterprise development, I am prepared to have the relief commence from budget day rather than 1 April to facilitate new businesses which commence trading between 22 January and 1 April.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the &ldquo;commitment given in Dáil Éireann on 21 November 1995&rdquo;, refers to my comments during the Second Stage debate on the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill, 1995, that I would be willing to reconsider the exemption of the Director of Public Prosecutions provided for in the terms of the Bill as published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage which was taken last month, an amendment in my name was agreed which removed the total exemption previously proposed for the DPP.  As a consequence, the Bill now provides for a broadly similar accountability and compellability arrangements to those proposed for the Attorney General.  This means that the Public Accounts Committee would have the <Col N="1614" /> power to compel the Director of Public Prosecutions to appear before it and give evidence relating to matters of general administration. While still respecting the principle that information relating to specific cases remains exempt, it has been possible in this instance to provide for the bringing into the compellability category statistical matters arising from a report which the Government has arranged for the Director to publish at regular intervals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be extremely costly to the Exchequer to provide specific financial incentives to business people who invest in small business premises in rural towns and villages.  As the Deputy will appreciate, <Col N="1615" /> there is a very large number of such towns and villages and there are numerous types of business premises.  Consequently it would not be possible for reasons of the big Exchequer cost involved to introduce such a scheme.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that there is considerable competition for small stores, particularly in regard to the multiple stores that, as the Deputy says, are now located in most provincial centres.  This is a fact of modern commercial life and it also applies in the large cities where some small stores may in fact be located very close to a large multiple branch, unlike the case in rural Ireland where there could be some distance between a rural town or village and the nearest provincial centre.</P>
      <P>In regard to rateable valuations, the position is that the valuation of all commercial property is based on its net annual value i.e. the rental value of the property.  The Valuation Acts provide that any improvements, alterations or change in use that affect the rental value of a property must be taken into account in assessing the rateable valuation. That assessment, which would not necessarily result in an increase in the rateable valuation, would take into account such factors as the operation of the property market and changes in economic conditions.</P>

The primary objective of the review which is currently under way is to provide for a corporation tax structure after these deadlines which will ensure that Ireland remains a competitive location for internationally mobile investment.</P>

      <P>It is a basic principle of Government procurement that a procedure based on competitive tendering should always be used.  The national guidelines, with which all Government Departments must comply, are set out in the official publication &ldquo;Public Procurement&ldquo;&mdash; 1994 edition.  Two types of tendering are permitted under the guidelines &mdash; open tendering and restricted tendering.  In addition to the national guidelines there are EU public procurement directives which, for contracts over certain values, provide that advertisements must be placed in the Official Journal of <Col N="1617" /> the European Communities.  These directives also provide for open and restricted procedures.</P>
      <P>Open tendering takes place when an advertisement is placed in the national and &mdash; or local press and all interested parties may tender. Restricted tendering may take place in two manners &mdash; invitation or pre-qualification.  The former method occurs when a Department or Office invites tenders from firms whom they know to be capable of undertaking the particular contract envisaged.  When this method is used, the contracting authorities concerned must ensure that the list, from which the invitees are drawn, is comprehensive, up-to-date and not discriminatory in nature.  At least five firms should be invited to tender.</P>
      <P>Where a pre-qualification procedure is adopted, a notice of intention to invite tenders is advertised, inviting firms to indicate whether they would be interested in formally bidding for the project.  The contracting authority then invites tenders from those interested firms whom it is satisfied are capable of undertaking and satisfactorily completing the project concerned.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the effect of both the national and EU public procurement regimes is that advertisements for contracts and subsequent assessment procedures are fair, non-discriminatory and equitable.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The expected yield from capital acquisitions tax in 1997 is estimated at £50 million.  In addition, the combined yield from probate tax and discretionary trust tax is expected to be £22 million.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer cost of introducing a single rate of 20 per cent is estimated at £18 million in a full year.  In framing policy in this area, I am conscious of the fact that across the board reductions in capital acquisitions tax rates would benefit equally those receiving productive assets and passive assets.  In recent years, resources have been focused on reducing the impact of taxes on the transfer of businesses so as to encourage the successful development of enterprises from one generation to the next.  In the recent budget I announced that the rate by which business assets can be reduced for capital acquisitions tax purposes is to be increased to 90 per cent.  This means that over the last three budgets business relief has been made vary much more attractive.  It will, in fact, have been increased from a minimum rate of 25 per cent to the proposed new rate of 90 per cent.  This increased relief will also apply to transfers of agricultural property.  It is my view that this targeting of reliefs on the transfer of assets which are likely to assist in the creation of employment is preferable to introducing one single rate of capital acquisitions tax for gifts and inheritances.</P>
      <P>It is unclear to what tax avoidance practices the Deputy is referring.  Under the capital acquisitions tax code the charge is imposed on immovable property as well as the beneficiary to ensure compliance.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, which has been made at EU level regarding the decision taken in December 1996, to the effect that national restrictions, such as the Irish requirement to produce tax clearance certificates prior to receiving certain grants and headage payments, run counter to the Treaty of Rome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The EU Commission raised certain questions about the application of our national tax clearance system to headage and certain other EU payments to farmers.  Following discussions with the Commission, certain modifications were made to the tax clearance rules for these EU payments.</P>
      <P>Applicants for payments over £500 and less than £5,000 are requested to supply their RSI number and a declaration that their tax affairs are in order and applicants for payments over £5,000 are requested to provide a tax clearance certificate. Failure to supply a declaration or tax clearance certificate may lead to a delay in processing the application and to an examination of the applicants tax affairs by the Revenue Commissioners. In relation to RSI, the EU Commission have agreed that failure by the applicant to supply an RSI number will result in the application not being accepted.  The Commission is satisfied with these arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has not specified the type of information transfer in which he is interested, i.e. whether it is normal commercial exchanges or exchanges of information which can be used to verify a taxpayer's return.  Neither is it clear whether the information linking referred to is confined to information from financial institutions.</P>
      <P>I will outline briefly the main range of exchanges between revenue and financial institutions.</P>
      <P>As with any progressive organisation, revenue has a wide range of normal commercial information exchanges with financial institutions: Value Added Tax (VAT) Direct Repayment System; automated Entry Processing (AEP) Debit System; direct Debit Facility; bank GIRO Facility; PAYPATH.</P>
      <P>In addition it has a number of exchanges which relate specifically to verification of taxpayer's returns or the prevention of fraud:</P>
      <P>Third Party Returns:</P>
      <P>Payments in excess of £3,000 for specified services; interest in excess of £500 paid without deduction of tax; acting as intermediary in the opening of foreign accounts.</P>
      <P>Mortgage Interest Returns &mdash; Details of mortgage interest paid.</P>
      <P>Irish finance houses &mdash; arising from the operation of Vehicle Registration Tax, revenue provides information in respect of vehicles to Irish finance houses as a fraud prevention measure.</P>
      <P>Revenue also has a number of computer based exchanges with organisations other than financial institutions.  The main such exchanges are:</P>
      <P>Return of withholding tax details in respect of payments for professional services. PAYE Media Exchange</P>
      <P>&mdash; End of year returns by employers.</P>
      <P>&mdash; PAYE/PRSI allowance entitlements of employees supplied by Revenue to employers.</P>
      <P>Service Charges</P>
      <P>&mdash; Local authorities supply Revenue with details of persons who pay their service charges.</P>
      <P>Health Insurance</P>
      <P>&mdash; Some large employers supply details to Revenue.</P>
      <P>Works Number Tape</P>
      <P>&mdash; This service is provided by Revenue to employers whose computer system operates by reference to their employees' works number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information is matched by various means, as required.  The most efficient and effective method of matching information is using computers.  This, however, may have Data Protection Act implications. Care is accordingly necessary in this area <Col N="1622" /> so as to avoid coming into conflict with the Data Protection Act, 1988.</P>

      <P>The question of the future structure of the State banking sector has been under consideration for some time in the context of developing measures to improve competition in the provision of retail banking services.  This is a very intricate matter involving detailed consideration of the dynamics of the market for banking services and the interactions between the various banks and the markets in which they operate.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken a number of initiatives to improve competition, in particular, the implementation of the Competition Amendment Act, 1996 and the Consumer Credit Act, 1995. The market for financial services in Ireland has also undergone major change over the past few years with increasing market penetration by the building societies and the development of the credit unions as major providers of financial services. There have also been developments in corporate financing due to the increasing presence of European financial institutions in the domestic market. All these developments have resulted in greater competition for domestic institutions and it is clear that, with the globalisation of financial markets and the progress being made on economic and monetary union, such competition can only increase with resultant benefits to both corporate and personal banking customers.</P>
      <P>The State banks are all performing well in what is a buoyant but extremely competitive market and, at this juncture, I do not have firm proposals to alter the status of any of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal aim of the review was to make comparison, in the case of the main commercial State bodies, and other State bodies where statutory provision exists for the control of the remuneration of the chief executives, between the actual remuneration arrangements in place for the chief executives and the arrangements authorised for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review was based on information on the salaries and other benefits actually applying to the chief executives, which was provided, to a large extent in confidence, to the relevant Ministers <Col N="1623" /> by the chairpersons of State bodies.  Analysis of the information in respect of the bodies, apart from Bord na Móna, which was not included in the survey because it has already been dealt with, showed the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;In general, salary levels were in line with approved arrangements but there was a practice of giving some additional benefits without the approved rates being reduced by the value of those benefits, as required by the authorised arrangements.  The additional benefits mostly took the form of extra superannuation cover, VHI cover, income maintenance and accident insurance, home security, personal tax planning advice, club membership and taxable representation allowances.  The extent of the availability of these benefits varied from body to body.</P>
    <P>&mdash;In the case of five State bodies, the basic salaries exceed the authorised rates, mainly as a result of misinterpretation of the arrangements to apply to the chief executives under national pay agreements.  The practice has been that the chief executives, in common with all groups within the remit of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector, are dealt with, in terms of increases and effective dates, under the pay agreements which apply to the public service.  In contrast, the staff of commercial State bodies have come under the pay agreements for the private sector.  That situation has lead to some confusion.</P>
    <P>&mdash;As regards expenses, little came to light in respect of expenses which were unvouched.</P>
    <P>The lastest general report of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector has recently been presented to me and is at present being examined before submission to the Government for general consideration prior to publication.  In the circumstances, it has been decided that the limited divergences from approved arrangements which came to light as a result of the survey of remuneration referred to above will be followed up in the context of the detailed consideration of the recommendations of the review body's report.</P>

      <P>The total borrowings of commercial State bodies as at December 31 1996 were £5,638 million.  The total borrowings of non-commercial State bodies at the same date amounted to £990 million.  This <Col N="1624" /> includes borrowings of £423 million by local authorities from the Housing Finance Agency.  As the Housing Finance Agency is in the commercial State sector its corresponding borrowings of £423 million are included in the debt of that sector. The overall total debt of both commercial and non-commercial State bodies after disregarding this £423 million amounts to £6,206 million.</P>
      <P>The ten major borrowers at 31 December 1996, their borrowings and their average costs of funds are set out in tabular form, a copy of which I will circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to draw meaningful conclusions from these global figures because they reflect, for each body, the timing of its borrowings and the interest rates prevailing at those times. For instance, the debt of some of these bodies includes a significant amount of fixed rate borrowings dating from ten to 15 years ago when borrowing rates were as high as 14 per cent; the debt could also include an appreciable amount raised at very low rates of interest through more recent capital financing instruments such as structured finance leases.  In the case of ACC, the figures include substantial customers' deposits and, as the Deputy will be aware, demand deposits are currently paying very low rates of interest. Finally, some of these bodies have substantial guaranteed borrowings which attract very competitive interest rates.  In sum, the average cost of funds indicated above would not reflect the margins currently being achieved by these bodies in the market.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that all State bodies are currently securing very fine margins in the market and, as older debt comes up for refinancing, it is being replaced by debt financed at a considerably lower cost.</P>

      <P>The publication in this year's budget of projections for the main economic and budgetary aggregates, including expenditure, in 1998 and 1999 marks a significant further step in the move to a full multi-annual planning system.  The expenditure projections for 1998 and 1999 published in the budget represent an objective estimate of the cost in those years of a continuation of the existing level of services under departmental spending programmes and taking account of the additional spending commitments included in Partnership 2000.  They do not take account of the possible cost of any improvements to the existing level of services or of any additional commitments over and above those contained in Partnership 2000. They were arrived at after careful and detailed discussions between my Department and the spending Departments.  I am satisfied that they are as soundly based as possible.</P>
      <P>The projections provide a benchmark which puts the Government in a much better position to consider the overall budgetary and economic impact of any proposed new spending policies.</P>
      <P>The multi-annual approach operates on the basis of a rolling three-year planning cycle and the projections for 1998 and 1999 published with this year's budget will be subject to review and update as the three-year cycle progresses.  The published expenditure figures are not spending targets.  The target rate of growth of gross current supply services spending over the period 1997-9 is set out in Partnership 2000, namely, to keep the annual growth as close as possible to 2 per cent in real terms, any excess in this figure in 1997 being minimised and the aim for 1998 and 1999 being to hold to an average annual 2 per cent rate.</P>

      <P>The vote classification of expenditure on supply services, as published in the annual Book of Estimates, reflects the ministerial-departmental allocation of functions and responsibilities at the time.  The vote or supply estimates are the basis of the statutory authority for the appropriation of money to meet most expenditure by Government Departments and certain related bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no immediate plans to revise or update the existing vote presentation.  However, there are a number of developments in relation to the Government's programme of financial reforms under the Strategic Management Initiative which, in due course, may involve some changes in the existing vote presentation of supply services.  In <Col N="1626" /> particular, the move to a multi-annual budgeting, which I announced in my 1996 budget and which was further developed in this year's budget, may require some revision in the way in which the supply estimates are presented.  Also, developments in relation to accrual accounting will involve changes in the traditional cash-based presentation of Departmental expenditure.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise, however, that for legal reasons it will not be possible to move away completely from the traditional cash-based presentation of the supply estimates.  The type of changes which may emanate from the Government's financial management reform programme would be additions to rather than replacements of the existing vote accounting system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">

      <P>The Government's policy in relation to taxation is set out in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  The programme stresses the need to reform the tax system, in particular to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on those with low incomes. Tax reform will favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap, aim to reduce the tax wedge and encourage enterprise development.</P>
      <P>The main principles underpinning my three budgets have been to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.  In these budgets I have introduced significant measures to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on employment.  Such measures have included considerably increasing personal allowances and exemption limits, widening the standard rate band and reducing the standard rate of income tax.  A new PRSI-free allowance was introduced in 1995 and increased to £80 per week for most employees in the 1996 budget.  In addition, in this year's budget I also reduced the main rate of employees' PRSI by 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>As a result of these measures the tax burden, for example of a single person on the average industrial wage will have been reduced from 31.3 per cent in 1994 to an estimated 27.2 per cent of gross income in 1997.  In the case of a married couple, one earner, two children, on the same income level the tax burden will have fallen from 23.4 per cent in 1994 to 20.1 per cent in 1997. This represents continuing real progress towards making employment more attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, with a view to improving competitiveness, I reduced in the 1995 budget the standard rate of corporation tax by 2 per cent to 38 per cent, and in 1996 introduced a reduced rate of 30 per cent for the first £50,000 of companygroup income otherwise liable to the standard <Col N="1627" /> rate.  In this year's budget I announced further reductions of 2 per cent in both the standard rate of corporation tax to 36 per cent and in the reduced rate to 28 per cent.  These reductions will assist competitiveness, especially in the services sector where the potential for generating additional employment is most significant.</P>
    <P>More needs to be done, of course, towards improving further our competitiveness and the incentive to work.  In Partnership 2000 the Government has agreed to introduce, over the period of the programme, personal tax reductions of £900 million on a full year basis.  This year's budget took a significant step towards implementing this undertaking, in that the personal tax reductions introduced amounted to £393 million on a full year basis.  It is planned that the remainder of the personal tax reductions will be provided over the 1998 and 1999 budgets.</P>

      <P>I am aware of anecdotal evidence which suggests that employers in certain sectors are having difficulties in filling vacancies.  Why this is so is not always clear and several factors have been put forward in explanation.  While some blame the interaction of the social welfare and taxation systems which can create a disincentive for certain people, especially those with children, to accept an offer of employment, others offer different explanations. In any event, this Government have acted to alleviate the disincentive effects of the tax and social welfare systems which have arisen over a number of years.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy in relation to taxation is set out in the <i>Programme, a Government of Renewal</i>.  The programme stresses the need to reform the tax system, in particular to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on those with low incomes. Tax reform will favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap, aim to reduce the tax wedge and encourage enterprise development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main principles underpinning my three budgets have been to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.  In these budgets, I have introduced significant measures to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on employment.  Such measures have included considerably increasing personal allowances and exemption limits, widening the standard rate band and reducing the standard rate of income tax.  A new PRSI-free allowance was introduced in 1995 and increased to £80 per week for most employees in the 1996 budget.  In addition, in this <Col N="1628" /> year's budget I also reduced the main rate of employee PRSI by 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>As a result of these measures, the tax burden, for example of a single person on the average industrial wage have been reduced from 31.3 per cent of gross income in 1994 to an estimated 27.2 per cent in 1997.  In the case of a married couple, one earner, two children, on the same income level, the tax burden will have fallen from 23.4 per cent in 1994 to 20.1 per cent in 1997.  This represents continuing real progress towards making employment more attractive.</P>
    <P>More needs to be done, of course, towards improving further our competitiveness and the incentive to work.  In Partnership 2000, the Government have agreed to introduce over the period of the programme, personal tax reductions of £900 million on a full-year basis.  This year's budget took a significant step towards implementing this undertaking, in that the personal tax reductions introduced amounted to £393 million on a full year basis.  It is planned that the remainder of the personal tax reductions will be provided over the 1998 and 1999 budgets.</P>
    <P>Another important step taken in this year's budget, is the first step in the reform of the Family Income Supplement agreed in Partnership 2000.  This reform will change the way in which FIS is calculated from a gross income basis to a net income basis.  This first step will mean that FIS will now be calculated on income net of PRSI and levies and coupled with an increase of £10 per week in the income threshold will mean a minimum increase of £6 per week in the vast majority of cases.  These changes in FIS, by exceeding the relevant social welfare rate increases, will make it more attractive for people with families to take up employment.  For example, when the increases announced in the budget take effect, a single income family with two children in receipt of long-term UA who take up employment at the relatively low sum of £150 per week will, when FIS is included, have a take home pay of almost £60 per week more than their previous social welfare payment.  Even allowing for the loss of some secondary benefits, this is a significant improvement and, hence a real incentive to return to work.</P>
    <P>In addition to the changes in the Family Income Supplement which I have just mentioned, another important improvement which impinges on the work incentives is the way in which child income support has been changed.  This Goverment have set about a policy of increasing child benefit while freezing the child dependant allowances associated with social welfare payments. Since child benefit is not dependent on the income or employment status of the parent, it does not contribute to the poverty trap.  Including the changes announced in this year's budget, child benefit has been increased by 50 per cent for the first two children and by 56 per cent for third and subsequent children since this Government have taken office.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, this Government has made significant <Col N="1629" /> progress to date in the reform of the tax and welfare systems, within the financial constraints placed on us.  This should make work more attractive to those on social welfare payments. We are also committed to further improving the incentive to work through the future reform of the tax and welfare systems planned in Partnership 2000.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the likely consequences for Ireland if the United Kingdom decides not to enter into an economic and monetary union with the other member states of the EU.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility that not all member states would participate in economic and monetary union from the outset was, of course, made explicit in the Treaty on European Union.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom Government has indicated that the question of whether the UK will participate in economic and monetary union, economic and monetary union, from 1 January 1999 will not be decided until closer to that date. It has not indicated that the UK will never enter economic and monetary union, nor even that it will not enter in 1999.</P>
      <P>It is relevant that the Treaty sets out a framework for the co-ordination of member states' economic policies to help ensure stability within the European Union as a whole.  Under the Treaty, member states, whether participating in economic and monetary union or not, are obliged to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and to co-ordinate them within the Council.  In particular, they are obliged to treat their exchange rate policies as a matter of common interest.</P>
      <P>The implementation of these obligations was clarified by the agreement at the Dublin European Council on a new Exchange Rate Mechanism, and on the stability and growth pact, which <i>inter alia</i> includes provision for more effective monitoring of the budgetary and economic performance of member states, whether participating in economic and monetary union or not.  The Council and the Commission are considering further the methods for the effective surveillance of exchange rate developments.  The arrangements being put in place will help foster price and exchange rate stability.  In the context of Ireland joining economic and monetary union where the UK remainded outside, they offer the prospect of helping to promote orderly exchange rate relations between the euro and sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the consequences for Ireland if the UK decides not to enter economic and monetary union, the Deputy will recall that last year, on the Government's behalf, I commissioned the ESRI to conduct a study on the implications of economic and monetary union for Ireland.  The <Col N="1630" /> resulting report, &ldquo;The Implications for Ireland of economic and monetary union&rdquo;, is a comprehensive analysis of the impact of economic and monetary union on the Irish economy.  A copy of the report was sent to every member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The report examined the implications for Ireland of a number of membership scenarios, including the situation where Ireland joined economic and monetary union but the UK did not do so.</P>
    <P>Taking as a benchmark a situation where both Ireland and the UK were outside economic and monetary union, the report made a quantified assessment of the balance of economic advantage from Irish participation, both together with the UK and in the context of UK non-participation. In relation to the latter it assessed the likely costs of the loss of currency autonomy, both in a scenario where sterling expressed a severe depreciation and by reference to historic experience.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report concluded that membership of economic and monetary union for Ireland would, on balance, be economically advantageous even were the UK to remain out and with allowance made for possible sterling-euro exchange rate turbulence.  The ESRI conclusion was reinforced by its view that the unquantifiable implications of economic and monetary union membership for Ireland &mdash; including the convenience of a common currency, the impact of Ireland's commitment to Europe and increased currency stability on business confidence and investment, as well as wider intangible political factors &mdash; were also likely to be positive. However, the ESRI report makes clear that while the overall impact of economic and monetary union membership would be positive for Ireland even if the UK remained outside, a sharp fall in sterling against the euro would give rise to significantly greater problems in some sectors of the economy than in others.  The challenge to all concerned, including Government, is to continue working to minimise the exposure of the sectors concerned.</P>

      <P>I and my Department are in close, ongoing contact with Amnesty International and other NGOs in regard to human rights in China, Turkey and in other areas of the world.  We very much value that dialogue with the NGO community, <Col N="1631" /> which represents an important input into the formulation of Irish foreign policy.</P>
      <P>We share the concern of Amnesty International regarding the human rights records of China and Turkey and I would like to outline the Government's approach on what are separate situations.</P>
      <P>As regards China, Ireland and our EU partners have been pressing strongly and actively for substantial improvements in the general human rights situation there and in individual human rights cases.  Individual cases of human rights abuses are raised with the Chinese authorities.  To focus attention on the issue, the EU has tabled a draft resolution at each annual session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for a number of years.  However, because of blocking action by China, no resolution has yet been adopted by the Commission.  Nonetheless, the process of drafting a resolution has in itself been a means of drawing attention to our concerns and the issues raised by Amnesty and others have been reflected in our proposals.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the EU has made every effort to resume a formal dialogue with China on human rights &mdash; including during Ireland's Presidency last year &mdash; as a means of bringing about progress in respect of the many issues of concern. An EU ministerial troika will meet with the Chinese side <i>en marge</i> of the ASEM Conference in Singapore this week.  Human rights will be an important element of the agenda for that meeting. The response received at the meeting to EU requests for substantial improvements will influence how the European Union decides to proceed in regard to this year's session of the Commission on Human Rights, which takes place in Geneva from 10 March to 18 April.  However, on present indications I do not see any basis for a different approach by the EU at the Commission on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Human rights in Turkey is also a matter of serious concern and has consistently been raised by the EU in its contacts and dialogue with the Turkish authorities at all levels.  During the Irish Presidency, I had occasion at several meetings with the Turkish Government to make clear our concerns in this regard.  Serious issues have been highlighted by recent reports on Turkey concerning disappearances, torture and violations of human rights and freedoms.  With our partners in the European Union, we have repeatedly made clear to the Turkish Government that observance of the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms are crucial for the further development of the Union's relations with Turkey.  We have urged Turkey to take early measures to improve protection of human rights for the Turkish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Turkish Government has recently indicated publicly that it will take further initiatives to promote human rights in Turkey and, in particular, in relation to the issue of torture.  We wish to see such reforms adopted and implemented <Col N="1632" /> with all possible speed as part of an ongoing process of reform of legislation and full implementation of democratic freedoms and human rights.</P>
    <P>As regards the option of tabling a draft resolution at the UN Commission on Human Rights, since such a procedure is not an end in itself, it is a matter for consideration and judgment as to the best and most effective means of achieving the goal of improving the human rights situation in a particular country.  To date, the EU has not taken the option of tabling a draft resolution on Turkey at the Commission, preferring, as I indicated above to bring pressure to bear directly through bilateral contacts and organised dialogue with the Government of Turkey.  The Union will shortly be consulting on its approach to the forthcoming session of the commission in Geneva and it is likely that Turkey will be discussed in that context.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that Ireland and its EU partners will continue to give priority to seeking progress on the human rights situation in Turkey and will keep under review the means to be adopted to achieve this.</P>
    <P>I will keep the House fully informed of developments on Turkey and China and other issues relating to the promotion of human rights.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy that the Government has consistently supported initiatives aimed at promoting the economic regeneration of the Border counties, North-South economic co-operation, and consolidation of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland was established by the Irish and British Governments in 1986, with the aim of promoting economic and social advance in Northern Ireland and the Border <Col N="1633" /> counties, and encouraging contact, dialogue and reconciliation between all communities throughout Ireland.  The fund has received contributions from the European Union, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.  The fund has already provided a total of £300 million overall, of which approximately £90 million was allocated to the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, established by the European Union in 1995, is aimed at Northern Ireland and the Border counties. It involves a total EU expenditure of approximately £240 million over three years.  At least £48 million of this funding is available for the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The Joint Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme, established under the Structural Funds, has approved EU funding for the Border counties for the six years 1994-99, of approximately £72 million.  In addition to the EU funding, the Government is committed to the provision of matching funding.  The total amount of public funding available, therefore, to the Border counties under this programme, exceeds £100 million.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that the EU Community Support Framework for Ireland, 1994-99 includes a commitment to maximise the opportunity for beneficial co-operation with Northern Ireland. The scope for intensifying this co-operation will be addressed in the mid-term review of the CSF which is under way, and which is due for completion around the middle of 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition, the US Government has supported the peace process through measures to develop trade and investment between the United States and the region.  President Clinton held the White House Conference on trade and investment in May 1995.  The US Department of Commerce held a further economic conference in Pittsburgh in October.  Both conferences were successful in helping to encourage business partnerships between US and Irish companies.</P>
    <P>In order to assist people applying for these various funding programmes in the Border region, the Taoiseach, in February of last year, asked the Minister with responsibility for western development and rural renewal, Deputy Carey, to chair a task force on funding arrangements in the region. The task force reported to the Government in July, and the Government accepted its recommendations. The recommendations are designed to make the application process as clear and simple as possible for people applying for funding in the region.</P>
    <P>In December last, Minister Carey hosted an information seminar in Monaghan, on the range of funding programmes available.  The seminar also gave people an opportunity to identify better ways of co-ordination and collaboration across programmes, and to identify opportunities for cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>The range of activities I have outlined indicates that the Government has consistently supported initiatives aimed at actively promoting economic <Col N="1634" /> regeneration of the Border counties.  North-South economic co-operation, and consolidation of the peace process.  I can assure the Deputy that these initiatives will be continued, and be vigorously promoted by the Government, to ensure that the maximum possible benefit is realised.</P>

      <P>Exchange rate movements can have a significant impact on inflation, especially in an open economy such as Ireland where exports and imports of goods and services together account for over 160 per cent of GNP.  Other things being equal, a sustained trade-weighted exchange rate depreciation can be expected to lead to higher inflation, and a sustained trade-weighted exchange rate appreciation to lower inflation.</P>
      <P>However, measuring the effect of exchange rate changes on inflation is complex.  It is difficult to estimate the CPI effect of a given change in a bilateral exchange rate, since for example other bilateral exchange rates may simultaneously move in a different direction.  In addition the other determinants of inflation would also have to be examined in the context of any given set of exchange rate movements to assess the net impact on the CPI.  These determinants include factors such as the level of wages, productivity changes and the degree of competition in the market place.</P>

      <P>The transfer of all second hand residential property in excess of £150,000 will be liable to the new rates of stamp duty.  In addition, new residential property with a floor area in excess of 125 square metres will also be liable to these new rates if either the site value of the property, or one quarter of the aggregate of the site value and the construction costs exceed £150,000.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the regional dispersion of the transfer of residential property in excess of £150,000 I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information is not collected in a format which would provide an answer to the specific question.  However, I would expect that the vast majority of such properties are located in urban areas where the value of residential property is generally at a premium.  The Government is satisfied that these new rates, which are being introduced to recoup most of the loss in revenue to the Exchequer as a result of the abolition of residential property tax, are an appropriate means of addressing the need to raise revenue from residential property.</P>

      <P>The third stage of economic and monetary union, European Monetary Union, is due to commence on 1 January 1999.  On that date, the single currency, the euro, will come into being and the exchange rates of the currencies of the member states participating in Economic and Monetary Union will be irrevocably fixed against it.</P>
      <P>The Treaty on European Union sets out criteria by reference to which member states' fitness for participation in economic and monetary union, in terms of achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence, will be judged. Briefly, the criteria are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  the general Government deficit must not <Col N="1636" /> exceed 3 per cent of GDP unless it has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level close to 3 per cent, or unless the excess over 3 per cent is small, exceptional and temporary;</P>
    <P>(ii) the ratio of general Government debt to GDP must be below 60 per cent or, if above, must be sufficiently dimishing and approaching 60 per cent at a satisfactory pace;</P>
    <P>(iii)  price performance must be sustainable and, for a year before the examination of fitness for economic and monetary union, average inflation &mdash; as measured by the consumer price index on a comparable basis &mdash; must not exceed by over 1.5 per cent that of the three best-performing member states;</P>
    <P>(iv)  for a year before the examination, the average nominal long-term interest rate must not exceed by more than 2 per cent that of the three best-performing member states in terms of price stability; and</P>
    <P>(v)  the currency must without severe tensions have respected the normal fluctuation margins of the ERM for two years before the examination and its central rate must not have been devalued on the member state's initiative against any other member state's currency in that period.</P>
    <P>The European Commission and the European Monetary Institute will report on the achievement of a high degree of convergence by reference to the fulfilment by member states of these criteria.  These reports will also take account of the compatibility of member states' legislation with the Treaty requirement for Central Bank independence, the development of the ECU, the results of integration of the markets, the situation and development of the balance of payments on current account and an examination of the development of unit labour costs.</P>
    <P>In spring 1998, the Council, meeting in the composition of the heads of state or Government will decide, taking due account of these reports and the opinion of the European Parliament and on the basis of ECOFIN recommendations, which member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency.  The decision of Council will be based on the most recent and reliable data for 1997.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that Ireland should continue to meet the conditions for entry into economic and monetary union.</P>

      <P>While reducing the national debt is a worthy objective, it is one which should only be pursued with due regard to other policy considerations.  Given the remaining development needs of our economy, there are areas where expenditure funded by borrowing is both necessary and justified in order to develop the human and physical infrastructure crucial to the continued growth of the economy. The Deputy will, therefore, appreciate that it is not the trend in its absolute level which is the most important indicator of debt that the trend in the ratio of debt of GDP or GNP, a ratio which measures the relative burden of debt on the economy.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy is to continue to reduce the general Government debt to GDP ratio towards 60 per cent at a satisfactory pace, as required by the Maastricht Treaty.  This ratio stood at 73 per cent at end 1996.  In &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo;, the following medium-term forecasts of the debt ratio, on the present basis of computation, were given:</P>

    <P>However, in 1999, new accounting conventions for Maastricht reporting purposes will be introduced. The resultant changes in the measurement of the values of general Government debt and GDP are likely to add some 7 per cent to the general Government debt/GDP ratio in 1999. These technical changes will not affect the underlying downward trend in the ratio, the size of which, as indicated in Partnership 2000, could be reduced to 60 per cent early in the 21st century.</P>

      <P>All relevant tax reduction options, including the possible reduction of the 48 per cent income tax rate, were considered in the run-up to the 1997 budget. However, the Government decided that a more equitable distribution of tax reductions was achievable through a combination of increasing personal allowances, widening the standard band and reducing both the standard income tax rate and the main rate of employees' PRSI.  It is not possible to forecast what changes may be made to the <Col N="1638" /> higher rate of income tax in future budgets.

      <P>DIRT is necessary to collect the taxation due on deposit interest income.  Deposit interest is normally subject to a retention tax at the standard rate of 27 per cent.  In addition, individuals may deposit up to £50,000 in a special savings account, which is subject to a special low DIRT rate of only 15 per cent.  DIRT satisfies an individual's full liability to income tax in respect of deposit interest income.</P>
      <P>The net yield from DIRT in 1996 was £128.5 million.  Without a major search of records it is difficult to determine definitively if any proposals have ever been received in recent years to abolish this major source of tax revenue.</P>
      <P>As regard the withholding tax on professional services, the Deputy will appreciate it does not represent an additional tax liability but rather the payment of tax on account and this tax will be available for set-off against the taxpayer's final liability.  A number of representations have been received proposing changes in the way that this tax is applied.  However, I do not propose to make any changes at present.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will of course be aware that the reduction of 1 per cent to 26 per cent in the standard rate of income tax which I announced in the budget will also apply to the withholding tax and to the standard rate of DIRT.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my statement of 19 December 1996 on this matter, an interdepartmental expert group dealing with telecommunications matters, and chaired by my Department, is currently addressing the question of equal cost telephone access for the public to Government offices, Dáil Question No. 35, ref. 24927/96 of that date refers.  While <Col N="1639" /> preliminary indications suggest that the provision of such a facility would place a significant burden on the Exchequer, I am hopeful that the group will find a basis for progress in this area.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of the Limerick office of the Revenue Commissioners, the availability of access at local call rate to this office for subscribers in the Dublin area is a beneficial byproduct of the decision to introduce the Government telecommunications network, or GTN.  This network provides efficient and cost-effective communications services to Government offices throughout the country and primarily to decentralised offices, such as the Revenue Commissioners office in Limerick.  Department head offices in Dublin use the GTN to transfer telephone calls to decentralised offices at no extra cost to the caller.  Individual Departments bear the costs of providing such facilities to their clients.</P>

      <P>In general, entry to the Civil Service must be by way of open competition.  Section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, as amended by the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973 provided for the reinstatement to their former positions of women who resigned from the Civil Service for marriage-related reasons and who fulfilled specific criteria.  The person concerned applied for reinstatement under the statutory provisions but did not qualify for reinstatement. The Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act, 1996, repealed the statutory provisions and, consequently, the only avenue of re-entry to the Civil Service now open to the person concerned is by competing in and being successful at an open competition run by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To alleviate the consequences of the repeal of the reinstatement scheme, the next two series of clerical assistant and executive officer competitions <Col N="1640" /> will include provision for special subpanels which will be composed solely of former civil servants but will not differentiate on grounds of gender or marital status.  It is hoped that this initiative will go some way towards facilitating the re-entry to the Civil Service of women, such as the person concerned, who resigned on marriage. As the Deputy is aware, competitions for recruitment to the Civil Service are run by the Civil Service Commissioners and are advertised in the daily papers from time to time.  It is envisaged that competitions for appointment as executive officer and clerical assistant will be advertised during the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the child abuse guidelines issued by my Department in 1987, health boards currently maintain lists of suspected and confirmed cases of child abuse.  Their purpose is to monitor and follow-up on reported cases of children at risk and to provide data for research and planning.  Such lists are reviewed annually by the director of community care or delegated officer in consultation with senior personnel from the community care teams.  When families with children who are considered to be at risk change residence and move to another community care area, the information on the list is passed on to the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>The report of the Kilkenny incest investigation acknowledged current practice in this regard and recommended the standardisation of child abuse registers and the introduction of certain safeguards into the system.  It also recommended the revision of the Department's child abuse guidelines. I have previously announced that the new social services inspectorate will review the 1987 child abuse guidelines.  An examination of the current system of child abuse registers will be undertaken by the Inspectorate in the light of the issues which arise in the review of the child abuse guidelines.</P>

Information is only available on the methadone dispensed through the General Medical Services scheme.  A detailed examination of the dispensing of methadone during October 1996 by the GMS showed that five pharmacies dispensed in that period as follows:</P>

    <P>The reply to Question No. 103 of 4 February noted that there were eight pharmacies in Postal District 8 which dispensed methadone, but during the month of October 1996, which was taken for the purpose of this reply, only five pharmacies in that district dispensed.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has four main treatment centres where methadone is dispensed on site.  These are at Amiens Street, Baggot Street, Aisling Clinic in Ballyfermot and Ballymun.  Trinity Court, which is managed by the Drug Treatment Centre, also dispenses methadone on site in Pearse Street.  With the exception of Baggot Street all treatment centres dispense methadone on a seven day basis, where necessary, and the ingestion of the methadone is supervised on site at the treatment centres.</P>
    <P>General practitioners who work in satellite clinics for the health board do so on a contract basis and prescribe methadone which can be dispensed at any retail pharmacy.  This is carried out on a very structured basis with treatment cards and a contract with the client is arranged.  The pharmacy referred to by the Deputy does not exclusively provide a methadone service for the Eastern Health Board, rather it dispenses methadone as it would any other medication on foot of a properly written doctor's prescription.  At present any general practitioner can prescribe methadone and this methadone can be dispensed at any retail pharmacy.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is in the process of encouraging more pharmacists to dispense methadone.  It is the board's policy to encourage drug users to use the nearest chemist to where they live rather than transferring to another area. The board is also in consultation with local groups in the Inchicore area regarding the establishment of treatment facilities in the area.  It is intended to site these facilities at the Inchicore Health Centre.</P>
    <P>A review is currently under way to examine the role of general practitioners and pharmacists in the provision of services for drug misusers.  The review will examine present practice in relation to the prescribing and dispensing of methadone and will advise on how the present system can be expanded, with the appropriate controls, to encourage more doctors and pharmacists to become involved in the treatment of drug misusers.</P>

      <P>Under the Wildlife Act, 1976, deer are a protected species and as such cannot be hunted without a licence issued under the Act. Poaching or illegal hunting of deer can take many forms such as hunting without a licence, hunting on lands for which the hunter does not hold permission to hunt or hunting at night using lamps etc.  It is the policy of the national parks and wildlife service of my Department to prosecute where evidence of illegal deer hunting is available.  In Wicklow, where forestry areas provide the habitat for significant numbers of deer, there is anecdotal evidence of a perceptible increase in the poaching problem.  Anti-poaching patrols by NPWS ranger staff have been stepped up which together with the ongoing assistance and co-operation of the Garda Síochána will hopefully provide the necessary evidence for prosecutions to be brought before the courts.  In this regard, I will be proposing that the penalties currently prescribed for offences such as illegal hunting under the 1976 Act, will be increased substantially under the terms of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1997 which I hope to publish shortly.</P>

      <P>Regarding Lahard, Ballinamore, the council was notified last February that as only one house in the estate is in its ownership, its application was not eligible for funding under the scheme which applies only to certain groups of local authority dwellings.  However, as I recently informed a deputation from the council, certain works to privately owned dwellings may qualify for funding under the improvement works in lieu scheme.</P>

      <P>All development, except development specifically exempted under the planning Acts or regulations, requires planning permission.  Section 4 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 sets out certain development which is to be regarded as exempted development and it enables the Minister for the Environment to provide, by regulations, that any class of development is to be exempted development.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1997 which I made and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas yesterday, provide that, with effect from today and subject to strict limitations, the addition of antennae for mobile telephony to an existing radio mast, and the replacement of an existing mast, are to be exempted development.</P>
      <P>These new regulations give statutory support to the policy of co-location which was advocated in the Guidelines on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures published by my Department last July, to avoid unnecessary proliferation of masts.  Sharing of masts reduces the number required and minimises the impact on the environment and landscape.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is proceeding with the devolution to local authorities of full responsibility for the administration of grants for group water and sewerage schemes and for small public schemes. There is no reliable estimate at this stage of the cost of upgrading all deficient group water supplies to recognised standards.  Managers are being consulted in working out the detailed arrangements for the implementation of the devolution measures which will be put into full effect as soon as possible.  I am not yet in a position to decide the financial allocations to individual local authorities for 1997 in respect of group schemes, but these will reflect, among other things, existing commitments on foot of approvals already issued by my Department.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is employed as a residential care staff member in one of the five special schools for young offenders.  The special schools superannuation schemes were formulated to provide a superannuation code for the non-teaching staffs of these special schools.  The schemes are loosely based on the Civil Service superannuation code for unestablished staff (i.e. staff who pay full PRSI contributions) and consist of a main pension scheme and a spouses' and children's scheme.  Membership of the superannuation schemes is compulsory for all permanent non-teaching staff in the schools who are under <Col N="1667" /> 60 years of age on appointment.  The person in question is a member of the schemes.  Retirement is compulsory for all members when they reach 65 years of age.</P>
      <P>A member who has completed at least five years' pensionable service and who retires on or after reaching 60 years of age shall be eligible to receive a pension calculated as follows: retiring salary minus twice the annual old age pension rate multiplied by the number of years pensionable service, divided by 80.  The member shall also be eligible to receive a lump sum calculated as follows: retiring salary multiplied by number of years pensionable service multiplied by three divided by 80.  In addition to the entitlements under the special schools superannuation schemes, members are also entitled to apply for receipt of a contributory old age pension from the Department of Social Welfare on reaching the required age.  Determination of eligibility for receipt of a contributory old age pension is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year. I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wide range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of <Col N="1668" /> specialneeds, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Question Nos. 101 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of each £1 per week increase in the living alone allowance is £5.4 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that each £1 increase in child dependant allowances would cost approximately £21 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Consideration is given to a wide variety of proposals each year in the context of the budget and decisions are made in accordance with their relative priority in the light of the available resources. The cost of the budget improvements this year, almost £114 million in 1997 and £215 million in a full year, represents the largest increase ever allocated for social welfare purposes in a single budget.</P>

      <Quest>the Minister who introduced the ruling that a person has to enter insurable employment for the first time after reaching the age of fifty-six to qualify for a PRSI refund; and the way in which many people have availed of this scheme since it was introduced.</Quest>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least 10 years before reaching pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.  Since the introduction of the old age (contributory) pension in 1961 there has been provision for the refund of the old age pension portion of the social insurance contribution <Col N="1672" /> where a person enters social insurance for the first time less than 10 years before pension age provided they do not qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The initial regulation in that regard (SI 139 of 1961) was signed by the then Minister, Mr. Seán McEntee.  As the Deputy will be aware, pension age at that time was 70 years.  It was reduced to age 66 on a gradual basis during the period 1973 to 1977.  The regulation providing that self-employed persons would qualify for a refund unless they had no contributions prior to 1988 was first introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Michael Woods, in 1990.</P>
      <P>In my budget speech, I announced that in relation to the self-employed any person who was over 56 in April 1988, when insurance for the self-employed was introduced, and who also had paid social insurance at the full rate at any stage between 1953 and 1988, will receive a refund of the pensions element of their Class S social insurance contributions, provided, of course, that they do not qualify for an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  Up to now their earlier contributions would have prohibited them from receiving such a refund.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind and can pass on the relevant details I would be happy to have the situation of the person concerned checked out.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Government decision of 1 August 1996, an initial evaluation of the local employment service in the original 14 areas was undertaken late last year.  Forfás undertook this evaluation which is just completed.  The terms of reference for Forfás in undertaking the evaluation were to address the following questions: (i) based on the experience of the LES to date, can any conclusion be drawn as to whether it is likely, over time, to achieve the goals and objectives set for it; (ii) to what extent is the objective of greater co-operation and co-ordination among State sector providers being met, with particular reference to the SMI objective in this regard; (iii) are there lessons to be learnt from the LES experience to date for the future expansion of the service nationwide.</P>
      <P>There was no additional cost involved for the State in this evaluation as Forfás undertook the exercise from within its existing resources.</P>

      <P>The article in question is incorrect and is based on inaccurate comments about the operation of REPS.</P>
      <P>The European Commission did not initiate an investigation into the operation of REPS but sought the views of my Department on representations by an MEP about a shortage of suitably qualified REPS planners.  In reply, my Department indicated that there is no scarcity of planners.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of REPS in 1994 my Department has approved 243 planning agencies enabling approximately 900 planners to prepare agri-environmental plans under the scheme. There has been no complaint about any shortage of planners from either individual farmers or the farm organisations.</P>
      <P>The last REPS appreciation course for potential planners was held on 10 and 11 October 1995 and as I indicated in reply to a parliamentary question on 22 January 1997, the next such course has been arranged for 19-21 February 1997.</P>

      <P>The provision of ferries for the export of live cattle to mainland Europe is primarily a matter for the ferry companies themselves. However, I was pleased to be able to announce recently that an additional ferry service for livestock to mainland Europe would be introduced in the near future.  In addition, ships which have been approved under the Diseases of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Order, 1996 are, of course, entitled to bring cattle to mainland Europe.</P>

      <P>The number of brucellosis herd restrictions has increased significantly in the past year.  At the end of December 1995, some 189 herds were restricted.  Information on the position at the end of December 1996 is being compiled and will be conveyed to the Deputy when it becomes available.  The additional actions to be taken to redress the situation will be discussed with representatives of the farming bodies and the veterinary groups in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>The estimated total value, amount paid and balancing amount under each of the 1996 headage and premia schemes is outlined in the following table.  It should be noted that of the balance estimated at £221.131 million some £150 million representing payments in respect of special beef premium applications submitted in November-December 1996, suckler cow applications submitted in October 1996, third instalment of the 1996 ewe premium and extensification premium is not yet due, or is only now becoming due for payment.  In addition, and in line with past experience, not all estimated remaining cases will ultimately be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> Cases remaining to be paid under the headage arable aid and slaughter premium schemes, in the main, involve problems highlighted at inspection, area aid problems etc.  Payments are continuing as problems are resolved.</P>
    <P>Payments under the ewe premium scheme are normally made in three instalments.  Payment of any of the instalments cannot be made until such time as the rate is set by the EU Commission and until a set number of days have elapsed following publication of the regulation.  Payment of the first and second instalments&mdash;amounting to £66.434 million&mdash;has already been made.  The rate of the third and final instalment was set by the EU on 24 January 1997.  The regulation allowing payment was published on 8 February.  Payment of the final instalment will, therefore, commence this week.</P>
    <P>It is intended that balancing payments representing <Col N="1678" /> 20 per cent entitlement under the May 1996 suckler cow applications and special beef premium applications received in the period January-October 1996 will commence early next week.  Payments to November special beef applicants are now about to commence following the end of the retention period and December special beef applicants can expect to receive payments from early March.  In the case of October suckler cow applications, payment cannot commence until the retention period expires in April next.</P>
    <P>Payment of the extensification premium cannot commence until such time as all eligible cases have been paid special beef and suckler cow premium. It is expected that payment of extensification premium will commence in early May and that payment will be finalised by 30 June 1997 in line with the charter commitments and EU requirements.</P>

      <P>Measures adopted by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in October 1996 obliged member states to introduce an early marketing premium scheme for veal calves or the calf processing scheme.  As Ireland has no veal industry we are obliged under Council Regulation (EC) No. 2222/96 to introduce the calf processing premium scheme.  The scheme is effective from 1 December 1996 to 30 November 1998.</P>
      <P>The objective of the early marketing premium for veal calves and the calf processing premium is to reduce by one million per annum the number of calves available for beef production within the EU.

      <P>In 1994 a programme of financial delegation to the military authorities commenced.  In 1996 a total of £58 million expenditure from the Defence Vote was delegated.  When military pay and non-military expenditure are excluded, delegated expenditure represents approximately 55 per cent of the balance of expenditure from the Defence Vote.  A further tranche of financial delegation will take place this year.</P>

      <P>As the detailed information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number transferred to the reserve and the number who ceased membership in 1995 and 1996 as well as the average age of the members is not readily available in my Department it was not possible to compile it in the time available.  Accordingly, the information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <Quest>if the EU Transport Council meeting in December 1996 addressed in any way the difficulties facing Irish livestock exporters in view of the fact that they can only rely on one ferry company in order to continue their trade with Europe and the rest of the world.</Quest>

      <P>The EU Council of Maritime Transport Ministers' meeting in December 1996 considered proposals and adopted a resolution aimed at maintaining and developing the EU shipping sector as a whole but did not directly address specific problem areas, which in any event were not on the Council agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transport of livestock by sea is a matter <Col N="1683" /> for arrangement between the exporters and the private shipping interests and my Department has in the past year brought the two sides together to explore how more capacity could be made available for the livestock trade by mutual agreement between them.</P>
    <P>I am confident that arising out of the resolution adopted at the December Council action will follow <Col N="1684" /> at Union level which will facilitate the expansion of shipping services generally both here and throughout the Union.  The various initiatives taken by me in the past year together with the incentives announced in the budget are in tune with the current Union thinking and should encourage the private interests here to invest more in shipping, including vessels for the carriage of livestock.</P>
