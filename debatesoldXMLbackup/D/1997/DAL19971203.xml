      <P>I hope, Sir, you will not rule me out of order if I extend warm wishes to the Tánaiste for a speedy recovery.  I gather there was a good deal of arm twisting about the Government's position on the electoral Bill.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when we may expect to see the Bill that will be required to hold a referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty?  Will he give a timetable for the introduction of the White Paper and the Bill so that we may begin to organise ourselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will launch the White Paper early in the new year and we hope the referendum Bill will be available around that time.  I gave a commitment that on the resumption of the Dáil at the end of January we will debate the White Paper <Col N="3" /> and we can deal with the Bill at that stage.  It is still hoped the referendum will be held in March.</P>

      <P>As today is European Day of Disabled Persons, will the Taoiseach indicate if the Government has plans to introduce, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, legislation to provide for a disability Act and, if so, will he indicate when those legislative proposals will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making certain non-statutory decisions on that but it will be some time before the Bill will be ready.  We hope to reintroduce and enact some of the Bills that fell with the dissolution of the last Dáil.  I join with Deputy Quinn, and others, in acknowledging that today is European Day of Disabled Persons.  Irish groups and organisations have played a major part in European work to make sure today will be a great success, and I wish them well.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for arranging to have my office informed this morning that he was not yet in a position to tell me when the Flood Tribunal into the planning process in Dublin will be up and running.  I understand from press reports the delay is due apparently to a failure to reach agreement with barristers on their fees.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when he expects to be able to tell us that the tribunal will be up and running?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated yesterday, all the operational issues have been put in place.  As I told Deputy De Rossa, I will check what is happening. There seems to be some negotiation on the arrangements and the fees to be paid to the individuals concerned.  The Minister for Finance and the Attorney General are trying to sort that out this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is a day late in asking that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that question yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has abandoned plans to set up an independent body to handle applications as set down in the Refugee Act, 1996. Therefore, Ireland will be the only EU country without a statutory basis for dealing with refugees and an adjudication is to be made by a group of officials within the Department.  Is that a short-term arrangement or has the Government abandoned any aspiration to introduce a new refugee Bill or to amend the existing Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform replied to this question at length in the House yesterday.  The arrangement is short-term because, as the Deputy is aware the implementation of sections of this Act have been held up pending the outcome of a High Court case.  Some weeks ago we were asked to try to expedite it, which we are doing as far as we can.  In the meantime, the Minister said what he will do in the interim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the critical importance of this legislation and the common consent, with perhaps the exception of Deputy Callely, on its significance, have any attempts been made to negotiate a settlement in this dispute which concerns the age of the commissioner and has nothing to do with the core of the legislation? Does the Government intend to allow this legal action to frustrate the clear legislative intent of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go into detail on the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect, if the Taoiseach shares the concern of this side of House about this matter, he could introduce legislation to remove the offending part, which has given rise to the legal dispute, or settle that dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot interfere with a High Court case.  The Deputy will recall that during the life of the last Government attempts were made to settle the case but they were unsuccessful.  I made clear the Government's wish that these matters be dealt with expeditiously in the High Court so that we can get on with matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, in legislative terms, the net point is an age restriction? It is possible the High Court will rule that it is repugnant to the Constitution and that within four to five months the Government will have to consider an appeal to the Supreme Court and introducing legislation.  In the meantime, the <Col N="5" /> operation of this legislation is frustrated.  Will the Taoiseach take account of this problem and bring forward legislation to resolve the matter, otherwise this issue, which is of concern to the House and the public, will be totally frustrated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The case is before the High Court and I cannot comment on it.  The House and the last Government included the age restriction and I cannot comment on whether that was a good or bad idea or on the case before the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

Contrary to reports in this morning's papers, soundings were not taken from this Deputy on the issue.  If the Government does not propose to amend the party funding aspect of the Electoral Act, will it address other aspects, such as the need for an amendment to rectify the totally unjust and anomalous situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: Given the consternation in Carlow, which is also of concern to the Ceann Comhairle, has the Taoiseach spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy <Col N="7" /> to explain his outrageous decision to rescind the permission given for 26 houses in Carlow by the previous Minister last June?</P>

      <P>As regards the Taoiseach's earlier reply regarding the planning tribunal, will he indicate when he expects to be able to inform the House that this tribunal will begin functioning? Does the issue of fees for barristers relate to barristers seeking more money or the Minister for Finance seeking to pay less?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this. As I understand it, Mr. Justice Flood's interim report, which I presume will not be very bulky, must be presented to the Clerk of the Dáil in the next few days.  The second part of the Deputy's question was whether it was an issue of the legal profession seeking more money.  The answer to that is yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach took a personal interest in this legislation when people on this side were in Government.  The drafting of the <Col N="8" /> legislation was not the issue, it was the constitutional impediment which it was suggested was blocking it and this may be overcome.  Will the legislation be ready after Easter?</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 1: In page 4, subsection (5), line 5, after &ldquo;Act of 1964&rdquo;, &ldquo;(as amended by the Succession Act, 1965, the Courts Act, 1981, the Age of Majority Act, 1985, the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the Child Care Act, 1991, and the Courts Act, 1991)&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are drafting amendments. Amendment No. 1 expands the collective citation in section (5)(1) of the Bill to make clear that the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, has been amended by various Acts, namely the Succession Act, 1965, the Courts Act, 1981, the Age of Majority Act, 1985, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the Child Care Act, 1991, and the Courts Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 2 is to substitute in section (1)(5) of the Bill the collective citation, the Guardianship of Children Acts, 1964 and 1997, for the collective citation, the Guardianship of Infants Acts, 1964 and 1997.  The amendments reflect modern terminology and are in line with the intention of section 12 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 11: In page 12, lines 37 and 38, &ldquo;after the commencement of this Part&rdquo; deleted.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete the words &ldquo;after the commencement of this Part&rdquo; from the first two lines of the proposed section 24 of the 1964 Act.  Section 11 of the Bill inserts a new Part IV comprising 12 new sections into the 1964 Act.  Under section 1 of the Bill, six of these proposed new sections, including section 24, will come into operation one month after the date of the passing of the Bill while the remainder will be the subject of a commencement order.  There is a possibility that the words &ldquo;after the commencement of this Part&rdquo; in the section as currently worded may, notwithstanding the intention implied in the section, not commence until all of the other sections, including those which will be subject to a commencement order, have come into effect.  The amendment will help to make clear that this is not the case.</P>

      <P>Section 13: In page 15, lines 10 to 16 deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;(d) where the court has ordered that a guardian <i>ad litem</i> appointed under section 28 (inserted by the Children Act, 1997) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, should be legally represented in proceedings under subsection (4) of that section, and any of the parties to those proceedings is in receipt of civil legal aid.&rsquo;&rsquo;.&rsquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a technical drafting amendment.  Under the new section 28(4) of the Act of 1964, as proposed to be inserted by section 11 of the Bill, the court is empowered to order that a guardian <i>ad litem</i> be legally represented in guardianship, custody or access proceedings where it appears to the court in exceptional circumstances that it is <Col N="11" /> necessary and in the best interests of the child. This provision is not conditional on an application being made by the guardian <i>ad litem.</i>  The court may do so of its own motion, having regard to the gravity of the matters that may be at issue or any other special circumstances relating to the particular case.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (5)(d) of section 28 of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, as inserted by section 13 of the Bill makes consequential amendments to the Act of 1995.  The effect of the provision is to oblige the Legal Aid Board to grant a legal aid certificate to a guardian <i>ad litem</i> where the court has ordered that he or she be represented and any of the parties to the dispute is already in receipt of legal aid.</P>
    <P>The provision as it stands, however, indicates that the certificate will be given on application by the guardian to the court.  That wording is not consistent with the wording in the proposed new section 28 of the Act of 1964 and the amendment provides for the deletion of the reference to an application to the court.</P>

    <Title>Turf Development Bill, 1997: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see this Bill coming before the House not least because some little time ago, as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, I was in charge of much of the preparation of the Bill.  I was particularly pleased that it was possible to make provision for the winding down of the company's debt by direct Exchequer injection in such a way as to facilitate the simple company structure that is provided for in this Bill rather than a more complex two-stage operation which seemed to be required at the outset.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives the company a structure that is in keeping with the commercial environment in which it has to operate, a structure far more in keeping with that environment than the one currently in place.  The company is operating in a market that has changed very much in nature, and in some respects in scale, since it was founded, a market that has changed a great deal even in the past decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key to reforming the company in the way it has now been reformed was the decision of the last Government to provide the funding necessary to get the company out of the hobble in <Col N="12" /> which it found itself as a result of debts built up during times of energy crisis when the company had to incur major investment expenditures to expand without any direct assistance from the Government, thereby incurring costs that told very heavily against it when energy prices dropped.  It is fair to recall that the package which made the presentation of the Bill possible needed the agreement of the European Commission authorities.  That agreement was forthcoming and the Commission proved very understanding of the issues and challenges facing the company.</P>
    <P>The company is now in a better position to deal with the kind of markets in which it operates, the foreseeable changes in these markets and competition.  Its balance sheet has been cleaned up and is healthy. The company can engage in the full range of commercial practices and options which should be open to a company in a competitive marketplace. Specifically, it can consider joint ventures or equity partnerships in a way that was not possible before.</P>
    <P>In this context, the provision in section 16(3) which states that the Minister for Finance shall not reduce his shareholding to less than 50 per cent unless authorised to do so by a resolution of Dáil Éireann is unusual and is clearly included for political reasons only.  It has not been explained by the Minister and we have not been given any detailed reason 50 per cent should be the figure, why it is provided for and why it needs a resolution of Dáil Éireann rather than the agreement of the Government or some other form of agreement. Will the Minister give us some more detail on why it was thought necessary to include this very unusual provision?  I do not imagine that there is a great deal of pressure for a provision of this kind from the bargain basement Progressive Democrats bit of the Government and I wonder where it came from and why.</P>
    <P>Section 41 provides that more than 50 per cent of the aggregate value of the subsidiaries taken as a whole cannot be disposed of without the approval of the Dáil.  This is an unusual provision which seems to have been included for political reasons only.  While I do not have any great love for this provision, logic leads me to ask why it is framed this way.  Why does it relate to 50 per cent of the aggregate value of the subsidiaries taken as a whole?  Why does it not refer to 50 per cent of the value of any one of the subsidiaries taken individually?  Is there a reason for this?  We are entitled to know why matters of this kind should be brought before the Dáil in the context of a Bill which is designed at the very beginning to give the company a commercial mandate, the leeway to operate in a commercial market without the kind of interference we so often hear claimed, sometimes rightly, as the source of many of the ills suffered over many years by semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>The commercial freedom of the company being set up by the Bill is circumscribed to an extent by these two provisions.  It may be said that these <Col N="13" /> provisions in themselves will not constitute a substantial obstacle to the company in its operations in the foreseeable future but the time could come when they might prove to be so.  The time could also well come when the company adopts a strategy which necessitates a new form of equity partnership that requires more than 50 per cent of the aggregate value of the subsidiaries to be sold to another person as part of that deal.  The company could find itself &ldquo;upscuttled&rdquo; in that because a majority in the House did not provide for it.</P>
    <P>Equally, the company might find itself in a position &mdash; this is something we might hope would happen &mdash; where it expanded to the point that it needed a large injection of new capital and new equity partners which might want more than 50 per cent of the equity in the company. Although it might have a good financial proposition to make, it would have to come back to the House to get agreement for that.  It could face the prospect of having that arrangement &ldquo;upscuttled&rdquo; if it was not possible to get a majority in the Dáil for the Minister for Finance to dispose of more than 50 per cent of the shares in the company.  If that happened the people behind these two curious provisions might find they had outsmarted not only themselves but the workers in the company and the people who depend on the company for a living.</P>
    <P>The Government must make up its mind on this matter.  The Minister for Public Enterprise must make a decision.  Will we take the commercial route?  Will we make this company part of a competitive, rapidly changing energy market? Will we make it a valid player in that market? The Lord knows what the future holds for companies in the energy market.  The company and people who speak on its behalf will increasingly make the point in the future that the fuel it produces is more environmentally friendly than some of the fuels it would replace, and that may be the case, but people will have to be convinced of that.  It could happen that the company would market not only unmixed peat fuels but fuels or other products that are a mixture of peat and other materials, requiring the participation of other actors.  I fear these provisions will prove to be obstacles to such development of the company.</P>
    <P>There is a specific problem in the company with which the new structure will help it to deal. The peat products division of the company is the most difficult part to deal with in the sense of its placing in the market, its profitability and the prospect for its development.  That is not helped by ignorant remarks made by high personages elsewhere about a product that is quite inoffensive and has a number of enormous advantages. I hope that under the new structure of the company with its subsidiaries it will be easier to deal with the problem in that part of the company.  I hope the 50 per cent provision will not get in the way of dealing in real terms with that problem.</P>
    <P>I make that comment, having freely admitted to having a particular interest, as has my colleague <Col N="14" /> Deputy Power, in the future of the operation at Kilberry in Kildare South.  It has been part of the economic fabric of that part of Kildare for many years and all of us would like to see that continue.  If that requires new forms of association, co-operation or venture partnership with other companies, that should be done because we need to maintain that part of the economic base as long as that can be done on a viable basis.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in many ways only one part of the outcome of a process that has gone on for a long time.  It would be unreal to debate the Bill without reflecting on the history of the company.  For a period it had to engage in heavy investment from its own meagre resources and as a result incurred substantial debts.  It has undergone major rationalisation in the past ten years.  The staff and management has gone through one of the most fundamental restructuring operations which has ever taken place in a branch of Irish industry.  At one time a large proportion of the population of counties Kildare and Offaly, in particular, and counties Westmeath and Longford were employees of Bord na Móna, but only a small proportion of them are currently directly employed by it.  However, a number of them perform various operations on contract for the company.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter which has informed the approach of successive Governments to the company and to the introduction of this legislation. For many years Bord na Móna and the ESB have had a social and economic influence on the midlands which is inadequately understood. Even though the population of the midlands is not sparse, it is very dispersed because of the location of work with Bord na Móna and the ESB.  As I stated, Bord na Móna has undergone enormous structural change and the ESB is going through similar change, but the people still live where they lived when the organisation of those companies was different.  Many of them provide services on contract for Bord na Móna, some have retired and others have been made redundant. While the economic circumstances of a large number of people in north and west Kildare and counties Offaly, Longford and Westmeath have changed fundamentally in recent years, and they have little prospect of ever again being employed by their previous employers, little is being done to provide alternative employment in the region.  I am not insisting that this newly constituted commercial company should be given a particular role, but when implementing this necessary legislation it would be wrong to overlook the consequences which have made it necessary to make changes in the company.  Some Members on this side of the House have been calling for some time for a fresh look to be taken at the development requirements of the midlands which are easy to overlook because of the imperfect understanding of economic changes in that area in recent years.</P>
    <P>Although it may not be popular to say this, we owe a substantial debt of gratitude to the board <Col N="15" /> and senior officials of Bord na Móna.  They have brought the company through difficult days and allowed us introduce this forward-looking legislation. Section 26 provides for the appointment, and terms and conditions of appointment, of the managing director of the new company and the following sections relate to staff.  According to what I read in the newspapers in recent days, the Government does not intend to proceed with the Buckley proposals which, among other things, would give us an opportunity to consider the remuneration of chief executives of semi-State companies.  That is a great mistake.</P>
    <P>While it would not be appropriate to recount the history of a well known case which arises in this connection, it is obvious that the rules we apply to a number of semi-State companies in fixing remuneration for their chief executives are utterly unsuited to their positions.  The more our semi-State companies enter the competitive market, which is what we are rightly imposing on them by liberalising legislation, whether from our inspiration or that of the European Union, the more we are pushing them into competition with private sector companies.  Yet, we are also imposing on them a number of restrictions which in some cases prevent them from getting the expertise and staff input they need to operate in that market.  The ideal outcome would be to give these companies the freedom to head-hunt in the market for the type of people they need, but as the Buckley proposals have been published, it is outrageous that the Government should close its eyes and hope the problem will go away.  That is not satisfactory.  I would be delighted if, as a result of this debate, the Minister adopted a new approach.</P>
    <P>Members of the boards of semi-State companies are often criticised and held up to ridicule, their motives are often suspect and they sometimes achieve notoriety in their own right.  From time to time they are among the popular whipping boys.  They get paid a pittance for the services they give to the State.  A great many of them do not do much more than they are required &mdash; they cannot be blamed for that &mdash; but a number of them make a contribution to their companies that is far above the level of recognition they receive by way of directors' fees.  We are fortunate that some members and chairpersons of such boards are willing to do that.  Now that more of our semi-State companies are moving into the competitive market it is time to reconsider how members of their boards are treated.  If the Government wishes, I am also willing to consider the appointment of members to such boards. Board members usually have to wait until they retire and write a book to get the appreciation they deserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been born and reared on the edge of the Bog of Allen, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is strange how our attitude to bogs can change over time.  Going <Col N="16" /> to secondary school in CBS Naas, the townies often referred to us as bogmen from Caragh.  We were ashamed of such a title then but we are proud of it today.</P>
      <P>This is a straightforward Bill which received widespread support when introduced by Deputy O'Rourke.  However, Deputy Dukes indicated a number of concerns.  The purpose of the Bill is to give Bord na Móna a modern company configuration under the Companies Act.  This is essential given the changing business climate.</P>
      <P>It is important to look at the history of Irish bogs.  I came across a book called <i>The Bogs of Ireland</i> by John Feehan and Grace O'Donovan which examines the history of our bogs and the part they played in Irish life.  It is a great read which offers an insight to how people survived in rural Ireland.  Many people think that turf and bogs are to be found only in Ireland.  However, <i>The Bogs of Ireland</i> shows that we are only one of many countries lucky enough to have bogs.</P>
      <P>Concern has recently been expressed by conservationists that we are destroying our bogs.  It is important to strike a balance between the continued extraction of turf and the preservation of something which is beautiful.  I am reasonably happy that every effort is being made to ensure that this happens.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes mentioned the debt of gratitude we owe to members of Bord na Móna.  Eddie O'Connor was one such member who was vilified in no uncertain terms.  He set about tackling a serious problem in the company.  The necessary programme of reorganisation which he implemented created much unemployment in the midlands, particularly in County Kildare. However, this was a necessary evil and I pay tribute to him for his work and the manner in which he dealt with the problems in Bord na Móna.  The company is much stronger as a result.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke stated that Bord na Móna brought tremendous benefits to an area in which it established operations.  However, this was not a one way street.  Many families and communities gave much to Bord na Móna.  It was a two way process which worked extremely well.  Employment was created in areas to which it was virtually impossible to attract other industries.  It is important to look to the future in deciding how best to use our bogs.</P>
      <P>One of the major plans is for the construction of a 120 megawatt, peat fired power station.  Its location will be decided by the company which successfully tenders for its construction but it appears that it will be on the Kildare-Offaly border. This will bring enormous benefits to an area which has suffered due to the changes in Bord na Móna.  Such areas depend on activities in the bogs and the reduction of Bord na Moná's activities caused great problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new station is vital for the future of Bord na Móna and the midlands, particularly the Kildare-Offaly area.  During the past few years concerns have been expressed that this development might not go ahead leading to the withdrawal <Col N="17" /> of the promised £21 million in Structural Funds.  The Government and its predecessor have made every effort to ensure that this money is drawn down and I am certain that this will happen. It is important that we avail of the £21 million and ensure that it is put to the best use.</P>
    <P>The ESB owns all the power stations in Ireland. However, under EU law the new station will be subject to competition.  We hope that it will be commissioned quickly.  Preparing bogs for peat extraction requires much work.  Bord na Móna assures us that this process will support 250 full time workers and 250 part time workers.  The construction phase will employ 450 workers.  The direct income impact of the construction phase will amount to a little less than £20 million.  When the station is operational, the income will be £8 million.  This highlights the importance of the station and I wish all concerned well.  Our turf deposits will keep the station running for 30 years.  In addition to the raw material, we also have a workforce with the necessary knowledge and experience to operate the station.  In many cases their families have given their lives to the bogs.</P>
    <P>We have seen considerable employment difficulties in villages which were dependent on bogs. Many young people on leaving school 20 to 30 years ago took up apprenticeships in Bord na Móna.  There were no difficulties in obtaining places to learn their trades.  Major changes have taken place in this scheme recently, and although there have been developments in the past couple of years, the same opportunities are not available to young people.  Figures from the past ten years give an idea of the difficulties created by the restructuring of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>A voluntary redundancy scheme was launched by Bord na Móna in May 1988 following negotiations with the trade unions.  On 31 March 1989 there were 5,116 people employed by the board, including seasonal workers.  On 31 March 1997, 2,525 people were working in Bord na Móna, a reduction of 2,500 people.  I know a number of these people have had great difficulty acquiring alternative employment, and they will welcome the building of a new peat station.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes referred to the debt carried by Bord na Móna.  I pay tribute to the previous Government for its handling of that problem, and this work is being continued by the present administration.  Bord na Móna found it difficult to make progress while this strangling debt was hanging over its head.  The Government paid £40 million on that debt last year and £51 million this year.  That removed the difficulty the board faced and allowed it to concentrate on its work and plan for the future.</P>
    <P>There are four business activities in Bord na Móna: the peat energy division, the solid fuel division, the horticulture division and the environmental products division.  Deputy Smith, the current Minister for Defence, awarded Bord na Móna a grant some years ago for the Peat Research Centre.  Arising from that, the centre <Col N="18" /> has devised a new mechanism of puraflow, which treats sewage.  It is one of the most successful developments in rural Ireland.  Anyone involved in building houses or looking for planning permission can have difficulty in regard to septic tanks.  The puraflow method devised by Bord na Móna treats this problem, and local authorities accept it, in many cases attaching it as a condition to planning permissions.</P>
    <P>The puraflow peat-based treatment system is one of the most successful systems on the market for the treatment of septic tank effluent.  The product is supplied in modular form for single house applications.  Experimental units set up in Kildare and Tipperary in the late 1980s continue to perform very well.  Local authorities have assisted in promoting this product, and this gives an idea of what can be achieved.  People may view the bogs as having little or no future, but if we spend enough on research and development we could surprise ourselves with the opportunities the bogs can present.</P>
    <P>Sir John Purser Griffith is mentioned in <i>The Bogs of Ireland</i>, and tribute should be paid to him.  We often pay attention to members of boards merely to criticise them, but this man was chairman of the Irish Peat Committee which was asked to investigate the peat resources of Ireland. Having put considerable work into this, the committee presented its recommendations.  However, the British Government and then the Free State Government failed to act on those recommendations. Sir John decided to take the bull by the horns and he purchased two bogs at Ticknevin and Turraun.  He set up the Leinster Carbonising Company in 1924, investing over £70,000 of his own money.  In many ways he gave a lead to the country because he showed he was not happy to merely draw up recommendations.  He was prepared to put his money into doing something himself.

    <P>For generations in Ireland, peat or turf has been dug by hand, making generally a soft, variable and bulky fuel, so costly to transport that its common use is limited to the district in which it is dug.  By the introduction of the latest mechanical methods, the Turraun Peat Works have established a new industry which foreshadows developments of far-reaching importance in the domestic and industrial future of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sir John Purser Griffith was willing to invest his money and give us a lead.  We should be grateful that the inspiration he gave us is not lost.</P>
    <P>In 1933 Seán Lemass asked Tod Andrews to join the Department of Industry and Commerce in order to take in hand the development of the bogs.  Major changes took place after that, with a number of bog improvement schemes being undertaken.  Local co-operative turf societies were promoted and over 180 such organisations were established.  The Turf Development Board was set up in 1934 and brought significant benefits <Col N="19" /> to my area of Newbridge.  Hostels were set up for people based there, as over 200 people came from Donegal to work in the area.  Recently they celebrated the 50th anniversary of their arrival. Many old stories were told and secrets were revealed.</P>
    <P>Europeat is very important to the area.  In 1996 the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications announced the appointment of an international consortium as independent experts to design and run the competition for the new peat-fired station.  Following a meeting with the European Commissioner for Regional Policy it was confirmed that the Euro peat project will remain part of the Operational Programme.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure every effort is made to have this station up and running as quickly as possible.  It will bring enormous benefits to an area that has to a large extent been neglected and where families have given much to Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Recently I was reading about some of the coal villages throughout Europe where the pits are now closed.  At European level a scheme was put in place to revitalise those areas.  I see no reason a similar scheme cannot be put in operation for the areas here which have depended on the bogs in the past and where there has been much redundancy. I appeal to the Minister to address this important matter.  The bogs and Bord na Móna have provided jobs where few other industries would come and should not be neglected when peat resources are becoming scarce.</P>

      <P>The Turf Development Bill, 1997, is important.  I was a member of the Government which approved the proposal to reduce the debt substantially on Bord na Móna.  This company has a long and proud history and experienced the same problems as many other semi-State companies in the 1960s.  It was antiquated and inefficient and vision and leadership were required to transform that company to its present state.</P>
      <P>This Bill is about the generation of electricity.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that the speeches in the House will generate publicity today.  We should put down a marker, despite the fact that the Minister for Finance, later today, will lash out £500 million wherever the Government wishes, a day will come when the Celtic tiger will not have the same clout and image.  In that sense it is important to look to the future.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna's remit was to develop the bogs, because of a scarcity of provisions resulting from the war, and to develop an indigenous fuel.  That has been done to a large extent.  It involved looking at drainage and machinery techniques in Scandinavia, Russia and other countries which have a high rainfall and peat bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> Recently, with the advent of competition, Bord na Móna began to look at the competitive elements arising from membership with the European Union, such as the Valoren programme, under which assistance was made available to competitors to get into the electricity generation business either by hydro experimentation, wind or peat.  For example, the development of a competitive enterprise in the Geesala area of County Mayo by peat power was promoted by a former Member, Myles Staunton.  Elements in Bord na Móna did not encourage this competitive instinct and did not go out of their way to lend a hand to a competitor in the fields of milled peat and peat briquette production.  The techniques investigated in Scandinavia, in particular the use of light machinery, new drainage techniques and new methods of milling peat which Bord na Móna took on board brought about a radical transformation in the company.  That company was underfinanced and has since been taken over by a multinational, Norsk Hydro.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read the Minister's speech. The political structure has changed and the Minister for Public Enterprise, rightly, referred to her own area in some detail.  She mentioned the stations at Lullymore, Portarlington, Allenwood, Rhode, Ferbane, Croghan and Derrinlough but not Bellacorrick in which I have an interest.  In his famous Four Farrellys, Percy French referred to &ldquo;the bogs below Belmullet in the County of Mayo&rdquo;.  I am happy to be one of the representatives from that county.  The Minister's speech did not refer to the Bellacorick peat burning stating which has an economic and social value to the region in the Barony of Erris, which geographically is as big as County Louth.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I tabled a question to the Minister. I am not sure who wrote the reply or whether they think I suffer from imbecilic tendencies as the answer does not refer to the question I asked which was:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Public Enterprise if she will indicate the future for the peat burning station at Bellacorick, County Mayo, in view of her recent announcement regarding the development of a new peat burning station in the midlands; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>The reply stated that the Bellacorick peat fired power station was commissioned by the ESB in 1962-3 &mdash; I did not have to ask a question to find that out &mdash; that its future is a matter for the ESB in the first instance.  I asked the Minister to indicate the future of this station.  She said she had received no proposals from the ESB regarding the future of this generating station.  Did anybody in the Department inquire from the ESB about the future of the station?  Did anybody in the Department carry out an analysis of the lifespan of the bogs owned by Bord na Móna in the Bellacorick region and district?  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The new station will give rise to a temporary increase in emissions of CO2 from peat stations <Col N="21" /> but there will be a progressive reduction in CO2 emissions from peat in the years ahead as some of the existing older peat stations come to the end of their operational lives.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware some of the stations are approaching the end of their operational lives. Surely in the interests of public enterprise and efficiency, Bord na Móna will have carried out studies on the finite life of the bogs in the Bellacorick power station region.  That is the reason I tabled the question, to which I have received a nonsensical reply.  When replying to Second Stage will the Minister deal with this matter?</P>
    <P>If the 120 megawatt station proposed for the midlands &mdash; which I support on behalf of the board, the economy of the midlands and the workers &mdash; were to be built in the Barony of Erris there would be legitimate calls from these benches concerning the future of the peat burning stations in the midlands.  People would certainly ask these questions as I am entitled to do as a public representative.  In the Barony of Erris there is not a single household that does not have relatives in Cleveland, Boston, the US, Britain and in other countries who have helped sustain the fabric of the area.  The station, commissioned by the ESB in 1962-3, is a landmark in the region. As one goes over the hill at Boughadoon on the road west one can see its stack rising in the distance, a symbol of economic progress.</P>
    <P>What is the projected commercial lifespan of the bog owned by Bord na Móna at Bellacorick and what does the future hold for the station? Is there scope for co-operation between Bord na Móna and Norsk Hydro and for further economic development particularly as there is a wind farm located adjacent to the station and an application has been lodged for permission to construct a similar facility at Doohoma which is backed by a former senior member of Bord na Móna with expertise and experience in this area?</P>
    <P>Like its predecessor, the Government has stated clearly that it intends to take measures to help disadvantaged areas.  I would like to think that the station will not be closed prematurely as it may be deemed to be inefficient when compared to the 120 megawatt station where modern standards will apply.  Is there a possibility that other bogs in the area could be acquired by Bord na Móna which I am sure has conducted the necessary studies to determine the depth of peat? Is there a possibility that a deep sea port will be developed on the north Mayo coast through which a fuel additive could be imported to be used in conjunction with milled peat in the production of energy?  Timber production in the north west is on the increase and will prove commercially viable in the next ten to 15 years.  It will not be necessary to transport it to Waterford and other locations in the south.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond to my call.  The station has been in operation for 30 years and it should be possible to project the commercial lifespan of the bog to which I have referred.  In the seventies the late George Colley, when Minister <Col N="22" /> for Industry and Commerce, introduced a peat development Bill to provide for the construction of roads and bridges to facilitate access to smaller bogs.  It was a small but good Bill.  In the SACs for which the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cúiv, is responsible one will no longer be allowed to cut turf by machine in a great range of bogs.  The implications of this should be looked at in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not mention Bellacorick.  She did not provide the information I was seeking in reply to my question.  What is the projected commercial lifespan of the bog to which I have referred?  What is the cost per unit therm of heat generated?  Can the station be operated efficiently until the supply of peat is exhausted? Is there scope for co-operation between Bord na Móna and Norsk Hydro?  Is there a possibility that other bogs in the area could be acquired? Is there a possibility that fuel additives could be imported?  I seek answers to these questions on behalf of the people of the area which is beginning to prosper following the development of the Céide Fields and a national park, the provision of tourism amenities as well as sea and commercial angling facilities.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Bill the purpose of which is to place the operations of Bord na Móna on a commercial basis.  It can no longer be asked to engage in activities which are not feasible or profitable.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to compliment Myles Staunton whom Deputy Kenny knows.  He did not receive any assistance from the State in respect of his project which has been taken over by the Norwegian company, Norsk Hydro.  I wish it well and was delighted the previous Government was in a position to assist it through Údarás. I hope Bord na Móna which has received millions of pounds of taxpayers' money in subsidies will play ball with it.  It placed every conceivable obstacle in the way of Myles Staunton to whom I say: well done.  He is one of the few people who have tried hard to create employment in north Mayo.  I believe the Norwegian company will be successful and will employ many people in this disadvantaged area, in Erris, Belmullet and so on.</P>

    <P>Like Deputy Kenny, I have tabled many questions about Bellacorick.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to speak to the Taoiseach and Ministers about the way they answer questions.  I could have given Deputy Kenny the answer to his question.  I have received the same answer.  Last week I received a reply from the Minister of State's Department in Irish.  I have no objection to receiving replies in Irish and English.  It still insists however on replying through Irish.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle to protect my rights.  I have the right to receive replies in Irish and English. When I contacted the Minister of State's Department this morning by telephone I was informed that it was very busy.  I am also very busy.

      <P>Bellacorick is a major peat station about which we do not know the Government's intentions.  That is what I am talking about and shall continue to talk about because the people of north Mayo do not know what will be their position or future prospects after the year 2004.  Just before the general election I attended a public meeting in Crossmolina convened by Mickie Loftus with a view to saving the peat industry in Bellacorick.  It reminds me somewhat of the controversy surrounding television deflectors, all orchestrated by the Fianna Fáil organisation.  I have not noticed a meeting called by Mickie Loftus in Crossmolina since this Government came to power.  Of course, Mickie Loftus was an appointee of the Government to the RTE Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a public meeting before the last general election in relation to Bellacorick to which Deputy Kenny, I and all public representatives were summoned to ascertain what could be done to save its peat industry.  When the Minister is replying, we want to know the precise position in relation to Bellacorick.  The assertion that the ESB has not submitted a plan to Government is not sufficient.  I want to know the Government's view.  Does it want Bellacorick to remain viable after the year 2004, as I and the people of north Mayo do?  As Deputy Kenny has said, there are many young people working in that company trying to decide whether they should mortgage their properties, wondering whether their jobs will be retained after the year 2004 or precisely what will happen.  It must be borne in mind that it is a disadvantaged area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Kenny on one matter. The previous Government spoke in terms of positive discrimination in favour of the west which this Government indicated it would continue. <Col N="24" /> Yet, on assuming office, the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, transferred responsibility for western development from his Department to the Department of Agriculture and Food.  That did not bode well for a commitment to the west.</P>
    <P>When replying I want the Minister for Public Enterprise to inform the House precisely what will happen in Bellacorick.  I ask her to instruct the ESB to submit a plan in respect of which she will provide any funding necessary for its upgrading and continued commission after the year 2004.  It is vital to the economy of north Mayo and jobs there.  I hope she will be able to respond positively.</P>
    <P>I wish Norsk Hydro the best of luck and hope the State will play its part in assisting that major international company to increase the number of its employees.  I compliment Mr. Myles Staunton, one of the few businessmen who tried to do something to create employment in north Mayo. While he may not have been very successful, had he not begun this project Norsk Hydro would not now be in existence with an abundance of funding available to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Ring speak a few moments ago about the orchestration in which this side of the House specialises in political matters.  I hope he has the grace to acknowledge our orchestration of Bord na Móna whose work over many years has led to its being a tremendous development corporation in the midlands and west.  In a debate such as this it is only appropriate to pay tribute to men like the late Dr. C. S. Andrews and Aogáin O'Rahilly who did so much for the company over very many years.  In our age it is hard to believe that those men were motivated by the ideal of pure public service.  I am sure Deputy Penrose and others on my left would be most interested to learn that Dr. Andrews, in particular, took the view that it was improper to make profit in life, that it was more proper to serve in a public organisation, like Bord na Móna, in that manner placing one's abilities and services at the disposal of the people.  There always was a strong Marxist strain in our political thinking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which I am sure will continue to be applicable in the evolution of Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take up a point made by Deputy Kenny earlier when he said that, of <Col N="25" /> course, it was never intended that Bord na Móna would evolve into a body which was not commercial in the full sense of the word.  From its inception, the idea obtained that Bord na Móna would be developed along commercial lines.  Indeed, looking through the original debate on the Turf Development Bill 1945, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Seán Lemass, said that it was his intention to place an obligation on the turf development board to find a market for the total quantity it produced on its merits as a fuel and on the basis of the price at which it could be made available wherever it could be most conveniently found.  He used the term &ldquo;economic basis&rdquo;, meaning a price which would make it cheap to use in relation to the price of coal. Therefore, from its very inception the idea was that Bord na Móna would be run on sound commercial lines.</P>
    <P>Of course, the funding of Bord na Móna's three development programmes rested on Exchequer advances.  The first and second development programmes adopted by the company after the war were funded by means of repayable Exchequer advances to the board, the earlier phase of its third programme having been funded in the same manner.  Since 1978 Bord na Móna has carried out its development work on the basis of bank borrowing.  While grants were paid to the board for the experimental station at Newbridge, and the provision of housing for its employees &mdash; which we Dubliners often see on visits to the midlands &mdash; it was originally a dream of the United Irishmen that the turf resources of the midlands would be harvested for the benefit of the capital city.  Therefore, the idea of turf development went right back in our national history to the United Irishmen, to their idea that this was a valuable native resource which should be developed for the benefit of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna's various development programmes since 1978 have had to be funded by bank borrowing, when the company experienced difficult years, as a consequence of which waivers of interest and postponement of repayments of capital on Exchequer advances were allowed.  But it is clear that Government policy, as enunciated in Second Stage contributions of relevant Ministers introducing the original and amending legislation, has been that, from the very beginning, Bord na Móna would operate on commercial lines.  It never had a social function of simply providing jobs though, of course, that was a very desirable result of its operations.  However, no State funding was ever provided for that purpose.</P>
    <P>As Members on all sides of the House have acknowledged, the function of the board is to develop indigenous resources which would provide import substitutes for oil and coal and sell those at an economic price in the marketplace. The generation of jobs, of enormous social importance especially in the midlands, has been acknowledged by successive Ministers.  However, nobody has ever suggested that Bord na Móna should provide jobs other than as a consequence <Col N="26" /> of viable, commercial activity, the primary objective being to develop indigenous energy.</P>
    <P>Since Bord na Móna's fate is dependent on economic performance, Exchequer advances having ceased and additional guarantees on bank loans no longer available, its further expansion has to be provided for out of profits.  The whole purpose in introducing this Bill is to provide Bord na Móna with a legal structure that will allow its business to develop along normal, modern commercial lines.</P>
    <P>The 1946 Act, the founding charter of Bord na Móna, reflected the thinking of its time and the type of development mandate given the board in the form of a public corporation, in common with other bodies founded in that era &mdash; the ESB to name but one which springs to mind.</P>
    <P>In spite of huge changes in the legal and business framework since 1946, the board has not reoriented legally to those changes.  It is important that this Bill should reorient the board to operating under a largely commercial mandate and its structure should be adapted for that purpose. This Bill will provide Bord na Móna with a constitution which is governed and regulated by modern company law.  In turn, that will enable the board to deal with its bankers and traders in a manner which will provide some certainty on the market, which had been missing heretofore, since different rules of interpretation applied to company law than to those regulating, say, a statutory public corporation.  This means the company has been placed on a level playing pitch, a phrase so beloved of modern commercial commentators.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes somewhat further.  For the first time, it provides the board with a proper capital structure which makes the application of modern accounting procedures and practices very difficult in regard to Bord na Móna in that there is a degree of artificiality in their application.  Heretofore there had been no structure within which equity could be invested in the company whereas this Bill will enable the Government or others to obtain shares in return for investment; while I mentioned &ldquo;others&rdquo;, I know that is not the primary intention of this Bill.  Nonetheless, the new structure does enable Bord na Móna to take advantage of borrowing opportunities in its own right and will also allow the necessary flexibility to the different businesses in the company's divisions to develop autonomously in accordance with their needs.  The existing legislation would allow the formation of a company but would not allow the transfer of assets or the devolution of statutory functions to subsidiary companies.  It is important that the diversification of Bord na Móna is reflected in legal form through the establishment of subsidiaries.  This is one of the central provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>An obvious example of the need for these new structures arises in the context of the proposed Euro peat power station, the owner or operator of which will have to be satisfied that the supplier of peat upon which the station will depend has its <Col N="27" /> own sound structures, balance sheet and resources to protect it from adverse circumstances which might arise in other divisions.</P>
    <P>The fuels division, which has developed with the takeover by Bord na Móna of one of the largest coal distribution companies in the State, requires limited liability status to deal with its competitors, suppliers and customers because it operates in the wider home heating market, not just in a peat market.</P>
    <P>The horticultural division, one of the great success stories of Bord na Móna, largely works in the export market and requires a definite legal structure to deal with its external customers and competitors.  It also requires constant investment and the overseas markets need flexibility to form partnerships with local investors in other states which may be interested in forming alliances.  This necessary flexibility is provided through the establishment of a subsidiary arrangement.</P>
    <P>State investment already provided to Bord na Móna is effectively being turned into a retained debt.  This enables a lowering in the price charged to the ESB for milled peat.  This equity investment does not make money available for investment &mdash; it is an accounting exercise &mdash; but the legislation is designed to ensure that, in a cost efficient manner, within a reasonable period of time and without disruption to any of the businesses, proper subsidiaries can be established within Bord na Móna for the acceptance of equity. At the same time, Bord na Móna ensures a degree of co-ordination in the overall operation.</P>
    <P>The legal position of the limited company will mean each subsidiary will be free to carry out its business in the most appropriate manner, provided it does so in accordance with the companies legislation and the memoranda and articles regulating that particular subsidiary company.  There is also a provision for vesting the assets of the board, by ministerial order, in a subsidiary company and for changes in the superannuation provisions of the Turf Development Acts to bring them in line with modern commercial pension practice and to comply with the Pensions Act, 1990, to protect employees transferring to the new company.  The board will be able to obtain normal commercial funding while the board's businesses will have the flexibility to enter arrangements with other entities.</P>
    <P>The Bill ensures Bord na Móna can operate in a far more flexible manner in the modern market place, like other companies.  It is a tremendous achievement that Bord na Móna has reached this stage and I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise some technical issues.  The definition of subsidiary in section 2 seems confusing as there are separate definitions of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; and &ldquo;the subsidiaries&rdquo;.  This is a curious provision as the Bill authorises the establishment of subsidiaries and I fail to see why there should be two separate definitions.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is the crucial provision, providing for a further injection of £10 million by the Minister <Col N="28" /> for Finance at his discretion and I know the employees are anxious that this takes place as soon as possible.  Sections 47 and 48 contain provisions relating to the vesting of property by Bord na Móna in the subsidiaries.  One aspect of this is curious because, while section 47 provides an automatic vesting of all property in a subsidiary, land is specifically exempted.  The board will retain ownership of all lands, even those with which a subsidiary may be dealing.  I do not know whether it is intended to specifically vest the land by way of deed of conveyance from the board to subsidiaries or whether the subsidiaries are intended to own land.  Section 48 provides that the company, meaning the board, can authorise by licence the use by subsidiaries of land held by the company.  It is not clear where the subsidiary companies stand in terms of acquiring land.  Does it mean that existing land within the ownership of the board can never be vested in a subsidiary?  If that is the case, it seems a rather inflexible provision and the Minister should examine whether these provisions can be made as flexible as possible in relation to the operation of the subsidiaries so that they can acquire and deal in land in the same way as their parent company.</P>
    <P>Section 56 provides that the board and the subsidiaries &ldquo;shall ensure that its activities are so conducted as to afford appropriate protection for the environment and the archaeological heritage&rdquo;. This type of provision seems unexceptionable as a matter of theory and principle and I very much welcome recognition of the importance of protecting our peatland environment.  I have a particular interest in the preservation of a representative sample of raised bogs in the midlands as it is important that some should be preserved for posterity.  However, I am not sure whether section 56 of the Bill is appropriate if the purpose of the measure is to put the board and its subsidiaries on a modern commercial basis.  Other companies dealing in different markets do not have a general obligation in their founding charters to ensure their activities are conducted to afford appropriate protection for the environment and archaeological heritage.  I am not saying these are unworthy objectives or that we should not provide for them in every possible manner in this House, but is it appropriate to include such a section in legislation governing a company which we want to operate in the market like other companies? We do not impose such an obligation on any other company.  It should be noted that the terms of the section apply to subsidiaries as well as the board.  This means, for example, that a company established under the legislation to deal with the circulation of domestic fuel such as peat and coal will have to conduct its activities in such a manner as to afford appropriate protection for the environment and the archaeological heritage. This seems a curious provision for such a company. While the theoretical basis of the section as a matter of principle seems sensible, I wonder whether it is appropriate to include such a section in a measure designed to put these companies on <Col N="29" /> a level playing field.  The inclusion of this section means the playing field is not level because it places obligations on them which are not imposed on other companies.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear hostile to the appropriate preservation of peatlands.  The operations of the board should be conducted as far as is practicable in a manner that respects the environment and protects a very important part of our history and geographical experience.  However, section 56 seems a curious provision.  I thought the Environmental Protection Agency regulated commercial operations in peatlands and that necessary licences had to be sought and impact assessments prepared.  I do not see why the board or its subsidiaries should be put in a different position from everybody else and I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important Bill which provides the necessary commercial flexibility to allow Bord na Móna and its envisaged subsidiaries to operate on commercial lines in a modern market place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Wall.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Bill.  I come from the heart of the midlands and I know the importance of Bord na Móna in the economic and social activities of the midlands.  Deputy Lenihan should not deprecate his midlands connection which is long and honourable; his late father and many others played a role in the development of Bord na Móna in Westmeath and in Lanesborough in County Longford and into Roscommon.</P>
      <P>The Bill will result in the constitution of Bord na Móna as a PLC and of its four divisions as limited companies.  When it was set up in 1946 with a largely developmental mandate, it was appropriate for Bord na Móna to have the structure of a statutory corporation.  In the intervening years, it has successfully carried out the mandate given to it by successive Governments.  That mandate was strenuous on occasions and many social obligations were imposed, but Governments were often less than forthcoming with the necessary financial support.  Nevertheless, Bord na Móna carried out its mandate given to it by successive Governments in a series of turf development Acts and it has now been set up on a fully commercial structure.  I will make some points later on aspects of the Bill with which I have problems.  I hope the Minister will look favourably on a number of amendments from this side of the House on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The change from statutory corporation to limited company status will have the general effect of causing Bord na Móna to adopt and operate on the financial, management and legal structures in general use in all commercial entities.  The main effects of the change will be that Bord na Móna will become a holding company and all its operations and business will be carried out by one or other of the new subsidiary companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> Although the Turf Development Act, 1990 gave Bord na Móna the power to form subsidiary companies, that Act did not allow it to delegate any of its statutory functions to such subsidiaries and, more particularly, did not provide the mechanism for the transfer of assets and liabilities to subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna comprises a group centre and four divisions &mdash; peat energy, horticulture, fuels and environment.  In addition, a number of small scale enterprises have been established in the consultancy, tourism, engineering and bogwood sculpture.  The Celtic Roots phenomenon is very popular in the midlands and we often utilise the bogwood sculpture there to make presentations. We are proud of that sculpture in the midlands and visitors from the United States and Europe are very interested in it.  I pay tribute to Michael Casey and those involved in that area.</P>
    <P>The economic importance of the board to the midlands cannot be over emphasised.  In the midlands Bord na Móna employs approximately 1,800 permanent and 580 seasonal workers.  The breakdown of employment on a divisional basis is as follows: peat energy &mdash; 963 permanent and 500 seasonal employees; fuels &mdash; 400 permanent and 20 seasonal employees; horticulture &mdash; 312 permanent and seasonal employees in addition to 75 employees in France.  There are approximately 70 permanent employees in the environmental area.</P>
    <P>I frequently make reference in the House to the pain suffered by people in the midlands during the l980s when more than 2,000 people lost their jobs in Bord na Móna.  That is a significant fact which many people, both inside and outside this House, have forgotten.  Those families made a major contribution to the development of Bord na Móna from its establishment in the late l940s. The trade union movement in particular played a significant role, which should never be underestimated, together with the workforce in ensuring that Bord na Móna turned the corner in regard to its difficulties.  Nevertheless, we must acknowledge the pain experienced in the midlands when many families were devastated by job losses.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna employees and the unions, together with the management, embraced change with the advent of the autonomous units.  I salute all the people involved for their efforts in that regard which was appreciated by both the management and the Government of the day. However, one should never underestimate the degree of pain suffered by people in that regard. I pay tribute to the former chief executive, Eddie O'Connor, whom I knew well and who played a vital role in turning around the fortunes of the company.  He was an innovator with many ideas and he was anxious that the company would develop new product lines.  I pay tribute and wish every success to the current chief executive, Paddy Hughes, who brings a new dimension to that role.  He has been involved with Bord na Móna for more than 20 years and, coming from <Col N="31" /> the midlands, he realises the importance of the company to the area.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to a colleague of mine, Councillor Mark Nugent, who has given 37 years' service to Bord na Móna and who is currently vice-chairman of the board.  He was the person who came up with the idea of the Europeat station which is now coming to fruition. On many occasions I heard him advocating that idea at council meetings, and not everyone looked favourably upon it.  This was a person who started at the bottom in Bord na Móna, became a worker-director and is now vice-chairman of the board.  He could see the company's potential but he also saw the pain and he never wanted to see such pain inflicted on families in areas from Rochfortbridge, Tyrrellspass, Kilbeggan, Kinnegad, into Mullingar, Lanesborough and across into Rattin.  He was part of the engine that brought the peat fired station to fruition.  He knew that was critical to the future of Bord na Móna.  That station will secure the future of families living in places like Derrygreenagh and across the bogs into Tyrrellspass and Kinnegad for the next 30 years.  Nobody should underestimate the importance of the Europeat-fired station.</P>
    <P>It grieves me to hear certain economists and people who live in ivory towers talk about cost benefit analyses in relation to peat fired stations, and that Structural Funds would be better spent elsewhere.  I have a message for those erstwhile people who try to evaluate life in the midlands. Not everything can be evaluated by way of a grandiose cost benefit analysis.  If that were the case, all funds would be allocated to areas with the best infrastructure, the large urban areas, and rural Ireland would be forgotten.  Is that what they want?  I want to send out a clear signal that that is not what we want in Westmeath or in the midlands.  We want to be treated equally.  This is a vitally important project for the midlands which will have a major impact on employment in Bord na Móna because the necessary work on the preparation of the bogs and the peat extraction will provide approximately 300 full-time and 250 part-time jobs over the lifetime of the station.  In its construction stage, the project will provide 450 to 500 jobs and the infrastructure exists to allow it develop.  The rail network has been laid painstakingly by Bord na Móna workers and they should not be denied the right to obtain Structural Funds to ensure this station goes ahead.</P>
    <P>This project is critically important to the local economy and to the wider economy of the midlands. It will be worth approximately £20 million to the area in its construction phase and £8 million to £10 million when in operation.  That money will accrue to the various shops across the midlands, particularly in my own area of Westmeath. Indeed, the houses at Derrygreenagh in Rochfortbridge were built on Bord na Móna land. Approximately 120 families live there and they have all given service to Bord na Móna.  The sons and daughters of those families are now giving <Col N="32" /> their services to Bord na Móna.  That is approximately 600 or 700 people and we should never underestimate the importance of that service. What would be the result if anything happened to Bord na Móna in such an area?  If Bord na Móna was threatened it would destroy the social and economic fabric of such an area.  That is why the new peat fired station, which will be subject to planning and environmental requirements, is critical to the survival of Bord na Móna in the midlands.  We should ensure there are no further obstacles to its development and that it will be built as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I come from Westmeath and I know of other areas that are also critically important.  There is a decline in the population in Coolnagun in north Westmeath which is in need of reinvigoration, revitalisation and regeneration.  The recent census reveals that some townlands in that area which supported families in the past have been denuded of their populations.  This is a time of plenty and there is much talk about the Celtic tiger, but people wonder what it is all about when many are not benefiting.  That is why the Coolnagun plant was critical.  It employed 72 people from the Coolnagun area when it was set up in the late 1940s and commenced production of sod turf in the 1953 season.  It produced 49,000 tonnes at maximum production in 1975, but it was closed in February 1988.  However, thankfully, the works have diversified production and production figures have increased steadily.  It now produces some 7,000 cubic metres of peat nuggets for environmental and horticultural use.  That represents an increase of 190 per cent in four years. It is currently producing between 3,500 and 4,000 bags of peat walling blocks per year.  The works at Coolnagun have shown adaptability to the marketplace and must be congratulated on the innovative way it has retained substantial economic activity in the area.</P>
    <P>In the mid-1980s my colleague Councillor Mark Nugent talked about a peat fired generating station as an important aspect to feed into the electricity generation network.  Like him, I suggest that if we adopt the Finnish model there is no reason we cannot give life back to an area like Coolnagun by establishing a ten, 15 or 20 megawatt peat fired generating station in that area.  I ask the Minister, who is innovative and practical, to take note of this.  There is 30 years' supply of peat in that area.  Why not utilise it?  Its use is critical to the survival to towns across north Westmeath including Castlepollard, Finea, Coole and Multyfarnham.  It is a single flicker of hope to the people of those areas and should be considered. The hatches should not be battened down.  We should be receptive to ideas such as this to give hope to the people.  It serves an important role in relation to the electricity generation network.  It is being done in Finland and we should examine that case study.  That was the case study used for the 120 megawatts peat fired station.  We should come down the scale, consider areas like Coolnagun and give hope to families.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> I am concerned about one aspect of the Bill which empowers the Minister to sell off 49 per cent of the holding company and all or any one of the subsidiaries in so far as the value of that subsidiary does not exceed 50 per cent of the total.  That means the Minister could take two or three of the subsidiaries together in a block and sell them off if they constitute only 49 per cent of the total.  Section 41 should provide that the Minister cannot sell off each subsidiary unless she returns to the Dáil for its approval.  I am concerned that section could be used as a blueprint for the sale of all but the company's core activity of producing turf.  There are also horticulture and environmental areas and I am concerned that they might be sold off without any reporting back to the Dáil.  I know the Minister will carefully examine section 41 and I appeal to her to reconsider the provision.  I am giving the Minister of State adequate warning that section 41 will be considered very carefully by the Labour Party and we will table an amendment to it.  My colleague, Deputy Wall, will comment on this in his contribution, nevertheless I welcome the thrust of the Bill which, at least, recognises the importance of Bord na Móna and peat production for the midlands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which brings Bord na Móna, a vital industry in south Kildare, into the public arena which affords us the opportunity of a full debate on it.  When I became a public representative I was briefed on Bord na Móna by Eddie O'Connor, one of its former chief executives. I understand it was at his initiative the headquarters of Bord na Móna were moved to Newbridge in County Kildare.  That has resulted in putting in place there a vital sector of the business community not alone from the point of view of presentation in terms of the magnificent work done on the offices in the main street, but also in terms of bringing life to Newbridge.  It has benefited the Newbridge area because of the number of employees, etc., in its head office.  I also thank Paddy Hughes who was more than forthcoming on any occasion I had to seek information from Bord na Móna.  Kevin McMahon of SIPTU went far beyond his duty on occasions to ensure a positive attitude from the workforce in Bord na Móna.  As my colleague, Deputy Penrose, stated he stood up and was counted in the 1980s and sought to ensure that the workers of Bord na Mó na played their part in its development to ensure a future for Kildare and west Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company is made up of four sections and I would be gravely concerned if under section 41 any of them were sold off.  Each of them in their own right plays a major part in the development of Kildare.  Unfortunately, west Kildare has suffered a great loss of jobs over the years.  It was with interest that I read in a local hostelry a small advertisement cut from a local paper in the late 1940s or early 1950s which sought to recruit 1,000 employees for Bord na Móna.  That advertisement was displayed with pride because in that <Col N="34" /> area 1,000 employees were needed to ensure the progress of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>In reply to a recent parliamentary question the Minister stated that the new peat burning station would commence in 1999 and, week in week out, the people from west Kildare approach me asking whether that date will be met.  I ask the Minister and her Department to ensure that for the future success and hope of west Kildare area that date is met and that the station will be completed by the set date of 2001.  I also ask that every effort be made to refurbish Kilberry plant which is a vital ingredient in the development of south Kildare and has been since it was first initiated. Bord na Móna is a vital sector of employment in Kildare.  I hope the Minister will ensure that the energy, peat and horticulture sections and the environmental section, which is vital and its initial stages of development, will be allowed to continue under the auspices of Bord na Móna and that it will remain within the remit of this House to ensure its future progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>While I give a general welcome to the Bill, why is it necessary at this stage? I am aware the Bill provides for the conversion of Bord na Móna from a statutory corporation to a public limited company under the Companies Act and that, as a result, the Minister will have shares in the company equal to the value of its net assets.  Why is that necessary at this stage of the development of Bord na Móna, which has been operating for the past 50 years?  I would like clarification from the Minister.</P>
      <P>When introducing the Bill, the Minister dealt with the history and effect of Bord na Móna in the Westmeath area, the acquiring of vast acres of raised bog in the midlands, the development of machinery and technology to drain those bogs and the part Bord na Móna played in that regard. It played a part in the development technology being used in other countries.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with the development of Bord na Móna in the midlands from where I come.  I remember a day in the 1950s when two officials from Bord na Mó na arrived at our house.  Without prior knowledge or consultation, except for rumour in the area, they negotiated with my father to acquire 200 acres of his raised bog for a princely sum of £1 per acre.  I saw the machinery arrive and the adapted plough machines which were used to drain this vast bog stretching for more than ten miles from Kenagh to Lanesborough to Ballymahon and the surrounding areas. It was extraordinary to see machinery move onto a vast area of bog covered with heather which was being turned into a mill peat area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the great work Bord na Móna did by providing much needed employment in the <Col N="35" /> midlands.  Many part-time farmers, their sons and families were able to get work with Bord na Móna.  In the 1950s and 1960s, it revitalised the area by providing employment.  The social role Bord na Móna played benefited the area to which I refer.  Many people who would have otherwise emigrated were able to obtain reasonable employment in their area and maintain their families. It had a tremendous effect on the social fabric of the area.</P>
    <P>The small rural parish from which I came was able to keep its young people at home and this resulted in better activities and GAA pitches. Although it was the smallest parish in the county, we were able to win through to a county championship. Most of the players were employees of Bord na Móna.  I recognise the beneficial effect Bord na Móna had on the social fabric of the area.</P>
    <P>There is an old Irish proverb which states that: <i>is féidir leat an fear a thógáil as an bportach ach ní féidir leat an portach a bhaint as an bhfear</i> but the opposite was the case with Bord na Móna.  It did not take the man out of the bog but took the bog out of the man from the point of view of training, developing and operating sophisticated machinery for the drainage and development of bogs.  At first Bord na Móna adapted drainage ploughs and ditching machines which ditched material from the drains across the heather.  Har-row and harvesting machines were also used.</P>
    <P>When Bord na Móna moved into this area, it was covered by vast areas of raised bog covered by heather measuring ten by five miles in some cases.  The bogs were rarely transgressed by people, except at the edges where traditional turf cutting took place.  The area was transformed when Bord na Móna drained the bogs and harvested the peat.  Within a few years, vast areas covered by heather were covered with mill peat without any remaining vegetation.  All wildlife disappeared from the bogs.</P>
    <P>When I grew up red grouse nested and fed on the heather and wild geese migrated to feed on the bogs in winter.  Each day one would see them coming in droves.  All such wildlife disappeared when Bord na Móna took over the bogs.  I am sure wildlife and environmental interests would not allow that to happen today.  I will let somebody else judge whether that would be good or bad.  It would have been bad for rural society in the area.  I do not know what effect it had on other species besides grouse, wild geese, snipe, curlews, woodcock, etc., which have all disappeared from the bog area.</P>
    <P>I represent West Galway, areas of which are covered by blanket bog which is different from raised bog.  Practically all of Conemara is preserved under the special areas of conservation. Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, will extend the SAC to the raised bogs of the midlands because we must preserve some of these bogs despite the benefits provided by Bord na <Col N="36" /> Móna.  Half the raised bogs in the world, about 19,000 hectares, are located here.  Much of the area has been developed and I do know what steps the Minister and the Department are taking to preserve some of these areas.  I am aware of the efforts of the Irish Peatlands Conservation Council to preserve some of the raised bogs in the midlands.  Recently, approximately 40 acres was acquired near Mullingar.  What is the policy of Bord na Móna, the Minister and the Department in preserving some of these bogs?</P>
    <P>Before the arrival of Bord na Móna only the edges of the bogs were utilised.  This preserved the bog because only the top two feet were turned over each year thus preserving the lower bank on which heather grew.  The natural state of the bog was preserved. The development of peat moss was a different concept.  I visited this area recently and noticed that since I left 30 years ago, the level of the bog has dropped 30 to 50 feet in some cases because of drainage and the milling of peat.  Vast areas of bog were drained into rivers which flowed into the River Shannon and they are now at a lower level than when drained.  A pump is required to take out the last few feet of peat.</P>
    <P>What will happen to those bogs when Bord na Móna pulls out and when the mill peat is finished? I remember my father asking the officials if the bogs would revert to his sons, their sons or families after being cut out.  I was a small child at the time but I remember he got a vague promise from the officials that the bogs would revert to the bog owners, who practically gave away their bogs for £1 per acre because they thought, perhaps through ignorance, they had no other option.  That is why, like Deputy Penrose, I am concerned about section 41 as I do not know what rights it confers for the disposing of assets when they are finished with.  I would like them to remain with the local people.  The great work which was done should be recognised and I hope it can be sustained in the area by the provision of briquette factories which will utilise and develop the remaining bog, although I do not know what life is left in it.</P>
    <P>We must examine the long-term implications for the area.  What will happen to the people and their families who have lived near those bogs and worked in them for the past 40 years?  What will their employment prospects be when the bogs in the midlands run out?  Those questions must be examined and this Bill is the opportunity to do that.  It is 40 or 50 years since the last Bill was introduced in the Dáil.  I will deal with the issues in more detail on Committee Stage.  I intend to pin down the Minister on the long-term plans of Bord na Móna and the plans for disposing of or utilising the vast areas which are left.  If the peat is to be extracted down to the gravel as I observed in some cases, what will be the value of what is left?  Will it be a swamp, as it was thousands of years ago?</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCormack for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Bill and <Col N="37" /> the opportunity to speak on it.  I once spoke with a retired Bord na Móna worker who was one of the first to work locally with the company.  He told me of the two things he feared most in his fragile employment contract.  The first was obvious for the time: a wet summer.  The second I would not have guessed: general elections.  I asked him why he, a Bord na Móna worker, feared them.  He said that, with the proliferation of promises politicians made at election time regarding the development of boglands in Ireland and the closing and opening of power stations, he never knew where he was going to be employed, if he continued to be.  That is the opinion of most workers of the many promises made by politicians and respective Governments down the years.</P>
      <P>In east Galway, we have a failed monument to such promises and it is no more than a lighthouse in a bog.  It is a concrete slab which still remains in Derrynafada in north east Galway on the border with south Roscommon.  It was the result of demands made prior to elections and was established to a fanfare of delight and tape cutting.  It remains unoccupied and undeveloped, but I hope Bord na Móna will be able to utilise and develop it within the next decade and fulfil the promises made in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>It is timely we are debating this Bill as Bord na Móna was set up more than 50 years ago and will now be established as a public limited company under the Companies Acts and will be subject to all the legal obligations and responsibilities of other commercial companies.  Bord na Móna has been a traditional company supplying energy, peat moss and sod turf to generating stations over the years.  Many speakers praised its work, its management, its workers and its engineers.  I wholeheartedly endorse those remarks because, through the company's insight and development work, it has provided employment in areas which would have found it very difficult to attract industry. Seasonal though much of the work may have been, it at least supplemented the incomes of many people and kept generations of people in areas where it would have been impossible to stem the tide of emigration.</P>
      <P>Today we face rural decline for other reasons. The development of Bord na Móna, the work it has done and has provided for many generations, especially in the midlands, has been worthwhile, and should be looked upon as a part of a rural renewal initiative of a bygone age.  It might be an example for us to follow today.  If Bord na Móna is rationalised as threatened, it should be well thought out and should not be a case of closing one power station after another, offering the workers redundancy packages and leaving one shining jewel in the company.  We should progress very slowly and carefully because of the traditional role Bord na Móna has played in renewing and sustaining rural Ireland, especially areas in great difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna has expanded and diversified over the years into the production of commodities <Col N="38" /> such as the branded Shamrock peat moss, exports in horticulture and delving into the area of tourism.  There is a very important tourism development in County Offaly related to Bord na Móna &mdash; the bog train &mdash; which has caught on as a concept.  I pay tribute to Bord na Móna as an indigenous company which has shared its experience with the people, especially young people in school.  It has gone to the trouble to encourage young people to learn about peat bogs, be they the blanket bogs of the west or the raised bogs of the Central Plain.  It has supplied very important education packs and resources, made them readily available to schools with the accompanying details and information sheets and has granted very generous access to its plants.  The company has provided this down the years and allowed schoolchildren see how electricity and energy is used which assists in the area of conservation.</P>
    <P>However, I must complain about the serious silting and pollution Bord na Móna is causing in the Shannon, especially around Portumna on Lough Derg.  It seems no effort has been made by the company to restrict and retain the silt which has been allowed to flow freely without filtration into the water courses and networks of the Shannon. Lough Derg is today lined in some places with several metres of silt, especially in the small inlets and bays.  I refer particularly to Portumna, County Galway, where a swimming pool is being destroyed and Bord na Móna must take responsibility for it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and its provisions.  I listened with interest to the Minister's speech as she reminisced about the time she spent working in bogs. I also spent many schooldays working in bogs but they were different from those of the Minister. Perhaps this is due to gender as I recall many tough days catching turf.  If one dropped a sod on top of the &ldquo;sleánsman&rdquo; one did not have a pleasant day and could have had a reddened ear by the end of it.  People say they were great days but it was a tough time.  Perhaps as the Minister is of a different gender she had an easier time.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna was established in 1946 through the foresight of the then Government to develop a great natural resource.  It entered uncharted waters because no one was sure how the company would turn out.  Tremendous development work across the countryside was required.  While the company was seen as developing an indigenous fuel source, it also contributed significantly to social development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> There is extensive bogland in my county, Westmeath, particularly around Rochfortbridge. A community grew up in Derrygreenagh where 100 houses were specifically built by Bord na Móna for its workers 40 years ago.  It was a far sighted development which was nicely laid out with a huge park in the middle and the houses were well kept and have been preserved.  Derrygreenagh and its associated bog contributes substantially to the economy of the area in towns such as Rochfortbridge, Tyrrellspass, Kilbeggan and also Mullingar to which many of the employees travel.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago approximately 500 people were employed at the bog along with 200 seasonal workers.  Times have changed dramatically with only 220 people employed now along with 80 seasonal workers.  People took redundancy, some still work in the area, others retired and are enjoying it, while a small proportion never managed to find other employment.  Nonetheless the area still thrives and the recent proposals on Europeat are welcome and have given the area a great lift.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna employees were decent, high calibre, hard working folk.  They were associated with the communities built by the company but the workforce was also drawn from the hinterland, including farmers who were prepared to take up seasonal work to augment their meagre incomes.  Thriving schools were associated with them also.  For example, there is a very progressive secondary school in Rochfortbridge with 800 pupils who achieve remarkable standards in State examinations.  The children of Bord na Móna employees are to be found in high office throughout the country and should be commended.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna is to be applauded for recruiting apprentices.  Many young people took up apprenticeships there.  They received a great grounding in engineering and electrical work which stood to them over time and many of them subsequently set up their own businesses.  However, many good things come to an end and the bubble burst for Bord na Móna towards the end of the 1980s.  During the oil crisis it was told to develop because Ireland needed an alternative indigenous source of power.  It developed bogs to produce the raw material to fuel power stations.  Thankfully the oil crisis ended and prices reverted to a more reasonable level.</P>
    <P>However, regretfully, it caused havoc in Bord na Móna and many employees who had been taken on to carry out development work were no longer needed.  The company accumulated huge debts of approximately £200 million whereas its turnover was £120 million.  It was insolvent for a number of years and had its creditors decided to move it would have been embarrassing as the company had undertaken substantial borrowings which were guaranteed by the State.  This sum could have been added to the national debt.</P>
    <P>Over the years Bord na Móna had to have a radical rethink and examine where it was going.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> It is fair to commend the board and staff who went through the difficult process of rationalisation to achieve what was needed and in particular, tribute should be paid to the then chief executive, Mr. Eddie O'Connor, for his work.  He took the company from a position where it employed 5,000 people to one where it has 2,400 employees. In that period, no days were lost through industrial action as everything was negotiated and agreed with unions and workers.  The output per worker changed dramatically from 2,000 tonnes per annum at the end of the 1980s to 5,000 tonnes per annum at present.  That involved changes in work practices, development of new machinery, etc.  Eddie O'Connor got a raw deal when the chips were down.  He was treated shabbily by the previous Government and a man who had done so much for a semi-State company should not have been treated in that way.  If only we could turn back the clock.</P>
    <P>The reduction in staff dramatically changed the face of many Bord na Móna villages.  Twenty years ago 500 staff were employed in the Derrygreenagh area and about 200 seasonal workers. Today there are 220 staff and about 80 seasonal workers.  At the other end of the county the Coolnagun development was going quite well with about 70 workers.  However, in February 1989 the doors closed and all that remained was a skeleton staff.  That was a tremendous blow to the economic viability of that area and to the population there.  North Westmeath has suffered dramatic losses of population over the past 20 years and it was a sad day for Coolnagun when the Bord na Móna development closed leaving only a skeleton staff.  Thankfully, the skeleton staff that remained there have been dynamic.  They introduced new work practices and developed new products. There is now a thriving industry involving quite a number of enterprise groups and workers.  The new peat walling block which is used in horticulture was developed at Coolnagun, is now being exported and is extremely successful.  Peat nuggets were also developed there.  This station provides valuable employment in that area which is very welcome.</P>
    <P>This Bill will set up Bord na Móna as an ordinary company which will be able to operate under the same type of financial management and legal structures as any other commercial company.  The injection of £100 million by the State was right and proper because the borrowings of Bord na Móna were underwritten by the State and it was at the behest of the State that many of the development costs incurred were spent.</P>
    <P>I am delighted progress continues to be made on the Europeat project which is to be centred in the midlands.  Successive Governments have put their shoulders to the wheel to ensure this happens. I understand it is now at the tendering process and that the successful company will be announced early in the new year.  When that happens the Minister must ensure that the company moves ahead as quickly as possible to develop the project.  It will make a tremendous difference to <Col N="41" /> the midlands and County Westmeath, the county the Minister and I represent.  It will create important employment opportunities &mdash; it is expected that when the Europeat project goes ahead about 250 full-time additional jobs and a substantial number of seasonal jobs will be created in the Derrygreenagh area.  Infrastructural work has already commenced with the upgrading of railway lines to serve that power station when it comes on stream, and it is expected that by the time the station opens 1.5 million tonnes of milled peat will already have been stockpiled.</P>
    <P>In considering tenders for the new peat fired station and in negotiating with the successful company the Minister should look seriously at the proposals made by the workers at Rhode power station.  They have put forward plausible reasons for upgrading the Rhode station to be the new peat fired station.  I appreciate that the new company will call the tune as to where the new station will be sited.  Nevertheless, we should look carefully at what is happening at Rhode, how it could be adapted and the possibilities for saving taxpayers' money and ensuring the employability of the workers there.</P>
    <P>Some developmental work has been undertaken by Bord no Móna, particularly horticultural and environmental product development.  One example which was mentioned in the House is the Puraflo treatment system for septic tanks attached to domestic houses and larger developments. That was developed by Bord na Móna. It has been tried and tested and has been found to be successful.  The Government could undertake a promotion of that produce to encourage its use around the country.  Not only would it have a beneficial effect on the environment and improve the outflow from septic tanks, it would create additional employment opportunities within Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>There is a facility in the Bill in relation to superannuation payments, but it does not say clearly how future pensioners from Bord na Móna will be accommodated.  I expect and hope they will be accommodated, but will they remain as pensioners of the holding company of Bord na Móna or will they be apportioned between the four subsidiaries that are being established?  It is important to clarify that and I would like to hear what the Minister says about it.  It is crucial from the point of view of the pensioners that their pensions are secure but, in terms of future performance of the subsidiaries, it is important to clarify how this will be done.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to supporting indigenous fuels for power is important, but what will happen to the peat stations in County Westmeath over the next few years?  Are they likely to be refurbished so that they can continue in use?  What are the Minister's views on these power stations which are important for employment within that large catchment area?  It is important for the Minister to talk to the ESB and Bord na Móna to ensure that those stations are <Col N="42" /> revamped so that their employment potential will remain.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in the Bill of cutaway bogs, which are contentious in parts of Westmeath. Some of the cutaway bogs have been successfully turned into grassland and sold off to adjoining landowners.  Should some of those bogs not be allowed to revert to wetlands?  We need to formulate policy in relation to that.  Does the Minister envisage a role in the horticultural area for private operators who are in competition with Bord na Móna and who have not received any subsidies?  Is she open to discussing with them how they can continue to develop their enterprises?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to talking to anyone about anything at any time.  I will be glad to take up the matter raised by Deputy McGrath.</P>
      <P>We have had a very interesting and full debate on the Bill.  While it is open to all Deputies to contribute, the debate was legitimately dominated by those Deputies who represent constituencies where there are Bord na Móna stations.  I was present for the contributions by the Opposition spokespersons and listened on the monitor to many of the other contributions, and I found all of them very interesting.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stagg asked me to withdraw the Bill but I have no intention of doing so.  It is very important from the point of view of the future development of Bord na Móna and has been welcomed by the management and workers.  I have spoken with the chairman and will meet the unions tomorrow.  I thank Deputy Dukes for the work he put into the Bill when he was Minister. He was ably assisted at that time by Deputy Stagg.  It is, therefore, bemusing that Deputy Stagg wishes me to withdraw a Bill he supported in Government.  His party leader was also enthusiastic about it.</P>
      <P>The proposal to establish four operating divisions was approved by the previous Government. The then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, put forward the proposal, which I am glad to follow through, that more than 50 per cent of the aggregate value of the four subsidiaries cannot be disposed of without the approval of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I am very enthusiastic about the Bill as I represent a constituency where Bord na Móna plays a major role.  I want to give the company a future and the Bill provides for an equity injection of £100 million and the payment of the £10 million overhang.  Deputies referred to employees' concerns about pensions.  The provisions dealing with pensions are comprehensive and cover both past and future employees.  Existing staff will retain their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies referred to the new peat fired station.  When I met the EU Commissioner last week she stressed the importance of ensuring this station comes to fruition within the specified time.  I have instituted a practice whereby I am given a report every Monday on the progress in <Col N="43" /> the station.  While the matter is moving along slowly, it is within schedule.  An international consortium is handling the tendering procedure and I know nothing about it.  After the consortium give me the details of the successful tenderer it will be a case of all hands on deck to ensure the station is completed within the specified time. Proposals have been put forward on various locations but this will depend on the tenderer. Clonbullogue is one of the possible locations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes criticised the Government for the non-implementation of the Buckley report as it affects chief executives.  The previous Government adopted the report but, like St. Augustine, it said &ldquo;not yet, dear Lord&rdquo;.  This Government has also adopted the report but has not yet implemented it.  The report involves more than chief executives, for example, semi-State companies and other groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <P>The chief executives are making some noises about it.  The Government will implement the report in time.  Like the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, my lips are sealed on these matters, but it may not be as soon as they think.</P>
      <P>Fears about the future of the Bellacorick station are premature.  Most of us live in communities affected by the rationalisation measures taken by Bord na Móna.  However, we managed to live through that time.  The company is now on the right track and is focused on what must be done.  The division of the company into four operating divisions will ensure it concentrates on making each division viable.</P>
      <P>On the points raised by Deputy Stagg, I checked the record and we have adhered to the recommendations made by the Cabinet.  I was glad to follow through on the proposals made by Deputy De Rossa and do not intend to withdraw the Bill.  One cannot accommodate all views in legislation, but this is a fine developmental Bill.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate and the consideration of amendments.</P>

      <P>I met the World Media Network on Thursday, 13 November 1997 following a request from <i>The Irish Times</i> which is a member of the network and was hosting an editorial meeting of the group in Dublin.  The World Media Network is a grouping of 20 newspapers around the world, but predominantly European.  It started in 1990, embracing such titles as <i>The</i></P>
      <P>
        <i>Guardian</i>, and <i>La Stampa.</i>  It has since expanded to take in several Middle Eastern titles as well as a number of Latin American and Asian ones.  I am circulating a list of current members in this reply.  <i>The Irish Times</i> has been a member since 1992.</P>
      <P>The network publishes two supplements each year, one geopolitical and the other a guide to summer cultural events in Europe.  Recent topics have included Europe, world centres of power, cities and health.  The network's editorial meetings alternate between its headquarters in Paris, and at six-monthly intervals, the home cities of its members.  Recent meetings have been in Madrid, Cairo, Sarajevo, Istanbul, Marrakesh, and Turin.</P>
      <P>Those attending the briefing in Government Buildings were editorial executives who usually report for their newspapers on these briefings. Deputies will see from the list of papers circulated that it provided a very good opportunity to present a positive view of Ireland, particularly the economy and the peace process, to a wide international audience.  I was accompanied at the briefing by the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs.  We discussed aspects of Irish economic and foreign policy with the group and briefed them on progress in the peace process and the all-party talks.</P>

      <P>The NESC is currently undertaking three studies.  These are: a study of settlement patterns in Ireland; an examination of the level of investment in Ireland and its implications for the sustainability of growth; and the development of a set of indicators to benchmark progress in relation to Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>Both the settlement patterns study and the investment study have been completed.

      <P>The council launched the new NESC Research Series at a seminar in Dublin Castle on Thursday, 27 November.  The series is based on work done by the council which is considered to be a potential contribution to the wider public debate but on which the council has not adopted a position. This series will allow the council to make a contribution to public policy discussions in areas where definitive conclusions by the council are not appropriate.  The first three papers in this series focus on clusters in three separate Irish industries and copies have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

The report to which the Deputy referred, Population Distribution and Economic Development: Trends and Policy Implications has been completed and will be published before the end of the year.  That useful report was drawn up as a result of a Government request and recommendations in the council's study on new approaches to rural development to examine patterns of population settlement.  In its study, the council emphasised that any examination of patterns of population change must be viewed on the basis of the principles of economic and social equity, in other words, we should focus on policy implications for rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The report's objective is to outline the general patterns and trends in population distribution since l950.  Those patterns and trends were considered in terms of how they were subject to the influence of public policy, particularly economic policy, over that period and in terms of their implications for public policy and public service provision in the future.  This includes services such as health, education and transport in rural Ireland.  The key question posed relates to how public policy can effectively achieve a sustained high level of national economic and social development with a relatively dispersed distribution of benefits.  The report will be useful in the debate on rural development and rural regeneration, to which I am very committed.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the agriculture side of rural development, and more particularly for aspects of rural renewal, will rest with the Minister of State, Deputy Davern.  As the debate does not deal exclusively with agriculture, a debate took place on whether the matter should come under the remit of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  We have been forming a section in that Department to deal with the matter.  The Commissioner for Agriculture, Franz Fischler's proposals are geared towards agriculture and related issues.  It makes sense, therefore, that the Department of Agriculture and Food should deal primarily with the matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this question has been on the Order Paper for a number of weeks, but we were not able to resolve the problem.  The technical problem has not been sorted out.  Apparently from the time the web site was set up &mdash; although I do not know why &mdash; the Taoiseach's Department was linked up separately. When the system changed in the Department of Finance the Taoiseach's Department was isolated and people in the Department have not been able to resolve the problem.  This was brought to light in the Department after 6 October.  We have had to forget about what is there and reconstruct the website.  When it is up to date it will operate under the arrangements I outlined to Deputy Sargent.  We have not been able to correct the problem since it was highlighted in October.  I have been asking about this for the past three weeks and have been told it will be technically right by Christmas.

This is a mistake in view of the substantial loss of life which occurred in County Meath in 1798.  What does the Taoiseach intend doing about this?  Is there any commemoration planned for the Young Ireland rising of 1848 of which next year is the 150th anniversary?</P>

      <P>There are no plans on my list to commemorate the 1848 rising.  To the best of my knowledge it is not tied in with my recent reply concerning 1798 but I will check that.  I thank Deputy Bruton for his letter which sets out the historical facts of a substantial engagement during 1798 in County Meath.  The group involved has not made any application.  I thank the Deputy for giving me a contact name in the Meath Historical Society.  I have instructed the committee to contact the society so that it will be included.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate what form the commemorations will take? Does he have any concerns or reservations about the fact that the events being commemorated are all violent?  Given the violence of the past 27 years in Northern Ireland which purported to be based on the history of 1798, 1848, 1916, 1919 and so on, does he consider it is time for us to use next year as a period of reflection on how we look at our history?  Perhaps we are having too many simplistic commemorations.  We should look in depth at our history in all its complexity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy should wait until we reach Parliamentary Question No. 10 to deal with the full facts of the National Commemoration Committee.  The Irish community across the world is engaged in commemorating the 1798 rebellion.  There are committees in New Zealand, the US and Britain.  Irish people are very anxious to commemorate this event and the committees are incredibly determined to do so. Many books, pamphlets and videos are being produced. Things have changed a little when one looks at the leaders of the 1798 rebellion.  They are different to those we tend to associate with more recent events.  We have many commemorations of violent events but that is how our history has been for the past 800 years.  We commemorate many of these events in a peaceful manner.  Many commemorations involve pageants designed to commemorate events in a more stable way than in the past.  Offence can be caused by the determination of some people to commemorate events in a more realistic manner.</P>
      <P>I am more supportive of commemorating events surrounding the Croppy Acre in Wexford, Thomas Street and other developments that are focused on museums and memorials.  The committee in Wexford are trying to create an overall commemoration of which people will be proud.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that a commemoration of 1798, or of any military engagement, should commemorate the memory of those who fought on both sides so that a genuine sense of healing rather than division is achieved?  I agree with Deputy De Rossa that we should commemorate peaceful constitutional change.  In that regard, 1998 will be the 50th anniversary of the declaration of the Republic by John A. Costello and will also be the 50th anniversary of the first rainbow coalition Government.</P>

      <P>It is too early to say if that matter will be discussed next week, but the Minister for Agriculture and Food hopes to meet his British counterpart in London tomorrow to discuss this matter.  Whether I raise this matter with Prime Minister Juncker or other European colleagues depends on what happens over the next few days.

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that this is the second occasion in less than six weeks that disruptions have occurred in large EU countries &mdash; first France, now Britain &mdash; which disrupt the normal legal methods of trade for small EU countries like Ireland?  This is a serious practical issue for EU construction.  If we cannot guarantee the transport of goods, the internal market means next to nothing.  In modern business, &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; delivery means just that, and any disruption of that is very serious.  The Taoiseach should take this matter on board.  Even if the Welsh issue is <Col N="55" /> resolved, he should raise the matter in Luxembourg.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that what happened last Sunday night and yesterday is extremely serious.  It was an attack on Irish farmers and hauliers who were going about their business in a free market where there are no impediments other than the normal regulations and rules, which they followed.  However, they were severely attacked and their merchandise was ruined.  We made the strongest possible protest on that issue and we will continue to do so at whatever level necessary.  The obligation to protect the movement of trade is on the country where such events happen under the rules of the single market.  The Secretary of State for Wales has indicated that responsibility has been accepted and that these difficulties will be dealt with properly.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food has already been in touch with his British counterpart, and, as I have said, they will meet soon to deal with these matters.</P>

      <P>The Information Society Commission, established earlier this year is finalising an interim report.  The commission has been considering legal issues regarding the use of the Internet, with particular emphasis on intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>The law on defamation is a matter for which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility.  His Department also chairs a working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet which while it is focusing primarily on issues such as pornographic material, may also have an input in this area.  It is due to produce its first report in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Minister will introduce legislation in the area as soon as possible which will have regard to the Law Reform Commission's reports on libel and defamation, the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, and the consideration of any relevant advice from the Information Society Commission.  I will consider the Deputy's suggestion when I have had an opportunity to study the Information Society Commission's interim report, which I expect to be submitted to me shortly.</P>

Will he agree it is extraordinary that we should seek to defend intellectual property rights while not seeking to defend the good name and <Col N="57" /> reputation of persons who are entitled to their good name?  Will he ensure, whether it is done by the Information Society Commission under the aegis of his Department or the working group under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, this matter is reviewed and a report is presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the gaps with a view to considering whether the gaps can be addressed to ensure citizens are properly protected?</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree there is a difficulty in enforcing any controls on libel or the dissemination through the Internet of pornography or methods of making bombs for killing people?  The difficulty is that the Internet is stateless and, therefore, there is no jurisdiction governing it.  Will the Taoiseach agree there is a necessity for international action to create some form of jurisdiction to govern the Internet and that it needs to be brought within the framework of the rule of law, the same as all other activities? This is a matter that needs to be tackled, at the very least, at United Nations level through a convention or at some other international forum.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take all the points made on board.  As Deputies are aware there is great difficulty in the control and regulation of the Internet.  Deputy Bruton correctly said it is not something over which we have control in our jurisdiction.  It is an international issue and as he said it is stateless.  Much useful work was attempted in this area by the former Minister for <Col N="58" /> Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Mervyn Taylor. The working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet is continuing that work.  On the issue of defamation, it is practically impossible to check on the instigators both in our and in other jurisdictions.  Even where they believe they have found a source it is almost impossible to do anything about it.  I will consider what is the best forum in which to raise it.  In the meantime it is important for us to focus on the Bill on child pornography, violence against children and other issues.  Those are the primary issues but not the only issues to be dealt with.  That legislation will be available shortly.</P>

      <P>I understand the decision by Irish Ferries, a privately owned company, to discontinue the use of Cork port was taken on purely commercial considerations and as such I have no function in the matter.  The company has announced an improved and upgraded continental cruiseferry service for the 1998 season between Rosslare, Cherbourg and Roscoff.  This service will increase capacity for tourist traffic, vehicles and freight business and I welcome the company's continued commitment to the Continental route.  I understand the service will begin next April and will operate according to a new schedule which allows for consistent departure and arrival times with early morning arrival times in France and Ireland to better facilitate passengers driving onwards to their holiday destinations.</P>
      <P>I have not spoken directly to Irish Ferries about its decision to discontinue the use of Cork port, but my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, replied to Deputies in the House on the Adjournment on 19 November on this matter.</P>
      <P>It is too early to assess what impact, if any, the decision to discontinue the use of Cork port will have on flows of Continental tourists to and within Ireland.

      <Col N="59" /> Ireland is primarily a matter for the regional tourism authorities and the tourism industry, I am concerned about improving regional spread generally, as we all know that recent growth in tourism has not been benefiting all regions to the same extent.</P>
    <P>Last month I announced an extra £5 million for Bord Fáilte by way of Supplementary Estimate this year, which will facilitate tourism promotion and marketing for the coming season.  I have asked Bord Fáilte to design a series of initiatives for the 1998 campaign, targeted not only at maintaining tourism growth but more particularly at addressing regional spread.  Further details of this initiative will be announced after I move the Supplementary Estimate for my Department in the House on 11 December.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the new tender procedure for a national conference centre is being organised by Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent Management Board for Product Development.  The tender procedure <Col N="61" /> was determined after consultation with the relevant directorates in the European Commission and is being conducted in full compliance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contract.</P>
      <P>The full tender procedure notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 September 1997.  The notice was also published in the daily newspapers on 16 September. It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by 5 p.m. on Monday, 20 October.  Bord Fáilte received 12 responses within the deadline set for the receipt of applications.  On 31 October invitation to tender documentation was dispatched by Bord Fáilte to seven qualified applicants, six of whom confirmed their intention to submit full tenders before the deadline set, 14 November.  These six applicants who will be responsible for providing a site for the proposed development have three months to submit their tenders, that is, by the end of January next following which the tenders will be assessed.  The management board has estimated that it will be late March before it has completed its deliberations.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Operational Programme for Tourism the agreement of the Government and the European Commission, on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Union law, will be required in respect of the final selection made.</P>

      <P>It was reported in the newspapers that the EU rules had been broken in this matter. Bord Fáilte stated in reply that invitation to tender documentation was issued on 31 October and that tenderers could seek clarification on the matters covered.  Will the Minister agree that on that occasion Bord Fáilte should have sought to allay the fears of the general public by stating that there were no errors in the documentation issued to applicants thereby ensuring that the dates set for the completion and submission of tenders for this important project will be adhered to?</P>

      <P>I assure everybody concerned that the regulations are not causing problems.  I agree with the Deputy and my predecessor that this is a matter of national importance and hope that we have learned from mistakes made in the past.  I ask those who have encountered problems to come to the Department or Bord Fáilte.  A certain group has written to Bord Fáilte indicating that some of the regulations were not in order but the Commission has not found any case with which to reproach us.  As Deputy Wall correctly said, the invitation to tender document of 30 October provided a mechanism by which tenderers could seek clarification of any matter covered by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the national interest, I request all those interested to stop putting obstacles in the way of this project.  I agree with Deputy Wall that nobody should attempt to sabotage this project which is of major incentive and importance to this <Col N="62" /> country.  Let us go ahead with it and, if any problems are encountered, let them be brought to my attention when I shall endeavour to have them overcome.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the tender procedure was determined after consultation with DG 15 and DG 16, conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts. We have gone to extremes here to ensure that everything is in order and that the relevant European Union Commissioner backs us on the matter.  This country needs a national convention centre and there has been a huge surge in tourists coming here in recent years.  I want to see the continuance of the huge strides made under successive administrations and the provision of a national convention centre is one of the best means of sustaining that momentum in tourism development.</P>

In the national interests I ask people to allow this national convention centre to go ahead which is what I think is the desire of all parties and successive Governments.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the tourist accommodation sector where there is already in place an extensive system for approval in accordance with standards set by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>One of the board's statutory functions is the registration of certain types of tourist accommodation such as hotels, guesthouses, holiday cottages, holiday apartments and holiday hostels. The inspection activities associated with these functions were contracted to a third party, Tourism Quality Services Ltd., arising from the implementation of the recommendations of the review of Bord Fáilte carried out by Consultants Arthur D. Little Ltd., in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the board's system of approval for accommodation in the bed and breakfast sector <Col N="63" /> was also out-sourced, following the Arthur D.

The regional tourism authorities also operate a system of approval for single unit self-catering accommodation to ensure that they are consistent with Bord Fáilte standards.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to those units which have chosen to enter the system.  In a £3 billion industry, employing 100,000 people, with a current complement of 5,000 approved premises with a capacity of 47,000 bedrooms, with 12,000 unapproved premises with a capacity of 40,000 bedrooms, what steps is the Minister taking to safeguard standards and protect our country's image as a quality tourism destination while so many uninspected units operate outside the standards prescribed by him and his Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>This has not been a problem encountered by me only but by consecutive administrations and Ministers.  I emphasise that I am pursuing exactly the same policy pursued to date.  The standards of those unapproved units about which the Deputy speaks have not been causing any major alarm.  As a matter of fact, I have received many more complaints about standards obtaining in five-star accommodation than in those unapproved units.  For example, I have received complaints about cups of coffee which, in some areas, cost more than the ordinary pint, indeed, in some areas of this city about a cup of coffee costing as much £4.  I have also received complaints about £10 being charged for two cups of tea and light biscuits and £8 for a bowl of soup and a roll.  Therefore, it will be clearly seen that such complaints do not arise in those unapproved units.  Nonetheless I must warn those engaged in these areas that I am concerned about excessive prices being charged.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the numbers of unapproved units to which the Deputy referred, while they are indeed of importance, they are not the units at present causing me problems <i>vis-a -vis</i> standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister a question about five-star accommodation but about unregistered units.  Does he agree that they tend to destroy our tourist image and tourism itself? What steps is he taking to ensure they comply with fire and safety and health and hygiene standards generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen is well aware that the standards in regard to fire and safety and health and hygiene apply to all units, as does taxation. Of course, if those unapproved units do not come up to standard, tourists will not return to them, which in itself answers his question.  If they <Col N="64" /> are approved by Bord Fáilte, there is certainly a mechanism available by which tourists or others can complain to my Department but I reiterate that standards have not been the problem encountered in these unapproved units.</P>
      <P>While the overall matter of licensing was mooted in the past, on its introduction how does one police that type of authorisation or operation? How does one go about imposing penalties on those who do not adhere to the relevant regulations or standards?  In the interests of the future of our tourism industry, I shall certainly examine the matters of standards and licensing.  However, the latter probably is something with which it would be impossible to get to grips immediately or in the short-term and undoubtedly cause immense headaches for any of my predecessors who might encounter such problems.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>the views of his Department on the impact of the abolition of the internal duty free industry within the European Union on the Irish tourist industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21686/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Highly profitable duty and tax free sales are currently being used in part by air and sea transport operators to keep charges and fares down.  Abolition of duty free sales could have an adverse impact on tourism through potentially higher charges by airports, airlines and maritime transport companies.  This could be particularly problematic for low fare airlines and ferry companies, slowing down tourism growth to Ireland where more competitive fares have underpinned above average growth in tourist arrivals in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government is availing of every opportunity to raise this issue at political level in appropriate fora and to suggest the need for further study by the European Commission of the implications of the abolition of intra-EU duty free.  Because of the potentially damaging impact of the proposed measure on the development of the tourism industry generally, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood, raised the issue at the EU Tourism Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels on 26 November.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Enterprise have <Col N="65" /> also been active in highlighting the importance of the matter.  Last week the Taoiseach raised the subject at the EU Employment Summit in Luxembourg and he reported to the House on the outcome in some detail on 25 November.  There is a special committee studying the implications for Ireland in his Department and he intends putting down a further marker about Ireland's concerns at the December summit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach outlined in his statement on 25 November the Government's strategy which is to continue to seek to have the matter raised with transport Ministers, ECOFIN, the European Council and the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stressed the importance of this matter.  Does he know when a final decision will be made on the abolition of the internal duty free industry?  Is there a set criteria in relation to that date?  I have had numerous representations from people in the industry and union representatives on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no final date for making the decision.  The Deputy is aware that the date is in 1999 and we are arguing the case at present. The last meeting the Taoiseach attended concerned unemployment.  We want the EU to provide a proper study.  The only study to date has shown that the abolition of duty free would lead to approximately 140,000 job losses throughout the EU.  The last summit meeting dealt with unemployment and there is a case for asking for a study on the impact which the abolition would have on Ireland in light of the projected job losses.  The matter is ongoing and we are continuing to use every opportunity to raise the matter. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, raised the matter recently at the Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels.  The abolition of duty free would have disastrous effects on employment here and in Europe.  If we are serious about unemployment in Europe, it is only proper that we have the study, which was promised, to find out what the ending of duty free would mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as the Minister predicts, the proposed study shows that major damage will result to Irish tourism and associated jobs, is it within the remit of the Government to veto the decision?  What measures can be put in place to protect as far as possible the number of jobs under threat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The abolition of duty free will result in major job losses in all sectors and will increase travel costs for tourists.  Does the Minister agree that the Taoiseach seemed to throw in the towel on this issue at his recent meeting in Europe when he said there was little interest or support among his colleagues for this matter?  Does he also agree that studies alone are insufficient and that what is required is critical action at the highest level?</P>

We are now trying to make sure we can raise the issue at different levels in order to increase interest in this matter.  It has a major impact on us as a country on the periphery of Europe, particularly in tourism where duty free has been responsible in large measure for the low access fares to the country.</P>

It is at present finalising its report which will incorporate recommendations on developing and implementing a sports anti-doping policy.  When the report is completed and submitted to me, which I expect will be shortly, I will begin preparing plans for introducing a drug testing programme in sport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister hold the same opinion he held three months ago, namely, that if he introduces a drug testing programme he will also introduce blood as well as urine testing? What discussions has he had with the federations that will have to amend their constitutions and impose sanctions in the event of any athlete being detected as using drugs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>My initial plan is to introduce the drug testing programme in Ireland.  We have approached most of the national governing bodies with a view to them changing their constitutions, in the event of blood testing being introduced, to include sanctions.  All bodies are in agreement with this.</P>
      <P>I intend to proceed as far as possible with introducing the type of testing referred to by the Deputy and I hope we will be in position to make a further announcement in the new year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister work in co-operation with the Northern Ireland sports council on this matter?  Will he set up laboratories which will need to be accredited by the OCIR?  Will he use the Chelsea laboratories which some of us visited? Does he intend to introduce this system in 1998?</P>

      <P>Regarding testing and working with the Chelsea laboratories, the Deputy must understand that we develop this issue one small step at a time.  Introducing blood testing is difficult.  There are constitutional difficulties but we can introduce testing and with the help of the organisations and the federations we can go some way towards being at the forefront in this area.  It is necessary to start by taking small steps.  I hope to introduce this scheme in 1998.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the tour operators and I understand they have a strict regime. The Deputy highlighted one specific sport but the problem is that the medical profession seems to be held back by regulations which keep doctors one step behind the abusers.  The technology is in place and medical science has progressed to such an extent that we can identify persons who have taken any substance, but the current regulations apply only to certain substances.  Pharmacology is very advanced in this area.  The abusers think they are outsmarting the medical research facilities capable of identifying them, and I am simply <Col N="68" /> trying to ensure that we get one step ahead of the abusers.  That is the objective of drug testing and the various federations will have to realise it is only through blood tests we will be in a position to do that definitively in the future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the attention he gave this matter early on in his term.  As he alluded to it in his reply, will the Minister tease out more definitively the merits of blood testing over urine testing as I understand urine testing is open to miscalculation or is not as foolproof as blood testing?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to introduce a drugs education programme along with a drugs testing programme?  While he works out the legalities and implications of introducing blood testing next year, will he introduce the internationally acceptable urine testing as quickly as possible?  Does he intend to set up a statutory testing authority independent of his Department? Also, because of the legal and medical implications, does the Minister intend to set up an independent appeals board to allow athletes who believe they have been dealt an injustice have the right of appeal to an independent body?  What are the Minister's thoughts on these issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to set up an anti-doping board and we will discuss at a later stage whether that will be on a statutory basis.  Legislation may be required to do that.  With regard to the appeals board, we should set up the other board first and then discuss that.  That issue will be discussed by the relevant committee which was set up under the Deputy's auspices.</P>
      <P>With regard to the drugs education programme, it is hoped that programme will be introduced. There is a question about that on the Order Paper and if it is reached, the Deputy will hear my reply.  Deputy Sargent asked about urine and blood testing.  That is a complicated area of physiology which I could talk about all day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the effects of drugs in urine and in blood, we now have what are known as half life substances which are flushed out of the system very rapidly.  It is easier now to determine the effects these drugs have had.  Testing on-site at major competitions is of little value.  Testing should be carried out in between competitions at training grounds and so on.  That is where the real positive results are obtained.  Many athletes believe they are one step ahead of medical science <Col N="69" /> but I disagree.  We will have to start thinking about testing in between competitions.</P>
    <P>In regard to under age athletes taking drugs, everybody here would be concerned about that but we will have to comply with rules that might be introduced covering the age at which testing can be done.  Many of our young people who use gyms in this city and others around the country are being offered substances of which I am sure their parents are unaware.  I would like to put in place an education programme because prevention is better than cure.  I hope to discuss this matter with all Deputies when we introduce the Bill later in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas was introduced, under the Finance Act, 1995, on 1 July 1995 on a pilot basis for three years.  The purpose of the scheme is to assist in the renewal and updating of tourist amenities and facilities in the areas designated.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental group comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Revenue Commissioners, Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development is currently reviewing the impact of the scheme.  The review will assimilate all key data concerning developments currently taking place in the designated resort areas, including the total number of projects; the total number of projects by type of enterprise; the total capital investment, the total level of tax relief granted; the total number of jobs created; the geographical spread of uptake; and the qualitative aspects.</P>
      <P>When I receive the review findings, I will examine them in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  At this stage, I clearly cannot anticipate those findings.  I had hoped to have them before the end of this year but as the Deputy knows, the scheme will run until the end of next year.  I anticipate we will have the findings before that time.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clarify in more detail the length of time he expects this review to take before completion?  He must be aware that certain towns expect this scheme to be extended. I was glad the last Government initiated the scheme and included the town of Arklow, in my own county.  I know the Minister will accept that it is a good idea to learn from experience, but will <Col N="70" /> he not agree there is now an urgent need to ensure the review is completed?  Does he perceive this review to be completed in the context of him expanding the scheme?  Does the Minister intend to expand the scheme because the current scheme will soon come to an end?  Many people are working on the basis that the scheme will be extended but the Minister has not actually stated that.  Will he state clearly that it is his intention to extend the scheme, even if it is altered or refined as a result of this review, or does he intend to terminate it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer the Deputy's question about extending the scheme until I receive the report.  I am sure she understands that.  Problems have arisen in certain areas of the scheme.  This was an excellent scheme from my point of view because it rejuvenated areas which were neglected.  Like all good policies introduced by various Governments, this scheme tended to be abused.  Problems arose with the scheme in some areas, particularly the environmental area, and in regard to the profile of certain specific areas.  It was unfair to highlight one or two of those and castigate the rest as a result.</P>
      <P>We will have to consider the scheme in a different light and, if it is extended, certain aspects of it will have to be changed.  Many representatives of the local development groups to whom I spoke indicated the scheme would have been much more appropriate had it applied to the introduction of leisure facilities rather than some of the areas it covered. We have up until next year to review the scheme and I anticipate the report will be completed by next February or March.  At that time we will review the scheme in conjunction with the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that some ambitious projects, which have been delayed by An Bord Pleanála and in respect of which there are other planning difficulties, including those involving the Land Registry, will not come to fruition if the scheme is not extended? That is an important point for the Minister to consider in extending the scheme.  Will he agree that a number of the less progressive resorts have not capitalised fully on the scheme to date and it is only now that the scheme is beginning to have an effect?  If the scheme was terminated now, the benefits which have been acknowledged would not impact on those resorts.</P>

    <P>Many Deputies have approached me about the same type of problems concerning projects that are about to commence and have requested that the scheme be extended.  However, that is a matter for the Minister for Finance, but I hope the hatchet will not be brought down immediately on projects which have a reasonable chance of coming <Col N="71" /> to fruition and that the Department of Finance will look favourably on them.

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Department on this good scheme.  Perhaps not all resorts use it to its full potential or exploit it in the wrong way.  Does the Minister consider there is a possibility of extending the scheme to cover more peripheral regions; for instance resorts close to the Border such as Moville and Buncrana?  There is a need for positive discrimination towards those areas.  Is there scope in the scheme to expand it to include towns that have suffered as a result of other difficulties, where tourism is their only future and they have limited tourist facilities even though many people are doing good work to develop those areas?  Will the Minister ensure peripheral regions, including the one I mentioned, are taken into account in a review of this scheme?</P>

      <P>I am fully conscious of the effects of the devastation that has occurred along the Border.  I hope, before my brief in this area concludes the Border area will recognise the benefit it achieved while I held this portfolio.  The decision to extend this scheme is a matter for the Department of Finance.  I would have no difficulty extending it to include numerous other areas and there is an excellent political reason for doing that.  However, that is a decision for the Department of Finance, but the Deputy can rest assured the Border will be well and truly looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the many benefits of the seaside resorts scheme but I regret north County Dublin was overlooked in the initial tranche. In reviving the scheme will the Minister take into account the environmental impact on some of the areas that have benefited from it and the hike in property prices in some areas which has meant that local people have been priced out of their areas, which in the long-term will be more damaging than any initial benefit the scheme may have.  In Lahinch and Youghal the visual impact of the scheme has been a cause of much comment by members of the local community.  When it comes to reviewing the scheme perhaps that should be a lesson on to how things should not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct.  Those are two specific reasons the scheme must be revisited. One concerns the environmental impact of the scheme.  In the areas concerned local development groups have told me that families and others trying to build houses on their own sites have found the price of sites have risen astronomically. Those concerns must form part of the balancing act in reviewing the scheme.  The <Col N="72" /> environmental impact on those towns and the price of sites in them are two detrimental effects of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is extraordinarily surprising that the evaluation of this scheme has not progressed further.  Is the Minister aware that six weeks ago I brought a delegation to the Department of Finance?  To say the least I was not happy with the level of competence in that Department and the manner in which the evaluation of this scheme is being carried out.  Is the Minister aware that as yet only one town has responded to the request for information, which is delaying the evaluation of the scheme?  I expressed my alarm and the alarm implicit in Deputy McManus's question that towns like Bray which were excluded from the scheme will continue to be excluded unless the Department removes its collective digit and proceeds with matters.  Will the Minister ensure the review is speeded up and give an early response on the long-standing request that Bray be included in the scheme?  I remind the Minister that the Minister for Finance when he first advocated this scheme and last year in amendments which he sought to table to the Finance Bill suggested that Bray should be included in the scheme.</P>

      <P>I will try to facilitate the Deputy by speeding up the review of the scheme and obtaining the reports.  As I stated in reply to Deputy McManus's question, I tried to get the reports in before the budget so that a proper discussion could take place on the scheme, but Deputy Roche will understand this is a matter for the Finance Bill.  The Finance Bill will not be published until the new year and this scheme can be discussed before that.  I will encourage those areas that have been requested to furnish information to send it in as soon as possible so that we can have a proper basis on which to evaluate whether to extend this scheme.</P>

      <P>Westport was included in the scheme.  As Deputy Sargent said, there is a major problem concerning the prices of houses and sites in some of the resorts included in the scheme. Will the Minister ensure in the review of the scheme that where major developments are taking place and there is planning permission for the building of 20, 30 or 40 houses, half of those will be made available to young couples living in the area?  In Westport 120 to 140 houses were built and are available for rent, but that is not good for the economic future of the town.  Will the Minister ensure that if a certain number of houses are built in a town included in the scheme some of them will be made available for local people?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 39, 42, 44, 51, 54, 68 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>I understand the decision by Irish Ferries, a privately owned company, to discontinue the use of Cork port was taken on purely commercial considerations and, as such, I have no function in the matter.  The company has, however, announced an improved and upgraded continental cruise ferry service for the 1998 season between Rosslare, Cherbourg and Roscoff.  This service will increase capacity for tourist traffic, vehicles and freight business and I welcome the company's continued commitment to the continental route.  I understand the service will begin next April and will operate according to a new schedule which allows for consistent departure and arrival times with early morning arrival times in France and Ireland to better facilitate passengers driving onwards to their holiday destinations.</P>
      <P>I have not spoken directly to Irish Ferries about its decision to discontinue the use of Cork port, but my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, replied to Deputies in the House on the Adjournment on 19 November in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>It is too early to assess what impact, if any, the decision to discontinue the use of Cork port will have on flows of continental tourists to and within Ireland.  As I have already said, the new vessel being chartered by Irish Ferries will provide for increased capacity for tourist traffic and vehicles and will offer higher standards of on board facilities which should prove attractive to potential visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> While the distribution of visitor flows within Ireland is primarily a matter for the regional tourism authorities and the tourist industry, I am concerned about improving regional spread generally, as we all know that recent growth in tourism has not been benefiting all regions to the same extent.</P>
    <P>Last month I announced an extra £5 million for Bord Fáilte by way of Supplementary Estimate this year, which will facilitate tourism promotion and marketing for the coming season.  I have asked Bord Fáilte to design a series of new initiatives for the 1998 campaign, targeted not only at maintaining tourism growth but more particularly at addressing regional spread.  Further details of this initiative will be announced after I move the Supplementary Estimate for my Department in the House on 11 December.</P>

      <P>I met the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland shortly after taking up office in July 1997. The following grant payments have been made to the Olympic Council of Ireland to help cover expenses relating to projects in 1997: European Youth Olympic Days, £45,000, and Italian Exchange Scheme £9,000.  Both myself and the Sports Council are currently in correspondence with the Olympic Council regarding applications from it for further assistance in respect of various funding requests under active consideration at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from the Minister's reply that an annual allocation has not been made to the Olympic Council this year.  Has he been successful in getting a full statement of accounts from the Olympic Council for this year or a quarterly cash flow statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I made numerous requests to the IOC to try to obtain information to pay the council's grants this year.  I have twice requested the Olympic Council of Ireland to give me a cash flow statement of what it has but I have not received a reply to date.  I was shocked to hear the President of the Olympic Council recently say he was prepared to lay off people because of a cash flow crisis.  I asked the President of the Olympic Council to show me the cash flow accounts but he has refused to bring them to my attention and yet has threatened lay offs, which I find extraordinary.  If the council is not prepared to give me a statement of its current cash flow, I will wonder why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister carry out an investigation into the situation surrounding a fund set up in Atlanta by a group of supporters of Irish athletes which made a payment to the Olympic Council late last year or early in 1997 of well over $100,000?  To my knowledge, athletes have not been paid money from that contribution.  Earlier <Col N="77" /> this year the Olympic Council said it was unable to fund the medical expenses of top athletes because of its cash flow problem despite the fact it received at least $113,000 in Atlanta on top of a previous contribution of $100,000.  Will the Minister carry out an investigation into this which, as he said, is most unsatisfactory?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unaware of any individuals providing funding to the Olympic Council and of the $100,000 to $113,000 in question.  I will continue to ask for cash flow statements from the Olympic Council because I am statutorily bound to do so.  Last year the Comptroller and Auditor General made such a request and said they were satisfactory.  He also made the point that cash flow accounts were needed to formulate what type of grant to give to the council.  I received numerous requests from the President of the Olympic Council asking me to fund events, namely the winter olympics and the world youth student games which are coming up.  I will be unable to do so unless I get cash flow statements from the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Today I have the great privilege of presenting my first budget to Dáil Éireann and the first budget in a series of five of a new Administration.  It has been said that those living through radical change rarely appreciate its reality at the time.  That is the case when it comes to the budget because we still look at it as we used to in the 1970s and 1980s.  In the old model, the Minister for Finance could choose to be Santa Claus or Judge Dredd. He could give a present to everyone in the audience, or he could punish the spenders and give lectures on how everybody had to get a grip. There was high excitement value in the old model and high anticipation with people queuing the day before a budget to fill their petrol tanks or stock up their drinks cabinets.  The old model might have made some sense for a small nation and a small economy.  The new model makes sense for a member state within the EU, and part of a vast and open economy.</P>
      <P>Because we are a member state, part of a vast open economy and committed to the parameters that will take us into the single currency, the surprise element is more or less gone from the budget.  It could also be said that by budget day, a Minister for Finance has no money left to spend in that it has all been spent 50 times over by experts in the newspapers over the previous weeks.</P>
      <P>The budget should not seek higher TAM ratings than it deserves.  A budget used to stick up from the rest of the year the way Mount Everest might stand up in the middle of the Curragh.  Those days are gone.  Instead of creative gimmickry and lucky bag spending to win votes, today's budget is characterised by three things: control of public spending; correction of tax inequities and overdue acknowledgement of the elderly.</P>
      <P>In regard to the control of public spending, I wish to make it clear that I do not believe control of public spending is an end in itself, a virtue of itself.  Ruthless cutting of public expenditure in some areas might benefit the economy in the short-term but it would have a lethal long-term effect on individuals and families on the margins. We will not build an Ireland worth living in by deepening social inequalities nor will we maintain social peace and progress in that way.  The control of public expenditure in this budget, therefore, walks the very thin line between proper rectitude and punitive rigour.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Building on Economic progress</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has in this decade undergone an economic transformation.  I would like to acknowledge the contribution that my predecessors in this office have made in that period.  They were supported by the social partners &mdash; the trade unions, employers and farmers &mdash; as well as the broader community.  Irish society has joined together over that decade to forge and sustain a coherent and consistent strategy for economic and social progress. <Col N="79" /> In that period the numbers at work have increased by over 250,000.  Our public finances are in much better shape.</P>
    <P>There are, however, still many challenges and deficiencies to be faced on the economic and social front and my budget sets out to deal with these.  We have to do three things: first, we must ensure that we create the right conditions to sustain strong economic growth so that more people get jobs; second, we must take steps to ensure that any inflationary pressures are contained; third, we must prepare for the problems we face in the decades ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Partnership 2000 and Progress to Date</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is now almost a year since the conclusion of a new agreement between the social partners &mdash;<i>Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness.</i>  This included a commitment to personal tax reductions of £900 million on a full year basis over three years and an action programme for social inclusion and equality involving additional expenditure of £525 million, again over three years.  Taking account of the 1997 budget and the measures I am proposing today, the overall resource commitment will have been delivered in the first two years of the three year programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Action Programme for the Millenium</i>
    </P>
    <P>This Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, outlines our main fiscal objectives for the next five years. Today's budget addresses these objectives.  I am projecting a significant current budget surplus each year to 2000.  By the year 2000, Exchequer borrowing will have been eliminated.  On a general Government basis, borrowing has already been eliminated.  My current spending targets will be achieved.  Overall resources will permit me to invest more in vital capital needs.  Over the period to the year 2000, Government spending will decline as a proportion of GNP.  This budget delivers the resources promised in Partnership 2000 for tax and social inclusion.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Developments in 1997</i>
    </P>
    <P>Nineteen ninety-seven has been the fourth successive year of very strong economic growth.  This is once again being translated into substantially higher numbers at work, about 50,000 more this year.  At the same time, inflation has remained moderate at around 1.5 per cent.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement is expected to be about £280 million or 0.7 per cent of GNP, compared with the budget target of over £600 million.  The general Government balance is likely to show a surplus of about 0.4 per cent of GDP.  The general Government debt to GDP ratio is likely to fall to 67 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget Strategy</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the separate document, <i>Budget 1998: Economic Background</i>, I have set out in detail the basis for my budgetary strategy and the economic <Col N="80" /> outlook for the next three years.  In preparing my budget I had to take account of a number of strategic issues: provide for capital investment, reduce the tax burden, pursue social inclusion, prepare for Economic and Monetary Union, anticipate changes in European Structural Funds, plan for an ageing population and reduce our national debt.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Debt</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a country we are still deeply in debt.  By the end of this year, it is likely to exceed £30,000 million, about £22,000 for every person at work in the country.  The interest cost alone will be over £2,300 million.  We must free up these resources.  Think of the alternative uses we could make of them: increased investment, improved social services or a reduced tax burden.  We did not thank earlier Administrations for spending their way into our pockets.  Our children would not thank us for spending our way into their pockets.  We must not and will not lose control of our finances just because of our strong economic growth.</P>
    <P>
      <i>1998 Budget Targets</i>
    </P>
    <P>On the basis of the taxation and expenditure measures I am announcing today, the targets for the 1998 budget are: a current budget surplus of £1,109 million; a capital deficit of £1,198 million; an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £89 million; and a general Government surplus of 0.3 per cent of GDP.  I am also projecting general Government surpluses for 1999 and 2000.  The general Government debt ratio will fall from 67 per cent of GDP in 1997 to 58 per cent of GDP in 2000.  From the 1999 budget on, our targets will be set in terms of the EU measure, the general Government balance, rather than the Exchequer borrowing requirement or EBR.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>The public service pay and pensions bill &mdash; £5.6 billion &mdash; is expected to increase by 6 per cent over 1997 on top of an increase of 10.5 per cent in 1997.  This is totally unacceptable.  Two main factors are driving up the pay bill; numbers employed and pay rates.  In future, all proposals to Government for new or expanded services will specifically identify any implications for the pay bill.  The main problem, as far as pay rate increases are concerned, has been cost drift under the local bargaining provisions of the PCW, such as the increases secured by a number of major groups in the health sector.  The nurses' settlement alone is adding 1.5 per cent to the pay bill in 1997.</P>
    <P>We need to finally put the PCW to rest.  It is essential that the remaining PCW local bargaining cases be resolved within the PCW cost norm.  The groups concerned cannot expect to follow the higher settlements secured on the basis of certain unique considerations by nurses and a small number of other groups.  We must ensure that the efficiency and effectiveness commitments made by public servants in return for local bargaining <Col N="81" /> increases under the PCW are fully honoured.</P>
    <P>There must be no repeat under Partnership 2000 of the cost drift under PCW.  The 2 per cent limit on local bargaining in Partnership 2000 must be adhered to strictly.  The Government has decided to introduce new arrangements which will involve giving each Department an annual allocation to cover the cost of all Partnership 2000 increases, including the 2 per cent local negotiations increase.  These allocations will represent the total funding available for all improvements in pay and conditions during the period of the partnership.</P>
    <P>There is no point in having national programmes unless we all honour them.  The last Government negotiated Partnership 2000 and this Government is committed to implementing its terms.  Those who signed up for the pay and industrial peace terms of the agreement must keep their part of the bargain if this Government is to be able to deliver on social inclusion and tax measures while continuing to manage the economy in a balanced and responsible way.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to social inclusion.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Inclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>The continued strong performance of the economy provides the resources for an improvement in the position of the more disadvantaged members of our community.  I am confident that the range of measures I am proposing today in social welfare and other social policy programmes will result in solid progress in these areas.  These measures are designed to deliver on undertakings aimed at combating disadvantage set out in the Government's programme, make further progress towards meeting the commitments on social inclusion in Partnership 2000, contribute towards the achievement of the strategic aims of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and continue the reorientation of the social welfare code in a work-friendly direction.  A special emphasis is being put on helping older people.</P>
    <P>The Government undertook to spend £525 million on social inclusion measures over the three years of Partnership 2000.  Last year, £273 million was committed for this purpose.  This budget commits a further £282 million in a full year, so that resources which had been promised over three years will now be more than provided over two.  This is a concrete expression of this Government's desire to see that economic progress is accompanied by real social advance for those in need and of our commitment to the social partnership process.  The social welfare improvements which I will announce will cost £125 million in 1998 and £225 million in a full year.  In addition, I will be announcing other social inclusion measures which will cost £39 million in 1998 and £57 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Weekly Welfare Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>From the first week of June next, I am providing for a real increase in the weekly payment <Col N="82" /> rates for all welfare categories.  In general, personal rates will be increased by £3 per week, while qualified adult allowances will rise by 3 per cent.  These increases are well above the expected rate of inflation.  Moreover, the new rates will be payable for 31 weeks in 1998 compared with 29 weeks in recent years.  It is my firm intention that, over the term of office of this Government, the implementation date for budget welfare increases will be brought forward to early April to coincide with the new tax year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Elderly</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our older citizens have persevered through the bad years, and have done so much to create the boom time in which we live.  Not only have they worked in times that were more difficult than the present, they now face old age in a radically changed Ireland, an Ireland busier and less supportive in some ways than the Ireland of earlier days.  Older people should be able to face the years after they retire with confidence.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's determination to ensure the older members of our society are well provided for, I am pleased to announce that the full personal rate of all old age and related pensions will be increased by £5 per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This will give increases ranging from 6 per cent to almost 7.5 per cent, or at least three times the expected rate of inflation.  The weekly pension for a typical elderly contributory couple will rise to almost £140.</P>
      <P>I am also raising substantially the tax exemption thresholds which I will refer to under my taxation proposals.  This is in line with our election commitments to the elderly and is an unashamed and deliberate targeting of resources.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Commission on Social Welfare Rates</i>
      </P>
      <P>As a result of these measures, the rates for all but two categories will be brought above the minimum rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and the two exceptions will be brought to within 2 per cent of this level.  This will increase the living standards of all those dependent on welfare support.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Child Benefit</i>
      </P>
      <P>From September next, child benefit rates are being increased by £1.50 per month for the first and second children and by £3 per month for third and subsequent children.  A mother with four children will then receive monthly payments of £147 or almost £34 per week.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Child Benefit &mdash; Twins</i>
      </P>
      <P>I have also decided that, from September next, child benefit for twins will be paid at 150 per cent of the usual rate.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement has long been recognised as an important income support for families in low paid work by ensuring <Col N="83" /> there will be a reward for working as compared with being unemployed.  A commitment was given in Partnership 2000 to calculate entitlement to the supplement on a net rather than gross income basis.  The first move in that direction was made earlier this year by excluding PRSI contributions and health and employment levies from the calculation.</P>
      <P>On this occasion, I am completing this process by removing income tax from the basis of assessment with effect from October next.  Moreover, current family income thresholds are being increased by £7 per week from June.  As a result, the average weekly payment for existing FIS claimants will rise by £11, to £50.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance scheme has been very successful in reintegrating large numbers of the long-term unemployed into employment.  I have decided to increase the number of places on this scheme by a further 5,000 to 27,000 in 1998.  The area based allowance is also being extended to the entire country.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Other Improvements</i>
      </P>
      <P>As well as the initiatives which I have just announced, I am targeting certain other areas within the social welfare code.  I am allocating an additional £1.2 million in 1998 for marriage and child counselling and the family mediation service. I am extending eligibility for the companion travel pass to benefit people over 75 years who are unable to travel alone.  I am also providing a free travel pass to all recipients of carer's allowance. Finally, additional grants are being made towards voluntary and community services.  A list of these grants is included in the <i>Summary of 1998 Budget Measures.</i>  My colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, will announce full details of these various measures.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Social Welfare Abuse</i>
      </P>
      <P>While the Government has amply demonstrated its readiness to provide support and assistance where it is most required, it is equally determined that spending should only go where it is genuinely needed.  The results of a special live register survey published last year gave rise to serious concern regarding the possible extent of fraud in the unemployment payments system.  Let me make it clear that we will clamp down on social welfare abuses with renewed vigour.  In this way, we can free up greater resources to invest in the genuine social needs at the heart of Partnership 2000<i>.</i></P>

      <P>An additional £36.8 million is being allocated for the development of health services in 1998.  This, with other technical changes, brings the gross Estimate for the Health and Children Vote to £3.1 billion next year &mdash; representing about one fifth of all supply spending. This is £1 billion higher than the 1993 spending figures of £2.1 billion.  The 1998 provision is 11 per cent higher than the 1997 figure of £2.8 billion.</P>
      <P>I might at this stage mention that £16 million of these new initiatives relate to social inclusion measures, including an extra £7 million for the mentally handicapped; a further £2 million for the elderly; and £1.5 million for psychiatric services both for the elderly and for young people.</P>
      <P>Despite a considerable expansion of our child protection services since 1993, under which additional annual expenditure is £45 million, health boards remain under pressure.  The budget for child care services in the Health and Children Vote in 1998 will be £8 million higher than in 1997, including £2 million for new developments which I am providing today.  In addition, a further £2.2 million is being provided to expand family and community development services on the Social, Community and Family Affairs Vote.  This allocation will support the Government's child care programme.</P>
      <P>
        <i>People with Disabilities</i>
      </P>
      <P>Today is <i>European Day for People with Disabilities.</i> I want to underline our commitment to the development of services for people with disabilities. This Government is the first to appoint a Minister of State with special responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Mary Wallace.  The Government decided recently to establish the National Disability Authority of Ireland as recommended by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  Today I am glad to be able to allocate, as part of the social inclusion package, a further £3 million for people with physical or sensory disabilities.  Further details are set out in the <i>Summary of 1998 Budget Measures.</i></P>
      <P>
        <i>Community Employment</i>
      </P>
      <P>Community Employment is currently being reviewed in the light of recent labour market developments.  Pending the outcome, I have accepted a recommendation of the social partners and agreed, as an interim measure, to make funding available for an additional 1,000 places on the part-time jobs option and 1,000 places on the jobs initiative.</P>

    <P>Furthermore, in line with the improved social welfare payments, the allowances payable under <Col N="85" /> community employment will also be increased at a cost of £6 million in 1998, and £10 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Social Inclusion Measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have set out in the <i>Summary of 1998 Budget Measures</i> a number of other improvements.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OTHER EXPENDITURE MEASURES</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Millennium</i>
    </P>
    <P>The new millennium will be celebrated in a variety of ways in this country and across the world. There are a number of interesting proposals being developed to mark the millennium &mdash; for example, the rejuvenation of O'Connell Street, the premier thoroughfare of our capital city.  I will consider the possibility of some future contribution to funding suitable projects.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sport and Tourism</i>
    </P>
    <P>Gaelic games are an integral part of our culture. The GAA is the premier sporting organisation in Ireland and for over one hundred years has been a powerful positive force in fostering our gaelic games.  The association has indicated that it intends to press ahead with plans for completing the remaining phases of the Croke Park redevelopment project.  The recently completed first phase of the project has been widely admired and there is little doubt that the overall project, when completed, will provide this country with a state of the art sports stadium for the new millennium which will stand comparison with facilities available anywhere else in the world.  Accordingly, the Government has decided to support the project by allocating £20 million over a three year period from the surplus revenues of the national lottery.  A total of £7 million will be provided in each of the years 1998 and 1999 and the balance in the year 2000.</P>
    <P>A further £3 million will be provided for recreational and major sporting facilities, £1.75 million for sports organisations and £3.5 million for tourism marketing initiatives.  The details are set out in the Summary of 1998 Budget Measures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our agricultural and food industry remains central to the well-being of the economy.  Government policy will aim to maximise the contribution which the industry makes to economic growth, exports and the balance of payments, and employment.  However, we must plan for this in a policy environment of improved competitiveness and a readiness to embrace structural change under the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Government will work closely with agricultural and rural communities in adapting to this changing environment.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I am making some additional allocations for agriculture in 1998 including £23 million in funding for headage payments and £3.5 million to discharge outstanding applications for installation aid for young farmers. The details are set out in the budget summary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" />
      <i>Total cost of current and capital expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The expenditure measures I have announced today total £214 million, of which £194 million is current and £20 million capital.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will maintain and strengthen the social consensus which has brought Ireland major benefits.  In addition, the extra capital spending provided for in the 1998 Estimates will make a significant contribution to improving Ireland's economic prospects.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Controlling Current Spending</i>
    </P>
    <P>When account is taken of the spending measures I have announced today, the percentage increase in net current spending including Central Fund is 3.7 per cent for 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <P>The projected average annual increase in net current expenditure over the three years 1998 to 2000, on a &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; basis, is 3.8 per cent, just within the 4 per cent limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The task of achieving the Government target of containing the growth in current expenditure will be a challenging one.  For example, while the projected annual average increase remains within the Government target, the current spending increase in 1999 over 1998 is projected, on the &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; basis, to be 4.8 per cent.  Accordingly, ensuring that the Government's objectives are met will require continued firm discipline in the control of current spending and, if necessary, corrective action over the lifetime of the Government.</P>
      <P Just="Center">TAXATION.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Income Tax</i>
      </P>
      <P>I now turn to my income tax proposals.  The Action Programme for the Millennium makes clear the Government's commitment to reduce the burden of personal taxation in order to reward effort and to improve incentives to work.</P>
      <P>The programme sets out specific targets and commitments for tax reductions and reliefs over the period of the Government.  It is not possible to do everything in one budget but it is important today to make progress towards the goals we have set ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> I am concerned that this budget should ease pressures in the labour market.  Reduced taxes will increase take-home pay and make it more attractive to work.  This will help keep the pressures on pay costs and inflation under control.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am allocating £517 million in full year costs to the main personal tax reductions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Evasion</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government has already made clear its view that tax evasion in any form is totally unacceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Pursuit of evasion is a demanding and ongoing activity.  The Revenue Commissioners have been active in recent years in streamlining their operations to facilitate this effort.  A large number of staff have been placed on audit and investigation work.  This activity brought in some £133 million in tax receipts in 1996.  I know from personal observation, and I am sure the House knows, that Revenue has transformed its whole approach to tax administration in the past decade.  This has played a significant part in the increased tax revenues we are now experiencing.</P>
      <P>As part of its anti-evasion activity, Revenue has designed and put in place arrangements to secure a more effective prosecution policy for cases of serious evasion.  A number of cases have already been reported to the DPP and court proceedings have been initiated.</P>
      <P>Following the report of the McCracken tribunal I initiated a review by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners of Revenue's powers for combating evasion.  The Moriarty tribunal, in accordance with its terms of reference, will also be looking at certain aspects of this matter.</P>
      <P>If additional powers are required and these are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective, I will bring forward the necessary legislation for consideration by the House.</P>

      <P>I am also taking action in the budget to reduce the availability of certain tax shelters used in particular by high income earners. Tax incentives have an important role to play in promoting investment in certain sectors. However, this has to be counterbalanced by the need to achieve a more equitable sharing of the tax burden.</P>

    <P>I will now turn to the main tax package.  I am happy to announce that the standard rate of income tax and the higher rate will be reduced by two percentage points in both cases from 6 April next.  The new rates will be 24 per cent and 46 per <Col N="88" /> cent respectively.  It is the Government's aim to reduce these rates further as resources allow and to achieve a 20 per cent standard rate of income tax over the next few budgets.</P>
    <P>The alternative route to achieving a 20 per cent rate would be to introduce a new but limited income tax band at 20 per cent and to widen it in successive budgets.  I have decided that the better course is to cut the standard rate of tax until 20 per cent is achieved.</P>
    <P>The basic personal allowance is being increased from 6 April 1998 by £250 to £3,150 per annum for single persons and by £500 to £6,300 per annum for married couples.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same as was introduced last year when the rates were not cut.</P>
      <P>An increase of £250 per annum will also apply to widowed, single parent and widowed parent allowances.</P>
      <P>In addition, in the case of widows with children, the special allowance in the first year after bereavement is being increased from £1,500 to £5,000, and this will be tapered out over five years instead of three years as at present.  This will provide substantial relief to widowed families at a time when financial pressures can be at their greatest.</P>
      <P>I am also increasing the blind person's allowance to £1,000 per annum and to £2,000 per annum for married couples where both spouses are blind.</P>
      <P>The incapacitated child allowance is being increased from £700 to £800 per annum.  The maximum allowance for the care of an incapacitated taxpayer or spouse will increase from £7,500 to £8,500 per annum &mdash; all of these changes with effect from 6 April next.</P>
      <P>I also propose to increase the PRSI weekly allowance of £80 per week in the case of full rate PRSI contributors to £100 per week.  The PRSI ceiling applicable to all employees and the selfemployed will increase from £23,200 to £24,200, as already provided for in the expenditure Estimates.</P>
      <P>The standard rate income tax band is being widened by £100 for single persons to £10,000 and by £200 for married couples to £20,000 per annum.  The general income tax exemption limits for those under 65 are being increased by £100 to £4,100 per annum for single and widowed persons and by £200 to £8,200 per annum for those who are married.  The Government is also committed to easing the tax burden on the aged and for that reason the income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 to 74 are being increased by £400 to £5,000 per annum for single and widowed persons and by £800 to £10,000 per annum for married couples.  For those aged 75 and over the exemption limits are being increased by £300 to £5,500 per annum for single and widowed persons and by £600 to £11,000 per annum for married couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> It is my intention ultimately over a number of budgets to have a single exemption limit for all those aged 65 and over.  The substantial increases in the age exemption limits for those aged 65 to 74 are significant steps in that direction.  The measures I have announced will take over 15,000 persons out of the income tax net who would otherwise have been liable for tax.</P>
    <P>In line with the reduction in the standard rate of income tax, the withholding tax on professional services and the standard rate of DIRT tax will also be reduced from 26 per cent to 24 per cent.</P>
    <P>The thresholds for the payment of the employment and training levy and the health contribution are being raised by £500 to £10,750 per annum, or from £197 to £207 per week.  These income tax and PRSI changes will cost £517 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Credits-Standard Rating</i>
    </P>
    <P>A number of proposals have been made in pre-budget submissions to standard rate some or all income tax allowances and reliefs and to convert these into tax credits at the standard rate.  A special group set up under Partnership 2000 has been examining the issue and is preparing a report for the social partners.</P>
    <P>While the completion of this report is awaited, the Government is open to considering such a move provided that all the complex issues involved can be fully teased out and the system can be introduced into the tax code in a manageable way.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Childcare</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is not possible to introduce all the new measures one would wish in a single budget.  I examined carefully the possibility of a tax relief on childcare at the standard rate of tax but decided not to proceed with it this year.</P>

        <i>Initiatives to help the Long-Term Unemployed</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>To assist the long-term unemployed back to work, I am introducing a two part initiative.  The first part is a special tax allowance in the first year of employment of £3,000 plus £1,000 for each child for persons unemployed for one year or more who take up a job.  The allowance will be tapered down over a three year period.</P>
      <P>The second part of the initiative is a double tax deduction for wages for employers who employ the long-term unemployed person.  This double deduction can last for a period of up to three years provided the former long-term unemployed person is still employed by them.  Participants will retain their secondary benefits.  This allowance will be an alternative to other existing back-to-work incentives.</P>
      <P>The initiatives will be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill and will operate from 6 April 1998.  It is difficult to know how many long-term unemployed people will benefit from these initiatives but I am making a tentative provision for a cost of £1 million in 1998 and £5 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Systematic Short-time Workers and Unemployment Benefit Taxation</i>
      </P>
      <P>I am extending for a further year the special tax relief on unemployment benefit payments to systematic short-time workers introduced in the 1994 Finance Act.  There are about 4,000 employees affected by this relief which has been rolled forward each year since 1994.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Business Expansion Scheme</i>
      </P>
      <P>I have decided that from today the aggregate amount that can be raised by a company under the BES will be reduced from £1 million to £250,000.  This reduction will achieve a better targeting of the BES relief on smaller companies which find it difficult to raise equity finance from other sources.  Transitional provisions will be put in place to cater for BES projects in the pipeline which are well advanced prior to today.</P>
      <P>The estimated savings from the refocusing of this scheme are about £20 million in a full year. However, taking into account the proposed transitional arrangements, it is estimated that savings in 1998 will be of the order of £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" />
      <i>Capital Allowances for Buildings (including Hotels)</i>
    </P>
    <P>The availability of enhanced capital allowances for certain buildings is an important tax relief to stimulate investment.  However, their availability to passive investors is also a prime factor in certain high income earners being able to reduce their income tax liability by substantial amounts. This effect has become clear in certain cases following a recent review by the Revenue Commissioners of the amount of income tax paid by high income earners.  I called on previous occasions in Opposition for measures to ensure that all taxpayers liable to income tax pay an adequate effective rate of tax on their earnings. This is what fair taxation means.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, proposing that on and from today there will be an annual cap of £25,000 on the amount of capital allowances on buildings that an individual taxpayer can claim against nonrental income.  This cap will apply to the amount of capital allowances not availed of by the taxpayer as an offset against rental income.  The buildings in question are all those on which capital allowances can be claimed including buildings in tax designated areas.  This change will not affect owner-occupiers who carry on a business in the building nor will it affect such investment by companies.</P>
    <P>In the case of hotels, I propose that &mdash; except for the special scheme I will mention later &mdash; the capital allowances will be ring-fenced to rental income in the case of individual investors in hotel projects other than where the individual is the person actively carrying on the hotel business.</P>
    <P>There will be a special scheme for investment in certain hotels in particular parts of the country where the unrestricted availability of capital allowances to individual investors will continue. The areas I have in mind are counties where there are insufficient hotels of 3 Star or higher standard and where an investment in upgrading such facilities will help spread some of the tourist traffic to those parts of the country which up to now may not have shared fully in the overall increase in tourist numbers.</P>
    <P>The counties I propose are the seven contiguous counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo, excluding the designated seaside resorts in those counties.  This special scheme will need to be discussed with the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>These changes will have effect on and from today, but transitional provisions will apply for projects already in the pipeline.  I am also introducing anti-avoidance measures to ensure that the new restrictions cannot be by-passed by groups of essentially passive investors setting themselves up as &ldquo;trading&rdquo; partnerships.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Nursing Homes</i>
    </P>
    <P>In order to encourage the provision of extra nursing home places, I am proposing that nursing home buildings registered with the health boards <Col N="92" /> will qualify for capital allowances at 100 per cent over seven years subject to the restrictions mentioned for individual investors.</P>
    <P>Details of the new capital allowance regime are set out in the Summary of 1998 Budget Measures. It is estimated that these new capital allowance measures could save up to £20 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The House is aware of the particular importance that is attached to corporation tax and its role in promoting the expansion of business and employment in the State.  The previous Government announced last May that a single low rate of corporation tax of 12.5 per cent on trading income would be introduced from 2006 in the case of non-manufacturing companies and from 2011 in the case of manufacturing.  A rate of 25 per cent would apply to non-trading income.  The European Commission was notified accordingly and since then there have been extensive discussions with the Commission on this notification.</P>
    <P>Arising from an examination of the issues by the Government, it has been decided to confirm that the rates of 12.5 per cent and 25 per cent will apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>To achieve these target rates, substantial progress must be made in reducing the standard rate of corporation tax in each budget over the coming years.  Accordingly, it has been decided to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax from 36 per cent to 32 per cent and to reduce the rate on the first £50,000 of profits from 28 per cent to 25 per cent from 1 January 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to set a timetable for the further reductions needed to reach the 12.5 per cent rate when the current discussions with the Commission have concluded.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the code of conduct on business taxation which was agreed by the EU member states last Monday in Brussels.  This code is designed to curb harmful tax measures.  It is not aimed at harmonising corporation tax rates in the Community and will not affect the single low rate of corporation tax.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tax Credits on Dividends</i>
      </P>
      <P>Given that the standard rate of corporation tax has been reduced substantially in the past few years and will be further reduced in future years, it has been decided that the tax credit attaching to dividends paid by companies will be abolished over a period of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the ordinary course this credit would reduce as the standard rate of corporation tax is cut but I have decided to accelerate the process.  The tax credit rate which will apply from today in the case <Col N="93" /> of dividends paid out of profits taxed at the standard rate will be reduced from approximately one quarter to just under one eighth of the dividend. The rate of advance corporation tax which is equivalent to this credit is being reduced in tandem. My intention is to abolish tax credits and advance corporation tax in respect of all dividends paid after 5 April 1999.  The tax treatment of shares taken instead of a cash dividend is also being changed, as outlined in the Summary of 1998 Budget Measures<i>.</i> These changes will yield £24 million in 1998 and £60 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Life Assurers</i>
    </P>
    <P>In line with the reduction in the standard rate of income tax, the tax rate applying to life assurance companies in respect of their policyholders' investments will be reduced from 26 per cent to 24 per cent from 6 April next.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PRSI</i>
    </P>
    <P>It has been decided to increase the threshold below which the lower rate of employer PRSI applies from £260 per week to £270 per week. The overall ceiling on employer PRSI will rise from £27,900 to £29,000 per annum as already provided for in the expenditure estimates.  We have many attractions for domestic and foreign business to operate here &mdash; the skills of our workers, the &ldquo;can do&rdquo; business environment, our membership of the EU, language skills and a determination to succeed.  We also need to maintain the tax environment for business to complement these other advantages.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of the changes I am making today will help to increase jobs, investment and tax revenue so that we can continue to reduce the tax burden and tax rates on the PAYE sector and on earned income generally.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Savings Accounts</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am proposing to increase the 15 per cent rate of tax which applies to special savings accounts to 20 per cent with effect from 6 April 1998.  As I said, we are aiming for a 20 per cent standard rate of income tax and it makes sense to move the rate of DIRT on special savings accounts to this rate now.  This also helps to correct the imbalance between the tax treatment of deposit interest and other income.  The new rate still provides a competitive after-tax return to Irish depositors on their investments.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Charities</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the clear wishes of the House for a tax measure in recognition of the major contribution <Col N="94" /> the domestic charities make to Irish life, I will be introducing a new tax relief on donations to domestic charities along the lines proposed by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The new relief will be in respect of donations made by companies on an arm's length basis to eligible charities.  The relief will apply to donations of between £250 and £10,000 to any one charity in any one year, subject to an overall limit of £50,000, or 10 per cent of a donor's taxable income, whichever is the lesser amount.  Full details of this new relief will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tax Relief for Disadvantaged Schools</i>
      </P>
      <P>Disadvantaged schools are generally situated in economically deprived areas and experience great difficulties in fundraising.  I am proposing a new tax relief on personal and corporate donations made to disadvantaged schools which could be used, for example, to provide for computers, additional equipment or book rental schemes. Details of the relief, which will operate from 6 April next, will be incorporated in the Finance Bill.  These two new reliefs are estimated to cost just more than £1 million in 1998 and about £4 million in a full year and will take effect after the passing of the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Car Value Threshold</i>
      </P>
      <P>The car value threshold used for calculating capital allowances in respect of new cars and allowable expenses for all cars used for business purposes will be increased from £15,000 to £15,500 from today.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Capital Gains Tax</i>
      </P>
      <P>For a considerable period of time I have been of the strong view that a reduction in capital gains tax will release pent-up investment funds and create an incentive for the acquisition of further capital assets.  This will encourage investment and growth in the future.  I have decided, therefore, to reduce the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent except for disposals of development land which will remain taxed at 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>I also propose to reduce the current annual allowance of £1,000 single and £2,000 married for capital gains tax to an individual allowance of £500 per annum.  The new rate of 20 per cent also means the abolition of the current 26 per cent rate of capital gains tax on disposals of shares in certain small and medium-sized unquoted companies.  The reduction in CGT will take effect from today while the reduced allowance will apply from 6 April next.  As a prudent accountant, I am allowing for a net cost of <Col N="95" /> £5 million in the first year and £19 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Farmer Taxation</i>
      </P>
      <P>I am proposing a number of improvements in existing reliefs to assist the farming sector.  The expenditure limit for the special capital allowance for farm pollution control is being increased from £20,000 to £30,000 with effect from the next income tax year starting on 6 April 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The current 100 per cent stock relief for young qualifying farmers will apply for four years instead of two years.  This change will take effect from the start of the current income tax year.  I am also making a change in capital gains tax retirement relief to benefit farmers who lease their land under the early retirement scheme.  This measure will come into effect on 6 April next.</P>
      <P>In the area of VAT, I propose to increase the flat rate of VAT which may be charged by unregistered farmers on their sales to registered traders from the current 3.3 per cent to 3.6 per cent from 1 March 1998.  The farmer flat rate VAT is designed to recoup to farmers the cost of VAT borne on their inputs and the increase will cost the Exchequer just more than £5 million in 1998 and £8 million in a full year.  The associated VAT rate for livestock will also increase to 3.6 per cent from the same date.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Capital Acquisitions Tax</i>
      </P>
      <P>For some time I have been concerned about the position of elderly brothers and sisters who share the family home and who, when one of them dies, may face a very large inheritance tax charge on part or all of the family home.  This has become a more acute problem with the recent upsurge in house prices.  For that reason I have decided to increase the current relief from inheritance tax in such situations from 60 per cent of the value of the family home or £80,000 to 80 per cent of the value or £150,000, whichever is the lesser.</P>
      <P>Similar problems can also apply in the case of other close relatives sharing a family home.  I have, therefore, decided to create a new relief for situations where the recipient of the family home is a close relative of the deceased owner, that is, nephew, niece or grandchild, and both have been living in the house for at least ten years prior to the inheritance.  This new relief will have broadly the same terms as the improved elderly siblings relief.  Details of these new and extended reliefs are set out in the Summary of 1998 Budget Measures.  These two changes will take effect in the case of inheritances taken on or after today.</P>

        <i>Future Pension Provision</i>

    <P>As Deputies may be aware, a major study is being carried out by the Pensions Board into the whole pensions area.  It is expected that the board <Col N="96" /> will shortly present a report to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  I am conscious of the various anomalies and discrepancies that exist within the existing tax rules for pension provision, particularly those relating to retirement annuities.  I intend, therefore, to examine these rules after the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has considered this forthcoming report.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Designated Seaside Resorts and Car Parks</i>
    </P>
    <P>In response to requests from the areas affected, I will extend the termination date for the scheme of tax reliefs for the 15 designated seaside resorts from 30 June 1998 to 30 June 1999.  This extension will apply only for projects in respect of which a local authority can certify that at least 15 per cent of the total cost of the project had been incurred by 30 June 1998.  A review is being carried out into the operation and effects of the designated seaside resorts scheme and no decision will be taken about any further extension of the scheme until after this review is completed.</P>
    <P>A similar extension of the termination date from 30 June 1998 to 30 June 1999 will also apply, subject to the same conditions, in the case of the tax relief for multi-storey carparks which was introduced in 1995.</P>

    <P>The taxation of motor vehicles is an important <Col N="97" /> source of revenue which helps to fund vital public services and enables the Government to keep down taxes in other areas.  Nonetheless because of the termination of the scrappage scheme on 31 December next, it is reasonable to cushion the impact of this somewhat by a small reduction in vehicle registration tax.  I expect these reductions to be reflected fully in dealer prices.  I have decided to reduce the rate of VRT on cars from 23.2 per cent at present to 22.5 per cent on vehicles up to 2,500 c.c. and from 29.25 per cent to 28 per cent on vehicles over that threshold, with effect from 1 January 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to increase the VAT inclusive excise duty on cigarettes from midnight tonight by 10 pence per packet of 20, with pro rata increases in other tobacco products.  Also from midnight tonight, the VAT inclusive excise duty on leaded petrol and on super unleaded petrol will be increased by 4 pence per litre.</P>

      <P>The net effect of these changes will be to raise £27 million in additional revenue in 1998 and to add 0.2 per cent to the Consumer Price Index.  I decided not to increase excise duty on drink.</P>
      <P Just="Center">MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET PROJECTIONS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking account of the measures I have announced today, the general Government surplus is projected to be 0.3 per cent of GDP in 1998, increasing to 0.6 per cent in 1999 and 1.3 per cent in 2000.  However, in keeping with the practice introduced by my predecessor, I am including a contingency provision against all budgetary uncertainties of £180 million in 1999 and £450 million in 2000.  This is a reserve against unforeseen factors which could impact adversely on the budget over the next three years.  On this basis, the general Government surplus is projected at 0.3 per cent of GDP in 1999 and 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2000.  As long as current favourable economic conditions apply, my objective will be to achieve a general Government surplus in each of the next three years.  In the event of less favourable conditions, the necessary action will <Col N="98" /> be taken to ensure the budgetary requirements of the stability and growth pact are honoured.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FUTURE BUDGETARY PROCESS.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Multi-annual Budgeting &mdash; further progress</i>
    </P>
    <P>I will continue and develop the multi-annual presentation of the budget which was begun by my predecessor.  I will publish projections showing expenditure by individual ministerial vote group for 1999 and 2000 on a &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; basis.  The final phase of the move to multi-annual budgeting, as envisaged in Delivering Better Government, would involve the Government making decisions for resource allocation over a three year period covering the main budgetary aggregates of taxation, expenditure and borrowing. This will be a major undertaking.  I will consider the implementation of this in the 1999 budget preparations next year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Improving Public Finance Statements</i>
    </P>
    <P>Many of the statements produced on the public finances are too complex.  They are fully understood by only a few experts.  I want them to be presented in a way which will be more readily understood by the man or woman in the street.</P>
    <P>I will, therefore, appoint a small expert group to bring forward proposals to me on this before the next budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Timing of 1999 Budget</i>
    </P>
    <P>This is the first time the budget has been introduced before the beginning of the year to which it relates.  It brings us into line with the practice in most of our EU partners.  It gives certainty to Government Departments and State agencies on expenditure allocations from an earlier date.  I intend to continue this practice.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION.</P>
    <P>I have today delivered a budget which runs a significant current budget surplus each year to the year 2000, eliminates Exchequer borrowing over the next three years, projects a general Government surplus for the years ahead and reduces the debt burden.  It sets the public finances on a path which will lead our economy to continued solid growth and increased prosperity for all our citizens both now and in the future.</P>
    <P>It is a responsible yet caring budget.  It rewards effort, delivers major tax reform, promotes social inclusion, provides for our key investment needs and prepares us for the major challenges that lie ahead.</P>

      <P>One view of the Irish economy is that a river runs through it.  In the 1950s, the water level in that river was low and the flow was <Col N="99" /> sluggish.  In the 1990s, the river is in flood, the flow could not be faster and the rising tide is lifting all boats.</P>

      <P>That view of the economy is dangerous because it suggests that the economic conditions within which we operate are random, whimsical and outside of our control or influence.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> This Government will not relinquish its responsibilities, nor will it buy into the optimistic but simplistic model of a rising river lifting all boats.  A responsible Government sees the economy as having more in common with a canal than a river&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <i>Notes on Multi-annual Budgetary Projections</i>
    </P>
    <P>The projections for 1999 and 2000 reflect:</P>
    <P>1. (a) the full year impact of the measures announced in the 1998 Budget</P>
    <P>(b) the cost of maintaining existing levels of service in all other areas</P>
    <P>(c) a continuation of current interest and exchange rates.</P>
    <P>2. As indicated in the Budget Statement, the overall Partnership 2000 resource commitment in relation to taxation have been delivered in the 1997 and 1998 Budgets. In order to provide a more realistic view of the emerging 1999 and 2000 position a prudent provision has been made (a) under the taxation heading for further possible changes in both 1999 and 2000 in personal taxes costing £250 million in a full year and (b) under the expenditure heading for further possible expenditure costs in both 1999 and 2000 of £120 million in a full year over and above the costs of maintaining the existing level of services.</P>
    <P>2. A prudent contingency provision, see line 8 above, is made against factors outside the control of Government that may impact on the Budget but which cannot be foreseen at this stage. Examples are variability in tax buoyancy and exceptional costs arising in areas of public expenditure. While such variations are likely to be both positive and negative, it has been considered appropriate to allow in the projections for a modest negative net impact on the General Government Deficit (GGD) and EBR. It also makes provision for changes arising from proposals in the Action Programme for the Millennium relating to local government (these will also involve a switch between the Exchequer current and capital funding of local authorities; for the purpose of the table presented here, the expenditure totals are based on the existing arrangements).</P>
    <P>4. The calculation of the GGD ratio for 1999 and 2000 reflects new measurements of debt service and GDP in 1999 for Maastricht definition purposes. These changes have the effect of adding 0.4% to the GGD calculation in 1999 and 2000.</P>
    <P>5. The current and capital expenditure figures shown in each of the years 1997-99 take account of the EU Structural and Cohesion Fund support as provided under the Operational Programmes in the existing Community Support Framework (CSF) 1994-99. For the year 2000 the projections have been prepared on the basis of a technical assumption that, in the case of EU supported programmes, expenditure will remain at the level under the current CSF.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The applause from the Government benches reminds me of a scene from a Victorian novel where distant and impoverished relatives are informed they are the beneficiaries of a huge inheritance and applaud the solicitor who reads the will.  However, Government backbenchers should remember that the novel usually continues with the dissolute and spendthrift relatives scattering their inheritance to the four winds in as short a time as possible through foolhardy and imprudent action.  It is not the Government backbenchers who are the inheritors of the best economic circumstances since Michael Collins was Minister for Finance.  It is the Government which has the responsibility for conferring the benefits of a booming economy on the people, of managing the economy so that the very strong growth continues and of removing foreseeable bottlenecks which could bring that growth to a grinding halt.</P>
      <P>The economy was booming when the rainbow Government left office at the end of June.  Tax buoyancy was at an all time high, unprecedented numbers of people were getting jobs, emigrants were returning home and interest rates were very low.  Not only was every economic indicator positive, they were positive to an unprecedented degree.</P>
      <P>Until the publication of the Book and Estimates and today's budget, the new Government had made no economic decision of any consequence since it came to power.  The favourable position in which the Minister for Finance finds himself is entirely due to the actions of his predecessors. The Minister has a simple job to do in the great relay race towards prosperity.  He has to run without dropping the baton and pass it on to his successor.  It will not be long before his successor does likewise.</P>
      <P>Looking at the opening position, most Deputies thought the Minister could not get it wrong.  I am afraid that we are disappointed as are the Minister's backbenchers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never seen a more muted response to a budget since joining this House in 1981.  This budget does more than put at risk the progress made towards the success of this country. It is studded with a series of short-term expedient measures at the expense of medium to long-term strategies.  It dispenses money with the efficacy of a scatter gun but it fails to identify medium-term objectives and the ways and means to achieve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Confidence is a fragile flower.  The Minister for Finance has a duty and responsibility to guard and maintain it.  The public is not fully convinced this growth phase in the economy will continue. Over the years they have become used to false dawns that fade into misty twilights and boom turning to bust.  Somewhere in the backs of their minds they see a Minister for Finance returning from the races, calling into his Department and <Col N="118" /> finding the tiger thrown on the mat outside his office, his eyes rolling in his head, foam coming from his mouth and the Secretary of the Department feeding him with worm powder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The tiger died on Deputy Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must maintain confidence. Neither the public nor the markets are fully convinced about his management.  The Minister will maintain confidence if he is prudent, controls public expenditure and has clear medium-term objectives.  However, he is spending too much.  His tax package is inadequate, unjust and ineffective as an instrument of policy.  His social welfare measures are paltry and half-hearted and he has no medium-term plan.</P>
      <P>Great opportunities present themselves occasionally in politics when the decisions of individual politicians have a profound effect on the welfare of the nation; the founding of the IDA by Gerard Sweetman; the introduction of free education by Donogh O'Malley; entering the European Union under Jack Lynch; and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement by Dr. Garret Fitzgerald. These are instances which spring to the minds of many Deputies.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance had an opportunity to make his mark today.  It was an opportunity which would lead people to say in the future &ldquo;it began with McCreevy&rdquo;.  It was an opportunity to put his imprint on how this nation will be in the medium-term at the turn of the Millennium.  He could have ensured a continuity of the boom and distributed its fruits in a socially just manner so that everyone benefited in accordance with their needs.  This would have ensured that the people proceeded towards the future in prosperity and as one nation.  We would not be divided, with an increasing underclass but as one nation where, finally, all the children of the nation were cherished equally.  Unfortunately, the Minister has failed the test.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have met three objectives today.  He should have ascertained the facts which underpin the present economic boom and how he could reinforce them.  Second, he should have ascertained the foreseeable bottlenecks which can undermine our success and how he could remove them.  Third, he should have considered how he could create a fairer society where every person shares in the fruits of growth and where the needs of those who have fallen furthest behind are first addressed.</P>
      <P>I read the Minister's speeches from his days in Opposition.  It would be unfair to say he does not stand for anything.  However, on the basis of the written record, he does not stand for much. Today's speech does not alter my opinion.  There is no sign of a Minister for Finance who knows his mind and who intends to put his imprint on the future of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is one mantra which the Minister made his own in Opposition.  He repeated it time and again as the foundation stone of all fiscal <Col N="119" /> policy, the core of his core principles &mdash; control of public expenditure.  This principle emerged from his speeches in Opposition into the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and thence into the Programme for Government where he committed himself and his Government to confining increases to 4 per cent in current expenditure and 5 per cent on the capital side.  He has significantly failed to meet his targets.  He is increasing current expenditure by 7 per cent.  On the capital side he is throwing caution to the wind and increasing spending by 17.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>In its programme, the Government is committed &ldquo;to limit net current spending growth to 4 per cent which is broadly equivalent to the 2 per cent growth in real terms agreed in Partnership 2000&rdquo;. We can see more clearly what the Minister is at when we look at the figures rather than the percentages. In real terms, the Government is committed to increasing current expenditure by not more than £520 million.  Before today's budget, the Minister had increased spending by £900 million. Today's package adds another £250 million or so.  Against its commitment to increase public expenditure by, approximately, £520 million, the Minister is increasing it by £1.15 billion.  The Minister has not fulfilled his promise.  He has abandoned his core principle which he exhorted us to follow when in Opposition.  Because the Minister has disguised his intent does not mean that he is a prudent accountant; it means he is a creative accountant.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that all expenditure is bad.  The Minister's commitment to keeping capital expenditure under 5 per cent was an error.  Any independent observer could justify increased capital expenditure on schools and hospitals, which are below standard in many ways, or on the physical infrastructure of the country, which is far behind that of our EU partners.</P>
    <P>I am entitled to judge the Minister on his terms, on the principles he sets out and on his commitments. The only policy objective the Minister has clearly identified is the control of public expenditure. If he is to increase that expenditure to provide extra services in one spending area, he should have examined programmes that may have outlived their usefulness in order to achieve compensating cuts.  That is how he said it should be done, and that is what he should have done to increase public expenditure by the amount available to him.  With the buoyancy of revenue at his disposal, he has three choices.  He can spend the money on improving services, many of which in health, education and social welfare need improvement.  He can cut the national debt by budgeting for a significant surplus, or he can dedicate the bulk of his resources to tax relief.</P>
    <P>There are no other choices.  If the Minister opts for extra spending, he reduces the resources available to him for tax concession or reduction of the national debt.  If he had stuck to his commitment in the programme for Government, he would <Col N="120" /> have had an additional £700 million at his disposal today for tax relief and debt reduction.</P>
    <P>This is an expansionary budget.  It is doubtful whether the economy needs anything like the stimulus being provided to maintain the forward movement commenced in the three budgets from Deputy Ruairí Quinn when this side of the House was in Government.  This is more like bonfire night than budget night, as the Minister, like an unsupervised youngster, piles more fuel on the fire to see how high the flames will shoot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget reminds me of the expansionary budgets of the late 1970s and the grief of the 1980s when payback time arrived.  We must never forget the simple rules of economics. If demand outstrips supply, there are foreseeable consequences, some of which can be severely damaging to the economy.  The Minister is spending £1.15 billion more than was spent in 1997 on various Government programmes.  This will increase consumer demand significantly.  He is injecting £517 million of tax relief in a full year into the economy, which will increase consumer demand even further.  Ireland is entering economic and monetary union; the prospect of entry will reduce interest rates by almost 2 per cent in 1998.  This will also increase consumer demand.</P>
      <P>I am not so much afraid that this expansionary budget will immediately lead to inflation as that it will stimulate growth to a point where the resources of the economy can no longer provide for its own needs.  I am particularly concerned with the housing market, the chaotic traffic conditions and the increasing skill shortages in the labour market.  This budget will exacerbate the difficulties in all three areas, and I will comment in detail on these later.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister has accepted the decision of the Rainbow Government that the standard rate of corporation tax should be 12.5 per cent.  We told him when he attempted to reduce it to 10 per cent that this was foolish and dangerous, and he found this out in Brussels last Monday, when he barely pulled his fingers out of the fire before he got seriously burnt.</P>
      <P>However, that is in line with the various U-turns of this Government.  Does anyone remember the commitment to mandatory reporting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the real reason.  The Government passes the blame to the Independents to give itself cover for another shameless policy U-turn.</P>
      <P>Does everyone remember the introductory income tax rate of 20 per cent?  That also went today like last year's snow, blown away in a sentence by the Minister: he did not feel it was a great idea, it would not be done now and the standard rate is being reduced in any case.  The 10 per cent corporation tax rate is also gone, and a corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent has been announced.  I am delighted the Minister announced this, but he left it very late.  The EU are now watching us very closely.  A committee was announced last Monday in Brussels through which the European Commission may send agents to see if our tax measures are harmful; that is the result of the Minister and the Tánaiste horsing around with corporation tax.  If they had settled for 12.5 per cent, as agreed in June, we would not now have this committee knocking on the door to see if IDA packages are in accordance with EU policy.</P>
      <P>Is the 12.5 per cent figure real?  Will it be taken away by the committee?  The Minister says there will be two rates: a 12.5 per cent standard rate and a higher rate, 28 per cent, for non-trading income.  There is no definition of which companies will be at which rate given in the budget.  For example, will banking, farming or the retail sector be taxed at the higher rate?  The Minister should start to clear up these issues, because the main impetus to job creation in Ireland has been through service industries, not manufacturing. Will the higher rate of tax apply to service industries? This has all the appearance of a rushed announcement.  Irons were pulled out of the fire in Brussels at the last minute, and a paragraph without details was stuck in the budget.  That is not good enough, but at least the Minister got the rate correct, which might be a reasonable success given he had the assistance of the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>When the Tánaiste spoke on this matter, she suggested that the difference was minimal.  An increase from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent is an increase of 25 per cent.  Such an increase at any rate of tax is significant in anyone's book of arithmetic. However, since former Deputy Michael McDowell departed from the Progressive Democrats, they are increasingly becoming the innumerate party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget income tax arrangements are interesting, and the Progressive Democrats' hand <Col N="122" /> can be seen there.  Those arrangements are unfair and unjust.  Those that have most get most, and the wage earner at the bottom of the scale stays floundering with £3 a week.  Deputy Quinn, in last year's budget, gave £393 million in tax and PRSI benefits, which were spread reasonably equitably across the ranges of income.  The package today is about £100 million more.  Two points off the top rate of tax amounts to £100 million and two points off the standard rate amounts to £100 million. What is the effect of this?  One can go through the tables for the different samples of families, single parent and married parent, but in general to the single person on the average industrial wage, it is worth about £8 per week; to a married person with benefits included, it is worth about £6 per week.</P>
    <P>At the other end where the tables stop at £50,000 per year the gain is £21-22 per week.  A poor person will get £3 per week, the price of a pint of lager and the bus fare home, and the well off person will get £1,200 per year.  There are variations depending in the rates of PRSI but in general the bulk of the money was given to improve rates rather than the allowances and the bands. While everybody gains something and those who have a high income gain much, the person on the average industrial wage will wonder what it was all about.  That is what they will wonder in the bars around the country tonight.</P>
    <P>On capital gains, the Minister decided that certain significant entrepreneurs, who have to go offshore because they cannot realise their capital gains here, should have the rate cut from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  Yet he went on to hammer the small investor by reducing the allowances. This is a rich man's Minister for Finance, at every action he has skewed the tax system in a most unfair fashion.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have increased the allowances significantly.  A single man or woman starts paying income tax after earning £3,800.  After this budget, the best year since 1922, a single man or woman will begin to pay tax after earning another £250.  At present the single PAYE worker moves to the 48 per cent band after earning £13,700 gross, which is now being increased by £100.  The single person, instead of moving on to the 48 per cent band at £13,700 after 6 April next, will only have to pay at 46 per cent when he earns £3,080.</P>
    <P>The problem with the tax system is not that the person on £13,700 has to pay at 46 per cent rather than 48 per cent but that such people and people with significantly larger incomes should not pay at the higher rate but at the standard rate.  That position cannot be reached if £300 million out of the £500 million is given towards cutting rates without doing anything with the allowances and £100 million is given towards reducing the bands. That is the net position.  It is inequitable and ineffective.</P>
    <P>Tax policy is not all about giving back money to taxpayers in the immortal phrase &mdash; pay back time.  Tax policy is an instrument of fiscal management. There are skill shortages in the economy <Col N="123" /> and unless the Minister takes tranches of people out of the tax net &mdash; and not the mere 12,000 mentioned in his statement who will be back again after the first small wage increase &mdash; we are facing trouble in a buoyant economy. There is evidence of that in the service industries and notices seeking staff are on display in pubs, hotels etc. everywhere.  It is not worth their while working when the tax is paid.</P>
    <P>I welcome one item in the Minister's speech, that in future he will calculate family income supplement on net rather than gross income in accordance with the commitment we made when we negotiated Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to an anomaly which has not been significantly removed on which Deputy Paul McGrath tabled a question. He asked what a man on £230 per week with three children, one earner, in receipt of family income supplement, would have to be given to increase his take home pay.  If he was given £10 extra per week he lost 29p, if given £20 extra per week he lost 58p; if given £30 extra per week he lost 65p per week.  He had to get £40 extra per week before his take home pay increased by £5.17. If ever there was an example of the State intervening to transfer the resources of the employer to the Exchequer, by-passing the worker whom he was attempting to reward, that is it.  The family income supplement is paid only to those persons who if they did not get it would be better off on social welfare.  There is not a single iota of tax reform in this budget.  There is no attempt to address the issue of marginal rates for the low paid when they get above the exemption limits.  There has not been a single attempt to seriously take large tranches of low paid workers out of the tax net.  There has not been a single attempt to eliminate welfare and poverty traps and to deal with that complicated interface where family income supplement meets social welfare and tax take.  It is no wonder there are signs up all over the town.  Is it any wonder every businessman will say he would take on workers but he cannot get them?  Is it any wonder we still have almost 250,000 people on various forms of unemployment benefit and assistance?  This is not good enough.  The Taoiseach knows what I am talking about.  He allowed himself to get hijacked by the representatives of the greedy who are his partners in Government.  He knows better than anybody how the labour market works.  There were enough Members on the Government benches who knew what should be done but in the first year in office he did not have the guts to do it. What will it be like when he gets into tricky political times?</P>

      <P>If the Government was serious about tax reform and wanted to reduce the marginal rate of tax why allow the 2.25 per cent levies remain intact?  The top rate of tax is not 48 per cent.  The top rate of tax and the levies is 50.25 per cent.  If 1 per cent is removed from the levies it would have affected the lowest paid.  Instead, because from a PR point of view and because the marketing people suggest that cutting the top rate and the standard rate, there is a better story to tell, he ignored the allowances and the 2.5 per cent levies.  If the Minister really wants to fairly deliver money into the pockets of people where everybody gets a decent shake-out, the most effective way of doing so is through the PAYE allowance and the PRSI allowance.</P>
      <P>In his Budget Statement last year, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, took a point off the employee rate of PRSI.  That is why the tables of benefit in the budget last year were not skewed towards the top end of the earning pyramid but there was an even distribution of benefit.</P>
      <P>To think of the budget as simply pay back time, forget that tax management is an instrument of policy that can get a labour market response, and see the things simply in terms of tax reduction, with no attempt at tax reform, is to end up in the position the Minister is in today.  Last year Deputy Quinn had £117 million less at his disposal yet, at all income points, he delivered more per week to the ordinary worker.  On this occasion the benefits are skewed towards the top.</P>
      <P>On social welfare, I do not know whether this is a policy decision or an omission but in the summary outlining the main features of the budget I can find no reference to an increase in child dependant allowances under the various headings. There is a 3 per cent increase across the board in personal and adult dependant allowances. If it is the case that there is no increase in child dependant allowances it is an absolute shame.</P>

The mothers of Ireland will be delighted to receive an extra £1.50 per month or 37.5p per week in child benefit in respect of the first and second child.  They will receive an extra 75p per week in respect of the third child.  The Government promised to provide tax relief for working mothers so that they would have the money to pay the cre che fees.  Having thought about the <Col N="125" /> matter, it no longer thinks it is such a good idea and has dropped it.  It is of the view that 37.5p per week will give encouragement to the mother with one child who pushes the husband out of the door having had a cup of coffee and a slice of toast to take the child to the cre che and then rushes to work in a state of stress.

A sum of £3.5 million is to be provided in installation aid but there is a sting in the tail.  The money is to be used to meet outstanding commitments only despite the commitment given in the programme for Government to restore the scheme.  The amount available under the control of farmyard pollution scheme was cut by £30 million in the Book of Estimates.  To encourage farmers to participate a little tax relief is provided.

      <P>This budget and the forthcoming reduction in interest rates of 2 per cent will further fuel demand in the Dublin housing market. There is nothing in the detail of this budget, or in any Government policy I have heard enunciated which will increase either the supply of houses or of building land in the capital city.  If demand continues to rise and supply remains restricted, prices will continue to rise.  The entry point into the private housing market in Dublin <Col N="128" /> is now approximately £80,000.  Prices will continue to rise and I have no doubt the traditional aspiration of many young persons to own their own homes will become a pipe dream.</P>

      <P>We are facing circumstances in which, say, a nurse, garda, school teacher, middle grade civil servant and people in industry on almost twice the average industrial wage will not be in a position to aspire to owning their own homes.  The ambition to own one's own home, especially in the case of young married couples, is one which will not be abandoned lightly by the electorate.  Furthermore, very soon the social partnership on which so much of the prosperity we have enjoyed was built will not be maintained unless this problem is addressed.  The young will not stand for it and the trade unions will not be able to contain the demands of their younger members because, if they cannot get a supply of houses, they will seek extra income to get into the market for available houses.  Unless the Government takes action, this will break Partnership 2000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very hard to explain to young couples that an aspiration to own one's home, which was the norm for their parents' generation, is no longer an attainable objective for them.  The Government will not be forgiven if, having stimulated the demand, it fails to take any action to match that demand with supply.</P>

      <P>Yet, there is not a single provision in this budget which gives a young couple on lower or middle income any hope, in prevailing conditions, of entering the Dublin housing market. It is not solely a Dublin problem, house prices in other cities have also escalated, but the problem is most acute in Dublin.  The answer is evident &mdash; supply must be increased through extra density, extra building land, accompanied by rapid rail systems so that satellite, suburban, dormitory towns can be developed along with adequate transport facilities.  That aspiration so dear to many of our young couples will continue, which means that demand must be met.</P>
      <P>That is one of the bottlenecks this expansionary budget will worsen and which, if not addressed, could bring the whole house of cards crashing down around us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;-because it has a human dimension.</P>
      <P>Many Asian economies &mdash; the first to which the term &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; applied &mdash; were associated with the other difficulty to which I will draw the attention of the House.  One of the first indicators of difficulties facing Asian economies was the increasing growth and consumer demand, cluttering up their roads and choking their cities because they failed to provide the transport infrastructure to service their booming economies.  The first signs of a similar crisis facing us &mdash; while the Government stands idly by refusing to take strategic decisions &mdash; are evident to anybody familiar with traffic flows or the lack of them in Dublin.</P>
      <P>However, there is a wider issue than the social discomfort of the populace.  The inflow of foreign investment in manufacturing industry is a major contributor to our current prosperity.  Ireland is an attractive location for foreign investment. People do business where it is easy and profitable for them to do so; it is as simple as that.  When our main roads are dense with traffic, our cities, particularly Dublin, are choked with traffic, when it takes an hour to drive where one could walk in ten minutes, when the container traffic from Dublin port continues to lumber through the city centre, when people's journeys to and from their workplace take unconscionable lengths of time, when it is no longer even easy or profitable to do business in Ireland, the flow of investment ceases.</P>
      <P>The best hope of solving Dublin's traffic congestion is to proceed with the Luas project or a variation of it.  However, the Government refuses to take a decision.  A further evaluation has now been commissioned.  Even a special visit by the relevant EU Commissioner to urge the Government to get its act together lest it lose the Structural Funds allocated for that purpose has not succeeded in injecting any sense of urgency into the Minister for Public Enterprise or the Government.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the fury, the ill temper, road rage, all now a feature of our daily lives. Traffic is adding such a stress to the normal inter-course of daily life it is difficult to measure its consequences in personal and social terms and I do not intend to do so now.  What concerns me principally is that this extremely expansionary budget will further exacerbate the problem to the point at which not only our traffic but our economy will grind to a halt before this faltering Government takes remedial action.  In this context the paltry sum of £1.4 million in the Book of Estimates dedicated to relieve traffic congestion in Dublin must be the ultimate in the book of sick jokes.</P>

      <P>We are very fortunate to have such a pool of highly skilled people.  I do not know whether the Government is familiar with this phenomenon but it has now reached the point at which over the past 12 months, in certain specific skills, pay rates rose by in excess of 20 per cent.  It is still fairly specific to certain skills but this economy cannot withstand wage inflation of 20 per cent, and it is spreading.</P>
      <P>There is another factor on which I am sure the Industrial Development Authority would be well able to inform Government Ministers: that is, whenever announcements of new factories are made by the Tánaiste, whether in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Dublin or elsewhere, providing anything between 400 and 600 jobs, they are greeted with great applause by us politicians and equal enthusiasm by the general public.  Does the House know what small, indigenous business people say?  They say they will lose their key workers to the multinationals which take our skilled pool, and pay them more money.  They have to get out into the labour market where there is a shortage of skilled people but if they attempt to retain workers their pay roll costs rise. The Government should talk to the sub-suppliers, usually Irish companies around the country when they will see what is happening in terms of skill shortages.  They are not greeting new factory announcements with any enthusiasm because the inflationary pressure is there already and it must be met.</P>

Is it the secondary schools or the regional technical colleges and the universities?  We talk about smoke, mirrors and creative accounting: did anybody examine that £100 million?  Are people aware that it includes the cost of training and paying the teachers as well as buying equipment?  An item <Col N="131" /> of expenditure that should be on the current side of the budget is hidden as a capital announcement to inflate its impact.</P>

      <P>It is another disgraceful piece of nonsense.  The skills shortage is emerging at the bottom end of the labour market.  There are vacancy signs all over the city and increasingly around the country.  Why are 250,000 people unemployed and 100,000s of our people abroad while at the same time there are job vacancies all over the country?  Why, according to the most recent figures, did 15,000 people come into the country to take up these jobs?  The reason is simple. Fiscal policy has not dealt with the interface between social welfare and taxation and the fact that at certain levels of pay it is not worth working because too much has to be paid in PRSI and tax.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to reform tax in fiscally weak times because the trap is that there are winners, who identify their winnings and put them in their pockets, and losers, who become vocal and put on political pressure.</P>

      <P>It is not difficult to deliver tax reform in a time when there are great resources. Excluding previous expenditure, which should be re-examined, the Minister had £517 million at his disposal and he gave away £300 million in rates. Much of that money should have been dedicated to taking low paid employees out of the tax net and making it worth their while to work.  It would mean the low paid were working; that they would begin to pay tax and PRSI as their salaries increased; that they would be off the live register and that they would have dignity and self-fulfilment. They would have their first job and be on their way.</P>

      <P>This is what the Minister should have done.  When Deputy McDowell was advocating these policies in this House, something he did in an impressive manner, he was talking in theory, because no matter what was done there were no jobs.  However, the vacancies now exist and this is the time for fiscal intervention in the labour market to facilitate those who want to work and are available for work if they are properly paid.</P>
      <P>The Minister has continued what he described as his button-lipped policy on entry to EMU.  I do not understand why the Minister will not discuss the currency.  The most momentous event in this country over the next 12 months will be our entry to EMU.  Announcements will be made in the second week of May and it is clear that we will enter EMU from 1 January 1999.  Yet the Minister delivered his first budget speech without even mentioning it.  This is extraordinary and he will have to address it shortly because questions are being asked by those familiar with the market.</P>
      <P>The central ERM rate is 2.41DM to the IR£1. Yesterday, the IR£ was trading at 2.61DM. If the Minister decides next May that the convergence rate is to be at the central ERM rate &mdash; and we do not know any different &mdash; it means a devaluation in real terms from today's trading position of between 7 per cent and 8 per cent.</P>
      <P>Many people think that because the budget has been introduced before Christmas they will receive the benefit of tax relief by Christmas. However, even though the date of the budget changed, the tax relief will not come into force until after 6 April 1998.  Three weeks later the Minister will make an announcement.  If he decides the convergence rate will be the central ERM rate, people's spending power in terms of imported goods will be reduced by up to 8 per cent.  The population will be very upset by this. The Minister must clearly signal his intentions in terms of convergence.  We know we are joining EMU.  Fine Gael is pro-Europe and supports entry.  We know there will be reductions in interest rates but we do not want currency shocks over the coming six months with interest rates jerking up and down.  We want an even and systematic reduction in rates.  However, the Minister must make some attempt at managing entry and the announcement of a convergence rate to ensure the high morale of the public is not dissipated by a further lack of planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first budget introduced by the Minister.  It is very good for those who earn £50,000 per year and relatively good for those earning £30,000 per year.  However, for most of us it is a distinctly bad budget.  It is unfair, divisive, inequitable, reckless and irresponsible.  It points to a Government and a Minister with no coherent policy on management of the economy. It is borne out of party political expediency, intended to keep Fianna Fáil in power and the <Col N="133" /> Progressive Democrats Party alive.  In reality, it will do neither.</P>
      <P>When I spoke on the Estimates debate last week, I said we would measure the performance of the Minister in several different ways.  We will measure him against the expectations he and his party so successfully created last June; against the numerous targets he set for himself; against the effect of the budget on the economy and, in particular, on employment and unemployment. Finally, we will measure the Minister and his budget against the requirements of fairness and equity.  We will assess the impact of the budget on those least well off, those dependent on a fixed income, often social welfare, and those who live in communities where the Celtic tiger is little more than a joke.</P>
      <P>In 1988 George Bush made a famous and dangerous election pledge when he said: &ldquo;Read my lips, no new taxes&rdquo;.  It was a promise he lived to regret.  The 1997 Irish version of George Bush's mantra is the infamous phrase, &ldquo;It is payback time&rdquo;, used most famously by the <i>Irish Independent</i> the day before polling.  The debate that produced that mantra was deliberately engineered by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties for their own political ends.</P>
      <P>It is worth casting one's mind back to January 1997 when the Progressive Democrats produced a draft budget for 1997 which bears striking similarities to the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.  The draft budget promised a reduction of 2 per cent in the upper and standard rates of tax with some increases in PAYE allowances and the exemption limits.  In the months following publication of that draft budget, the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil tripped over each other in their enthusiasm to offer ever more substantial bribes to the electorate. In the end they settled on a package mainly skewed to the better off, since these are the people who form the bedrock of the ever diminishing number of Progressive Democrats voters.</P>
      <P>The total value of the tax package is £517 million. Of this, almost half is targeted at better off taxpayers and the most profitable companies.  It confers little or no benefit on the vast majority of taxpayers.  The total value, therefore, to ordinary taxpayers of the Minister's efforts is a mere £280 million.  In contrast, the total package introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, earlier this year was worth nearly £400 million.  For whom is this pay back time?  Certainly not for the ordinary taxpayer.  This Government and this Minister would not be in power had they not deliberately sought to create expectations of pay back time &mdash; expectations of serious tax reductions.  The better off have got a decent pay-off from the Minister, and no doubt they are suitably grateful, but the ordinary decent people who voted for Fianna Fáil have been betrayed by Minister McCreevy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with his budget today the Minister produced some tax tables setting out the benefit for individual taxpayers of the changes he <Col N="134" /> has introduced.  These figures are staggering and the Minister should justify them.  On a total income of £9,000, a married couple will benefit to the extent of 1.5 per cent of net income &mdash; £127. The percentages increase from there.  At £50,000 the percentage increase is 3.6; the actual figure is £1,124.  I have never seen such a regressive list of benefits.  The richer one is, the more one benefits; the poorer one is, the less one benefits.  Indeed, most of the poor hardly benefit at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My party believes reductions in income tax are desirable and necessary.  We were party to Partnership 2000, which provides for £1 billion in tax cuts over a three year period.  We happily signed up to that agreement and we stand by it, but there was a rationale behind what we proposed and I want to spell that out once again. The first and primary reason for reducing income tax is to smooth the way from welfare to work. The second reason is to remove the poverty traps that exist in the system.  It is crazy that someone can be worse off even though their nominal earnings are higher.  This comes about, as the Minister knows, through the complicated interaction of gross pay, FIS, exemption limits and the marginal rate.  The Minister has done nothing to deal with that.  We can justify income tax reductions because ordinary workers took pay increases over the past number of years which were less than the increase in national wealth.</P>
      <P>There is economic justification for income tax cuts.  We need cuts in income tax to get more people out to work, to reward those at work and to ensure the continuation of social partnership. Unfortunately, this Minister has had scant, if any, regard to the economic justification for income tax cuts.  The package he has introduced today is a political, expedient and unfair package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the higher rate of tax.  Forty-eight per cent was not an unusually high marginal rate by European standards, but people in this country on relatively modest rates of pay are paying income tax at a marginal rate of 48 per cent. When my party was in Government it made significant progress in addressing this position. Before today's budget, a married couple with a mortgage and one earner could earn nearly £30,000 before hitting the 48 per cent tax band. Despite all the rhetoric from the Minister and all the guff we have listened to from the Progressive Democrats in particular, the Minister has done almost nothing to broaden that band today.  He could have gone a great deal further if he had not <Col N="135" /> chosen to waste resources by reducing the upper rate of tax.  The reduction in the upper rate is wasteful, reckless and grossly unfair.  It will benefit only a small number of people to any significant degree and these are the people who need it least.  It is utterly outrageous that we should go out of our way to target some of the benefits of economic growth at those already benefiting most and who are best able to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>As regards people who earn high incomes, less than 10 per cent of taxpayers earn £30,000 or more.  Many of those people are professional, self-employed, skilled craftspeople, managers or journalists.  They make a decent wage by Irish standards and fair play to them.  They work hard, contribute enormously to our society and create jobs for others.  They and their families deserve a decent standard of living.  I begrudge them not a penny of what they earn.  The more people we have earning good wages and contributing to our economy, the better we will all be.  Begrudgery does not advance the argument for fairness and the House will not hear any petty-mindedness of that kind from these benches.  On the contrary, we require the active participation and contribution of the better off if we are to build on and retain the sense of community which has been a part of Irish society for many years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to create an education system for the rich and another for the poor.  I do not want to create a health system for the rich and another for the poor.  I do not want to see a society where the rich provide for their own pensions and the rest of us depend on social welfare.  To avoid a two tier society, we need the acquiescence, if not the support, of the better off in paying for services on which we all depend.  Ireland is at heart a genuinely more egalitarian and less selfish society than many others.  We can help to maintain that if we seek to create a social consensus.  This demands that we win the agreement of those who are better off to the proposition that we must all contribute according to our means and for the ultimate benefit of all.  There is and always will be a need for redistribution and the tax system is an essential part of that process.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the 48 per cent rate.  It is time to nail some lies.  The Minister would have us believe that a single person earning £15,000, £16,000 or £17,000 per year would benefit significantly from the reduction in the upper rate of tax. That is untrue.  A single person earning £15,000 per year, all other things being equal, benefits by less than £1 per week from a reduction of 2p in the marginal rate.  A single person earning £20,000 per year will benefit by hardly more than the price of a pint from a cut of 2p in the 48p rate.  The reason for that is simple: these people pay the upper rate of tax on only a small part of their income.  It is only when a person earns a seriously high income, and this is clear from the Minister's tables, that the reduction in the top rate makes any significant difference.  The Minister <Col N="136" /> is well aware of that, as is the Tánaiste.  That is the reason she proposed it.  If that is so, surely it is fairer to be open and honest with people. The Minister should come clean and give up the pretence that this measure is aimed at people on modest incomes.  The facts are clear, bald and unpleasant.  Only people earning high incomes will benefit in any meaningful way from a reduction in the top rate.</P>
    <P>There are other fairer ways in which the Minister could have dealt with the tax system.  Had he chosen to put all of his money into increasing allowances to effectively widen the zero rate band, 90 per cent of taxpayers would be better off than they are as a result of the Minister's measures.  Increasing personal allowances benefits all taxpayers whether they earn £10,000 or £100,000.  The proportionate benefit is greater for those on lower pay and that is only right.  It is worth pointing out that, in straight cash terms, high earners gain even more from increases in personal allowances.</P>
    <P>If the Minister felt he had to interfere with tax rates, he should have confined himself to the standard rate.  This too would have benefited all taxpayers, including those who pay 48 per cent marginal rates.  In short, the Minister had a choice. He could have done what was right for the economy and what the social partners, including the representatives of small business, asked him to do.  He could have done what was fair, but instead he has chosen a route which is manifestly unfair.  He has chosen to target more than a quarter of his total package at a tiny percentage of the population.  In doing that, he is risking social partnership and is wasting our money.  The most galling part of all this is that he is borrowing money to do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is an accountant by profession. When he spoke from these benches last year he lectured us at great length and with fervour about the importance of sound money, transparent public finances and fiscal rectitude, yet his record over the past five months is in breathtaking contrast to his previous rhetoric.  How often did we hear the Minister say we should budget for a surplus in good times so as to provide for a rainy day?  Yet, less than three months after taking up office in October of this year, he juggles the Exchequer finances in a way that is deliberately intended to engineer a deficit for 1997.  He borrowed money to finance a deficit we need not have had.  Had the Minister not fiddled the figures for 1997, the budget introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, in January of this year would have produced an overall Exchequer surplus of approximately £200 million.  Instead we will end up borrowing over £200 million in order to help Minister McCreevy present the figures in a way which suits his peculiar ideological bent. Only the most gullible have been fooled, but the manoeuvre has done no end of damage to the Minister's credibility and the credibility of his economic policy.  In a sense there was worse to come.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> Having engineered a false deficit in 1997, the Minister is now quite deliberately creating a deficit in 1998.  That is being done by a Minister who lectured us long and hard about the need to run a surplus.  The same Minister has the gall to come into the House today and tell us that he proposes to borrow money to pay for tax cuts, the primary purpose of which is to keep the Progressive Democrats alive.  The Minister's deficit for 1998 is one of the most expensive bailouts ever engineered here.  We are being asked to borrow nearly £100 million in a vain attempt to divert the Tánaiste and her colleagues from the route to political oblivion.  The Minister has betrayed the ordinary decent Fianna Fáil voter who looked to this day with some sense of expectation, but no doubt a few glasses of bubbly will be drunk in other quarters.  Who knows, perhaps the Minister's actions may find an echo of support in some dark distant parts of the Law Library.</P>
    <P>Before moving from the issue of income tax, I want to say a few words of warning, and I genuinely mean this in a most constructive sense. We have had growth of nearly 40 per cent since 1992.  Inflation is at a very low level, 1.5 per cent according to the Minister's figures today.  It is generally accepted that inflation in Ireland is largely generated by imports and seriously affected by the exchange rate.  There has so far been little evidence to suggest that the economy is over primed or that we are at risk of an inflationary cycle, but there are warning signs.</P>
    <P>In the first weekend of May next year EMU will effectively start.  The bilateral exchange rates will be put in place as a preliminary to the final fixing of exchange rates at the end of the year. The Minister has, in his own words, decided to &ldquo;button his lip&rdquo; in relation to this debate, but he knows as well as we all do what the current indications are.  The chances are that the exchange rates will be fixed next May at or about the current central exchange rates.  That is important for Ireland since we are currently the only participating country which is trading at a rate well above the central rate.  This morning we were trading more than 20 pfennigs higher than the central rate against the deutschmark.  What this means is clear enough.  It means that in all likelihood the Irish pound will be devalued against the deutschmark by somewhere in the region of 5 per cent between now and next May and that devaluation will be permanent.  It will bring with it a significant risk of imported inflation and the Minister knows that.</P>
    <P>At that same time we can reasonably expect a reduction in interest rates.  The Bundesbank recently suggested that a decrease of 1 per cent or, perhaps, 2 per cent is likely in Irish rates between now and next May.  That, too, is likely to boost spending and to increase the risk of inflationary pressures.  Add to all that the tax package introduced today skewed as it is towards the better off and one has the ingredients of a potential disaster.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> I do not intend to push the panic button or to be politically expedient about this.  It may be that we will come through this unscathed, but for the first time in some years there is a serious gamble. The Minister knows that because he said so in the past.  He said exactly that in his contribution to the budget debate last year.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of years we have experienced growth in excess of 5 per cent while simultaneously increasing .current spending by at least 7 per cent.  The Central Bank has signalled that growth in the credit institutions is now growing at an alarming rate and yet, at the same time, it is proposed to reduce taxation. to do all of these things at the same time is inexcusable.</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister said last year.  What a difference a year makes.  It seems that the fiscally prudent Deputy McCreevy of earlier this year has been replaced by the gambler Minister, Deputy McCreevy.  The Minister is entitled to gamble with his money, but at the moment he is doing far more than that.  He is gambling with the future of our economy.</P>
    <P>Regarding corporation tax, the Minister announced today that he intends to breach yet another of the promises made by Fianna Fáil before the last election, a promise which was translated across to the Government's, An Action Programme for the Millennium.  That is the promise to introduce a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax before 2005.  The background to that is well known and I do not want to spend too much time in that regard.  The Government was told at the end of last year that our current differential rates, notably the preferential rate for the IFSC and the 10 per cent manufacturing rate, could not be maintained in the long run as they constituted State aid and were anti-competitive.  As a result the then Government announced earlier this year that it would seek to introduce a general corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent over the next decade. It is no secret that the Labour Party would probably have preferred a slightly higher rate, but we accepted then and we still accept that there is a benefit in getting all-party agreement and in letting companies know well in advance what we intend to do.  As a result we supported the Government decision to seek a 12.5 per cent overall rate and we still support that decision.</P>
    <P>For some reason best known to himself, the then Deputy McCreevy in Opposition decided to go one step further by committing Fianna Fáil to a 10 per cent rate.  That would have been innocent in itself had it not had the undesired and undesirable effect of directing the attention of the EU Commission at our overall corporation tax policy. That is attention we could have well done without. As it happens the then Deputy McCreevy's 10 per cent promise was yet another political promise that has gone the way of so many promises made by the Government.</P>
    <P>There are three rates of corporation tax.  There is the lower 10 per cent rate, which the Minister <Col N="139" /> must increase although he has given us no intention today of when he intends to do that.  The two higher rates must be brought down over time. Ninety per cent of companies pay the lower rate of corporation tax and return net profits of under £50,000.  Many of those companies are in the service area and they contribute significantly to employment in the economy.  It is right and proper that they should get the primary benefit of the overall reduction in corporation tax.  The Minister should have targeted all or most of his resources at reducing this lower rate in the first instance.  The upper rate must also be reduced in time, but this could or should have been done more slowly.  The truth is that only a very small number of companies, mostly in the financial services sector, benefit hugely from reductions in the upper rate.  There is no particularly good or persuasive reason we should seek to benefit those companies.  They are the most profitable companies in our economy and they do not need the State to offer them a windfall profit on a plate. We should be considering a means of clawing back some of this money by, for example, reintroducing the bank levy.  If we do not do that, we should seek to ensure that those companies that benefit most, be they banks or supermarkets, pass on some of the additional benefit to their customers. Forgive me if I express a certain scepticism in that regard.</P>
    <P>The previous Government introduced a PRSI free allowance of £80 per week and the Minister has now increased that to £100.  That was a particularly fair way of targeting tax reductions at the low paid, as prior to the change all income, however modest, was subject to PRSI.  There is scope for an increase in that allowance and I am pleased the Minister has gone the way he has. However, beyond that it is striking that he has chosen to do very little with PRSI.  The social insurance fund is self-sustaining without Government contribution for the first time in many years.  In any event, many workers regard PRSI as a simple tax and the Progressive Democrats have been on the record many times as having said that.  There was and is much scope for a reduction in the employer and the employee rates of PRSI and it is disappointing the Government has made no progress in this matter.</P>
    <P>The previous Government introduced a provision whereby people on low income, currently just under £10,000 a year, do not pay the levies. That, in effect, provides for a two tier system of PRSI on that level.  The reform is effective in that it reduces the tax burden on those who earn less than that amount, but there is an anomaly of which the Minister will be well aware.  Because people earning just above the threshold pay all the levies on all of their incomes the threshold, in effect, becomes a step which causes problems for those who earn amounts just above the threshold. The Minister should have considered ways to eliminate that step and other similar steps that exist within the system by providing that the levies <Col N="140" /> would be payable only on amounts in excess of the threshold figures.</P>
    <P>Our economy is growing at a remarkable rate. Most of us are better off than our fathers or grandfathers and most of us can aspire to an improvement in our standard of living during the course of our lifetime, but that is not true of everyone.  Long-term unemployment is still at a stubbornly high figure.  There are parts of this country in west Dublin or north Cork where the very fabric of society is falling apart.  Long-term unemployment is the norm, housing conditions are terrible and schools are under equipped and staffed by teachers under serious stress.  The physical infrastructure and community facilities are poor and, in some cases, non-existent.  Drugs are rife and welfare dependency is the order of the day.</P>
    <P>When the Labour Party was in Government it sought to address this in a number of different ways.  We invested money in schools, in programmes such as Early Start and Breaking the Cycle and we sought to target resources at the disadvantaged.  We sought to encourage the partnership boards and we funded a range of measures designed specifically to take people out of long-term unemployment and into work.  We belatedly came to grips with the policy challenges of the drugs crisis and moneys were provided which are beginning to make a real difference. Let us be brutally frank about this, our successes were relatively few and many of the problems are still there.  It is crystal clear that we need nothing short of a dedicated effort targeted at education, health, unemployment, community facilities, infrastructural development and a range of other things specific to these areas.  It is clear that without that effort the chronic problems of those communities will continue.</P>
    <P>In many cases, there are community organisations in those areas with which Government can work but serious political commitment and considerable money are needed.  The Minister is on record as saying he has no time for the argument about social exclusion or &ldquo;the cranks that peddle that line&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, that philosophy &mdash; if philosophy is not too strong a word &mdash; clearly permeates his budget.  There is nothing in his budget for the poor and little for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>To take one example, it has long since been established and accepted that one of the most effective ways of targeting poverty is through child benefit.  During our time in Government the Labour Party more than doubled child benefit. Our efforts included two significant increases one of £5 and the other of £7, all of which went directly to mothers.  This Minister made no effort to build up on that achievement, providing a puny £1.50 extra per month.  He may believe there is a different or more effective way to tackle poverty, but he did not say so today.  The impression from all of this is clear &mdash; this Minister and Government cares little for the poor and cares an awful lot for the votes of the well off.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> I welcome the £5 increase being given to old age pensioners and widows.  Let us look at the effect that has had on other welfare benefits and increases provided.  A £3 increase in December 1997, in financial circumstances which are a great deal more beneficial, is the same amount provided by Deputy Quinn, as Minister, earlier this year.  Why did the Minister not do more?  He has given £1,100 to somebody earning £50,000 per annum and yet a person on social welfare is getting a mere £3 extra.</P>
    <P>A cogent and reasonable case has been made for an improvement in the carer's allowance.  The Minister has done nothing in the budget to help these people.  We all know people who spend every hour of the day looking after elderly parents or disabled people.  They are getting no breaks from the Celtic Tiger and the Minister's largesse dispensed today.  I welcome the fact the Minister has met our commitment in the context of Partnership 2000 to assess FIS on the net income.</P>
    <P>We should measure the Minister against his own targets.  Perversely and ironically, it is by this measure that he can most easily be seen to have failed.  I will look at his targets in sequence.  The Minister told us he would limit capital spending year on year to 5 per cent.  The Book of Estimates provides for a 17 per cent increase on capital spending and the budget has raised that figure to almost 20 per cent.  For what it is worth, the Minister was right to abandon his daft targets but by his standard, he has failed miserably.</P>
    <P>The second commitment the Minister gave was not to increase borrowing above £30 billion in times of economic growth.  By fiddling the figures this year and by borrowing unnecessarily next year, he has added half a billion pounds to the national debt.  This will bring the debt to perilously close to £30 billion, if not slightly higher. The extraordinary element in this target is that the Minister could have chosen to meet it if he had not chosen instead to bale out the Progressive Democrats with tax breaks for its supporters.</P>
    <P>The third of the Minister's targets is or rather was the commitment to limit the increase in net current spending to 4 per cent year on year during his tenure of office.  The Minister claims he has met this target.  This is arrant nonsense and he knows it.  He has played with the figures in a way which has not been done since the interfering hand of former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, dictated to the Department of Finance in the 1980s.  The real net figure is close to 6 per cent, if not higher, and the gross figure is several points higher than that again.</P>
    <P>I set out some of my views on public spending in the Estimates debate last week and I do not intend to repeat them.  Suffice to say, we badly need to invest in our infrastructure, not least the transport infrastructure of this city.  We also need to invest in education to do away with the disgrace of outside toilets in country schools and to provide our children with the skills they need to secure and retain decent jobs when they leave <Col N="142" /> full-time education.  We need to spend money on health which reflects itself in an improved service to the patient.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in public spending for the sake of it.  I said last week that the Left has sometimes given the impression, intentionally or otherwise, that public spending was a good thing in itself, but it is not.  Public spending is not always good and private spending is not always bad.  Public money has often been wasted and we still do not have a mechanism to ensure we get value for money.  We need to look seriously at what we do with taxpayers' money.  We need a serious Estimates process where Ministers and civil servants are required to stand up their proposals in public before the money is committed and not six months later.</P>
    <P>The Ministers target was daft and irresponsible and was plucked out of the air.  It is not related to our capacity to pay and makes no sense.  I am glad the Minister shattered his target but nonetheless, it is more than fair to do the Minister the service of judging him by the standard he set for himself.  On that standard his budget is a hopeless failure.</P>
    <P>The credibility of this Minister is in tatters. How can he ask the Dáil to take him, his Government or his targets seriously when he clearly has difficulty taking himself seriously?  He has not only slightly exceeded his targets but has left them and his credibility in shreds on the floor.</P>
    <P>It is not only the Minister's targets that have been shelved or shafted today.  He also indicated he intends to shelve a number of promises made by the Government prior to the election or in the programme for Government.  What now of the much vaunted help for child care?  What happened to the commitment to an entry rate of income tax to help the lower paid?  What happened to the commitment given to students on PLC's?  What happened to the increase in the number of gardaí on the streets?  What happened to the special pre-school budget?  What happened to the 25,000 place programme to tackle long-term unemployment?  The list is long.  Perhaps it will be acted on in time but I doubt it.  All the indications are that this Minister and Government intend to continue down their merry way ditching promises and betraying trust as they go. They wonder why people are cynical about politicians.</P>
    <P>For the first time in many years, we have a choice in the type of society we want to create. We can look to create a society divided between rich and poor, employed and unemployed, urban and rural, young and old or we can look to create a society in which we all have a stake and in which we are all better off, safer and more inter-dependent. Let us be in no doubt but that we are at a cross-roads.</P>
    <P>The choices before us can be symbolised by the current boom in apartment building in the capital city.  The expansion has often been trumpeted as a symbol of the economic boom and an indication of our prosperous future.  It goes unremarked, <Col N="143" /> however, that many of these developments have security arrangements which would put a mediaeval keep to shame.  They possess the modern equivalent of drawbridges and moats intended to keep the restless natives out.  If this is the social fabric we are intent on creating, I, and my party, want no part of it.  We do not believe in exclusion or in mé féinism or that society can function on such a fractured and divisive basis.  However, it is this type of society the Minister actively promoted today.  It is a society in which the rich look after themselves and where the disadvantaged are cut off and treated as a threat.  It is a society which is rotten to the core and which has turned its back on the idea of community.</P>
    <P>Sadly, the Minister clearly indicated where he wants to go.  This is a rich man's budget.  Its overall effect will be to make Ireland a less fair, more unequal place to live.  In short, the Minister has made the wrong choices.  In some ways he doubt-less thinks that he can do no wrong.  Perhaps he is right in terms of his short-term political interests but the bottom line is that in terms of things that really matter, he could have and should have done a great deal better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The nation awoke this morning to the news on RTÉ that the Minister has more money available to him than any finance Minister in the history of the State.  Having inherited this crock of gold from the Rainbow Government, the only question was how would the Minister choose to spend it.  Would he use his unexpected bounty to put more people back to work, to take the low paid out of the tax net entirely, to reduce the burden of tax on low to middle income earners, to seriously tackle poverty and transfer resources and the unemployment blackspots?  The independent group warned us that the return of a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government would mean payback time, but the question was for whom.  If one is in the high earning bracket and concerned with capital gains tax, it is not just payback time but kickback time.  This is a budget which provides £20 million for Croke Park and £7 million for the mentally handicapped.  No less than £315 million of the total tax package is frittered away in rate reductions to mollify the Progressive Democrats and its high earning supporters.</P>
      <P>A single earner on £10,000 per annum working as a barman near the Four Courts will gain £4.50 per week.  A single earner on £50,000 per annum working inside the Four Courts will gain £20 per week.  The married barman on £10,000 will gain £2.50 per week from this budget whereas the married lawyer on £50,000 per annum will gain just less than £22 per week.  The married earner on average industrial earnings with two children will gain less than £7 per week whereas the married earner on £50,000 per annum with two children will gain £22 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has defied the consensus painfully won among the different <Col N="144" /> interest groups and economic institutes that the greatest proportion of his bountiful inheritance should go towards dramatically increasing personal tax free allowances and towards widening the standard tax band.  A paltry increase of £250 or £500 for married couples is made in personal allowances and a derisory increase of £100 or £200 for married couples is made in the standard rate tax band.  This is a pathetic and cruel deception for those in the electorate earning roughly average industrial wages and who supported Fianna Fáil in the recent general election.  Meanwhile, the banks and finance houses make another killing on the dramatic reduction in corporation profits tax while the bank porter on £250 per week gets less than a fiver.</P>
    <P>I must admit that one distinct advantage in having to listen to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, read the official budget script this year is that we do not have to listen to the populist old guff he used to come out with in Opposition.  Any student wanting an insight into the Minister's homespun philosophy on the economy and society need look no further than his meanderings in response to the budgets of the past three years.  The Minister wandered the highways and byways of Irish political history, culture and economic policy without ever betraying what coherent approach, if any, he might pursue were he to replace Deputy Quinn as Minister for Finance.  Amidst all the blarney and little homilies and despite his professional status as an accountant, the Minister did not have the slightest compunction about misrepresenting the figures and it is a habit he has not lost as shown in the Book of Estimates.  Even the quality of his jokes was very uneven.  Reading these speeches now, it is impossible to make head or tail of them.  Since the Minister is an intelligent man, maybe this was deliberate on his part.</P>
    <P>The record shows that in Opposition Deputy McCreevy was in favour of generating a surplus to help pay back the national debt.  He warned it was &ldquo;an absolute mathematical certainty&rdquo; that EU transfers would diminish after 1999.  He said that the then Minister for Social Welfare &ldquo;would be far better off targeting a few key areas in social welfare rather than trying to spread the largesse&rdquo;. He falsely claimed the Labour Party and Democratic Left opposed social partnership.  He discounted the labour force survey as no more valid &ldquo;than an opinion poll&rdquo; in measuring unemployment. He said of the last budget: &ldquo;The last thing the economy needs at this time is the stimulus this budget will give it&rdquo;.  He ranted and raved about how the rainbow Government was overspending. He said if there was any slippage &ldquo;we would fall outside the EBR needs outlined in the Maastricht Treaty&rdquo;.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, growled an intervention, which I recorded, to underpin the Minister's financial punditry: &ldquo;It is irresponsible, we will fail the basic test&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister's first test came with the publication of the Book of Estimates where he was to add hugely to the supposed overspending of the <Col N="145" /> rainbow Government by contriving to drag more than £400 million from 1998 into 1997.  In other words, the same Deputy who in Opposition was so concerned about overspending in 1997, becomes the Minister who, by manipulating the figures so as to give himself room to manoeuvre in 1998, dramatically increases the 1997 outturn. No doubt with the passage of time the Minister hopes this decision will be attributed to the rainbow Government.  In none of his other predictions or prescriptions does the Minister fare any better when his performance today is compared to his ramblings in Opposition.  The man who wanted better targeting in Opposition targets the wealthy and treats the rest with a scattergun.  If there is any threat now to Maastricht, it does not come from the rainbow Government.  This is surely the first time a Minister has pushed out the parameters in order to slash capital gains tax, corporation profits tax and income tax for high earners only.</P>
    <P>The Celtic tiger economy is creating a permanent underclass.  Excluded from the benefits of economic growth, they are people with redundant, low or no skills.  Without more focused investment in training, they are largely unwanted for the kind of jobs created.  They are caught in the trap of intergenerational unemployment.  FÁS has forecast that 80 per cent of the 280,000 jobs likely to be created in the next six years to 2003 will go either to graduates or to people with qualifications such as those held by post leaving certificate students.  Therefore, only 20 per cent can go to people with no or low qualifications.</P>
    <P>If this Government had any regard to equity and justice, it would have addressed this phenomenon of endemic long-term unemployment.  First, the enormity of the challenge highlights why today's budget should have concentrated on tax reform to encourage, facilitate and make worthwhile people's movement from welfare to work. Second, the Government must face up to the new training challenge.  The package recently announced, and to which the Minister referred, addresses the skills shortage, but it is designed for educated young people and, to a lesser extent, to upgrade the skills of people already employed. There is nothing in this package for the mainly middle aged, male, unskilled and alienated long-term unemployed or for those in work who are likely to lose their jobs in the coming year.  Notwithstanding recent progress, there are 60,000 people on the live register who have not worked in more than three years and almost as many more who have been out of work for between one and three years.</P>
    <P>The training needs of these categories of people, many of whom are clustered in certain urban geographic areas, are distinctly different from the typical training provision.  The much improved community employment scheme is not a sufficient response to the training requirements of the long-term unemployed.  There is an urgent need for innovation and imagination in the provision of customised training for the long-term <Col N="146" /> unemployed.  I thoroughly reject this Government's complacent philosophy that a modest improvement in social welfare rates discharges the State's responsibility to the long-term unemployed. Regrettably, some of the funding channelled by the European Union into education and training is ineffective.  Much of the European funding goes into pilot projects and I have no objection to that, but we seem either unable or unwilling to have the results of successful pilot projects mainstreamed.</P>
    <P>I will quote one small example from my constituency called the Clondalkin Information Technology Initiative, or CITI.  It is a small project which set out to show it is possible to turn young people with low formal educational attainment but a proven aptitude for computer programming into qualified programmers getting well paid jobs in commercial electronics companies.  CITI is working, has achieved results and is turning out programmers who are getting jobs.  The life chances of the young people going through the project and graduating are being vastly improved.  The same can be said of a number of other such innovations, for example, Tramlines in Ballymun. These young people are going from unemployment to work, from no qualifications to being skilled and qualified and being set on career paths which, if they pursue them, will change their lives vastly for the better.  The trouble is that, as EU funding runs out &mdash; the CITI project regrettably wound up last week &mdash; there is no sign of the Government even in today's budget, main-streaming this type of successful pilot project, yet it is accepted throughout Europe that large scale unemployment can only be effectively tackled through investment in education and training.</P>
    <P>Further education, including technical education and training, second chance education, retraining and life long learning is critical to building a system and society that can cope with large scale ongoing structural and technical change as is happening in our economy. However, I fear that Government policy makers do not accept this side of the Celtic tiger.  They do not accept that cheek by jowl with all good indicators, which the Minister devoted so much time to, is endemic long-term unemployment concentrated in geographic clusters in urban Ireland where people are already trapped in intergenerational unemployment and there is no route out.</P>
    <P>If the phenomenon of poverty in society is not tackled now, when will it ever be tackled?  I have already recorded the conviction of my party that the most effective route out of poverty is a job. After that, it is incumbent on the Government to look after those who have no job or are unable to work or have retired.  The rainbow Government uniquely agreed in Partnership 2000 to allocate £525 million to social inclusion measures, £250 million of which was spent last year.  A large proportion of the remaining £275 million should have been spent on urgent social priorities and further pro-employment measures as well as bringing <Col N="147" /> social welfare rates to the levels recommended more than a decade ago by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The cost of achieving the CSW target rate is greatly reduced because of the unprecedented low inflation rate and it is for this reason the Combat Poverty Agency, among others, has drawn our attention to the fact that we will exacerbate the plight of the unemployed and social welfare recipients if we do not link social welfare increases to income rather than inflation.</P>
    <P>We are already in a low inflation environment and it is anticipated, in a single currency context, that will continue and if social welfare recipients are to have their bandwagon hitched to the star of inflation whilst every other individual participating in economic activity receives real increases in income then the lot of the marginalised and poor will worsen.  I accept a flat rate of increase improves the lot of those at the bottom.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were true to his own advice in Opposition to target a few key areas he would have continued the policy of recent years in significantly increasing child benefit.  It goes mainly to mothers and, despite its universality, is well targeted to larger, low income families.  Since it is universal and untaxed, it does not create or aggravate poverty or unemployment traps.  It was for that reason the previous Minister for Social Welfare concentrated on it.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's brief sojourn at the Department of Social Welfare, where he authored the infamous dirty dozen cuts, we have tried since to develop the social welfare system in the direction of encouraging people to re-enter the workforce.  I refer to measures, such as topping up the pay of low paid workers with families, allowing people keep their medical cards for three years after ceasing to be unemployed, enabling people to keep more of their social welfare benefits when they take up part-time or casual work and &ldquo;incentivising&rdquo; particular groups, such as lone parents who are under-represented in the workforce.</P>
    <P>We also dramatically increased the number of places on community employment and back to work allowance schemes.  I hoped for a continuation of this policy and specifically I had anticipated a further expansion of places on CE and BTWA schemes.  Instead there will be 5,000 extra places provided on the BTWA scheme.  That is grossly inadequate given the scale of the long-term unemployment problem.  However, I welcome the Minister honouring the commitment made by the previous Government to shift to calculating FIS on a net income basis.  PRSI and pension contributions were removed in last January's budget for calculation purposes.  I am glad to see the tax element taken out of FIS in this budget.</P>
    <P>On taxation, Democratic Left set out its stall in a document published before the last general election entitled <i>The Bottom Line . is what you take home.</i>  Our proposals were focused firmly on lower and middle income groups, the <Col N="148" /> people who for too long have been carrying a burden of income tax disproportionate to their income.  Specifically, we committed ourselves to dramatically increasing personal tax-free allowances so that people on very low incomes are freed of all taxes and other statutory deductions and middle income earners get significant relief; to widen the standard rate band so that no one on average industrial earnings pays tax at the higher rate and to reduce the standard rate of tax and increase tax free allowances much faster than the tax exemption limits to help the 123,000 people who pay tax at the 40 per cent marginal relief rate because they are just over the relevant tax exemption limit.</P>
    <P>We did not anticipate that, having published the detail of these proposals, they would ultimately get such broad based support from lobby groups and representative organisations of normally contrasting viewpoints.  It is most unusual for a Minister for Finance to be confronted with such a consensus embracing trade union and employer organisations, unemployment groups, Church organisations and commentators virtually across the board.  All advocate the reform of the tax system along the lines suggested in the Democratic Left paper.</P>
    <P>The thrust of tax reform has settled on a consensus in favour of targeting the reliefs on low to middle income earners.  In one fashion or another, all political parties, including Fianna Fáil one suspects but excluding the Progressive Democrats, support this approach.  Fianna Fáil appears not to support that approach for the majority who have been crippled by paying disproportionately for too long and it has bent the knee to the Progressive Democrats Party and concentrated the preponderant share of the money available in giving tax breaks to high earners.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Progressive Democrats Party, it is interesting to note a new development this year where ISME came out in favour of this approach. ISME is an organisation characterised by the SIPTU General Secretary on one occasion as the paramilitary wing of the Progressive Democrats Party and even it has deserted that position because its member companies have recognised the incentive involved in targeting tax relief on the low to middle income sectors so that it acts as an incentive for the low paid to return to the workforce.  It is a great pity the Minister failed to persuade the Tánaiste to similarly see the light. This consensus is underwritten by bodies such as the ESRI, TWIG, NESF and NESC.  We have not previously experienced such propitious economic and financial circumstances as have been inherited by this Minister and which provide him with such a golden opportunity to respond to this consensus.  No previous Finance Minister had available to him both the means and the consensus support on what the priorities should be.  To tackle the traps and incentives problems, to improve the position of everyone on low incomes, including pensioners, young people and very low <Col N="149" /> paid workers, and to remove major anomalies from our tax system, it is essential that the Minister significantly increase personal tax free allowances. Instead of grasping the opportunity, the Minister has done little on the key issue of personal allowances, as forecast in the Joint Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat statement on personal taxation issued on 4 June 1997.  In that statement the two parties clearly presaged what we have this evening, a major disappointment for the people who expected to benefit, and there is a preponderant number of taxpayers on average industrial earnings who expected to benefit from the concentration of resources on personal tax free allowances.  Instead it has been frittered away on the rate bands, and the main beneficiaries are those in the £50,000 salary bracket.  Whereas those on average industrial earnings will get an increase of less than £5 a week, those in the £50,000 bracket will get £22 or £23 a week.</P>
    <P>I will explain what the Minister might have achieved with the bounty available to him had he resolved to create incentives to work and overcome the long-standing structural difficulties between the tax and welfare systems.  If the Minister had opted to spend much more of the available money on increasing personal tax free allowances, by £1,000 per annum for a single person and by £2,000 for married couples, it would have cost £308 million next year and £525 million in a full year and 40,000 taxpayers would have been taken out of the tax net compared to the 15,000 the Minister claims will be taken out of the tax net but some of whom, because of the effect of fiscal drag and pay increases, will be back in it anyway.  No one on £90 per week, or £165 if married, would be liable to tax, 55,000 taxpayers would drop from the 48 per cent category to the 26 per cent band, everyone paying tax at 26 per cent would get an increase of £5 per week, everyone still paying tax at 48 per cent would get an increase of £9.23 per week, equivalent to a pay increase of over £20 a week at the moment, taxpayers dropping from 48 per cent to 25 per cent would get an additional £4.23 per week and unemployment and poverty traps would be dramatically diminished by a widening of the gap between income from welfare and income from employment.  It is that nexus the Minister does not seem to understand.  He did not understand it when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  He exacerbated it then.  Now, as Minister for Finance, he cannot grasp that interaction of the tax and welfare system.</P>
    <P>After significantly increasing personal allowances, my party's second priority would be to widen the standard rate band so that no one on average industrial earnings would have to pay tax at the higher rate.  At present a single worker with only the personal and PAYE allowances can reach the higher rate of tax at 48 per cent on earnings as low as £13,600 per annum, which is about £262 per week.  This is well below average industrial earnings which are just short of £15,000 per annum.  It is not acceptable that single <Col N="150" /> workers on this level of pay are subject to tax before PRSI and levies at 48 per cent.  Reducing that top rate from 48 per cent by one or two percentage points makes no real difference to the majority of PAYE workers.  They need to be kept out of the higher tax rate, and a combination of significant improvement in personal allowances and a widening of the standard tax band would achieve that.  Simply cutting the top rate of tax is only of real value to very high earners and of no value to those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Again, I draw the attention of the House to what would have been the effect of the Minister taking his courage in his hands and, in addition to the changes I have proposed on tax free allowances, widening the standard rate band by £1,000 for single persons and twice that for married couples.  This would have cost a further £79 million in 1998 or £134 million in a full year and would have meant another 55,000 taxpayers moving from paying at 48 per cent to 26 per cent, thus leaving only 31 per cent of taxpayers on the top rate, which is the objective.  It would also have produced a situation where no single person would be liable for the 48 per cent rate before earning £300 a week.  Also, the 5 per cent of taxpayers moving down to the 26 per cent rate would have gained a further £4.23 per week.</P>
    <P>In summary, the combined effect of doing what virtually everyone has agreed the Minister ought to have done with his inherited bounty would be to take 40,000 workers and pensioners on very low incomes out of the tax net and give them an increase of up to £5 per week.  Those still on 26 per cent would get £5 per week; those dropping from 48 per cent to 26 per cent would get £4.23 per week twice, once from the increased tax free allowances and again from the band widening; and the 31 per cent of taxpayers staying at 48 per cent would all get an increase of £9.23 per week.</P>
    <P>However, that would not have satisfied the Progressive Democrats, and the Progressive Democrats have to be mollified, whatever the cost.  The cost of these proposals that I have outlined, and which had broad support not just in this House but outside the House, would have been £380 million in 1998 and £642 million in a full year.  That is not beyond the Minister's reach. It is well within his grasp if we factor in even a quarter of the tax buoyancy experienced last year. The Department of Finance knows well that the predictions again will be a significant underestimation of the tax yield.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the Minister has chosen a different route, a route designed to featherbed the high earners in society, a route calculated to boost the profits of the banks and halve the yield from capital gains tax, a route which means no hope for the long-term unemployed and, not least, a route calculated to infuriate the hard-pressed PAYE sector whose expectations have been dashed and whose mood will not be improved by more of their hard-earned money being transferred to farmers whose contribution to the tax take continues to decline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties any Minister for Finance must face when drawing up a budget.  There are so many competing and conflicting demands that the task can be an unenviable one.  However, on this occasion the Minister for Finance is to be envied.  We are constantly told the coffers are awash, that we have never had it so good, that never has a Minister enjoyed such latitude on budget day.  In this budget the Minister had a real opportunity to assist the long-term stability of the economy and to ensure the increasing and unprecedented prosperity was divided in a socially equitable way.  It presented an opportunity to improve people's quality of life as opposed to their standard of living and to create an ecologically sustainable society.  Sadly, the budget is a lost opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger continues to roar but tigers are an endangered species and the Asian economies with which we are sometimes compared are suffering from a virulent form of feline flu which may yet have international consequences.  There are many dangers on the horizon for which we must prepare.  The milch cow of European Union funding will decrease to a major extent and our fellow Europeans will no longer tolerate our tax practices which they regard as opposed to fair competition.  In this situation, will inward investment continue to be as strong?  There are also problems associated with our involvement in EMU now that Britain will not participate in the medium term.  These problems have been conveniently glossed over by the establishment political parties but it is time we had a proper and frank debate on them.</P>
      <P>The budget fails to address these problems in a meaningful way.  It appears we have not learned the lessons of the past.  This is the 20th anniversary of the Fianna Fáil give-away budget which did such untold damage to the economy and society.  We see the same inclinations in this budget.  It is a crude, populist budget which lacks vision and panders to the comfortable voting class, vested interests and paymasters of the establishment parties.  It seeks to continue the myth that we have a successful economy.  For whom is the economy successful?  Is it successful for the 30 per cent of the population who continue to rely on social welfare payments?  Is it successful for the long-term unemployed who are surplus to our economic requirements?  Is it successful for the beleaguered PAYE worker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget's social welfare package seems on the surface to be very generous, yet when one looks closely at what social welfare recipients will receive, one sees they will be given eventual <Col N="152" /> increases in excess of inflation but below the rate of economic growth, meaning they will slip further behind in the prosperity stakes.  The additional expenditure for the elderly is to be particularly welcomed but even the Minister must admit that this sector of our society needs to be given much more before it can even begin to catch up with the wilder excesses of the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>Likewise, added expenditure on health is needed to deal with the problems created by years of under-investment.  The Minister made encouraging noises in relation to child care but it remains to be seen whether the money allocated will deal with the full scale of the problem in this area.  These problems are most acutely felt by voluntary groups who lack the resources to fully comply with the Child Care Act.  It seems that children are once again seen but not heard in the budget, with the idea of a child tax allowance thrown into the Minister's waste paper basket. Other carers have waited patiently for easier access to social welfare allowances and fairer treatment through the tax system, but what has the Minister offered them?  He has offered them a bus pass, and this when the wealthiest sports organisation, the GAA, has been given £20 million. This is a scandalous decision.  The Government could not care less about carers.</P>
    <P>Cynically cutting the top rate of income tax will, of course, be welcomed by the Progressive Democrats' wealthy but diminishing electoral base.  Reducing the top rate of tax by 2 per cent is socially inequitable.  Tax allowances have been adjusted only marginally in a way that does little to stop people from being taxed or from moving onto a higher rate of tax at too low a level of income.  While the increase in the exemption limit for the payment of PRSI is to be welcomed, a disproportionate amount of the tax wedge is still being borne by low and middle income earners. The Government cannot speak about tax equity or its concern about tax evasion when it has refused to ask the Moriarty tribunal to investigate the Ansbacher accounts.</P>
    <P>The Green Party welcomes the concept of a minimum tax liability.  However, the Minister's proposals on business taxation are reckless in the extreme and carry the risk of being rejected by the European Commission.  Sums based on this political calculation must be thrown open to doubt.  The moves in regard to inheritance tax are welcome but the Minister has failed to address the discrepancy which applies to long-term cohabiting couples.</P>
    <P>Real tax reform means changing the entire structure of the system, not just an annual updating and juggling of allowances, bands and rates. It means a determination to eliminate the insane traps and anomalies which exist, especially at the cross-roads between the tax and social welfare systems.  It means recognising that the world of work has changed radically and devising new and appropriate structures.  The case in favour of tax reform has been well made and is widely <Col N="153" /> accepted.  If there is not real tax reform now when will we get it?  The fate of hundreds of thousands of people has been on hold for years while we have been waiting for the resources to rectify the system.</P>
    <P>My party has long advocated the integration of the tax and social welfare systems through a basic income scheme.  It is a matter of shame for most of the parties represented in the House that they have to be dragged kicking towards the notion of a basic income for all.  As in the case of environmental matters, it has been left to the Green Party to promote this sane and sensible alternative. It is also shameful that research on a basic income and how to introduce it has been left to a body like CORI.  However, the work has been done and the blueprint for introducing a basic income scheme has been produced.  A basic income scheme is feasible and the resources to fund its introduction over three years are available. Why has such a scheme not been introduced?</P>
    <P>The Minister's environmental budget package is insulting in the extreme.  There are so many conflicting messages coming from the Minister on environmental issues as to defy belief.  He is willing to support alternative energy projects but has reduced vehicle registration tax and added to the growing traffic gridlock in towns and cities.  He has increased excise duty on leaded and super unleaded petrol but has ignored diesel which is the most carcinogenic fuel.  He has weakened the promise to consider fiscal means to bring about environmental improvements.  When it comes to environmental matters the Minister is either very cynical or extremely ignorant.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister not put forward measures to encourage a shift from private car use to public transport?  This move could be encouraged through the introduction of differential rates of vehicle registration tax, excise duty and VAT.  Such incentives are vital as cars contribute so much extra greenhouse gases.  Why are there no proposals to reduce or eliminate direct taxes on insulation for homes?  There is huge scope for job creation through improving environmental standards.</P>
    <P>I cannot support many of the measures in the budget as they accentuate the shift to the rich. The Government has failed to avail of this rare opportunity to frame a moral budget which benefits the weakest in the community.  There are already new budgetary constraints on the horizon which will make it difficult to introduce reforms in the future.  The budget is a lost opportunity for us all.</P>

    <P>Resolution No. 1 provides for an excise duty increase on tobacco products from midnight tonight which, when VAT is included will amount to 10p on a packet of 20 cigarettes, with <i>pro rata</i> increases on other tobacco products.  This increase is expected to yield £0.8 million in 1997 and £24.8 million in a full year and will increase the CPI by an estimated 0.16 per cent.  It is expected that the increase of 10 pence will reduce projected cigarette consumption by 0.9 per cent. Following the increase, consumption in 1998 is expected to be 1.4 per cent less than in 1997.</P>
    <P>Resolution No. 2 provides for excise duty increases on leaded and super unleaded petrol which, when VAT is included, amount to 4 pence on a litre or approximately 18 pence on a gallon with effect from midnight tonight.  It is estimated the increases in the rates will result in additional Exchequer yield this year, inclusive of VAT, of £0.88 million from leaded and £0.16 million for super unleaded.  These changes are expected to increase the CPI by 0.075 per cent.</P>

      <P>On unleaded it will be £12.6 million and on super unleaded it will be £2.89 per cent.</P>
      <P>Resolution No. 3 provides for reductions in the rate of vehicle registration tax on category A vehicles.  On cars with an engine of a cylinder capacity up to and including 2,500cc the rate of VRT is being reduced from 23.2 per cent to 22.5 per cent.  For cars with an engine of a cylinder capacity exceeding 2,500cc the rate of VRT is being reduced from 29.25 per cent to 28 per cent. Both rate reductions come into effect on 1 January 1998.</P>
      <P>Resolution No. 4 provides for an increase from 3.3 per cent to 3.6 per cent in the level of the flat rate farmers' refund with a similar change in the VAT rate on livestock, live greyhounds and the hire of horses.  The flat rate scheme is a simplified and practical method of applying value added tax to farming.  It compensates unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on their purchases of goods and services.  This will be achieved without applying the normal VAT rules on registration, record keeping and returns.</P>
      <P>The amount of the VAT rate is arrived at by calculating the VAT payable on agricultural inputs as a percentage of agriculture sales.  The Revenue Commissioners calculated, on the basis of macro economic data for the past three years, that a flat rate of 3.6 per cent is needed to achieve full compensation.  Traditionally, the VAT rate on livestock has been maintained at the same level as the flat rate addition.  This is administratively more convenient for farmers and their customers. These changes will take effect from 1 March next year and are worth £8 million to Irish farmers in a full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will not oppose the proposed increases in excise duty on tobacco products or the proposed increases on vehicle registration tax or value added tax, but we will oppose the increased hydrocarbon tax.  This substantial increase in tax on petrol will penalise those who have to travel a long distance to work. Because of the very expensive house prices in or near the main urban centres people have to go further afield to buy affordable houses which, in turn, means they have to travel substantial distances to and from work.  The cost of those journeys will be increased by this increase in petrol taxation.  The Taoiseach may argue that increasing petrol taxation is our contribution towards achieving the targets set at the Kyoto summit for a reduction in global warming.  He would argue that motor cars run on petrol are one of the biggest contributors to global warming.  On the other hand, it is fair to say that most people who use a car to go to work do not have a choice. Public transport is inadequate in newly developing areas.  CIÉ provides public transport in some of the older suburbs.  However, there are many new suburbs and towns around Dublin where there is virtually no public transport.  Many areas in my constituency with substantial populations <Col N="159" /> do not see a bus from one end of the week to the other, nor are they near a railway line. Anyone who wishes to get to work must use a car, be a consumer of petrol and pay this tax.</P>
      <P>This in one of the few taxes to be increased in the budget.  The Taoiseach and the Government have adopted an easy approach.  This is a convenient target.  When it comes to bridging the gap between revenue and expenditure every Minister for Finance is tempted to increase the excise duties on hydrocarbons.  The truth is that this increase falls disproportionately on those who make the effort to go to work.  Those who are not working do not need to spend the same amount of money on petrol.  Likewise, this increase falls disproportionately on those in rural and outer suburban areas.  This tax would be more readily accepted if a proper public transport network existed, but that is not the case.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach enlighten the House as to what percentage of the £361.36 cost of 1,000 litres of hydrocarbon light oil is represented by the duty?  What proportion of the retail price is tax and what proportion is the actual price of the product?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite my inclination to smoke tobacco occasionally, the Labour Party will not be voting against the excise increase on tobacco, the VRT or farmers' VAT provisions.  After the Taoiseach's explanation, I am confused about farmers' VAT.  It will contribute an additional £8 million, approximately, to the farming community and, therefore, it is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I would like some explanation as to why particular hydrocarbons were selected for additional taxation.  Why was diesel excluded?  Twenty pence per gallon is a hefty increase, one of the biggest in taxation on fuel in any budget.  With the amount of travelling required by those working, this increase will have a knock on effect throughout the economy.  The Government should look at this again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach tell me if I have got the figures right?  I believe he said that the excise on leaded petrol will generate approximately £12.6 million.  The excise on super unleaded will yield £2.89 million, a total of £13.5 million.  This seems a relatively small amount for an increase of 18p per gallon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the thinking behind this increase?  If the excise increase applies only to leaded and super un-leaded petrol, I presume there is no increase on ordinary unleaded.  The thinking may be to avoid increasing the tax on the least polluting hydrocarbon.  If this is so, is the Taoiseach aware that recent research in the UK and elsewhere casts doubt on this assumption? <Col N="160" /> Some research indicates that unleaded petrol may not be as environmentally friendly as we thought. If this is the case, why is the Taoiseach proposing that leaded and super unleaded be singled out for such dramatic increases?  If it is not for environmental reasons, is it purely for economic, financial or fiscal reasons?  Has any recent research been done to indicate that unleaded petrol is not the saviour we thought it to be?  I do not know if this is correct but were any such reports considered before this proposal was put forward?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has adopted a reasonable approach on the excise increases. However, coming from a Border county, I agree with his decision to oppose the steep increase in the price of petrol.  It is not so many years since petrol stations were closing down along the Border and it was impossible to find a petrol station in any Border town.  That imbalance has been somewhat redressed in recent years.  It is great to see petrol stations open in Dundalk, Lifford, Ballyshannon, Bundoran and other Border towns in Cavan and Monaghan.  I fret to think of what the effect of this measure will be on those who have invested large amounts of money in recent years in Border counties, creating jobs and attracting customers from Northern Ireland.  Has this been taken into consideration before this increase was announced?  It is a steep increase, almost 20p when everything is taken into consideration.  I do not know when such an increase was imposed before.  This is a tax on people living in rural areas.</P>
      <P>I come from a part of the country where CIE is non-existent.  Its services do not go beyond Donegal town or Letterkenny.  Deputy Blaney is aware that CIÉ transport does not go near Fanad, Gweedore, the Rosses or Cloughaneely.  People in those areas depend on privately run transport if they do not have cars.  They must make arrangements to go to hospital, for example, as people are dependent on a few entrepreneurs. Transport in rural Ireland is necessary.  One cannot shop or go to a service or mass without transport, and this provision will place a significant burden on people in rural areas.  I cannot support the measure and hope that its implications have been considered.  I will not need a whip to oppose it.</P>

      <P>Increased transport costs will have an immediate detrimental effect on manufacturing and service industries as well as the individual road user.  Resolution No. 2, which relates to hydrocarbons, is outrageous.  Deputy McGinley has spoken of the effect of this proposal on Border county business, as will I. This is particularly important now we are coming up to Christmas, as existing prices act as an additional incentive to shoppers from the North to bring their much valued custom to Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and Louth.  What of people in those counties who have invested in their forecourts and service stations?  What does <Col N="161" /> this measure offer them?  There is a projected increase for the Government coffers of £15.5 million, but all Members realise that a greater cost will be borne particularly by people in the Border counties, who are most distant from the seat of power.  This measure sums up the budget.  It has failed to meet normal and reasonable expectations, and it is consequently a great disappointment to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the increased duty on tobacco products as my party leader did. However, this will lead to a substantial increase in the price of tobacco products and could lead to a lucrative smuggling trade.  This happened in the past when consumer products were more expensive here than in the North.  The Taoiseach must refer to that incentive for increased cigarette smuggling, as such cigarettes are already available on the streets of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Deputy John Bruton that the tax on hydrocarbons is another blow to rural Ireland.  Whatever meagre benefits will derive from the increase in the price of petrol or diesel will be diluted, as one of the greatest disincentives to living in rural Ireland is the cost of transport. We have bad roads, and now we have what Deputy Stagg described as a historic increase in the price of a gallon of petrol.  The Taoiseach should refer to this in his reply.</P>
      <P>The decrease in VRT is very welcome, but the scrappage scheme has been discontinued.  The motor industry lobbied strongly for it to be continued, as it was very successful and led to large numbers of jobs in that industry as well as high returns in revenue.  This measure will go some way to alleviate the effects of losing that scheme, but there will probably be a fall in the number of new cars purchased next year.</P>

      <P>The average price of 20 cigarettes is now more than £3.  Although I support the increase in the excise duty on tobacco, surveys show there is a large amount of smoking among unemployed and low income families.

      <P>I kick up holy smoke.  The increase in hydrocarbon fuel prices concerns me. That is very serious for a rural area.  In an isolated area one depends on a car for transport, as there is a lack of transport in such areas.  Concessionary fares and travel passes are no use to many people in rural areas.</P>
      <P>An increase in hydrocarbon fuel prices has a knock on effect for a huge array of industries from the service to the manufacturing sectors. That means an increase in the price of the product. Industries will not take reduced profits, they increase prices which feeds its way into inflation. It will have a knock on effect in terms of the projections being made.  Given that we are in an unusual position, what amount will be taken between tonight and 31 December due to this increase?</P>
      <P>The VAT flat rate addition for farmers is being increased from 1 March 1998.  I may be one of the few who understands the concept since I worked with farmers.  I welcome it.  It is valued at £5.3 million in 1998 and £8 million in a full year.  It compensates farmers who are not registered for VAT on their inputs.  If registered they would be able to recoup the tax on the inputs and likewise on the sale of livestock.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed there are only 14 lines in the Budget Statement addressing agriculture.  The Government has reneged on young farmers. Where is the money for the recommencement of the installation aid scheme which had been suspended? Some £6 million is all it would cost in a full year.</P>

      <P>For 16 years I have come here on budget night.  I confess I am totally cynical about any help being given to the Border region by any party or people who live close to me and from whom I expected it.  The Border area, particularly County Louth, has been consigned to a modern day hell or Connacht and nobody gives a fiddler's curse.  The current Taoiseach addressed the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, as follows according to the Official Report at column 999 on 22 January 1997:</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach justify the increases of 11.5p for a gallon of. petrol.?  They filter through to the public and are a charge on transport. Cars are no longer a luxury for the vast majority of people.  The increases are penal and are against the spirit of removing the burden of taxation.  They may appear lower when expressed in terms of litres, but this cannot disguise the size of the increases in terms of gallons, especially when the high powered cars of today use so much petrol.</P>
      <P>My colleagues from the Border areas will express their views on this issue.  The Government never appears to listen to anything regarding Border areas, indeed it does not have any Deputies from the region.</P>
      <P>Another field marshal in the soldiers of destiny, Deputy Dermot Ahern, castigated my colleague Deputy Donal Carey and the Government for appointing him</P>
      <P>a token Minister of State with responsibility for the Border areas because the Government, in appointing Ministers and Ministers of State, decided not to appoint anyone from the Border region.  What chance is there for Border areas as far as input at the Cabinet table is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I absolve Deputy Carey but not Deputy Ahern. He had his feet under the Cabinet table.  What <Col N="164" /> went wrong?  He certainly has not done anything for the Border area.  These two quotations should be included in a classic hall of fame for political nonsense.  Will the Taoiseach tonight define that illogical statement he made 11 months ago?  If he felt that way at that time why did he allow the price of petrol to increase today by 20p.  There would be more commonsense remarks in a gas-works than here.  The reality is that this is a talking Chamber and has no effect.</P>
    <P>The Border area has been decimated for 20 years while the Ulster troubles lasted and nobody gave a tinker's damn.  One has to live in the Border area to realise that.  To watch the cars going across the Border at the weekend to Newry leads me to despair.  How many more cars will go over the Border between now and Christmas, exporting their money to England?  It is a shame the Government is insensitive to the Border region.  It has a token Minister, a Minister which the local Argus newspaper said acted as a kind of John the Baptist &mdash; the man who went before &mdash; and who promised a seventh heaven for Dundalk and County Louth when Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, got the keys of the kingdom.  He has the keys for the past six months and there has been no joy for the Border area.  The Tánaiste has announced jobs all over the place but none for County Louth.  Tonight the Government has copperfastened its neglect of the Border area by omitting County Louth from the seaside resorts initiative.  It has totally ignored a county that is palpably in need of help.  The Fine Gael consortium Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to register my annual protest against all parties who have failed to identify the need for remedial help for the Border area and who continually hone in on the most vulnerable area of petrol taxation.  Tomorrow the price of petrol will be significantly higher in the South than in the North.  This will result in the exportation of hundreds of thousands of pounds to the British economy between now and Christmas.  When people cross the Border to shop they do not just buy petrol, they also buy drink, the Sunday joint and electrical goods.  The ladies may also have their hair done.  I hope before I leave this Assembly there will be recognition by some party of the needs of County Louth and the other Border counties.</P>

It is mainly poor people who own cars which run on leaded petrol.  Following the removal of public services they have to travel to towns and villages to conduct their business.  The Government is responsible for the closure of post offices.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, when Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, closed one post office per <Col N="166" /> week.

The same can be said about the people of Donegal who are represented by Deputy Blaney.  The price of petrol in these two constituencies is 10 per cent higher than in Dublin and the Taoiseach wants to increase it by a further 10 per cent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure Deputy Healy-Rae will be concerned as he too drives a Mercedes.  I agree with Deputy Carey that, whereas this might be seen to be dealing with an ecological problem, car owners living in rural areas use this type of petrol, the price of which is being increased to such a spectacular extent.  I can remember that, whenever twopence or threepence was imposed on a gallon of petrol, it led almost to a revolution.</P>
      <P>I will deal now with farmers' flat rate of VAT, with a corresponding increase in the livestock rate.  My colleague, Deputy Penrose, charged with responsibility in this area has calculated, as has the Taoiseach, that there will be benefit-in-kind for farmers.  Will the Taoiseach say what will be the VAT implications in the case of animals being exported, particularly within the bloodstock industry, for example, horses suitable for jumping, and the greyhound industry?  Since we have already established a good trade overseas the implications of penalising the export of such animals could be significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the reduction in VRT will not compensate for the cessation of the motor scrappage scheme and will not go any way towards meeting the submissions of the motor industry.  It will affect not merely the industry but its many employees.  There is also the matter of its <Col N="168" /> implications in Border regions and for the tourist industry overall, both of which will suffer.</P>
    <P>It is very easy and fashionable to refer to the current popularity of taxing cigarettes and tobacco but will the Taoiseach give consideration to the implications for that industry which also employs quite a number of people?  Will he not agree that, while this extra imposition can be justified from a health point of view, he should have regard to its consequences on employees within the industry?  Can some method not be devised of assisting the industry to change its operational methodology so that it can continue to employ the same number of people, bearing in mind that earlier attempts to curb cigarette smoking failed? My present concern is that, since many such employees will have no possibility of alternative employment, they will probably become redundant on account of these penal taxes.  Will the Government not do something, as in the case of Croke Park which, from the point of view of GAA followers, was imaginative?</P>

      <P>No doubt when I will have been a Member of the House for 16 years I may be of the same view.  Nonetheless, an increase of 20p on a gallon of petrol is a huge one which will have devastating effects on Border regions.  All of us who represent rural areas, especially Border regions, have been aware over many years that one of the major attractions for people living south of the Border was to travel North for their petrol whereas over the past three to four years that worked in reverse, proving to be of immeasurable benefit south of the Border.  There will be a difference of approximately 10p or 12p in the price of a gallon of petrol between the two regions when no doubt people will again travel North to shop, with a consequent devastating effect on the service industry.</P>
      <P>As regards public transport, which we must also consider, the only CIE bus I have seen in County Leitrim over the past 20 years is one, without wheels, housed in a museum, going nowhere.

      <P>The issues of increased excise duties on cigarettes and petrol, reduction in VRT on cars and increasing farmers' flat rate of VAT from 3.3 per cent to 3.6 per cent should be debated within the context of their net effect. I am not a smoker and have very little sympathy for those who smoke and must pay for their cigarettes. Nonetheless, there is no evidence that increasing their price necessarily leads to a reduction in their usage.  If their increased price is being promoted as a health preventive measure, I have yet to see evidence that is the case.  I would <Col N="170" /> be more than happy to support an increase in the price in cigarettes if the additional moneys yielded were directed to increasing available funds for preventive medicine, particularly those allocated to hospitals where people are literally dying awaiting cardiac surgery.  A relative of mine died just two weeks ago having awaited triple heart by-pass surgery for 18 months.</P>
      <P>While this knock-about debate may be fine, there are serious issues at stake in relation to the smoking of cigarettes and our environment generally. When talking about the protection of jobs within the tobacco industry, we should ask ourselves: what are we protecting; alternatively, should we not be examining some method of replacing those industries rather than encouraging their continuation?  I know there are at present some 100 people bringing court cases against tobacco companies here because of the adverse effects of cigarette smoking.  While familiar with the argument that adults smoke of their free will and, therefore, should suffer the consequences, we must also remember that their adverse consequences result in massive bills for public health services in addition to innumerable deaths resulting from lung, stomach, lip and throat cancer.</P>
      <P>The money raised through the price increase on cigarettes should be designated to improve the availability of cardiac surgery for those waiting for it as a result of smoking cigarettes.  We should use it to find alternative industries to the tobacco industry. At a time when money is flowing we should use this income in a way that would be beneficial to society.  Regardless of criticism of people's choice to smoke cigarettes, we should not have a situation where people are dying while waiting for cardiac surgery.  It is criminal and obscene that this is happening in 1997.</P>
      <P>There are many arguments about the effect on the Border counties in the context of petrol prices and I have no doubt there is some validity in those arguments as was the case last year.  Arguments are also put forward based on the experience of people in rural areas, although it is also an issue for urban areas, particularly larger urban areas where people have to travel long distances and do not have an adequate public transport service available to them.  I regret that Luas is being delayed.</P>

      <P>I regret the manner in which Luas is being delayed but I do not propose to examine that issue tonight.  What is the rationale behind increasing leaded and super unleaded petrol?  I know super unleaded is as environmentally damaging as leaded and I am not arguing that there should not be a very large disparity between the prices of these types of petrol.  What <Col N="171" /> will be the impact of increasing the price of leaded and super unleaded petrol?  Most of those with cars which can use only leaded petrol cannot afford to change their car to an unleaded version. This comes at a time when the scrappage scheme has been abandoned.  Unless we provide those who have to buy leaded petrol with a realistic alternative to allow them to buy unleaded, we are only penalising them.  It is a curious irony that as the budget increases the price of leaded petrol, we are returning £1,000 to those on £50,000 per year who can afford to buy the cheaper petrol while we are giving £100 per year to those who cannot afford to do so.  These are questions which should be examined.  If this is being promoted as a way of improving the environment and cleaning the air, the original intention of having a difference in price between unleaded and leaded petrol, then we have to enable people to choose cars which use unleaded petrol.  Otherwise we are merely collecting more revenue.</P>
      <P>Regarding VRT, we are forgoing £13 million on the purchase of new cars &mdash; perhaps it also applies to imported secondhand cars.  If related to new cars then it could be argued that it would have some of the effect I was arguing for in relation to giving people the option of buying a new car which used unleaded petrol.  However, it seems odd to be assisting the import of second-hand cars which may or may not be capable of using unleaded petrol.</P>
      <P>I attended the presentation of SIMI, the representative body of motor car dealers.  It is a professional group which made a very professional case.  However, I was not convinced by the argument that the sales of motor cars would be affected if this cut in VRT was not applied.  We seem to be handing back money in circumstances where we have not thought through the wider impact apart from the desire of the State to take in as much revenue as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the note I received on the budget the VAT refund to unregistered farmers will cost £8 million in a full year.  This is an issue I have raised on numerous occasions during my 15 years in the House.  I fail to understand why we consistently use this device to enable farmers to reclaim money when there is no evidence that they paid VAT.  Refunds of £8 million at 3.6 per cent would mean a turnover of £200 million.  Why are a number of farmers &mdash; perhaps the Taoiseach could explain how many &mdash; who are not registered availing of this facility?  Why are they not registering for VAT like every other normal business, applying the VAT to what they sell and claiming it from the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners?  It seems we are refunding £8 million on purchases of £200 million per annum, which is an extraordinarily high figure.  Eight million pound is only the increase, not the total amount.  Some years ago refunds amounted to £70 million and it is probably far in excess of £100 at present.  How much is being refunded under this scheme and on what amount of purchases is it <Col N="172" /> being made?  How many farmers are not registered for VAT and what proportion are they of the total number of farmers?</P>
    <P>In general, the contribution of farmers to tax revenue is exceptionally low, amounting to about 23 per cent of the average amount paid by the PAYE sector.  I have no wish to attack farmers in general and I know there are farmers whose income is not high enough to pay tax.  However, massive amounts of money &mdash; up to £1,500 million in the last year &mdash; comes from the EU for Irish farmers.  The recent household survey indicated that the average income for farmers is higher than that for householders in urban areas; that they have newer and more expensive cars and bigger and more expensive houses.  I am not simply saying this: it is based on facts found by agents of the State when examining the household income of various categories.  It boggles the mind that we are handing back in excess of £100 million in VAT refunds to people who are not registered for VAT.  On the basis of a 3.6 per cent refund that must run in excess of £300 million to £400 million of purchases.  That seems an extraordinary figure and I fail to understand why we continue with this system and that we do not insist that the people doing this should charge and reclaim VAT in the normal way.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  I welcome the increase in the price of cigarettes.  I inhale myself but I do not have any objection to this increase. Smoking is a bad habit and if this increase helps people to give it up, it will be worthwhile.  I do not believe the increase will affect jobs; it did not do so to any great extent in the past.</P>
      <P>On the increase in petrol prices, there is no increase in the price of unleaded petrol or diesel which is the main fuel used here.  The Deputies opposite who made a great deal of noise about the increase in the price of super unleaded petrol drive Porches, Mazarattis and other big cars. There are not too many of those in my part of the country so it will not have any great effect.</P>

      <P>A number of the Deputies opposite would be in that league.  With the cessation of the scrappage scheme the reduction in VRT is welcome as it will help in the sale of new and second-hand cars.</P>
      <P>Farmers are entitled to the increase in VAT refunds.  With the reduction in milk, grain and beef prices the majority of farmers are finding it difficult to make ends meet.</P>

      <P>On the question of farmers registering for VAT, it is to the benefit of the State that they do not.  If every farmer registered for VAT, most of them would be in a net refund position.  The reason many farmers do not register is because they do not want to pay the additional cost of employing an accountant or bookkeeper to do the work for them.  I welcome the Minister's decision to increase the VAT refund which will help many farmers with a milk quota worth £30,000 or less.  They need this additional benefit given by the Minister in the budget.</P>

      <P>I will be brief because I am very upset.  A scud missile landed on the people of the west today, the increase in the price of petrol.

      <P>I can tell the Minister about that. There was a great deal of talk about Knock Airport but it was former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, who provided the money.  I do not want to talk about Knock Airport but about the people in Belmullet and in Louisburg who do not have any public transport.  If people living in north Mayo have to travel to hospital, they do not have the services of Iarnród Éireann.  They have to provide their own transport.  A recent report indicated that there is a high rate of poverty in Mayo and Donegal.  Some of the people living in these areas drive cars that are 13, 14 and 15 years old because they cannot afford new vehicles, yet the Government will take from them the small increases it has given in social welfare by increasing the price of petrol.  Some of these people have to travel 75 miles to Castlebar, or 100 miles to Galway, to see a doctor or attend a hospital, but the Dublin 4 brigade do not understand that.</P>

It fired a scud missile on the west by increasing the price of petrol by 20p per gallon.  That is a disgrace and the Taoiseach should examine it again because it is wrong to do this to the people living in the west.</P>
      <P>All the interest groups lobbied various public representatives from both Government and Opposition parties, but the only thing the people in the west like is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: This is not supposed to be a circus but an assembly of the elected representatives of our people who tonight are supposed to be discussing the effects of the serious measures proposed.  I am interested but not surprised that apparently the conservative parties are in agreement tonight to lash an extra 10p onto the price of a packet of cigarettes.  They do not represent poor people.  Under the utterly fraudulent guise of assisting public health in some way, this is an extra tax on poor people.  Cigarettes are a despicable and dangerous habit but an extremely addictive one.  Unfortunately, because of the pressures of life it is an addiction to which many people from working class communities resort as one of the consolations they can afford.  By adding that enormous sum onto the price of a packet of cigarettes the Government is imposing an extra tax which will hit those people hardest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Ahern, could not resist sending out his press statement on the benefits of the budget.  He boasts that a single person on long-term unemployment will now have £70.50 per week and that a couple on long-term unemployment assistance will get an increase of £4.20 <Col N="176" /> per week.  If they are unfortunately addicted to cigarettes, at a stroke, at least £2, if not more of that increase per week, will be immediately taken back.  The increase in the price of a packet of cigarettes is not an incentive to stop smoking.  That is a fraudulent claim and nobody believes it.  If the Government or successive Governments were interested in coping with cigarette addiction they would not sit on their hands while cigarettes are advertised and millions of pounds are spent annually on advertising them.  Let us expose this increase for what it is.</P>
    <P>In regard to petrol many parallel arguments apply.  Who have cars that are not top of the range and registered in 1997?  Poor people and low income workers.  This increase is an attack on them and an excuse for not doing something effective about public transport, which would be the appropriate way to cut down on environmental pollution.  I am mesmerised that under the heading Value-added Tax under Financial Resolution No. 4 there is a reference to VAT on horses for hire increasing from 3.3 per cent to 3.6 per cent.  I do not know what is meant by that, but there is a distinct failure to close one of the most glaring and scandalous loopholes in taxation. Millionaire stud farmers from the plains of Kildare and other plains earning up to £1 million a year from top class stallions will not pay an extra penny in taxation on the fees they charge. Yet, the unfortunate people addicted to nicotine, on low income or in receipt of social welfare have been hit over the head, and that is a disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked me about the incidence of duty and VAT per litre of motor fuel.  Value added tax on leaded petrol is 67.27p, on unleaded petrol it is 64.77p, on super unleaded it is 66.16p and on auto diesel it is 58.01p.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have time to deal with everything, but regarding the arguments on this, there has not been any increase in the price of unleaded petrol.  I listened carefully to the pleas made by Deputies about aspects of this.  They should join those of us who care about our health, that of our constituents and the environmental and health aspects of this issue.  I will not give a lecture on the ozone layer, but cars up to ten years old can be easily converted to take unleaded petrol.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the large sales of cars, particularly in County Meath, there are hardly any old cars left.  Leaded petrol because of its lead content and super unleaded petrol because of its benzene content are an environmental and health hazard.  The lead content of petrol has contributed greatly to increased levels of lead in the atmosphere and it is a health hazard, particularly <Col N="177" /> in regard to childhood development.  That has been proved scientifically.  There are no known safe levels of benzene and it is a recognised carcinogen. Deputies will remember when I introduced legislation on health safety in this House many years ago all those matters were debated and one of the issues on which everybody argued was that we should run a campaign to highlight the advantages of unleaded petrol over other grades of petrol.  That is what successive Governments have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten months ago the Taoiseach said it was too expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the right thing to do.  Unleaded petrol accounts for about 68 per cent of total petrol consumption.  It is anticipated this will increase to approximately 73 per cent in 1998, which will represent a 5 per cent increase and, therefore, we are making a real input.  Tax on unleaded petrol is currently approximately 4p per litre of which 3.5 per cent is excise duty.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the flat rate scheme for farmers, farmers' outputs in terms of food is generally zero rated while many of their inputs are taxed at the standard rate.  Thus, under the normal VAT system most farmers who are registered would be in a permanent repayment position.  There are approximately 100,000 farmers of which approximately 2,000 are registered.  This system has worked effectively for a long time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case for all types of reasons and it also benefits the State in many respects.  We are giving back £8 million to farmers and I am horrified the Deputy did not support us because all the Meath farmers will be delighted with that measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding petrol, the policy of applying a high tax rate to leaded petrol is in keeping with a programme that has been set out but time does not permit me to go through the details of it.  The European Commission decided five years ago to <Col N="178" /> initiate a programme to provide a solid technical foundation upon which to base legislative proposals. Deputy De Rossa asked if there was such a programme.  There is currently a draft Council directive relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuel before the European Parliament which provides for phasing out leaded petrol by the year 2000.</P>

    <P>(2) THAT this Resolution shall have effect as on and from the 3rd day of December, 1997.</P>
    <P>(3) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of <Col N="189" /> the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>The first resolution gives effect to the announcement in the Budget Statement that, as and from tonight, the cumulative amount which a company or a group of associated companies can raise under the BES is being reduced from £1 million to £250,000.  Experience with the BES over the years has shown that the smaller investments give the best returns.  A recent review of the BES by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment revealed that a relatively small number of large projects continue to attract most of the BES money.  For example, since its inception, approximately 80 per cent of all BES approvals were for amounts under £200,000 and accounted for 22 per cent of the total raised under the scheme.  On the other hand, 12 per cent of approvals were for amounts of £500,000 or over and accounted for 62 per cent of the total invested.</P>
    <P>The main conclusions of the review were that, first, the BES has strengthened the balance sheets of a significant number of small companies in the early stage of their life cycle.  Second, investments of over £250,000, however, tend to be in the nature of five year loan finance rather than genuine equity capital to smaller firms, which is what the BES is about.  The reduction in the amount a company can raise under the scheme will, therefore, help re-focus it back to its original intention which was to assist smaller companies to raise long-term equity capital as opposed to expensive loan capital which they could not otherwise raise because of the risks involved for investors.</P>
    <P>As with previous restrictions to the BES, transitional provisions are being put in place to cater for BES projects which were well advanced before today.  The &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; cases will be able to continue with their plans to raise funds under the previous limit of £1 million, provided that they comply with all existing rules of the scheme, as well as those governing the transitional arrangements set out in the Financial Resolution.</P>
    <P>With regard to Financial Resolution No. 6, over recent years the tax system has been used increasingly through various urban renewal schemes to encourage investment in areas considered in need of investment and renewal.  By and large the schemes which offer very generous tax incentives have, though costly, been successful in attracting investment to these areas.  Urban renewal schemes, for instance, have transformed rundown areas of our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, however, to maintain a balance between the use of the tax system as an instrument of investment policy and the use of various tax incentive schemes by high net worth individuals to shelter excessive amounts of income against tax.  For some time, highly tax efficient schemes have been marketed and aimed at high net worth individuals encouraging the investment of larger sums in property at little or no risk to the investor and at maximum cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> The purpose of the resolution is to restrict capital allowances available to individual passive investors on industrial and commercial buildings, including hotels.  Subject to transitional provisions the restrictions will generally apply to expenditure incurred on or after budget day on such buildings including those in tax designated areas.</P>
    <P>The restrictions are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) a ceiling of £25,000 per year is being introduced on the amount of capital allowances which an individual passive investor can claim against employment and other non rental income in respect of expenditure incurred on buildings other than hotels.  This limit is the same as that in place already for individual investors in the case of the BES and film relief;</P>
    <P>(b) in the case of hotels no capital allowances may be claimed by an individual passive investor against employment and other non rental income except for certain hotels in particular counties;</P>
    <P>(c) the balance of the capital allowances not offset against the passive investor's employment and non rental income can be offset against the individual's Irish rental income from all sources either in year one or in future years.</P>
    <P>The restrictions will, however, not affect investments made by an individual owner operator of a business or one actively engaged in the operation and management of a business for which the building is used, or investments made by individuals, including a passive investor, in three star or better hotels in counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo, other than in seaside resorts in those counties, or investments made by companies, including financial institutions, in any of the developments in question.</P>
    <P>The measures are essentially aimed at individuals who are lessors of industrial buildings, hotels and all types of commercial premises, including multi-storey car parks, which attract capital allowances whether generally or under various tax incentive schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to tease out both resolutions. In regard to Financial Resolution No. 5 the Taoiseach stated flatly that the rate of return on investments of less than £250,000 in a given company through the BES is higher than that on larger investments.  How, over what period and by whom is it measured and will he give a statistical statement with examples to bear out this assertion?  It is one that on the face of it is not necessarily credible.  I am not questioning the integrity of the people who prepared the report a copy of which I do not have.  Is it a published report and who recommended this restriction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on the evolution of the BES. I was responsible as Minister for Industry and Commerce for persuading the Minister for Finance to introduce the scheme and then I was <Col N="191" /> responsible as Minister for Finance for refining it.  The worst day's work ever done as far as tax incentives for industrial development is concerned, was done by my successor as Minister for Finance who expanded the scheme to include property in 1987 and 1988.  It was a terrible thing to do because it was obvious that people who had assets backing their investments were not in need of a tax incentive.  One was needed for people putting money into projects that were inherently risky where the asset underlying the project was the knowledge of those working and promoting it and not the physical asset.  Unfortunately, in 1987 the mistake was made of extending the BES to eventually include apartments that were supposedly for tourist occupation and which were asset backed.</P>
    <P>A further refinement has been introduced into the scheme which I regard as very objectionable. One of the canons of taxation is that there should be certainty in regard to the instance of taxation and this has been identified by Dalton and others who have written on the topic.  There is no certainty about the instance of this tax relief because the resolution sets out a system whereby one quango or another has to be applied to decide whether one qualifies for a tax incentive.</P>
    <P>There is no way of knowing whether one qualifies for it as one must apply to a group of people sitting around a table who will decide on the basis of some consultant's report, for which a great deal of money has been paid to prepare, whether one qualifies.  I am not questioning the integrity of these people but the idea that one does not know what one's tax position will be on the basis of the law as published and must rely on a third party sitting in judgment on one's case is wrong. They do not have to account for the basis of their decision.  The county enterprise board or industrial development agency defined in the resolution can simply say the M. D. Higgins project is in and the Collins project is out as they do not have to explain why one is in and the other is out.  That does not apply in regard to whether one qualifies for a personal tax allowance or any other tax allowances.</P>
    <P>An aberration in this tax allowance is that it is not certain, it depends on an administrative decision.  It is wrong that eligibility for a tax concession should depend on such a decision.  This is not the only case to which it applies but where an administrative decision must be interposed to decide whether an individual qualifies for a tax concession that is an admission of failure by the drafters of tax policy.  It should be possible to devise an abstract principle of law that can be stated in words or, if necessary, in a mathematical formula, or in some other way, on the basis of which people could decide whether they are eligible.  If they do not agree with the tax inspector's decision they should have the right to appeal to somebody else, for example, an appeals commissioner.  If eligibility for a tax concession is decided arbitrarily <Col N="192" /> by an agency, albeit within the compass of the rules, and distinctions at the margin can be made by that agency without recourse to the rules, that undermines the whole appeals procedure and the transparency of the tax code, and that is wrong.</P>
    <P>I am not saying the present Minister for Finance is the first Minister for Finance to have recourse to this procedure.  This resolution simply reproduces and slightly modifies something that was already in our law.  It is a profoundly wrong principle of tax policy in that, in the absence of certainty of interpretation as to eligibility for a particular tax concession, an administrative decision making process is imposed between the citizen and the law.  Basically the citizen should have direct access to the law on the basis of what he reads on a piece of paper.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that a certifying agency, a county enterprise board or, above all, a Minister will be deciding whether a person gets a tax concession. That is placing a Minister in an invidious position. Ministers should not have to decide whether someone qualifies for a tax concession.  We have established an independent Office of the Revenue Commissioners which is separate from the Department of Finance in order that Ministers will not have to make decisions about individual taxpayers, but it appears from paragraph 5(b)(iv) of this resolution that a Minister will certify in some cases.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>Every tax incentive for one party is, by definition, a tax disincentive for somebody else.  Every tax incentive for development in one part of a town is, by definition, a tax disincentive for development in another part of the town not covered by the incentive.  Any tax incentive for, say, deer farming, that is not available for ostrich farming is a disincentive to ostrich farming because it influences the decision on the best way of allocating resources.  That is why it behoves the Minister to give a clear explanation as to why there should be a tax code affecting investment in hotels in Kingscourt and not in Kilmainham Wood, on either side of the Cavan-Meath border.</P>
    <P>There are other examples.  The Minister from Westmeath is absent at the moment, but one can get a tax concession for a hotel on one side of the Shannon in Athlone and not for one on the Westmeath bank of the river.  One can get a tax concession for a hotel where the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, originated, but not for a hotel where he now lives.  In other words, one can get a tax concession for a hotel in Leitrim but not for a hotel in Longford.  What is it about Longford that there is no concession to be got for a hotel there?  Are there too many hotels in Longford and too few in Cavan and Roscommon?  County Meath has a serious problem in that there is no hotel that is big enough to accommodate coach tours.  People visiting the various monuments of the Boyne, Trim and other areas must do so as day trippers if they are travelling on a bus; they cannot stay overnight in the county because there is no hotel that is big <Col N="193" /> enough to accommodate them.  The Minister for Finance is creating a disincentive to building a hotel in Meath because an incentive to build a hotel somewhere else in the same vicinity is, by definition, a disincentive to doing so.</P>
    <P>Why has the Government decided that there should be a disincentive to building hotels in Longford, Louth, Meath and Westmeath?  What is it about these counties that they do not need hotel development, and what is it about the other counties that they do?  Perhaps there are good grounds for this distinction, but I would like to know what they are.  It is not a decision that should be made arbitrarily on the basis of the Government wanting to get a Dáil seat somewhere. Obviously the Minister for the Environment was asleep at the Cabinet table because County Meath was not mentioned.  Galway has been left out.  Clearly the Minister for Public Enterprise was asleep at Cabinet because Westmeath has been left out.  Also left out are Clare, north and south Kerry, all of Munster and the south-east, which feels neglected as far as hotels are concerned.  There are many places in Ireland where there is insufficient hotel accommodation, but in a very arbitrary way, it has been decided that there should be a disincentive to hotel building in all of those other remote parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Government that perhaps there should be a disincentive to building hotels in large towns, and perhaps we should have had an abstract criterion that no incentive would apply within so many miles of towns with a certain population, but that it would apply outside that area or in smaller towns.  Taking whole counties and creating incentives for them does not make sense.  That arbitrary distinction needs to be explained.  I have asked the Taoiseach a number of specific questions about the BES.  I hope each one has been separately noted because I would like an answer to each.</P>
    <P>What study has been conducted to justify this choice of counties?  Which tourism authorities were consulted in drawing up this list which excludes Longford, Meath, Galway and Westmeath, for example, as counties contiguous to ones That were included?  How long is it intended to maintain the discrimination between these counties and other counties in so far as hotel accommodation is concerned?  How many hotel bedrooms are there in each of these counties per head of population?  Does the ratio of hotel accommodation to the overall population justify this selection of counties?  Will the Taoiseach give the equivalent ratios for excluded counties such as Meath, Longford, Westmeath and Galway?  Is there statistical evidence to show there are fewer beds per 10,000 of population in the counties included to justify the discrimination against the counties which have been excluded?</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope this measure has been thought out properly.  We should not introduce willy-nilly, arbitrary forms of partition in tax application. This is a new form of partition as far as hotel <Col N="194" /> accommodation is concerned.  We are partitioning the State for hotel accommodation and the Border is now at Kingscourt.  There has been much oratory and blood expended in the argument about partition in other aspects of life.  The Government is introducing partition tonight and the reasons behind it need to be explained and justified.</P>

      <P>There are others who might disagree with Deputy Bruton.</P>
      <P>The decision to reduce the level of funding which can be raised under the business expansion scheme to £250,000 is prudent and represents a return to the initial intention of the scheme. There are good reasons for reviewing schemes after four or five years to see if they have fulfilled their purpose.  This is the reason behind this decision.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton introduced the concept of partition when referring to tax incentives.  The reality is that every tax incentive package must, by definition, discriminate against one area and in favour of another.  Otherwise, it would be patent nonsense.  If we adopted the principles enunciated by the Deputy we would wipe out a huge number of schemes introduced to discriminate in favour of certain areas in an effort to bring them up to the same level as other areas.</P>
      <P>If there is any validity in the points made by the Deputy it is the suggestion that we should be given more details on why these counties were selected.  There is some merit in that argument.  I listened attentively to the Minister for Finance. While I never expected my ex-colleagues in the Department of Finance to show a great deal of creativity in these matters, I remind them that the Slieve Russel Hotel in Cavan can accommodate more than a bus load of tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary on occasion to discriminate in favour of certain areas.  Deputy Bruton made a very good case for discriminating in favour of County Meath which has many advantages but does not have a large hotel.  I welcome the scheme under which tax incentives are given for the building of hotels of a certain standard. However, the Minister should look at the criteria governing it in the coming weeks.  Wicklow has huge potential in terms of tourism but it does not rank very high in the minds of the officials in the Department of Finance.  I discussed the seaside resorts scheme with some of them recently.  I will say more about this tomorrow.  Many counties are being denied the opportunity to attract and retain tourists because of a lack of hotels.  There are some superb hotels in Donegal.  This is partly due <Col N="195" /> to the magnificent effort put in by the McNiff brothers over many years.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental flaw in Deputy Bruton's argument.  He asked if it was prudent, proper or wise to have a certifying Minister.  I cannot think of anything more appropriate than having a certifying Minister involved in the designation of some of these areas.  We have reached the stage where the public trust practically everybody except politicians.  In spite of their warts, inability and the many sins they have visited on the State, politicians have to do one thing bureaucrats do not, they have to present themselves every so often to the public who make a judgment on them.  The suggestion that one should not have a certifying Minister for some of these schemes is patent nonsense.</P>
    <P>There is another reason I say this.  One of the proud boasts of the previous Administration, in which Deputy Bruton played no small part, was that it introduced a number of very good schemes, including the seaside resorts scheme which gives the Minister a certification role.  I said at the time it was an innovative and marvellous scheme and I hoped politicians would be able to persuade the people in the Department of Finance who wanted to terminate it to have sense. The principle governing that scheme is the same as the one governing this scheme, the concept of a certifying Minister and agencies.  I do not understand Deputy Bruton's argument.  We must give Deputy Quinn credit for introducing this scheme when he was in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the scheme in that it focuses some of the capital available for investment specifically on areas where it is needed.  The only problem I have with it is that Wicklow is not included. Other Deputies have similar problems with it because their constituencies are not included. Maybe I will be able to twist the Minister's arm during the next few days.  I do not understand Deputy Bruton's argument as some of the principles enunciated, particularly in Financial Resolution No. 5, governed some of the more innovative schemes introduced by his Administration. Why is he speaking against them now when he was in favour of them when he was in Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the Taoiseach and Deputy Bruton.  I very much support a fundamental examination of the reasons for the departure from the original purpose for which the business expansion scheme was introduced.  It was suggested at the time that the scheme would enable dead money, so to speak, to be invested in projects which might not otherwise go ahead.  I welcome the direction in which the Taoiseach is moving.  I listened with great care to his phrase that the Minister for Finance was moved to draft this resolution on the basis of advice that the risk and the cost to the Exchequer had maximised, but that is not the sole reason the BES should be considered.  For <Col N="196" /> example, because of the general taxation principles, if one takes the position of people at different levels of income in society, not only is there a much greater net benefit in the budget as one goes up the income ladder but the opportunities for managing tax avoidance are maximised. I saw a profile of a person on an income of £250,000 who is able to avail of all the schemes on offer and a huge proportion of whose income is not taxable.  That is tax avoided from the client's point of view, it is tax foregone from the public point of view and it is tax lost in terms of income to the State.</P>
      <P>On the review of the business expansion scheme, when did the flow of funds move into the property market?  If there is a flaw in current economic performance it is in the area of property. Speculation in property and the inflation of property values will make the economy vulnerable. If those on lower incomes, including those on social welfare and those in the middle ranges of income, are not getting the benefits they should from an economy which is working very well on the basis that it is overheating, it would not take very long to find that the flaw in the economy is property sourced.</P>
      <P>The BES has operated for some time, particularly in regard to assets where there is no risk. That is in complete contravention to the Finance Act that introduced the scheme.  It is not, therefore, a matter of reviewing the cap but the fundamentals on which the scheme was introduced. Apart from the criteria for qualification, which are very interesting, different multiples of the £250,000 can be put together to frustrate the Minister's intention in placing the cap.  In addition, one can invest in leasehold property and equipment.  In that regard the major banks have been running a racket for years.</P>
      <P>When reviewing the scheme, therefore, instead of simply considering a cap, should one consider the total operation of the scheme?  In regard to the much advertised business expansion schemes which will continue after this resolution is passed, what percentage will be taken by those who advertise such schemes?  When I was Minister, the film scheme was subjected to close analysis by consultants.  I asked that film incentives be compared with the business expansion scheme and found that the rigours forced on the film industry were not applied to the business expansion scheme.  The commission and the take of some financial institutions and brokers are outrageous. The behaviour of the banks in setting up shell companies which can handle not only anonymous investment but investment which in multiples can frustrate the placing of a cap such as that suggested here, is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone fortunate enough to have money to invest in the economy in recent years had expanded opportunities in terms of equities. There are increasing opportunities for those people to invest their money in projects that could create jobs and would have a beneficial effect on the economy.  Those who have abused <Col N="197" /> the scheme that was originally supposed to transfer money into positive investment to create jobs have, aided by financial institutions, invested it in assets.  That has had a pernicious effect on society and made it impossible for young couples to buy their own home.  It has resulted in &ldquo;blind&rdquo; property in practically every city and town, with nobody taking responsibility, and those involved continue to get tax benefit.  After this resolution is passed a cap will be in place which reduces the figure, but this news will hardly be revealed before people will be advertising how to break up units of investment into shell companies.  Perhaps we should consider the corporate aspect of this matter, set a limit and identify the beneficiaries.</P>

      <P>The BES, which was introduced in 1984, has been extended on an ongoing basis since then and will operate until April 1999. It covers a number of qualifying trades, including manufacturing and other activities.  Deputy Bruton asked about the tax strategy group.  That group asked for a review of the BES, which was undertaken earlier this year by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, based upon statistics provided by the Revenue Commissioners. That review shows that since the introduction of the scheme 13 years ago, £553 million has been invested at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of £275 million.  Nearly 80 per cent of BES projects to date were in respect of manufacturing projects and the cost to the Exchequer has increased dramatically in recent years.  The cost of relief in 1993-4 was £12 million whereas in 1996-7 it was nearly £42 million.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that nearly 67 per cent of all investment since 1984 was for amounts of less than £100,000 at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of £35 million.  Since 1984, 13 per cent of the total cost and nearly 82 per cent of all investment was for amounts up to £250,000 and the cost to the Exchequer was £72 million or 26 per cent of the total cost.  However, nearly 12 per cent of approvals since 1984 were for amounts of £500,000 or more and the cost to the Exchequer was £170 million or 62 per cent of the total cost. The BES has been successful in helping smaller companies to raise finance and strengthen their balance sheets.  The review of the BES has shown, however, that more than 80 per cent of projects have raised less than £250,000.  Therefore, the reduction in the aggregate amount a company can raise in ensuring the BES is targeted at the projects is most likely to benefit the BES.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked about the certification process and the objective criteria.  There are many <Col N="198" /> provisions in the tax Acts which require certification by the Government's agency and decisions are subject to administrative law.  I am sure Deputy Bruton will agree, however, that not all matters can be set out in legislation by way of mathematical formula.  There must be objective criteria but, as we are aware from previous legislation, when we try to do that we end up with reams of regulations and laws to close the loopholes. Deputy Higgins will remember what happened some years ago when film relief was introduced. One cannot write all the regulations into law.</P>

      <P>The tax regime introduced for hotels in selected counties is not an unusual measure.  In the case of urban renewal, Temple Bar and the enterprise zones of Gallanstown, Ballymun and East Point, sites were ringfenced and areas outside them were not included.  Many Border counties do not have adequate hotels on the Bord Fáilte list.  There are no large hotels in north Leitrim which is a beautiful area from a tourist point of view.  Governments in all countries intervene in the market to provide incentives for particular sectors and areas.  We provided similar attractions in many of the schemes we implemented in the past.</P>
      <P>The BES was extended to tourism and shipping ten years ago and included mainly asset-backed activities, such as hotels, guesthouses, self catering accommodation and Dublin 4 apartments. However, they were removed from the scheme in l991.</P>

    <P>Financial Resolution No 7 gives effect to the decision to phase out tax credits on dividend payments made by companies.  This change is an integral part of the restructuring of corporation tax to facilitate the introduction of a standard corporate tax rate of 12.  5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Under existing rules roughly half of the corporation tax paid by a company is attributed to shareholders when they receive dividends from the company.  This imputation of corporation tax paid by the company is achieved by attaching a tax credit to the dividend.  The amount of the tax credit under existing law is 21/79ths of the distribution of profits subject to the standard rate of corporation tax.  For dividends paid on or after today this tax credit is being reduced by approximately one half to I 1/89ths.  For dividends paid on or after 6 of April 1999 there will be no tax credit.</P>
    <P>A tax credit rate of 1/18th has applied to dividends paid out of profits which are liable to corporation tax at the 10 per cent rate.  This rate will continue for dividends paid up to the 6 April 1999, at which time it will also be abolished.  As a company is obliged to pay advance corporation <Col N="203" /> tax equal to the amount of tax credits attaching to its distributions, the reduction in the tax credit rate will result in a lower advance corporation tax liability.  With the abolition of tax credits from 6 April 1999, advance corporation tax will effectively be abolished as and from that date.</P>
    <P>The resolution also contains technical amendments in relation to distributions made out of export sales relieved distributions received and the entitlement of overseas life assurance companies to tax credits.</P>
    <P>Financial Resolution No 8 adjusts the tax treatment of scrip dividends issued by Irish resident quoted companies.  Scrip dividends are shares issued to a shareholder in lieu of cash dividends. Since the Finance Act, 1993, the receipt by a shareholder of scrip dividends has not given rise to an income tax liability, but the shares were regarded as having been acquired for a nil cost for capital gains tax purposes.  When the shares were subsequently sold a capital gains tax liability arose.</P>
    <P>As a result of this Financial Resolution the issue of scrip dividends will give rise to an income tax liability.  The amount of the cash dividend foregone will be treated as a distribution made by the issuing company to the shareholder and this will be generally subject to income tax in the hands of the shareholder.  In other words, a similar tax treatment will apply whether a shareholder takes a distribution of profits from a company in the form of a cash dividend or a scrip dividend.  This means the shareholder will be entitled to a tax credit, and the company will be liable to pay advance corporation tax.  When the shareholder eventually sells the shares, the base cost allowable for capital gains tax purposes will be the amount of the cash dividend foregone.</P>
    <P>This change in the tax treatment of scrip dividends is being made in the light of the significant reduction in the rate of capital gains tax and the phasing out of the tax credit on all dividend payments. It is appropriate, to protect the Exchequer, that the tax effects to a distribution should be similar, whether it is taken in the form of cash or shares.  The tax treatment of scrip dividends from companies other than Irish resident quoted companies is being left unchanged.  In such cases the amount of cash dividend foregone is liable to tax without any tax credit.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to Resolution No. 7 on the grounds that it is a very arbitrary and unjustifiable double taxation.  As I understand the measure, if a person receives a dividend from a company it involves double taxation.  The company will have paid tax on the profit it makes before it decides the dividend and the person who receives the dividend will also be taxed on the income he or she receives.  The same flow of income is taxed twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to avoid inequities arising from the receipt of income in the form of a dividend rather than in the form of rent from property which one might let.  If a person decides to rent a <Col N="204" /> house, one is taxed once on the income one receives from the rent.  If, on the other hand, one sets up a company which owns the house, one would be taxed twice under this system because one would be taxed on the income of the company and on the income of the rent.  A person is not necessarily rich because they own an incorporated company or poor because they receive ordinary income.  That equation does not apply. Corporations are often used by poor people and some rich individuals pay personal income tax and do not own incorporated companies.  We should not assume that people involved in a corporation are rich.</P>
    <P>People receiving income from dividends include the elderly or people who expect to be elderly soon and those who are no longer able to work and have received large compensation for an injury and invested the money in a company. Such people receive dividends to put aside money for the long-term care they will need when they can no longer care for themselves.  These people will be hit by this measure.  They will face double taxation.  Just because it is corporation tax and dividends does not mean that it only concerns rich people.  I wish to state that in case I am criticised by a Deputy from a neighbouring constituency.</P>

      <P>The Government is justifying the halving of the tax credit on corporation tax dividends on the basis that, in about ten years, the corporation tax rate will be reduced to 12.5 per cent.  However, it is reducing the tax credit within two years.  In other words, it is anticipating the reduction to 12.5 per cent in a reduction in the tax credit.  It is entirely unjustified to do this within the next two years rather than in line with the reduction in the rate of corporation tax.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why the reduction in the tax credit was not done on an ordinary annualised basis, step by step with the reduction in the corporation tax rate.  That would have been fair and justifiable.  A sudden cut in the dividend tax credit which accompanies a gradual reduction in the corporation tax constitutes a new wedge of double taxation on people on fixed incomes of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two main groups will suffer as a result of this measure.  First, those who have saved money, are no longer economically active and need this money for a good purpose.  Second, pension funds.  Every PAYE worker who is in a pension fund will suffer because their fund will be hit by this double taxation.  I hope that people will see that this is a mean change, slipped into the tax code at 10.45 p.m. on budget night in the hope that no one is watching.  It should not be introduced, least of all at this hour without a proper discussion.  It should have been dealt with in the Finance Bill.  It is not an appropriate subject for the application of the Provisional Collection of <Col N="205" /> Taxes Act, 1927.  I do not understand why that Act is being used for this purpose.  This is a matter of formal discrimination which should have been discussed properly.  It could easily have awaited the introduction of the Finance Bill.  I question the constitutionality of this procedure.  It is not an appropriate measure for the use of that Act.</P>

The Minister has taken the decision to reduce the tax credit accordingly.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy Bruton's point about introducing this measure over two years when the phased reduction in corporation tax will take longer.

      <P>Deputy Bruton asked why the tax credits were not gradually reduced in line with the corporation tax and why this is being done now.  Changes in tax credits announced today cannot be looked at in isolation.  In the context of shareholders, one must look at the reduction in the corporation tax rates, the revised credit and the budget income tax changes.  When all these changes are taken into account, a company's distribution of its profits will result in a shareholder, who pays tax at the top rate, suffering a reduction in their return after tax of no more than 87p per £100 of profit made by the company.  I remind Deputies that the Government's proposed move to a single 12.5 rate of corporation tax was outlined today by the Minister for Finance.  Part of <Col N="206" /> this move involves the abolition of tax credits. The budget proposes their being phased out over a two year period, an approach which reduces the need for complex changes in tax credit arrangements which otherwise would be necessary each year we make amendments.  The savings made by the Exchequer are being used to help implement Government policy in reducing the tax burden on business and those in employment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked how this measure would affect pension funds and trusts.  Pension funds which have been exempted from tax are entitled to a payment from the Exchequer of the tax credit extending to dividends.  As the level of tax credit is being reduced, pension funds will receive a smaller payment from the Exchequer.  However, the asset value of pension funds has grown substantially over the past few years due to the strong performance of equity markets.  For example, assets grew by almost £3 billion last year.  In the short-term, the abolition of tax credits over two years rather than their gradual phasing out in line with the reduction in the rate of corporation tax will result in a temporary decline in pension fund income from equities.  However, as corporation tax rates are reduced in future years, this trend will be reversed.  In addition, a policy of reinvestment of company profits rather than dividend payouts is encouraged as the tax credits can be reclaimed.  This will present a better long-term strategy for pension funds because of the higher corporate profitability which would be expected to flow from increased reinvestment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked whether all the corporation tax paid by a company should be imputed to shareholders.  A company is a separate legal entity.  As a result, it is granted a number of privileges, such as limited liability.  A company is a user of services and, in these circumstances, it is considered appropriate that it should make a contribution by way of a tax charge.  If shareholders were granted a reduction for all corporation tax paid by a company, this would mean that the company was not making such a contribution and that its tax payment represented an advance payment of tax on account of the shareholders' liability. I hope no Member is arguing for that.  The practice until now has been to grant shareholders receiving dividends a credit for approximately one half of the corporation tax paid by the company.</P>
      <P>We are now moving towards a new corporation tax regime with a much lower corporation rate. With that rate reduced, the tax credit should become less significant.  Phasing out the tax credit until 6 April 1999 should release resources that could be put to better use by reducing income tax to reduce the tax burden on employment.  That is what the Government wishes to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton asked why corporation tax rates will change soon when the tax credits change on budget day.  Normal changes in corporation tax rates and credits take effect on the same day, but in this case, as part of the transition to a single rate of 12.5 per cent of corporation tax, the <Col N="207" /> tax credits are being reduced by more than the usual amount.  Both changes take effect on 1 January 1998, and there is a possibility that certain companies would maximise the amount of dividends paid before the reduced credits applied. Where shareholders would be entitled to a refund of the tax credit, the situation could be manipulated to the detriment of the Exchequer.  To prevent this, the tax credits are being reduced with effect from today.  There will, therefore, be no incentive to arrange for early payment of dividends which could otherwise happen.  The difference in time between the rate reduction and the reduction in tax credits is only one month.</P>
    <P>I need not remind Deputy Bruton that in the document produced in May on employment-sharing for growth, removal of tax credits attaching to dividend income was proposed.  It was explained as a change to a classical taxation system, so that dividend income is subject to full personal tax rates in addition to the tax paid at company level. That was just over six months ago.</P>
    <P>The corporation tax reductions are a revenue raising measure that will yield approximately £60 million in a full year.  It is a net of offsets, and includes distributive dividend charges.  It will help to meet part of the costs of the reduction in the corporation tax rates from 36 to 32 per cent and from 28 to 25 per cent.  Those will cost £107 million in a full year.  The House knows that we are committed to continuing those reductions over coming years.  That has been negotiated with the Commission, and the payback is quite substantial.</P>
    <P>As we move toward lower corporation tax, I am glad that we are moving small businesses toward a rate of 25 per cent.  The House does not perhaps know that 94 per cent of businesses in the country return profits of less than £50,000, which means that as of close of business tonight, 94 per cent of businesses will be paying the 25 per cent rate.  That is a massive improvement and a huge incentive for small businesses.  Only 6 per cent of companies are in another category, and many of those are multinationals which pay the 10 per cent rate.</P>

They had been paying rates of £1,500 but rateable revaluation increased that to £6,500. That is a huge increase, and the Government is ignoring this indirect taxation.  Reducing profit tax to 25 per cent is of no benefit to small business as they cannot show a profit.  It is easy to pay 25 per cent of £1,000 or £2,000.  Given the indirect tax, such as revaluations, which are taking place all over the country, the Government must introduce legislation immediately to reduce this extreme cost on small business.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Phasing out the tax credit on dividends, may mask somewhat the extraordinary cuts in corporation tax.  The Government should explain this to the hard pressed PAYE worker.  After ten years of extraordinary profitability in business &mdash; increasing at the rate of about 10 per cent per annum &mdash; with no restraint on profits, while the incomes of PAYE workers were battened down to a real increase of 1 per cent per year, the Government gives a massive £107 million by means of the cut in corporation tax and capital acquisitions tax, which can only be seen as benefiting speculators who play the Stock Exchange in large measure. Will the Government explain to the PAYE worker this extraordinary disparity in the treatment meted out here?  A massive £5 billion in profits is sent out of this country to their headquarters by multinational companies without let or hindrance every year.  Between £1 billion and £2 billion is invested abroad by Irish nationals for speculative purposes.  I am not convinced by the Taoiseach's explanation that 94 per cent of the businesses affected by corporation tax are small. Has the Government even considered that in giving such large hand outs to big business and the rich who are the main beneficiaries, it should put in place a mechanism whereby the extraordinary <Col N="210" /> profits they will now earn will be invested here as opposed to swelling further Ansbacher accounts?</P>

I remind the Taoiseach the people we are talking about are pensioners and the prospective pensioners, people who actually get money from pensions. They are the people that the £60 million will come from.  The bulk of dividends nowadays is paid to pension funds of one kind or another, the so called well known institutional investors, the grey men in the grey suits who represent pensioners or potential pensioners.  This £60 million the Taoiseach proposes we take will come out of the funds that will be used to pay pensions to people who are not fortunate enough to have a public sector pension.  If there was a proposal to introduce some form of clawback, the effect of which would be to reduce suddenly the source of the funds from which public sector pensions would be paid, there would be an outcry and the Taoiseach would not be as brave in his defence of his proposals.  Given that we are talking about pensions which are paid in the private sector, through the intermediary of a pension fund which is administered by law, the Taoiseach is able to conjure up the picture of people running these funds for some benefit other than the recipients of the pensions.  I do not believe that is the case. It is important this issue should not be presented as the Taoiseach versus the pension funds.  It is a case of the Taoiseach versus the pensioners and the would be pensioners and £60 million of their money being taken away by an arbitrary change in tax practice that is not justified on principle.  It would be justified to reduce the tax credit in a digressive way in line with the digressive reduction over the same period and at the same stages as the rate of corporation tax.  To reduce the tax credit over two years while reducing corporation tax over ten years or more is not fair and is in effect, depriving pensioners of the future of a tax treatment benefit that pensioners of the past received.  It is changing the rules so far as pensioners who made contributions in the past were concerned.  They assumed there would be constancy in the treatment of the dividend income for tax purposes that was the source of the pension they would anticipate receiving. Changing the principle in an arbitrary way, as is now being done here, is unfair to future pensioners.</P>

Is he also aware that while small businesses &mdash; the backbone of the country &mdash; employ more than 400,000 people, approximately 97 per cent employ fewer than 50 people? <Col N="211" /> In many instances the owner's expertise is limited which is a considerable constraint.  While the proposed reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 25 per cent is welcome, it is a source of concern that 94 per cent of small businesses have incomes of less than £50,000.  That is a clear indication of their determination to survive despite the bureaucracy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton either misunderstands this measure or is deliberately seeking to misrepresent it.  People invest in pension funds to receive a pension.  Part of the income comes from dividends.  After tax profits, out of which dividends are paid, will increase considerably as a result of the changes announced by the Government.  These include the reduction in the rate of corporation tax and the partial abolition of the tax credit available for dividends.  This represents a partial clawback by the Revenue Commissioners.  The £60 million involved will be available to the Government to reduce the tax burden on the PAYE sector.  Deputy Bruton therefore is being mischievous and his comments are inaccurate and unhelpful to the PAYE sector. Pensioners will be net beneficiaries.  I cannot understand why Deputy Bruton will not support this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's 1798 commemoration committee, of which I am chairperson, has made substantial progress in devising the national programme of commemoration. To date a number of projects and events have been developed to mark this important period in our history.</P>
      <P>In line with the objectives of the commemoration, as endorsed by this Government, it is the committee's intention to develop a broad-ranging, comprehensive and inclusive programme which commemorates the ideals of the United Irishmen and the &ldquo;Fellowship of Freedom&rdquo; that inspired them in 1798.  With this in mind, it is felt that the commemoration programme should focus primary attention on the principles of democracy and pluralism which the United Irishmen advocated.  The programme will focus attention on the ideals of the leaders of 1798 and will acknowledge the Ulster dimension and particularly the contribution of the Presbyterian tradition, with its emphasis on justice, equality and civil liberty.  It is felt that particular focus should also be given to the international perspective of the United Irishmen and the enduring links which 1798 forged with America, France and Australia.</P>
      <P>The Dublin-Belfast Choral Festival, an ecumenical service, a Dublin-Belfast international conference, a 1798 commemoration scholarship, documentary programmes by RTE and significant exhibitions to be mounted by the National Library and National Museum and by the Linen Hall Library, Belfast are some of the many worthy projects and events being funded by my committee. A full list of the events confirmed or under consideration is set out as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many projects, should extra funding <Col N="218" /> become available, that my committee would have an interest in developing.  These projects would include some suitable local projects which are being organised in areas which were involved in 1798.  I am currently in discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on this matter.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Government's 1798 Commemoration Committee National Programme</P>
    <P>The Government's 1798 commemoration committee, which is chaired by Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, is currently devising the national programme of commemoration.</P>
    <P>The committee, which is interdepartmental, will receive a budget of £250,000 to implement its programme in 1998.  Some funds have already been committed out of that budget.</P>
    <P>The confirmed 1798 events are:</P>
    <P>Ecumenical Service &mdash; St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin on 14 June 1998 at 3.15 p.m.</P>

    <P>Dublin-Belfast Choral Festival (Mozart '98 Requiem) &mdash; Organisers aim to bring together a large number of singers and instrumentalists from North and South to perform in Wexford, Dublin and Belfast.  Tentative dates are 6-8 April 1998.</P>
    <P>International Conference, &ldquo;1798 A Bicentenary Perspective&rdquo;&mdash; International Conference to be held in the Ulster Museum and Dublin Castle from 20-24 May 1998.  Conference will look at all aspects of 1798 including national and international.</P>
    <P>Wolfe Tone Diaries &mdash; Grant given to Liliput Press to assist with the publication of Wolfe Tone Diaries which will be published in late 1997.  Minister will write foreword for publication.</P>
    <P>National 1798 Centre, Enniscorthy &mdash; Government's 1798 commemoration committee is working in association with Comoradh '98 on Enniscorthy Centre, which will be opened in early 1998. Grant of £1.6 million provided by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>National Library Exhibition &mdash; 1798 Exhibition will run from January 1998 to end of year.  It will be located in the National Library.  Exhibition will look at 1798 from a national and international perspective.</P>
    <P>Tour de France &mdash; To mark the commemoration of the 1798 Rebellion day three of the Tour de France will start in Enniscorthy.</P>
    <P>School Competitions &mdash; National school banner competition and secondary school essay competition (junior cycle and transition year) are being planned in association with the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>1798 Stamps &mdash; An Post will issue a series of stamps to commemorate 1798.</P>
    <P>Humbert Summer School, Mayo &mdash; Funding of £5,000 will be made available to the Humbert summer school in 1998 towards the cost of the <Col N="219" /> publication of the 1998 summer school proceedings.</P>

    <P>Restoration of William Lawless Tomb in Paris &mdash; In 1995 the Government's 1798 commemoration committee made a grant of £5,000 available towards the restoration of William Lawless Tomb.</P>
    <P>Bantry Bay Summer School &mdash; In 1996 a grant of £2,000 was made available to Bantry Bay summer school which was dealing with the theme of the French Revolution and its relevance to Ireland which was especially suitable as it was the bicentenary of the arrival at Bantry of the French Armada carrying Wolfe Tone.</P>
    <P>International 1798 Conference Notre Dame, Indianna &mdash; A grant of £2,500 will be made available in 1998 to Notre Dame University to assist with a major international conference on the theme of 1798 which is taking place at the end of March of next year.</P>
    <P>Lecture Tour of USA &mdash; Plans are under way to undertake a 1798 lecture tour of America in April of 1998.  Proposed cities: New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Boston.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to the allocation provided for the CSO in the 1998 Estimates which in gross terms reflects a decrease of 14 per cent on the 1997 forecast outturn.  The original 1997 allocation for the CSO reflected the carry-over cost of processing the 1996 census of population.  When account is taken of this cost however there is, in fact, a small increase in net allocations between 1997 and 1998.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that gross expenditure for the CSO rose from some £13.8 million in 1995 to £23.8 million in 1996 to cover the cost of the conduct and initial processing of the census.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will review the role of the Central Statistics Office in order to extend its remit to the measurement of criminal justice statistics, including court statistics, crime statistics, prison statistics and related statistics.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20247/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Criminal justice statistics are the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and, in the case of crime, prisons and probation statistics, are published in annual reports.  Some statistics on the criminal justice system are also published annually by the Central Statistics Office in its statistical abstract.</P>
      <P>Under the Statistics Act, 1993, the Central Statistics Office has the authority to co-ordinate statistics compiled by other public authorities. However, its right to access the records of public authorities does not extend to the records pertaining to a court, the Garda Síochána or the prison administration.  While administrative records provide valuable information on reported crime, it is the view of the CSO that estimates of actual, as distinct from reported, crime could be based only on national representative surveys.</P>
      <P>In September, the CSO launched the new quarterly national household survey, which will be an important source of statistics about the population, households and the labour market.  It involves surveying 39,000 households per quarter throughout the country.  Consideration is being given to including a module on crime in this survey for a future quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that the 1998 Estimates for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform <Col N="221" /> included a specific provision of £250,000 for research.  In the circumstances, I see no need to review the role of the Central Statistics Office in respect of criminal justice statistics.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the previous Government established a Cabinet committee on drugs, chaired by the Taoiseach, to give overall political leadership in the fight against drugs; review all trends in the drugs problem; assess progress in the strategy to deal with it; and resolve any policy or organisational difficulties which may inhibit an effective response to the problem.</P>
      <P>Recognising the links between social exclusion, drug abuse and alienation, the present Government decided that the most strategic way to tackle the problem of social exclusion was to reconstitute the drugs committee into a wider Cabinet committee which would address disadvantage in the broadest sense.  This committee &mdash; which continues to be chaired by the Taoiseach but whose membership has been expanded to include other relevant Ministers, such as Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs &mdash; links together the work being done under the local development operational programme and the national anti-poverty strategy, as well as the national drugs strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee meets as appropriate to review progress in the implementation of these strategies, resolve any difficulties which might arise and direct the work of bodies, such as the national drugs strategy team, which have been set up to progress the implementation of the various strategies.  The establishment of the youth services <Col N="222" /> development fund has been the subject of recent discussions with a view to bringing it into operation from early next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The spread of tourism throughout the regions is a matter for the regional tourism authorities which were established by Bord Fáilte, under the provisions of the tourist traffic Acts, to, <i>inter alia,</i> develop tourism in the regions.  I am conscious, however, of concerns expressed in some quarters that the increase in tourism growth in recent years, while above the European and international averages in all regions, is not being equitably distributed.</P>
      <P>I highlighted these concerns in my speech, last month, at the Forum 2000 business seminar in Dublin to which Deputy Moynihan-Cronin referred.  I used the opportunity to reiterate the fact that, in announcing an additional allocation by way of Supplementary Estimate of up to £5 million this year to Bord Fáilte to facilitate a boost to its 1998 marketing drive, I asked the board to design a series of additional new initiatives, targeted not only at maintaining tourism growth, but also at addressing regional spread.  Details of the new initiatives should be available later this month, after I have presented the Supplementary Estimate to the House for approval.</P>
      <P>It is clear, of course, that we cannot compel tourists to go to specific areas if they do not wish to do so.  I want to emphasise, however, the significant role the tourism authorities have to play in promoting the development of tourism in their areas and in putting in place sound business strategies to successfully market their own areas and facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Duty and tax free sales are highly profitable and are being used in part by air and sea transport operators to keep charges and fares down.  Abolition of duty free could, therefore, be particularly problematic for low fare airlines and ferry companies, slowing down the growth of tourism into Ireland where more competitive fares have underpinned a dramatic increase in visitor arrivals in recent years.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government is using every opportunity to raise this issue at political level in appropriate fora and to suggest the need for further study by the European Commission of the implications of the abolition of intra-EU duty free.</P>
      <P>Given the potential impact of the proposed measure on the development of the tourism industry generally, the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, raised the issue at the EU Tourism Council of Ministers' meeting in Brussels on 26 November. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Enterprise have also been active in highighting the importance of the matter.  Last week the Taoiseach raised the subject at the EU Employment Summit in Luxembourg and he has reported to the House on the outcome in some detail on 25 November.  There is a special committee studying the implications for Ireland in his Department and he intends raising a further marker about Ireland's concerns at the December summit.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach outlined in his statement on 25 November the Government's strategy which is to continue to seek to have the matter raised at the level of Transport Ministers, ECOFIN, the European Council and the Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 32, 35, 36, 70, 78 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that tackling the drugs problem requires a broad response across a number of key policy areas, including education, health and social welfare.  In line with this approach, the Cabinet committee on drugs established by the previous Government has been reconstituted into a wider Cabinet committee on social inclusion which will address disadvantage in its broadest sense.  This committee continues to be chaired by the Taoiseach but its membership has been extended to include other relevant Ministers, such as Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs.  Among the bodies reporting to this committee is the national drugs strategy team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister with overall responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's strategy to reduce drugs demand, I have responsibility for the <Col N="226" /> national drugs strategy team, and for overseeing the implementation of the various recommendations in the two reports of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs.</P>
    <P>Arising from one of the recommendation in those reports, 13 local drugs task forces were set up (12 in Dublin and one in Cork) and were man-dated to prepare action plans to tackle the demand for drugs in their areas of operation. Funding of £10 million was set aside to support the implementation of these plans.  To date, the Government, on the advice of the national drugs strategy team, has approved funding totalling £4.89 million to implement elements of the plans. The team is currently finalising its proposals to Government in relation to the allocation of further funding to task forces.  It is expected that these proposals will be submitted to Government before Christmas.  A sum of £10 million has been included in next year's Estimate for my Department towards meeting expenditure on the drugs initiative in 1998.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the part that sport and recreation can play in fostering a sense of community, especially for those living in disadvantaged areas and this is reflected in a number of plans already submitted by local drugs task forces and approved for funding by Government.</P>

      <P>Special Olympics International, the official governing body for the Special Olympics, has indicated its interest in holding the Special Olympics World Summer Games outside the US for the first time in 2003.</P>
      <P>A bid steering group was established by the previous Government to oversee the preparation of Ireland's bid to host those games.  The group investigated thoroughly the possibility of Ireland meeting the Special Olympics International requirements in terms of sports facilities, accommodation, transportation and language services and concluded that it was feasible for Ireland to host the games in 2003.  Its findings were considered by Government last month and grant assistance, up to a maximum of £5 million, was approved towards the cost of implementing the bid, should it be successful.  The organisers expect to raise the balance of the £16 million bill for the games from sponsorship and fundraising.  More than £1 million has already been secured and further substantial support from commercial interests will be a critical factor in securing the success of the project, in the event of the bid to hold the games in Ireland in 2003 succeeding.</P>

The committee, which is representative of all the main players in the formulation and execution of tourism policy, took into consideration the Community Support Framework mid-term review package (based on the ESRI review), the mid-term evaluation of the tourism programme (which was carried out by Fitzpatrick Associates &mdash; the external evaluator of the programme) and the views of the members of the committee.  The committee noted that while a significant financial implication for the Tourism OP involved a 10 MECU (about £7.5 million) reduction in funding under sub-programme 1, 6 MECU (about £4.5 million) of this was being reallocated to other priorities within the programme.  The decisions made by the monitoring committee will have implications for many aspects of the Operational Programme for Tourism and these are described in the following paragraphs.</P>
      <P>Natural Cultural Tourism</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The monitoring committee noted the CSF decision to reduce the European Regional Development Fund allocation of the natural/cultural tourism sub-programme by 10 MECU (about £7.5 million) and agreed the individual measure reductions as recommended by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  The monitoring committee also <Col N="229" /> approved the engagement of a consultant to undertake an audit of the physical progress of all projects in this sub-programme for the consideration of the monitoring committee at its spring 1998 meeting.</P>
    <P>Product Development</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee, while recognising that over 80 per cent of funding has already been committed to projects by the independent management boards for product development, agreed that remaining funds must be very carefully targeted to achieve maximum impact and to address those areas where OP interventions can achieve greatest impact in the development of sustainable tourism into the next millennium.  Consequently before further projects are approved for funding, the monitoring committee decided that the boards must first satisfy themselves that a project will act as a catalyst in achieving critical mass in developing non-traditional tourist areas in order to achieve a more balanced spread of tourism throughout Ireland; demonstrate a clearly defined and measurable contribution to the extension of the existing tourism season; from a sustainable development point of view, the project should contribute to the enhancement of the surrounding area, avoid overlap with competing facilities and contribute to a balanced area based strategy for promoting international tourism; and continue to ensure that aid levels are at the absolute minimum rate required to enable the project to proceed and only in very exceptional circumstances and as part of a strategic need in developing under-developed tourism areas should aid levels be at a maximum.  The boards will be advised accordingly.</P>
    <P>Marketing</P>
    <P>The implementation of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework has led to an increase of 3 MECU (about £2.25 million) in the European Regional Development Fund funding available to support the promotion of cultural and off-season tourism marketing.  The national monitoring committee has agreed that 1.500 MECU (about £1.1 million) is to be allocated to the marketing management board for new initiatives which aim to promote off-season tourism; an allocation of 0.750 MECU (about £0.56 million) to the overseas tourism marketing initiative to facilitate the promotion of Cultural and Heritage tourism facilities through the OTMI programme; and an allocation of 0.750 MECU (about £0.56 million) to the marketing management board specifically for the overseas promotion of the Natural and Cultural facilities which fall within the remit of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands would work with Bord Fáilte and other expert groupings to design appropriate marketing programmes and <Col N="230" /> that these will be considered for approval by the marketing management board.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the marketing sub-programme will now be divided into two Measures, &ldquo;Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative&rdquo; and &ldquo;Activity Approved by the Marketing Management Board&rdquo;, each with separate allocations.</P>
    <P>Also, the national monitoring committee has agreed to the transfer of 0.400 MECU (about £0.3 million) from the tourism angling measure to the marketing sub-programme to substantially boost the overseas marketing of Ireland's tourism angling facilities.  It is intended that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources will work with Bord Fáilte, the Central Fisheries Board and other expert groupings to design appropriate marketing programmes and that these will be considered for approval by the marketing management board.</P>
    <P>Training</P>
    <P>With regard to tourism training, the monitoring committee has examined the scope for providing more places for early school leavers and has asked CERT to further develop their proposals in this area including the setting up of a pilot programme. Early school leavers will also be targeted for inclusion on CERT's industry training and qualifications scheme.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee has also requested CERT to develop plans to extend further the training contribution of the larger operators in the industry and to focus more of their services on small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>Tourism and the Environment</P>
    <P>In July 1997 the monitoring committee for the Community Support Framework for Ireland, in the context of its review of all CSF Operational Programmes, decided that 3 MECU (about £2.25 million) European Regional Development Fund funding should be earmarked from within the Tourism Operational Programme to fund projects of a pilot demonstration nature, which will contribute to knowledge and understanding of best practice in terms of addressing sustainable tourism and the environment in which it operates.  A detailed announcement will be made by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Dr. Jim McDaid, as soon as the administrative and operational details have been settled.</P>
    <P>National Conference Centre and National Gallery</P>
    <P>The Monitoring Committee noted the decision of the CSF that progress on the national conference centre and the National Gallery will be monitored closely and if there is a risk that these projects will not be completed in time to draw-down the funds committed to them, all or part of these funds will be decommitted next year.  The monitoring committee resolved to ensure that these projects are suitably on target to satisfy the CSF Monitoring Committee.</P>

      <P>The 1997 forecast outturn for my Department published in the Abridged Version of the Estimates for Public Services 1998 reflects the outturn of the former Department of Tourism and Trade up to 11 July last, and the forecast outturn for the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation from 12 July 1997 to 31 December 1997.  The 1998 Estimate, however, is solely in respect of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>
      <P>For a valid comparison to be made between 1997 and 1998, it is necessary to include the projected outturn for all of 1997 under the subheads which are now the responsibility of my Department. The forecast outturn for 1997 for these subheads is £79.564 million.  My Department's Estimate for 1998, at £83.498 million, represents, therefore, an increase of 4.9 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 makes provision, under measure one of its product development sub-programme, for ERDF support for the development of a large dedicated conference centre capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates to be located in Dublin.  A new tender procedure to develop such a facility is under way, under the auspices of the independent management board for product development within Bord Fáilte, and six qualified applicants have confirmed their intention to submit full tenders before the three month deadline for such submissions, i.e. by the end of January next year, following which the tenders will be assessed.</P>
      <P>Measure five of that sub-programme also provided assistance for appropriate improvement and upgrading works for conference facilities at hotels of over 30 bedrooms throughout the country. It was designed to encourage hotel proprietors to provide modern facilities, including simultaneous translation and audio-visual equipment, to help attract high yield overseas conference business to their area.  A minimum level of investment of £1 million in international standard conference facilities and £50,000 in technological conference support equipment is required in order to qualify for European Regional Development Fund assistance.  As in the case of a national conference centre, all applications for grant assistance in this regard are considered by the independent management board for product development within Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that this question follows the Deputy's question to me on 22 October last about adequacy of access to tourist facilities for visitors with a disability.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment of both the Government and the European Commission to improve the position of the socially disadvantaged, the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, which is the main vehicle for tourism development in Ireland up to the end of this decade, includes provision for funding, where appropriate, for support to help meet the additional costs of providing suitable access-friendly facilities for the disabled when submitted to Bord Fáilte or Shannon Development as part of EU grant approved developments.  In interdepartmental discussions aimed at ensuring consistency and complementarity between the tourism and other operational programmes, my Department has stressed the importance of improved access for disabled tourists.</P>
      <P>All new buildings must comply with building regulations &mdash; introduced in 1991 by the Department of the Environment and Local Government &mdash; which state that people with disabilities must be catered for.  These regulations contain provisions for people with disabilities in relation to access to, and circulation within, all new buildings and old buildings which are being renovated.</P>
      <P>The industry has been circulated widely with a handbook specially prepared by the European Commission for the tourism industry on &ldquo;Making Europe accessible for tourists with disabilities.&rdquo; Ultimately, of course, it is the industry itself which must adapt its facilities and product if it is to appeal to this market and avail of the sales opportunities which it offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities makes a number of recommendations on the need to develop policy and practice in relation to the universal right of access to the built and external environments, which of course would include tourist facilities.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the National Rehabilitation Board (NRB) is undertaking, via the county councils, a survey with the aim of drawing up an updated list of tourist amenities with access thereto for people with disabilities.  The work of the NRB in relation to improving access for persons with disabilities involves it in ongoing contact with other appropriate Departments, national and local authorities and organisations, including those in the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should also mention that Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism authorities make every effort to inform disabled tourists, through promotional literature and other means, of the suitability or otherwise of the full range of tourism facilities, including accommodation.  Neither my Department nor Bord Fáilte is aware of any complaints from tour operators in this regard.</P>
    <P>Against this background of increased awareness and action, my Department has not seen any need so far for an audit on the lines mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 110, 111 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the new tender procedure for a national conference centre, which is being conducted in accordance with the EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, is being organised by Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development. The proposed centre, with the capacity to handle up to 2,000 delegates, will comprise a number of facilities, including, <i>inter alia,</i> a main auditorium, multiple break-out meeting rooms, foyers and circulation space, high quality restaurant, banqueting facilities, exhibition space and facilities for broadcasting and recording.</P>
      <P>The full tender procedure notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 September 1997.  The notice was also published in the Irish daily newspapers on 16 September.  It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by 5 p.m. on Monday, 20 October.  Bord Fáilte received 12 responses within the deadline set for receipt of applications to tender.  On 31 October 1997, invitation to tender documentation was dispatched by Bord Fáilte to seven qualified applicants, six of whom confirmed their intention to submit full tenders before the deadline set, 14 November, for so doing.  These six applicants, who will be responsible for providing a site for the proposed development, have three months to submit their tenders, i.e. by the end of January next year, following which the tenders will be assessed.  The management board has estimated that it will be late March before it has completed its deliberations.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the tourism operational programme, the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law will then be required in respect of any final selection made.  Before determining tender procedures, my Department consulted the European Commission which has not requested any clarification since then from my Department in relation to the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A specific timescale for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project cannot be determined until the proposal has been formally approved by the Government and the European Commission and matters such as planning permission are in place.  Paragraph 4 of the tender procedure notice points out that while the final date for taking account of expenditure for projects under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99 is 31 December 2000, there is provision for a member state to request the Commission to extend the time limits by not more than one year.  If an extension of more than one year proves necessary, a formal Commission decision is required.  No expenditure incurred <Col N="241" /> after the end date agreed with the Commission may be taken into account for the purposes of Structural Fund assistance under the Community Support Framework.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a number of different groups have expressed interest in the proposed centre being located in their particular areas.  However, the provision of a site is a matter for individual qualified candidates and, as I have said before, the entire process so far is being conducted by Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development.</P>

CERT, for its part, is also involved with the Forfás business awareness campaign, and is beginning a series of seminars for industry management to heighten awareness in the tourism industry of the systems and staff training repercussions of EMU.</P>
      <P>I am monitoring closely the activities of both agencies to ensure that they play their part in gearing up the tourism industry for the challenges of EMU, and I am satisfied that the industry will be fully ready for the changeover.</P>

      <P>The information requested is shown in the following tables.</P>
      <P>In the period since 1 January 1997 some £842 million has been paid to farmers under various schemes.  This includes £698 million paid to farmers under the various EU livestock and arable aid schemes of which over £446 million relates to payments made under the 1997 schemes.  To date this year some 1.322 million payments have been made of which 799,515 relate to payments under the 1997 schemes. Also to date in 1997 £144.538 million has been paid out by my Department under the REPS and the early retirement scheme.</P>
      <P>Payments under the 1997 disadvantaged areas headage schemes commenced on 28 September 1997 and to date over £97.5 million has been paid. Eighty per cent of cattle headage-beef cow applicants and 83 per cent of sheep headage applicants have now been paid.  Payments under the 1997 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 October, the earliest possible commencement date under EU regulations and some £85 million was paid to 94 per cent of applicants within one week of commencement of payments.  The current position is that over £89.5 million has been paid to 99 per cent of applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payments under the 1997 special beef premium and suckler cow premium commenced on 1 November and 3 November respectively.  The EU regulations provide that payment cannot commence <Col N="244" /> until 1 November and that only 60 per cent of entitlement can be paid.  To date over £116 million has been paid under these schemes. Eighty-three per cent of special beef premium applicants and 78 per cent of suckler cow applicants have now been paid.  It should be noted that by way of derogation, the European Commission allowed member states to pay an 80 per cent advance under the special beef and the suckler cow premia schemes in 1996.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that this year priority was accorded to making payments under the 1997 arable aid scheme in view of the very severe harvest conditions which affected some parts of the country.  It is also the case that almost 6 per cent of 1997 cattle headage-beef cow and suckler cow applications cannot be processed for payment at local office level because they are under query with the farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>Payments are continuing to issue to farmers under all premium and headage schemes.</P>
    <P>While the requirements of the land parcel identification system which is fully operational in 1997 under EU rules have been a complicating factor in processing the various premium and headage applications this year, it is expected that most remaining eligible applicants will be paid in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 1997 ten months special beef premium on 19 animals in all, 16 on 6 February and three on 15 May 1997.  On his 1997 area aid application he declared 38.46 hectares of forage area and opted for the official milk recording scheme figure to be used in calculating (a) the number of dairy cows needed to cover his milk quota and (b) his overall stocking density.</P>
      <P>Pending receipt of the official milk recording figure, the 897 gallon national average milk production figure per cow had to be used to calculate (a) the number of dairy cows needed to deliver his milk quota and (b) his stocking density.  As a result, he exceeded the stocking density of two livestock units per hectare set out in the relevant EU regulations and his special beef premium advance payments were cut back accordingly.</P>
      <P>However, the milk recording scheme figure has been supplied by him recently and will now be used, therefore, to recalculate the number of special beef premium grants to be paid to him &mdash; that figure indicates that there will be no cutback for this reason in the number of animals to be paid.</P>

The society is of course a voluntary organisation and any assistance which my Department may provide from time to time supplements the funding which the society raises from other sources. Grants totalling £100,000 have already been made to the society by my Department since September 1995 to assist its operations.  I will consider providing further financial assistance to the society if available resources permit.</P>

It is the policy of the Office of Public Works to vacate such premises and upgrade Civil Service accommodation whenever possible.</P>
      <P>An opportunity to move to a new building of adequate size arose last year and Valuation Office management decided to avail of it.  The relocation is scheduled to take place in March 1998.  Having regard to some concerns expressed about this move, however, I propose to review what has been decided to see if their concerns can be alleviated.</P>

      <P>Cardiac surgery waiting lists are maintained at four centres &mdash; the Mater Hospital, St. James's <Col N="249" /> Hospital, Cork University Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. Adult cardiac surgery is carried out at the Mater Hospital and Cork University Hospital.  Paediatric cardiac surgery is performed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that I have recently approved a sum of £1.7 million under the 1997 waiting list initiative, specifically for cardiac surgery patients.  As in 1996, the aim is to reduce the existing national cardiac surgery lists; specifically the number of patients waiting over 12 months.  My Department's strategy for achieving this aim involves the purchase of additional cardiac procedures and the selection of suitable patients for medical cardiac therapies.  I am confident that this will impact positively on the cardiac surgery waiting list.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional cardiac surgery facilities is a matter of national importance and one which will require significant capital and revenue investment over the next few years.  The question of the provision of cardiac care services overall is under review at the moment.  However, I hope to be in a position to bring my proposals to Government in this regard in the very near future.  An announcement will then be made on the location of additional cardiac care services.</P>

      <P>I understand the decision by Irish Ferries, a privately owned company, to discontinue the use of Cork port was taken on purely commercial considerations and as such I have no function in the matter.  The company has, however, announced an improved and upgraded continental cruiseferry service for the 1998 season between Rosslare, Cherbourg and Roscoff.  This service will increase capacity for tourist traffic, vehicles and freight busines and I welcome the company's continued commitment to the continental route.  I understand that the service will begin next April and will operate according to a new schedule which allows for consistent departure and arrival times with early morning arrival times in France and Ireland to better facilitate passengers driving onwards to their holiday destinations.</P>
      <P>I have not spoken directly to Irish Ferries about its decision to discontinue the use of Cork port, but my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, replied to Deputies in the House on the Adjournment on 19 November in relation to this matter.  It is too early to assess what impact, if any, the decision to discontinue the use of Cork port will have on flows of continental tourists to and within Ireland.  The new vessels being chartered by Irish Ferries will provide for increased capacity for tourist traffic and vehicles and will offer higher standards of on-board facilities which should prove attractive to potential visitors.  While the distribution of visitor flows within Ireland is primarily a matter for the regional tourism authorities and the tourism industry itself, I am concerned about improving regional spread generally, as we all know that recent growth in tourism has not been benefiting all regions to the same extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month I announced an extra £5 million for Bord Fáilte by way of Supplementary Estimate <Col N="252" /> this year, which will facilitate tourism promotion and marketing for the coming season.  I have asked Bord Fáilte to design a series of new initiatives for the 1998 campaign, targeted not only at maintaining tourism growth but more particularly at addressing regional spread.  Further details of this initiative will be announced after I move the Supplementary Estimate for my Department in the House on 11 December.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium attaches particular priority to the remedial education area through its commitment to equal opportunity and the priority it attaches to the provision of remedial teachers and resources for children with special learning difficulties. It is my intention to honour this commitment in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>At present, there is a total of 1,242 remedial teachers in the primary system and a further 350 in the second level system.  These posts have been allocated on the basis of priority of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> An initial survey of the remedial service by my Department's inspectorate demonstrated a need to reorganise existing provision to achieve a more effective targeting of resources.  It also identified a need to place much greater emphasis on preventive strategies in schools, including early identification strategies and differentiated teaching.</P>
    <P>In order to address these matters, my Department, in consultation with the education partners, has now commenced a thorough remedial education study.  The study is focusing on the numbers of pupils receiving a remedial service; the criteria for inclusion in and withdrawal from remedial classes; the organisation of remedial teaching in schools; the development and implementation of policy on remedial teaching in schools; record keeping and reporting.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the study will be of value in the context of the future development of the remedial service and in determining the optimum level for the remedial service.</P>
    <P>I am also reviewing provision across the entire special needs area, including the remedial area, to ensure that all resources which become available are utilised to maximum effect.</P>
    <P>I regret that the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of schools in each constituency which have requested and been refused a remedial service is not readily available in my Department.</P>
