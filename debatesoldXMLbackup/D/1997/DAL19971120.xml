      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies McManus and Jim Higgins.  I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I call on Deputy McManus to state the matter of which she has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific matter of public interest, namely, the release from custody of five persons charged with offences involving drugs worth in excess of £3 million, apparently as a result of procedural errors; the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that a full investigation is carried out into the circumstances of their release; and that appropriate steps are taken to ensure that such a blunder does not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Mayo)</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to enable the House to debate the following urgent and important matter, namely, the release from custody by the Dublin District Court on Tuesday last of five persons connected with the recent high profile seizure of £3 million worth of cannabis on the basis that the accused had been unlawfully charged; the subsequent rearrest and charging of the individuals in question; the subsequent release of the five detainees yesterday on the basis that they had not been properly rearrested under section 2 of the Drug Trafficking Act; and the urgent need for proper procedures to be applied to enable the individuals in question &mdash; three of whom remain at large &mdash; to be rearrested, charged and tried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On Item 12 which concerns the problem of drug abuse, will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform speak in the debate, and will he deal in the debate with the matter raised by Deputies Higgins and McManus about the enforcement of the law on drug abuse and the failure of agencies under his control to deal adequately with this matter?  Does he accept responsibility politically for this?</P>

Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has been very free in the past in demanding accountability from others, accept his share of accountability in the House in a debate which, happily, will take place?</P>

That is what is relevant on the Order of Business.  Will this Minister, who never kept his mouth shut when in Opposition, open it in Government?</P>

You prevented this debate on the Order of Business.  The first item of business is the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Bill.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  I am pleased to have the opportunity to open the debate on Second Stage of this Bill, which provides an opportunity to review the development of the functions of my Department relating to inland waterways and the newly assigned responsibility for islands.  Deputies will have an opportunity to express their views on the development of our inland waterways and on the offshore Islands.  I look forward to hearing those views.</P>
      <P>The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, now the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, was established by the then Government in 1993.  The former Roinn na Gaeltachta constituted the core of the new Department, with functions and staff from a number of Departments transferring to form it.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Service and the Waterways Service were subsequently transferred from the Office of Public Works.  I take this opportunity to commend the Office of Public Works for its excellent stewardship of the national heritage and inland waterways in the years prior to the transfer of these functions.  Specific responsibility for the offshore islands was assigned to my Department following the formation of the Government.</P>
      <P>Our inland waterways are a living part of our industrial heritage with their own unique ecology, all of which must be protected.  Their leisure, amenity and tourism potential should be developed.  The completion and maintenance of the connected waterways network and the promotion of leisure activities and tourism are my priorities.  Under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, a major programme of investment amounting to some £20 million is well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Grand Canal main line stretches 131 kilometres across the country from Dublin to the Shannon.  An offshoot, the Barrow line, is 45 kilometres long and connects the main line with the River Barrow in Athy, County Kildare.  Improvements planned for the Grand Canal under the operational programme have been largely carried out.  These involved the repair of several kilometres of embanked sections where the canal runs through bogs; the installation of several hundred mooring posts; the provision of new jetties, quays and slipways; improvements to landing <Col N="317" /> facilities at locks; repairs to a dry dock, and improvements to culverts.</P>
    <P>The Barrow Navigation is a river navigation with lateral canals bypassing shoal stretches.  It is 69 kilometres long, 17 kilometres in lateral canals, and extends from Athy to St. Mullins, County Carlow below which the river is tidal before entering Waterford harbour.  The programme of works is well advanced and includes dredging the navigation and lateral canals; the provision of new landing facilities, moorings, quays and slipways, and the restoration of a dry dock in Graiguenamanagh, County Kilkenny.  Some of the finest scenery of any waterway is found along the Barrow Navigation.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal stretches from Spencer Dock on the River Liffey, through the north side of Dublin, to the northern reaches of the Shannon. It is 145 kilometres long.  There is a small branch line of eight kilometres to Longford town.  Under the operational programme, £7 million is available for restoration.  Approximately 80 kilometres are navigable from Dublin to Mullingar, County Westmeath.  In Dublin, removal of the low level railway crossing at Newcomen Junction, North Strand Road, will commence shortly and the installation of a new lifting bridge in its place will remove the last remaining obstacle to navigation to and from the River Liffey.</P>
    <P>Dredging of the main line is completed.  There are three sections where the canal runs through bogs.  This year a start was made in repairing the embankments in these areas.  The removal of nine culverted road crossings in County Longford and one in County Westmeath which impede navigation must be undertaken.  Consultants have submitted preliminary reports setting out various options in terms of the design and cost for six of the bridges in County Longford which the Department is examining.  A contract was recently placed for the removal of the culverted road crossing and the raising of the road bridge on the Dublin road in Mullingar and works are under way.  When completed next summer, a further 30 kilometres of navigable waterway to Abbeyshrule, County Longford will be available.</P>
    <P>My Department has commissioned a firm of consultants to examine the existing water supplies to this canal which are on the low side for navigation purposes and to ascertain where new supplies can be obtained.  A programme of lock gate replacement is under way.  This should be completed in 1998.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Navigation offers some 258 kilometres of cruising waterway through the centre of Ireland.  It is a great success story with approximately 550 boats available for hire catering for approximately 50,000 tourists per annum.  A number of significant improvements are under way or planned.  These include the extension of the navigation from Lough Key along a new canal approximately 1 kilometre long to a point close to Boyle, County Roscommon where a new harbour is to be constructed.  The new canal will have ancillary facilities such as mooring, car parking <Col N="318" /> and a shower-toilet block.  This project is under way.</P>
    <P>In Limerick city the excavation of the Abbey River, the reconstruction of Sarsfield Lock, the construction of a new weir and the provision of floating moorings are planned and work is expected to get under way next year.  This project will greatly improve navigation between the freshwater and tidal reaches.</P>
    <P>The extension of the Shannon Navigation to the River Suck will allow navigation from the Shannon to Ballinasloe, County Galway.  This requires the construction of a new lock in Poolboy, which is well advanced, and the provision of mooring facilities in Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>The Rivers Agency in Northern Ireland, in co-operation with my Department, has commissioned a feasibility study of the possible restoration of the Ulster Canal which would reopen the link between Lough Erne and Lough Neagh. This detailed study will include a full topographical survey; a condition survey of the canal and associated structures; environmental considerations; a water supply and demand study; a navigation study, and a preliminary appraisal of the economics of the options.  It is expected that the results of this study will be available in the new year.</P>
    <P>Restoration of the Ulster Canal would complete the last major link in the connected waterways network on this island and allow boats to navigate from Waterford estuary in the south east to Coleraine on the River Bann in Northern Ireland.  However, any question of its restoration will have to be carefully considered in the context of the results of the feasibility study and, in particular, the major costs which would inevitably arise.</P>
    <P>Government policy on our offshore islands is for the first time under the aegis of one Government Department with the islands getting individual mention in the title of my Department.  The section of my Department dealing with the islands is being established in na Forbacha, Galway and the process of appointing staff commenced last week.  It is my intention, in co-operation with the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, who has specific responsibility for the islands, to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the access requirements of the inhabited islands.  Because of their geographical isolation, island communities are hindered in their development by inadequate and irregular transport services and have to bear higher transport costs.  It is the priority of all islands to have a socially desirable year round minimum level of secure transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has visited most of the islands and is in the process of analysing the priorities outlined to him during these visits. Access was one of the main issues brought to his attention on each island visited.  In consultation with local authorities and other interested parties, it is my intention to draw up a comprehensive five year plan to ensure populated islands, Irish and English speaking, have suitable access.  Because a <Col N="319" /> number of organisations are involved in the provision of access services to islands, the strategy in the past has been somewhat fragmented.  With overall policy for the islands firmly established in my Department and with the other Departments and organisations involved with island requirements fulfilling their role, I am confident that with the guidance of the Minister of State the problem of access and the associated problem of landing facilities will be satisfactorily addressed during the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>Our offshore islands have contributed in no small way to Irish life, particularly in terms of culture, history and language.  We have a duty to preserve and promote this unique inheritance.  In implementing the action plan for the islands, it is my intention to address the many other issues raised with the Minister of State by islanders during his visits with the priorities identified by the local authorities.  As everyone is aware, the Minister of State has an abiding interest in the lives of islanders.  He will continue to ensure their voice is heard at the highest level.</P>
    <P>Fundamental services such as roads, electricity, water and refuse are essential so that islanders can participate fully in the economic and social life of the nation.  Declining population is a major problem for most of our offshore islands.  The report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Island Development highlighted a 35 per cent fall in the overall population of our offshore islands between 1961 and 1991.  This, coupled with the fact that the average age of the populations on the islands is increasing, has major significance for the economic and social life of our island communities.  It also affects the demand for public services such as health and education.  It is heartening to note that the 1996 census figures show an increase in the population of some of our offshore islands.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has a particular interest in the matter of health services.  He will continue to work with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards to see what can be done to ensure access to health services for islanders at equal cost.  He will also pay special attention to the question of education.  On 19 September 1997 the Minister for Education and Science announced that the means test associated with the remote area boarding grant for secondary school students was abolished from the commencement of the 1997-98 academic year.  In co-operation with the education authorities, every effort will be made to provide education services on islands where the provision of such services is sustainable.  I regard the displacement of young children so that they can avail of schooling on the mainland as having a negative effect on the island communities.  It is our intention that the Interdepartmental Committee on Island Development will co-ordinate activities pertinent to those Departments represented on it.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to address deficiencies in the powers and functions of the <Col N="320" /> Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands which have come to attention over a period of time.  My Department is still a relatively new one and it is no surprise, given this fact and the varied nature of its functions, that certain issues require to be addressed in legislation.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for a comprehensive definition of inland waterways and a schedule of waterways to which the provisions of the Bill will apply.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that I may add to, delete from, or amend an entry in respect of an inland waterway in the Schedule, by order, which must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Under this section it is open to either House to pass a resolution annulling such order.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the powers and functions of the Minister in relation to inland waterways. Section 3(1) provides a broad role for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in the management and development of inland waterways.  As Minister, my powers and functions in relation to inland waterways are restricted to the Grant Canal, the Royal Canal and the navigation of the Barrow under the Canals Act, l986, to the navigation of the Shannon and Shannon Erne waterway under the Shannon Navigation Act, l990.  As Minister I have no statutory role in relation to any other inland waterway and am precluded from involvement in any other.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2) provides that I may exercise any of my powers under the Canals Act, l986 and the Shannon Navigation Act, l990 in relation to any inland waterway included in the Schedule but without prejudice to the rights of others under those Acts.  For example, this subsection would allow me exercise my powers to enter on any land to carry out works under the Shannon Navigation Act, l990 in relation to the Grand Canal or, should it ever arise, in relation to the Ulster Canal, within this State, or in relation to any other inland waterway which might be added to the Schedule in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 3(3) provides that, as Minister, I shall be empowered to carry out works to public roads where such work relates to my functions in respect of inland waterways.  I am at present precluded by statute from carrying out works to a public road within the meaning of the Roads Act, l993.  In the context of the extensive programme of developmental works under the operational programme to which I referred earlier, this has given rise to some serious problems.  For instance, it has emerged that Morans Bridge over the Royal Canal at Mullingar is a public road within the meaning of the Roads Act, l993.  Consequently, I am precluded from replacing this bridge &mdash; work which is necessary for the restoration of navigation.  In addition, the necessary grading required on each side of the new bridge would involve works to a public road.  To overcome this problem, officers of the Office of Public Works, who have the necessary legal power under the Commissioners of Public Works (Functions <Col N="321" /> and Powers) Act, l996 are acting as project managers.  Similar problems are in prospect in relation to other bridges over the Royal Canal.  The provision in this subsection will enable me, as Minister, to arrange for the necessary restoration works to proceed on schedule in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that, as Minister, I may finance the building, acquisition, overhaul or repair of vessels suitable for the operation of ferry services to inhabited offshore islands in the State and to subsidise such services.</P>
    <P>At present, under the provisions of the Aran Islands Transport Act, l946, as Minister, I may contract for:</P>
    <P>A shipping service available to the public for the transport of passengers and goods for reward between the city of Galway and the Aran Islands.</P>
    <P>Beyond that I have no specific power to subsidise ferry services to islands in general.  Therefore, this section clarifies the position and will facilitate the implementation of the five-year access plan for the islands to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out my powers and functions in relation to land and other property ancillary to my other functions, including power to acquire an inland waterway, to acquire intellectual property, deal with buildings or other property, either alone or jointly, or through an agent, and provide financial assistance in respect of matters related to my functions.</P>
    <P>The Schedule specifies the inland waterways to which the provisions of the Bill apply and includes the Ulster Canal.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of this Bill, a technical problem which has arisen <i>vis-a -vis</i> section 10 of the Heritage Act, l995 has been brought to my attention which I shall address by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill and compliment the Minister on its introduction.  I also compliment her predecessor, Deputy M. Higgins, on the foundations he laid in this Department.  This is a Department whose functions require co-operation across a very broad range of activities with considerable potential benefit for communities throughout the length and breadth of the country. Indeed such co-operation and co-ordination of effort should be the common denominator in any efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand this to be an enabling Bill resulting from the Minister's inability, through lack of power, to deal with necessary projects, to exercise her due ministerial right within her Department and the Office of Public Works.  I pay tribute to the personnel, in particular, the engineers, of the Office of Public Work.  Over the years, this unique State body was frequently the butt of derision in respect of the length of time it normally took to carry out works and so on.  Nonetheless, it is fair to say that, by and large, any work it has undertaken, or has been involved <Col N="322" /> in, has been an outstanding success.  Therefore, tribute must be paid to its engineers and staff generally in addition to the skills of their officers who engage in restoration works.</P>
    <P>I suppose I have a traditional liking for the Office of Public Works since my late father served as a Parliamentary Secretary and was responsible for that Office when, no doubt, I gained an understanding of what was entailed in their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Our inland waterways have enormous potential only now beginning to be realised.  That takes me back to my initial point of co-operation being required among agencies, organisations and communities generally.  The problem with waterways is that they were always perceived in glorious isolation as an engineering problem not related to the concept of development beyond that.</P>
    <P>In my term of office in the Department of Transport and Tourism it became very obvious to me that there is a growing understanding of the potential of the proper development of our inland waterways and its economic impact both in the Republic and Northern Ireland.  I worked hard to achieve a considerable degree of cross-Border co-operation so that people, irrespective of their political affiliations or religious beliefs could see that this kind of development had enormous economic potential for the benefit of everybody and that such co-operation was of enormous overall benefit.</P>
    <P>Within the statement of strategy in respect of waterways the Minister's remit is to complete the draft legislation for the establishment of an inland waterways navigation authority to complete the programme of restoration and development.  Her remit also requires her under the new Operational Programme for Tourism, to facilitate the recreational amenity and tourism usage of inland waterways and, finally, to conserve their industrial heritage and ecology.  These are matters only beginning to be understood in terms of their true potential.</P>
    <P>Our canals always were perceived as presenting an engineering problem, never as the living line on which communities living adjacent to them focused over many years and from which they derived considerable benefit.</P>
    <P>When replying I would like the Minister to spell out the concept, as she perceives it, of the co-operation and relationship obtaining between her Department and various other agencies and organisations which will have an impact on her endeavours.  For instance, what is the relationship between her Department and the various fisheries boards?  Public money is being pumped into these organisations and money is being raised by various means for the development and promotion of tourism, commercial and competitive angling.</P>
    <P>What is the relationship between the Minister's Department and the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards?  We know that 75 per cent or 80 per cent of British coarse anglers come to Ireland, 65 per cent or 70 per cent of <Col N="323" /> whom return because of the quality of the fishing and their enjoyable experiences here.  In that regard, co-operation is necessary.</P>
    <P>What is the relationship between the Minister's Department and Bord Fáilte?  If the Minister has statutory powers to take over inland waterways, deal with the issue of ferries to islands and so on, has she discussed the implications of that with Bord Fáilte in terms of what it does in respect of international marketing?  We are a unique island and a unique people and Ireland is not as environmentally destroyed as many other European countries.  That stands to our benefit but co-operation is required as well as the proper use of public money to get the maximum benefit from that type of promotion.</P>
    <P>What is the relationship between the Minister's Department and the regional tourism boards which promote facilities in their areas?  These boards encourage people to holiday in Ireland, a unique experience they may have bypassed for years.  Irish people tend to travel to every country and do not explore their own.  To travel the inland waterways or avail of the magnificent lakes in this country is a wonderful experience for those who have never done so.  In that respect, co-operation between the Minister's Department and the regional tourism boards is necessary.</P>
    <P>What is the relationship between the Minister's Department and local authorities?  Local authorities are the primary organ of development in any county and close co-operation in regard to the taking over of waterways, the development of access to islands, etc., between them and the Department is fundamental.  Far seeing county managers have great plans for the expansion and use of inland waterways, canals, lakes and offshore islands and in that respect there should be a close working relationship between the Minister's Department and local authorities.</P>
    <P>What is the relationship, if any, between the Minister's Department, the Department of Public Enterprise and FÁS?  FÁS schemes have been carried out in a number of the communities living along canals and in the vicinity of inland waterways to improve the look of these areas and hopefully encourage tourists to visit them.  In that respect the power being conferred on the Minister to provide for these works to be carried out should be exercised in co-operation with local communities.</P>
    <P>What is the relationship between the Minister's Department and the Department of Education and Science in regard to this matter?  We pride ourselves on our young population and constantly talk about this green island which is environmentally friendly and unpolluted.  The inland waterways represent an aspect of ecology which is the responsibility of the Minister to preserve.  The school curriculum reflects areas of this in a practical sense.  There should be close co-operation between primary and second level schools thereby encouraging children to appreciate, preserve and protect what is left to us in an ecological <Col N="324" /> sense.  The preservation of wildlife habitats along the inland waterways should be encouraged also as this wonderful resource is not available to many people in Europe or other countries.</P>
    <P>What is the relationship between the Minister's Department and the farming organisations?  Many of the inland waterways will be deemed special areas of conservation under the European directive.  It is important that the farming community, which is close to the environment and the primary guarantor of its preservation, is included in this.  It should be explained to farmers that this power will not interfere with their rights of development and that, within the criteria laid down, everybody will benefit both in respect of preserving the environment and the activities of farmers.</P>
    <P>What is the relationship between the Minister's Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána?  I understand there is an article in today's edition <i>of The Irish Times</i> to the effect that the canals and the Shannon navigation system may have been used in the past, is being or will be used in the future for the transportation of drugs. The scourge of drugs is an enormous challenge to this country and one many other countries have failed to eliminate.  Given the length of our coastline, it is difficult for the Garda to police it effectively.  If drugs are being transported on the Shannon navigation system it is obvious that there must be a working relationship between the Minister's Department and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal, the Royal Canal and the Ulster Canal are unique waterways.  They are the longest navigable channel in Europe.  When replying to Second Stage, I ask the Minister to deal with the proposals that emerged from the studies carried out some years ago on the Royal Canal from Spencer Dock to Allenbridge by Brady Shipman &amp; Martin.  I have read some sections of those excellent reports.  They lay out the entire strategy and, in an imaginative way, highlight an opportunity that needs to be exploited.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal, which was commenced in 1757, links Dublin to the Shannon, is 169 miles long and flows mostly through agricultural lands and the great bogs of the midlands.  From the Lucan Bridge Road its character changes to a suburban canal until it reaches the centre of Dublin.  In the book &ldquo;The Canals of the South of Ireland&rdquo; by VTH &amp; DR Delany, there is a description of the opening of the Grand Canal which is worth putting on the record.  It states:</P>
    <P>The opening ceremony was performed on 23 April 1796 by the Lord Lieutenant, the Earl of Camden, attended by Mr Secretary Pelham and his suite.  About twenty vessels with barges and pleasure boats followed the viceregal yacht <i>Dorset</i> through the entrance to the docks from the River Liffey.  A thousand persons partook of breakfast served in tents, and it was estimated that 150,000 members of the public were present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> I do not know whether the Minister has the intention or the capacity to restore that level of interest in the canal and the inland waterway system but in 1796, 201 years ago, 150,000 people turned up for the opening ceremony of the canal.</P>
    <P>The business of the Ulster Canal is of interest to me.  I had the opportunity to visit the Ballinamore Canal as Minister for Tourism and Trade.  This canal had lain closed and overgrown for almost 60 years. Whatever else is said about the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, the restoration of this canal was one of his primary objectives in a cross-Border sense.  A year after the Ballinamore canal was opened, 4,000 cruisers passed through the lock. The people who own these cruisers have money to spend and they want to participate in the unique experience of pleasure cruising in Ireland. The Minister should make the opening of the Ulster Canal a focus of her ministry.  I appreciate it is a major project and the Minister referred to the study being carried out on it.  Money for work on that project would be money well spent. Enough money will be squandered in Northern Ireland on various other projects to cover the cost of this project ten times over.  From an island perspective, imagine the selling power of that project.  One could travel by way of the canal system from Belfast to Shannon and to Dublin and the south east.  This mode of travel has a great following internationally.</P>
    <P>I would like discussions not only to take place between the rivers authority in Northern Ireland and the Department but the Minister to take an active interest in this at ministerial level and push for this project to be developed.  If she wishes, she could make it a millennium project.  Irrespective of political affiliations or religious beliefs, as a cross-Border project it has enormous potential in terms of selling power internationally.  This project would provide a unique opportunity to travel on one of the longest inland water systems in the world and the Minister should strongly promote it.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the potential of the Ballinamore canal and the work carried out on it by the Bord of Works, ESB engineers and others involved.  When the locks were dismantled and replaced it was evident the engineers who had worked on them 100 years ago had done as good a job as has been done now in terms of the stonework, masonry, the alignment and the configuration.  It is not necessary to have broad shoulders to move the gates now, smart cards will do that job now.  We can be justly proud of that project.</P>
    <P>There is potential on the canals for fishing, sailing, canoeing, swimming, house boats and other activities pursued on inland waterways.  Co-operation, proper management, proper use of the moneys allocated and marketing contribute to communities along the canals being able to derive economic benefit, jobs and prospects for the future.  Something they turned their backs on for generations can now become a central focus of their lives in an economic and jobs sense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> The book I mentioned by VTH &amp; DR Delany referred to a gigantic engineering failure in the attempt to link Lough Corrib and Lough Mask with what is known as the Cong canal.  It is about three miles long, but the fractured limestone in the district led to the water seeping away after the canal was opened and it was never used.  A quay side was provided in Ballinrobe and the four locks on the canal were never used.  Lough Mask and Lough Corrib are the second and third largest lakes in Ireland.  They are our great lakes and are unique waterways.  They provide potential for new opportunities.  Lough Mask will supply most of County Mayo with water in the next 20 years and Lough Corrib supplies water to Galway and Connemara.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the European Union ECOS overture scheme under which an initiative was proposed in the recent years to address the possibility of reopening and restoring that canal to the point where it could be used.  The view is that the moneys spent on canals at that time were diverted into railways and the will did not exist to plug the fractured limestone to facilitate the reopening of the canal.  There is a difference in depth of about 36 feet between Lough Mask and Lough Corrib and that would have to be taken into account. Lough Corrib is infested with roach but that is not the case in Lough Mask and that could be dealt with by proper screening and filtration.  Provision for that could be included in the Schedule of the Bill.  I would like the Minister when she replies to the debate to indicate the status of the ECOS overture initiative in terms of reconnecting the Lough Mask and Lough Corrib canal and perhaps she could give some assistance in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister's cousin, the Minister of State, has been very active in visiting the islands.  A picture of the Minister of State and his driver visiting one of the islands was carried in this week's <i>Mayo News.</i>  It is strange that he needed his driver to get to one of the islands.  It is good that he has visited most of the islands, but the time for action is now.  I understand this Bill was introduced partly because the Minister was constrained in terms of what she could do regarding legislation to deal with the Aran Islands.  This Bill gives the Minister great authority.  It provides that she may finance the building, acquisition, overhaul or repair of vessels, may subsidise such services and its sets out the functions and powers of the Minister in relation to land and other property as well as her other functions.</P>
    <P>I read the comprehensive islands document put forward by the Minister of State which has been accepted as the Government's programme for the islands.  The Minister has done well in the Estimates and if she can deliver on this programme over the remainder of her period in office she will do very well.  The provision of the islander allowance is something that does not require the powers under this Bill.  It is proposed that those islanders in receipt of social welfare are to get an increased allowance because of the cost of living <Col N="327" /> on islands.  That is addressed to an extent in the Minister's wish to have proper healthcare and education services and facilities on the islands. One of the outstanding access problems to any island is that which exists on Inishbiggle off Achill, which is one of the only islands that does not have a subsidised or proper ferry service.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Carey, who had responsibility for this area under the Department of the Taoiseach did a great deal of work in laying the foundations to deal with such problems and the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, can build on them and achieve progress.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Carey, brought into focus the Gaeltacht and non Gaeltacht islands off our coasts which had been forgotten for so long.  He brought them back into a central position.</P>
    <P>The powers under this Bill give the Minister the authority to bring the islands into the 21st century in terms of the provision of access and facilities.  Having visited the islands I hope the Minister of State has analysed the problems faced by islanders.  He said in the Dáil he would make his mind up quickly.  There is a good deal of money in the Department of Finance which must be spent this year and decisions made between now and the end of December could have beneficial results.  I would like the Minister when replying to this debate to indicate the decision taken by her and the Minister of State on the problem of access to Inishbiggle.  Will access be provided by way of ferry, cable car, bridge, aircraft or hovercraft?  The Minister of State discussed the options and said he would make up his mind quickly.</P>
    <P>There are access problems to other islands off the coast.  I assume the reason for including the powers to deal with islands, access to them and island ferries and their subsidisation is because the Minister and the Minister of State want to improve access to our inhabited Gaeltacht and non Gaeltacht islands to ensure they are all treated in the same manner.  I would like the Minister to respond to that.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's reply to a question on 14 October about the future development of the canals system.  However, one of the lessons I learned in the short time I was in Government was that when one considers the range of activities with which one must deal and the range of responsibilities one is given as a Minister it is difficult to achieve the progress one would want to achieve unless one defines one's priorities and pursues them in a ministerial sense.  This Bill gives the Minister the authority to do a really effective job in providing people with an opportunity to benefit themselves and their communities.  I would like to think that the Minister will show a high level of urgency and display ministerial flair in this matter by involving herself at every single opportunity in promoting this kind of benefit.  There is an opportunity for this ministry to impact effectively on the lives of communities that have drifted for years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> As regards the ratings of Ministers in this Cabinet, their term in office will not be long passing. I do not know whether it will be a year or two years, that is a matter for the people and probably for Ministers themselves.</P>

      <P>It will pass much more quickly than the Minister thinks.  She should not believe that by introducing Second Stage of this Bill it will revolutionise the country.  There will be many Ministers for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands before the Ulster Canal is open up to Belfast.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take that one issue on board and talk to her opposite number in Northern Ireland and the river authorities to make it a central issue of her ministry.  In fact the thought crossed my mind of what the former Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, would have thought of the Minister introducing this Bill and confining herself to the bit of the Ulster Canal that is in this State, when Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution recognise the entire territory of the island of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill.  We will deal with this when it comes up on Committee Stage.  Its overall impact can be huge, but it requires the co-operation and co-ordination of the various bodies I mentioned.  It also requires the Minister to take a really active and responsible role in it.  I wish the Minister and her Department well in their endeavours.  In so far as we can assist from this side of the House in the promotion of these matters, we will.  They are for the benefit of the people and it is important to demonstrate the benefit for them economically, socially and in a community sense.</P>

      <P>I also welcome this Bill.  which is essentially a piece of housekeeping.  I recall having to prepare a Bill like this just before I left office and history intervened to ensure it is being introduced today.  I listened with great interest to the Minister and Deputy Kenny.  I was particularly moved by Deputy Kenny's suggestion that the Minister's relationship with the Ulster Canal would be something of the order of the relationship of Cleopatra with the Nile, should she be able to secure sufficient funding from the Department of Finance to complete this worthy project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht &mdash; which is now the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands &mdash; was established in 1993.  The former <Col N="329" /> Roinn na Gaeltachta constituted the core of the new Department, with functions and staff from a number of Departments transferring to form the new Department.  That is, indeed, as it was.  Apart from this Bill, which is necessary and which I support, the Minister also has my support for the ongoing work of that group of people which was assembled in 1993.  I do not have the files in front of me but my best recollection is that in those six weeks when I was Aire na Gaeltachta and based at 1, Grand Canal Street, urlár a cúig, there were about 57 people in the Gaeltacht department at the time, with most of them in Na Forbacha. When the new functions were added there were, if one included outdoor staff, more than 1,700. The figure of 1,763 comes to my mind.  I was frequently described as the first Minister with responsibility for empire building.</P>
    <P>I never realised that as people change from one side of the Dáil to the other, the language changes as well.  I wish the Minister luck with what I still regard as an understaffed Department.  A sentence early in the Minister's speech provoked me to remember the facts.  It mentions this necessary Department, which I had the honour to serve and the Minister now serves, as being one &ldquo;with staff from a number of Departments transferring to form the new Department&rdquo;, but not that many transferred.  For example, responsibility for arts, culture and film required many initiatives.  I remember going on an early inspection to the Department of the Taoiseach after which I am not so sure we left with half a dozen people.  Three might have been nearer the mark.  In the case of communications, which has responsibility for broadcasting, four people may have transferred.</P>
    <P>Long negotiations took place between the Department and the Office of Public Works, an agency that predates the establishment of the State.  Each went through an evolving process towards what turned out to be a fruitful working relationship in the new order of things.</P>
    <P>I am making these points from a sense of benevolence and to say that the Department was understaffed from the beginning in relation to the transfer functions.  Therefore, I was not defending the position with much enthusiasm when the Minister, then in Opposition, used to say there were staffing implications when I introduced legislation.  I have become converted to her view. There are staffing implications because &mdash; no more than what the Minister said during the debate on the Cultural Institutions Bill concerning the National Library, the National Museum and every other institution for which I had responsibility &mdash; what is the point in bringing in legislation unless one has staff?  There are serious staff shortages in that Department.</P>
    <P>This Bill would have provided an opportunity to restore to the Department its proper title of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  When I have tabled questions on this matter, I have frequently suggested that heritage, Oidhreacht in Irish, was an inclusive word and, indeed, it is.  The point I <Col N="330" /> made was that Oidhreacht in Irish includes an imaginative inheritance as well as the parkland that one would associate with the big house or the exploitative landed classes of the neighbouring island.  In that case Oidhreacht was a wider, richer word than heritage, but I never suggested it encompassed all the territory of culture.  Culture includes the contemporary and the future or, to put it another way, the unimagined past and that which has yet to happen.  So culture, in that sense, is wider.  That is an argument we can have again after an election when new titles of Departments are being allocated.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that I attached less importance to culture, because of the distinction I drew between heritage and the fullness of the definition of Oidhreacht in the Strategic Management Initiative, is unworthy.  It has now been said three or four times and the next time I intend to go back in detail to the process of writing the Strategic Management Initiative to know whose definitions were being imbued and whose were not.  I was not consulted on that point.  I would not say this if it had not been mentioned in the House.  I consider it unworthy.  The point of the matter is that we have a genuine difference of opinion and we can accept that.  I claim that culture includes the contemporary and the future.  It was a mistake to lose the word culture.  The thinking that guides my position on this is accepted by the British Secretary for Culture, Chris Smith, who changed his title from Secretary for the Heritage.  It is also the term used in every other member state of the European Union.  However, I do not want to become distracted by this point.</P>
    <P>I liked the Minister's presentation in terms of the importance of the waterways.  I congratulate her on the lengthy but useful description she gave.  Waterways have an industrial history and they also tell us about the communities which lived beside them.  Waterways were often neglected by our generation.  People were not familiar with their history or that of the mills which stood along them.  As an island people, we neglected the marine and turned our face from the sea for many reasons, including historical ones. These important canals and waterways are striking features on a map.  It was interesting to hear Deputy Kenny's description of the royal personages of the 18th century.  We are glad we have moved on from that and I hope we never return.</P>
    <P>I will give one example which amplifies what the Minister stated.  I recall when the barge restoration project was advertised too many people and communities wanted to become involved. There was no way the demand could be met.  I mentioned earlier the problem of establishing a new Department with extensive functions which created great difficulties for many staff.  I want to place on record my deep appreciation of the staff who accepted change, particularly when they were understaffed.  It is good to see people embracing a new order with enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>We should be clear about the people who influence views on the canals and waterways.  Mr. Dick <Col N="331" /> Warner, for example, attracted a huge audience with his documentaries and films on the waterways.  These programmes have not only been watched repeatedly by people in Ireland but have been sold abroad.  I once described Mr. Dick Warner as a floating poet because his work on the subcommittee of the Heritage Council, as a film maker and as someone who uses the waterways of Ireland has been inspirational.  Deputy Kenny mentioned others, such as Ms Ruth Delaney.  Those who have become involved in the development of waterways are perceived by many as being addicted to it.</P>
    <P>It is challenging to think about opening the work which will take place during the lifetime of the operational programmes to schools and communities.  Perhaps the most significant development in the general Dublin area was the involvement of communities in terms of working groups in implementing strategies.  Letters from cross people who claimed objects were fired at them are not written as often as they were.  I believe too much was made of such letters at the time because the Department was in the process of establishing the relationships of which I speak.</P>
    <P>While everyone is impressed with the finished work and expertise of the different sections of what was the Office of Public Works, now part of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and its antiquity should be respected, the procedures and decision making process are archaic.  This Bill addresses some of those problems.  The idea, for example, that a Minister could negotiate and allocate money for a particular project but would be completely disempowered to spend it, even on an agency basis in some cases, makes no sense at the end of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>We should try to emphasise what projects are good and positive.  For example, the Minister mentioned Limerick city and the reconstruction of the Sarsfield Lock.  That is a striking example of co-operation between a Department, local authority and several other agencies.  It is also an example of the people getting treble value for money in co-ordinating the construction of sewerage facilities and water activity expenditure.  The community got three or four times more than it would have received without such co-operation.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the problems on Inishbiggle will be solved next week because the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, said he would decide between a hovercraft, a cable car, a boat or a bridge before his next Question Time.  I wish the people of Inishbiggle well because they have waited long enough for this.  I remember when I was Minister the choice was a cable car or a hovercraft, which had to be tested.  In his reply, the Minister of State upbraided me for tabling a question in English about an Irish speaking island.  From now on when I speak about the Irish speaking islands, should I follow the injunction of the Minister of State and do so in Irish or should I continue to try to strike a philosophical balance?  As I do not share his view on such matters, <Col N="332" /> I thought it would have been better for him to concentrate on the problem of access to the island, with which I am familiar.  I know a number of families there who have come back from England.  This problem, which was raised in English, will be solved next week.</P>
    <P>I rarely ask questions about local issues, but I am not clear about the situation regarding the Eglinton canal.  I presume the Minister will not buy it.  If she wants to carry out work on Parkaverra Lock and other such areas for which funding was allocated, would that be possible under the changes in the Bill?</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill is followed by another one which will give the Minister more flexible powers. I was deeply disappointed with the attempts to reform the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act and the strategic management initiative which was dominated by the Department of Finance.  In terms of public administrative reform, we should, at the end of this century, move towards giving greater autonomy to the Minister who will, in turn, be accountable to the House.  For example, the idea &mdash; as a former Minister I will say it in case other Ministers forget to say it or, in expectation of their future preferment, choose not to say it &mdash; that I found the business of developing a programme with expert input, establishing timescales and negotiating the money and having to clear every little bit of expenditure, both of a capital and current kind, a completely backbreaking exercise.  It made no sense whatever.  The ideal would be for the Minister of the day to stand up in the Dáil and take responsibility for expenditure.  The Minister should have the power, freedom and flexibility to do that.</P>
    <P>Deputies from north of the midlands and Ulster are probably in a better position than anybody to speak about the enormous contribution which the canals can make to their lives, to tourism, the economy and societies.</P>
    <P>The procedures are slow.  To fire a question here about the mid-term review to concentrate people's minds, while the Minister refers in her speech to a certain expenditure which had been agreed in relation to the different Operational Programmes, how have things come out of the mid-term review?  Are we in expectation of the addition of further projects to the general waterways area or will money be taken from some projects?  It would be useful if this was mentioned in the Minister's reply.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis the hoileáin, aontaím le gach iarracht atá ar siúl chun é a dhéanamh níos éasca do na hoileánaigh bheith i dteangbháil leis an mórthír.  Thar na blianta ní raibh daoine sásta leis na háiseanna a bhí ar fáil dóibh ó thaobh cursaí farantóireachta de.  Luaigh an Teachta Kenny cupla nithe eile.  Tá comhoibriú ag teastáil agus b'fhéidir nach raibh sé ar fáil i gcónaí idir na húdaráis éagsula, ar nós comhairlí contae srl, agus is minic go raibh na Ranna Stáit in iomaíocht lena chéile, Roinn amháin ag déanamh an-obair agus Roinn eile gan a bheith réidh chun tosnú, agus, <Col N="333" /> tar éis cupla bliain, an dara Roinn ag iarraidh rud éigin a chur ar fáil a bheadh i bhfad níos éasca agus níos saoire a chur ar fáil dá mba rud é go raibh an Roinn sin réidh chun tosú ag an am céanna.</P>
    <P>With regard to that co-operation in relation to the islands, access is the biggest single issue for islanders.  It is valuable that the Minister of State has visited the islands and that he will come up with proposals.  I do not understand from the Minister's speech how the balance has been achieved between the Irish and English-speaking islands.  I welcome a more sophisticated approach towards the matter, but when I was Minister I recall the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, asking me about the working language in my office, which was Gaeilge, and the working language at Na Forbacha.  I remember him saying to me once, in the course of one of these friendly exchanges between Dáil colleagues, that he had heard English in the background, that he was speaking on the telephone in Irish but English could be heard in the background.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to go around with a sound detector to ascertain not only that we were doing all our business through the medium of Irish but that there were no external sounds coming in.  The point is that if this is the case, one welcomes decentralisation to Na Forbacha.  Will all the islands have their welfare discussed?  That would be a good thing.  Has that policy decision been taken?</P>
      <P>In addition, there are other practical issues beyond access about island life which do arise. The Minister rightly addressed one which was very interesting, the importance of people being able to complete their education as close as possible to their community.  There are specific requests to the Department and to the Department of Education and Science, where certification goes beyond junior level, to enable the full school cycle to be completed locally.  If that is possible, it makes enormous sense.  There is a specific request at present in that regard from the Aran Islands.</P>
      <P>There are also a definite set of proposals from Dr. Broderick, among others, in relation to medical care on the Aran Islands and the way it might be facilitated.  There is another set of proposals in relation to those who were looking for an extension of the regular users' ferry subsidy to take account of air transport, that is, a regular users commitment for islanders.  All these measures would improve the quality of life on the islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the health services there is a question beyond that to which I referred in relation to the island doctor.  There used be regular representations about the right of people to die on the island with dignity rather than having to move to old people's homes on the mainland.  I had the great privilege of knowing a very distinguished Aran Islander and poet, the late Máirtín Ó Direáin. <Col N="334" />  We were friends.  He spent about one year at UCG around the time I was on temporary leave from politics.  The electorate and I had not renewed our contract in 1977&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;so we had the benefit of talking a great deal.  He wrote a very beautiful poem <i>Stoite</i> about being torn from an island.  The poem is about the fact that he was a civil servant in Dublin and he could never really resow the root of the dockleaf.</P>
      <P>For older people, for whom Irish is their first language, there is a very good home in Carraroe, the facilities of which were expanded by the last Government.  There is another good one in Clifden, which is a day centre for English speaking people.  The provision of care for Irish speaking islanders in their own setting is long overdue.</P>
      <P>It is nonsensical in that beautiful part of the country, in which I live and which I represent, that people's names are being translated into English right, left and centre.  Minister of State Ó Cuív was a one-man monitor of me in all this when I was Minister but now he has a wonderful chance to straighten it all out.  Since he became Minister of State there has not been a marked improvement in the actions of the county council, the corporation, the health board, the ESB or other bodies in treating people as equal citizens. It is all very fine to give a long, boring speech about the importance of the Minister's thinking in all this but implementing it is another matter.  I hope something will be done in this regard before more lectures and homilies are delivered to me should I ever have the good fortune to change to the other side of the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny has more than adequately covered some of the other islander issues, particularly how the people are all inspired by the Minister of State having come among them.</P>
      <P>Another part of the Minister's speech, which relates to the ownership of intellectual property, is intriguing and I welcome it.  I understand that will help in relation to the original legislation in relation to the Arts Council, but it is worthy of expansion by the Minister.</P>
      <P>By way of being positive, I want to make a recommendation to the Minister in this regard. I remember looking at a property on which the Department was interested in spending money and upgrading.  I want to emphasis that there is no shortage of enthusiasm in local communities in terms of involvement.  I mentioned the barge restoration projects already.  We went to see the people who had come forward to be involved in these projects in co-operation with FÁS and the idea of giving people back something good was welcomed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes has arrived and I must inform him that I found myself in an entirely absurd position because I could not provide adequate help to the Barrow.  If this Bill provides such help, that is another reason for supporting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="335" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed that out to the Deputy on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no shortage of enthusiasm for good projects.  However, there must be co-operation with local groups and educational bodies to develop the community aspect and make the canals part of a heritage approach. The new mindset in the waterways section of the Department has no difficulty in perceiving itself as part of that approach.  However, integration is the way forward and a narrow, technical view would represent a retrograde step and be a recipe for disaster.  The more such projects enter the public realm, the more people will support them.</P>
      <P>There is need for concern about another matter.  People sometimes proceed with enthusiasm and begin cleaning waterways without sufficient care.  In each instance where the assistance of the Department's waterways section has been sought, it has proven invaluable.  Unfortunately, or fortunately, there is now an ecological dimension to our waterways.  It is necessary that the ecological balance, not merely in terms of water birds and plant life but of other ecosystems related to the inland waterways, be taken into account.  Our inland waterways have an enormous potential for future use.  One need only compare the waiting periods for using such amenities in other European countries, such as the Netherlands and England, to the situation in Ireland.  However, it is important that the other dimensions to which I referred &mdash; I believe they justify the appointment of ecological specialists &mdash; be taken into account.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wishes to bring forward proposals to introduce further legislation of this sort, contrary to attitudes adopted by people in the past I would support the use of such consultancies as are necessary.  It took much time to draft this Bill.  For many years, people have been informed that it takes from seven to nine years to train an apprentice draftsperson.  It appears that such individuals are grown in one narrow furrow.  Legislation cannot be prepared because of the lack of qualified staff, which is nonsense.  The Minister should be free to employ consultants to draft the necessary legislation.  Even if this were flawed, it could be democratically debated by the House. We should not be forced to wait for housekeeping or management Bills of this kind.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill and I wish the Minister well. If it emerges on Committee Stage that the powers involved must be extended, I will support the necessary measures.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy de Valera on her appointment as Minister and I wish her well in her Department during the next four and a half years.  Likewise, I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the lifetime of the previous Dáil, important legislation was put through both Houses by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  The Acts in question added considerably to the legislative base for activities in the areas of arts, culture and <Col N="336" /> heritage.  The Minister and her officials are to be complimented on bringing forward this Bill because it represents a further important administrative landmark in the identification, cultivation and preservation of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands gives the Government and the Minister the opportunity to address and redress the regional imbalance that has occurred in the establishment of arts, culture and heritage centres throughout Ireland.  In that context, I ask the Minister to bear in mind the need to invest, on a regional basis, the substantial Structural Funds that have been made available in recent years to ensure that the regional imbalance in arts infrastructure is redressed and, particularly, to take into account the need for investment in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>With the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland, we have an ideal opportunity to strengthen North-South co-operation.  Fortunately, there has been considerable co-operation between the Arts Council and its counterpart in Northern Ireland and substantial progress has been made.  It is important that common links such as culture and heritage, which are shared by everyone on this island, be given recognition.  We must take the opportunity to build on those strengths.  In nominating members for appointment to boards and councils under the control of her Department, the Minister should give favourable consideration to people of distinction in the appropriate disciplines from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The province of Ulster is endowed with a rich heritage.  The first human settlement in Ireland can be traced to 8000 BC at Mount Sandel, County Derry.  The Neolithic or new stone age gave rise to the first farmers and traces of their settlements can be found in Counties Tyrone and Limerick</P>

      <P>The erection of megalithic tombs in that era gave us the splendid tomb at Cohaw, County Cavan, where extensive and valuable research has been carried out.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Michael D. Higgins stated, our schools and educational institutions have a vital role to play in the preservation and nurturing of our heritage and culture.  A visit to the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at Cultra, Hollywood, County Down is a most enlightening and exciting experience.  Such visits should be highly recommended to all schools and adults.  It would be interesting to know the percentage of schools from the South that have visited that institution. The museum gives major coverage to the history of the flax industry and the general heritage and history of Ulster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The province of Ulster has numerous and valuable historical societies such as those at Breifne, County Cavan and Farney, County Monaghan and others in Counties Armagh and Donegal.  I hope the Department will provide practical assistance <Col N="337" /> to such groups, where necessary, with their publications and take on a co-ordinating role in their work.  Those societies are carrying out important work and making an enormous contribution to the preservation of our rich heritage.</P>
    <P>The development of county museums has been welcome.  The establishment of such a museum at Ballyjamesduff in County Cavan has provided a great boost to the tourism sector and local people interested in revisiting their history.  The development of these museums provides a much needed tourism and visitor focus for counties and regions. I pay tribute to Dr. Wallace, Director of the National Museum, and his colleagues for facilitating the transfer of items of local and national importance to Ballyjamesduff so that they could be preserved for the county in a permanent facility.  Such items have more meaning and greater historical relevance in that environment than they would elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I believe that we require decentralisation.  In that context, local authorities and other community groups can play an important role in the care and management of our rich history.  My local authority, Cavan County Council, is co-operating with local groups to preserve that history and it has carried out extensive research on the possible development and linkage of monastic sites in Counties Fermanagh and Cavan.  The sites in question are St. Mogue's Island, Drumlane and Trinity Island in County Cavan and Boa Island, White Island and Devenish Island in County Fermanagh.  The decision to concentrate on island monastic sites will create an alternative tourist amenity based on two central factors, namely, their location on major navigational waterways and their rich historical and archaeological content.  The development of this proposal would be an ideal cross-Border project and I hope the Minister, her Department, Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works will give it favourable consideration when the disbursement of Structural Funds takes place.</P>
    <P>The Government's 1994 national development plan proposed to invest in products for specialist tourists.  The monastic island sites proposal has the potential of being marketed towards those specialist visitors.  St. Mogue's Island on Templeport Lough has the remains of a 6th century church ruin.  The 12th century settlement was established by St. Mogue who received his training at Clonard under St. Finian.  The discovery of St. Mogue's shrine was made on this island.</P>
    <P>Trinity Island on the shore of Lough Oughter has the remains of the Abbey of the Premonstratensian Canons founded about 1250.  The Romanesque doorway in Kilmore Cathedral is thought to have originated on Trinity Island, and there are headstones of note dating from the Middle Ages up to the modern age located on this island. All of this is on part of the waterway which comes under the jurisdiction of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The oldest building at Drumlane Abbey is the round tower, with a round-headed doorway and <Col N="338" /> windows.  Beside the tower stands a medieval church which is thought to date back to the 13th century.  The western doorway preserves some fine stonework with unusual features of Bishops and Abbots of the 15th century.  Also included are carvings of a monarch on the outer side of the doors and windows.</P>
    <P>Devenish Island is a very important site on lower Lough Erne and the earliest buildings are the church of St. Molaoise, one of the best examples of a round tower in Ireland.  A museum was established on this island in 1976 and it preserves many of the stone fragments found on the island.</P>
    <P>Boa Island is renowned for its two highly unusual stone carvings found at Caltragh Cemetery on the island.  White Island contains the only complete round headed Romanesque doorway surviving in the Six Counties, and it is also well known for its stone figures.  An early Christian date has been given to these monuments. One of the central links between these locations is St. Mogue who was born on what is now known as St. Mogue's Island.  The saint is linked with Drumlane, and when he attended St. Finian's School at Clonard he befriended St. Molaoise who later moved to the Devenish Island monastery.  Similarities can be struck between the round towers at Drumlane and Devenish and artefacts discovered on Devenish have strong similarities with the Romanesque architectural features found at Kilmore Cathedral and which may have originated on Trinity Island.</P>
    <P>Presumably, life on these islands varied little due primarily to their common physical location. The common themes should be developed and made available not just as a visitor attraction but also as an enrichment of our own understanding of history.  The similarities, and indeed the differences, between the various monastic sites should be an interesting theme to develop and would provide a useful alternative tourism product particularly in the southern part of the province of Ulster.</P>
    <P>Some of the islands I have just spoken about are accessible from the restored Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal, now known as the Erne-Shannon waterway, and the extension of the Erne Navigation southwards from Belturbet to Killykeen to Killeshandra would provide access to Drumlane. This proposal affords an opportunity to increase the range of culture and heritage tourism products within the country, particularly with the development of these monastic sites along the Erne and Lough Oughter complex.  Tourism within the Border counties can only benefit from such a development in terms of employment and improved cross-Border relations.</P>
    <P>I commend the manager and members of Cavan County Council for their initiative in drafting this proposal.  I appeal to the Minister, as I have done in written representations and earlier documentation, to give this proposal the practical financial assistance it needs at this time.</P>
    <P>The decision by a Fianna Fáil Government in <Col N="339" /> the late 1980s to restore the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal was a courageous and imaginative one.  It is paying economic dividends for the local economy in Fermanagh, Leitrim and Cavan.  The restoration of this historical amenity and the revitalisation of the 19th century link has created a continuous inland waterway of 875 kilometres, which uniquely enriches this country's tourism potential and provides one of Europe's best leisure amenities.  A commercial value can be put on the restored canal, and that can be measured in the number of tourists and weekenders, the number of cabin cruisers provided and the general influx of visitors.  However, we should also take into account the fact that the restored Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal is a fragment of Europe's past and that it is now a living and working piece of the 19th century that has returned to life. Broadly speaking, the cut stone bridges have been preserved with some modification and considerable repair.  I pay particular tribute to the Office of Public Works, their engineering and waterways divisions in particular, for the outstanding work they did in preparing for the restoration of that canal.  Great credit is due to those officials and to ESB International who did the restoration of the canal.  Every element of that reconstruction was organised to ensure the animal, bird, fish, insect and plant life along the derelict canal were preserved in their natural habitats.  The cross-Border nature of the project proved that co-operation can be readily achieved between bodies on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>At this stage I appeal to the Minister to progress another proposal before her Department, that is, the extension of the Erne Navigation southwards from Belturbet to Killykeen Forest Park and Killeshandra.  This project would be complementary to the restored Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal.  It would also add considerably to the economic well-being of Killeshandra, Belturbet, Ballyconnell and their hinterlands as well as the southern part of County Fermanagh.  In the context of recent political developments on this island I appeal to the Minister to give this project priority in view of its cross-Border nature.  The project is worthy of funding and it would be particularly apt to fund it at this time when we are hearing so much about cross-Border co-operation and funding is being made available specifically to strengthen the economy of the Border region that suffered so much for 28 years and more.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Sargent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mixed feelings about welcoming this Bill.  While certainly in this legislation starved parliament, since this Government was elected, the presentation of any Government legislation is welcome, I am somewhat disappointed with the contents of this legislation.  There is an expectation that when a new Government is elected, it will bring new legislation before the House, that it will have new and imaginative approaches to <Col N="340" /> issues, and initiate some degree of reform.  I see no evidence of reform in this Bill.  In a way it changes nothing, with the exception of one matter to which I intend to return later.  It does a bit of administrative tidying up, but it does not introduce any real reform in terms of our approach to the freshwater resources of this State.</P>
    <P>As has been stated by previous speakers, our inland waterways and our freshwater system have been greatly undervalued.  We have almost 400,000 acres of lake, almost 90,000 miles of river, and the Minister gave the figures relating to the mileage of canals.  They are a hugely important resource.  They provide us, in many cases, with our source of fresh water and drinking water, although the question of extraction is a matter for debate.  They provide an important inland fisheries resource, navigation, and a method of drainage, however flawed it may be at present in some parts of the country.  They are also a source of leisure and they constitute a great ecological richness in themselves.  It is indicative of the fragmented way in which we approach fresh water that the Minister in introducing this Bill did not mention pollution, drinking water, fishing or leisure activities such as swimming.</P>
    <P>This reflects the confusion and overlapping in regard to the management of freshwater resources.  The question of ownership is totally fragmented, the Bill goes part of the way to clarify the ownership of some waterways and gives certain functions to the Department.  The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has responsibility for inland fisheries.  This means one arm of the State owns the water, while another arm is responsible for the fish in it.  A multiplicity of agencies and Departments have responsibility for the protection of inland waterways.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency, under the water pollution Acts and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, have particular responsibilities in relation to water pollution and licensing for emissions into water systems.  The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the fishery boards have certain functions under the fisheries Acts, while the Department of Agriculture and Food has certain functions under REPS.  For example, Teagasc has a role in relation to the environmental protection of the waterways.</P>
    <P>When there is an environmental incident such as a major fish kill, a multiplicity of agencies and Departments have responsibility and there is no clear focus on how to deal with it.  Likewise in the case of flooding, the Minister's Department, local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government have a responsibility, while the Department of Agriculture and Food has a role in so far as run-offs etc., from farms are concerned.  When it comes to dealing with how to manage the waterways we have an administrative mess.</P>
    <P>There are also conflicts about the use of the <Col N="341" /> waterways which have not been resolved.  For example, there is a conflict between navigation and fishing interests.  The Minister referred to the extent to which the Shannon system will be opened up to navigation.  However, there was no reference to the impact of this on fishing in the river.  There are also conflicts between those who want to whiz around on jet skis in lakes and those who want to stand on the bank with a fishing rod. These conflicts will continue to grow as an increasing number of people buy boats and jet skis to use on lakes.  There is also an obvious conflict in terms of pollution.  It has been suggested that some of the pollution incidents on the Shannon relate to the increased navigational activity. I do not know if this is true and perhaps it could be examined.  There is a degree of confusion and lack of co-ordination in regard to every area of activity on waterways.  As no one is really in charge there is a degree of neglect.  The Bill will not change anything in this respect.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we are not debating legislation which would fundamentally change the way we look at fresh water.  All the reports published by the United Nations point out that the coming crisis on the globe relates to fresh water.  The sources of fresh water are running out, while the quality of drinking water is in decline.  I do not have to emphasise the importance of drinking water in terms of our sustainability and health.  Fresh drinking water is rapidly becoming a scarce resource.  It may not yet be a crisis here but we should make preparation for it.  Instead of adding to the titles of Departments it would be better to fundamentally reform the way in which Departments are constituted and on what they focus. The time has come to set up a ministry for water which would be responsible for ensuring the protection of water systems, the provision of fresh and clean drinking water and the management and maintenance of inland waterways.  It could also be given overall responsibility for preventing pollution, protecting inland fisheries, etc.  This would bring together the resources, energy and commitment within the existing State agencies which have a role in relation to the waterways. This would be real reform and it is the direction in which we should be going.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to a specific aspect of the Bill with which I will deal in greater detail on Committee Stage.  Section 5 gives the Minister the power to acquire, create, hold, maintain and dispose of land, including an inland waterway.  I understand why she is being given the power to acquire, create, hold and maintain inland waterways but why is she being given the power to dispose of them?  What canals, rivers or lakes is the Minister contemplating selling?  This House should not give her the power to sell off inland waterways in any sense.  This is not an abstract issue to raise, particularly in light of the question raised on the Order of Business by Deputy Stagg who drew attention to the plans by the Central Fisheries Board to sell off the fishing rights on several rivers.  The Minister needs to quickly <Col N="342" /> address the Government's intentions regarding the possible sale of inland waterways.</P>
    <P>The House should not give the Minister the power to sell inland waterways.  They are held by the State for all the people and that should remain the position.  We should not give the Minister the power to sell the people's heritage.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Gilmore as a chuid ama a roinnt.  The Bill is very far from being a substantial one.  It may need to be passed by the Houses to enforce the division of responsibilities agreed by the Government parties on the commencement of their term of office but it treats two important aspects of the work of government in an unimaginative way.  Administrative control of specified, largely man made, inland waterways and overall management of the ferry services as they operate between inhabited islands and the mainland may not be of relevance to many people or represent a large percentage of the land area of the country but they are areas of responsibility which, if carried out with proper diligence, will greatly enhance our collective quality of life and, hopefully, guard against further loss of life.</P>
      <P>The inland waterways as specified in the Bill are few in number.  Even in this short list there is a wide divergence in terms of standards.  The two large canals, the Grand and Royal Canals, seem to operate a type of aqua apartheid as they weave their way out of Dublin, the Royal Canal being decidedly less regal these days, while the Grand Canal has seen the greater benefit of what passed for renovation work in recent years.  Even as these two canals trace their respective routes across the country, restored glories mingle with still tawdry differences.  In many cases the good work is largely carried out by concerned people within local communities.  Those people often do great work without Government assistance.  The Office of Public Works has done itself proud on some stretches of waterway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell navigation one can see the results of a well structured, Government supported restoration programme. The resources for that project came largely through the good offices of the European Union. The discrepancy between voluntary restoration projects and the golden cow of European regional development funded programmes is not addressed in the Bill.  The Bill lacks the vision needed to bring our inland waterways up to a required standard.  Responsibility for the Shannon navigation is one of the more curious features of the Bill.  The Shannon, one of the mighty rivers of Europe, should be our environmental jewel but instead it has become the receptacle for many of our ecological sins, with effluent from every source, industrial, agricultural and domestic.  Lough Derg in particular has become a dying sea.  Our acceptance of pollution levels of the Shannon has become so casual that commentators no longer express surprise or shock that communities adjoining the river cannot expect a <Col N="343" /> clean supply of water, as is poignantly the case in Nenagh, County Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands joins the many other Government Departments and State agencies responsible for the Shannon.  This multifaceted management approach has created the river's ongoing problems and certainly will not bring about the necessary solutions.</P>
    <P>Our island ferry services are, as the late Lord Boyle-Roche would say, a different kettle of bulls' horns.  Under the Bill the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has responsibility only for ferry services to and from inhabited islands, giving the impression that adequate ferry services already exist.  That is patently not the case.  There is no provision in the Bill to increase the standard of transport to and from our islands.  I have some experience of islands along the west and south-west coast and tá Oileán Reachrainn san Dáil ceantar, Lambay Island.  Access to that island is difficult, not because of any decision by the owners of the island but because of the new rules relating to ferries, which were timely, particularly following the Castletownbere tragedy.  My last visit to Lambay Island was in 1984.  Island life is a unique experience for visitor and inhabitant.  While Lambay is a privately owned island, the real owners are the wildlife, which are much tamer and not as threatened as wildlife on the mainland.</P>
    <P>Ferry services to our larger islands have improved significantly in recent years.  Access to islands with smaller populations is very difficult and safety standards are inadequate, sometimes resulting in unnecessary loss of life.  It seems the Minister is not prepared to tell us how she intends to deal, particularly financially, with the problems of island communities.  If resources were made available, islands could be provided with modern transport and up-to-date communications, which would banish forever the isolation of island life.</P>
    <P>An ideal opportunity was presented on Cape Clear to harness renewable energy but, because of petty political considerations, the system of wind energy operated by computer and linked to a diesel generator was not developed.  The people on that island will have to continue to depend on the mainland.  Island communities need assistance and it behoves the Government to ensure they have the capabilities to maintain their independence and dignity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this Bill.  The canal system, which symbolises a much more easy going age, forms part of our industrial heritage.  Anybody who followed the leisurely sojourn of Dick Warner through the canals and waterways some time ago on RTÉ will have been saddened by the lack of monitoring of these amenities.  I, therefore, commend the Office of Public Works and, more recently, the staff of the Department on making considerable strides in restoring the Royal, Grand <Col N="344" /> and Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canals.  I was particularly impressed by the scope of the plan published last year for the upgrading and development of the Grand Canal.</P>
      <P>The Royal Canal in my constituency has not been accorded the priority it deserves.  Some stretches in the inner city are far from well kept. It is a pity so much debris is allowed accumulate in the canal for long periods.  Shopping trolleys, pallets, tyres and other garbage bobbing in the water at Binn's Bridge reflect poorly on the managers of these facilities.  With planning, effort and the co-operation and active involvement of local communities, the Royal Canal has enormous potential.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal for the removal of the low level railway crossing at Newcomen Junction, North Strand, to be commenced shortly, and its replacement by the installation of a new lifting bridge.  That will be of enormous benefit to that part of the city.  Much work is needed on the stretch of canal from Finglas via Croke Park to Spencer Dock.  That area has enormous potential.</P>
      <P>The canal is used extensively by schools, such as Colaiste Eoin in my area in Finglas, to introduce students to canoeing and water sports generally.  While the attitude of the authorities to such uses has improved since the days when the canals were under the control of CIE, there is still a tendency by some people to discourage children from using the canals.  The area along the canal should be opened up so that facilities such as cycleways and pedestrian trails could be provided in the medium term.  The Finglas-Cabra partnership, with the support of the EU Urban Programme, addresses the tourism potential of the Finglas-Cabra area.</P>
      <P>The Tolka Valley Committee is working on a plan to develop the river from its source to the sea.  Dublin Corporation is doing the groundwork for the making of a special amenity order for the Tolka River and the three local authorities involved, Meath County Council, Fingal County Council and Dublin Corporation, have prepared a water quality management plan for the river. Following the closure of the Dunsink landfill site, a comprehensive development plan has been prepared for the general area.  I hope the Minister's Department, as the custodians of the Royal Canal, become active participants in these developments and discussions.</P>
      <P>I want to address one or two other issues relevant to the Minister's Department.  In recent years the Hugh Lane Gallery at Parnell Square, under the capable and creative directorship of Barbara Dawson, opened its doors to thousands of visitors to the city.  The gallery and the nearby Writers' Museum are two sought after tourist destinations&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair. I welcome the Bill, but much work remains to be done to promote our canals, waterways and islands.  It is regrettable that many of our lakes have been allowed to deteriorate significantly.  It is long past the stage when our islands should have been integrated into the mainland provisions for society.  Many island communities feel extremely isolated.  I commend the Minister on the initiatives she announced earlier and compliment her on introducing this enabling legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Bill could be regarded as enabling and clarifying, it is regrettable it did not deal with some of the issues to which Deputy Gilmore referred.  I had hoped that in dealing with inland waterways the Bill would have resolved some of the turf wars that take place constantly and which in times of crisis make it difficult for the many public authorities to deal effectively with pollution, the more general management of the quality of our inland waterways and other emergencies.  It would be unfair to criticise the Minister or her predecessor for having a rather narrow focus in this area, but it is worthwhile recording that an opportunity has been missed to comprehensively clarify the boundaries between the different functions of the various authorities dealing with inland waterways.  This is not a criticism of any particular authority.  It is, however, a criticism of our system which simply allocates functions and powers to people in a rather unco-ordinated fashion.  We should be more concerned about the functions that need to be done rather than those of individual agencies and Departments.</P>
      <P>I am delighted some matters have been clarified in the Bill and that the Minister's powers regarding canals, in particular, and the Barrow navigation have been outlined.  I hope that clarification and the enabling provisions of the Bill will accelerate the works that need to be done. The Minister referred to the Barrow navigation and correctly spoke of the provision of landing facilities, moorings, quays and slipways.  I have the pleasure of having several good friends who recently provided a new slipway on the River Barrow in Athy.  They built it in a week and the only funding they received was the amount bet by the President of the Chamber of Commerce who said they would not build it in that time.  That slipway will be useful for local young people participating in water sports for the first time.  I commend them for their work, but it is a pity they had to do it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Athy, which has many attractions, has had only one development in terms of services along the Barrow for navigation purposes, the installation of a long overdue sanitary pumping unit for cruisers <Col N="346" /> using the navigation.  I am sure the Minister would agree a great deal of work remains to be done to make the Barrow navigation system an important part of our inland waterways.  Until this is done, unfortunately, it will be possible for the Minister and her successors to say that this waterway has yet to be discovered by a large number in the boating fraternity and by business interests dedicated to tourism.  The reason is that the facilities on the Barrow navigation are not capable of dealing with the volume of waterborne traffic the river and the countryside along it merit.</P>
    <P>Our canals are capable of being developed into a significant tourism resource.  While developments are taking place, they are being hampered by the lack of infrastructural investment, particularly in the form of slipways, berthage, sanitary facilities and the general cleaning of the waterways.  The pace of cleaning operations is incredibly slow.  It seems to take forever to clean any stretch of canal and, to put it at its mildest, the pace of work seems to be very relaxed.  People living along the system seem to be better informed than those running the operation about the location of vessels with the equipment to cut the weeds but not about the manpower to man them.</P>
    <P>The banks of our canals also have a substantial recreational and tourism potential.  Our canals traverse the varied countryside of our midlands. For much of their length they traverse the central bog which, contrary to what many people believe, offers a wide diversity of landscape and flora and fauna.  The canals are also very varied.  In some parts they form a straightforward trench and in others they are raised on an embankment above the level of the surrounding countryside.  There are also a number of interesting aqueducts through which canals traverse roads and rivers and many of our bridges are of historical and architectural significance.  Some of them must have been pure hell for people who had to carry goods over them in horsedrawn carriages because they are the most humpbacked one could cross in a long day's travel.  However, that is part of their charm and of our industrial and commercial history.  A great deal of work is required on the embanked sections of our canals and on some of the aqueducts to bring them up to a satisfactory state of repair.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a number of ongoing works on the improvement of the Grand Canal which need close attention.  I am sure we want to avoid a situation such as that of a couple of years ago when a section of an embankment on the Grand Canal simply collapsed and led to the closure of that section of the canal for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>The canals are flanked by towpaths, which are included in the definition of the canal as set out in the Bill.  I am delighted with that inclusion because I wish the Minister to pay particular attention to the towpaths.  They were originally constructed to allow very heavy horses to pull heavily laden barges by the use of tow ropes.  In <Col N="347" /> many parts of the country canal towpaths became highways for pedestrians and people travelling on horseback.  Many sections of canal bank provided convenient shortcuts for people going about their business.  In some parts of the midlands the canal is the shortest distance from one town to another and it is not surprising that the canal banks became well travelled.  Even today where there is a roadway running along a canal bank, one can be sure one is taking the shortest route from one town on the canal to the next.</P>
    <P>The towpaths are no longer needed for their original purpose.  As a result many stretches of canal banks are oases of peace and quiet and many others have become overgrown.  Some stretches have fences and barriers of various types where none should exist.  There are places where there is a constant battle between the canal authorities and people who live or have property near the canals to prevent those people erecting unauthorised barriers to traffic along the canal banks.  It is sad that the canal authorities have been putting up new barriers recently where there were none.</P>
    <P>In many cases in the vicinities of towns canal banks have become places where people can walk in comfort and safety.  Unfortunately, in some places the banks are so overgrown as to be inaccessible.  Many of the towpaths have been designated as part of the walking trails being promoted for the pleasure of walkers and in other areas they have become venues for coarse angling. However, they are not used to their full capacity. Many stretches of canal bank would make ideal ground for horse riding.  I speak as somebody who has experience in that regard.  I have derived great pleasure from many areas where canal banks provide miles of good, unobstructed ground with a good view of scenery and plenty of space for horse riding.</P>
    <P>However, the canal authorities have taken the extraordinary step of banning the use of towpaths for horse riding.  The excuse given, which is reasonable in some cases, is that stretches of canal bank frequented by walkers are not suitable for horse riding.  This is not true.  There are places where the two uses would not mix but that is not to say the banks are unsuitable for horse riding. I have heard it said that stretches of canal bank where anglers are to be found are not suitable for horse riding.  As a horseman I consider that patent nonsense.  Nobody would ride a horse as near to the bank as one would find an angler sitting.</P>
    <P>It is beyond doubt that there are stretches of canal bank which are little used by walkers, anglers or anybody else which would provide ideal ground for riding establishments, bringing Irish people and visitors closer to the countryside.  I will illustrate this point from my own experience and in doing so I confess a fault.  It is the nearest I will be found to be <i>in flagrante delicto</i> on a canal bank.  I have frequently ridden on the banks of the canal between Rathangan and Monasterevin in County Kildare where the authorities do not <Col N="348" /> like horse riding.  Indeed, they have busied themselves putting up new barriers.  On the many occasions on which I have ridden along both sides of that stretch of the canal, I have only once met a pedestrian &mdash; a local farmer.  I meet cattle more frequently.  On the stretch of the canal in the immediate vicinity of Monasterevin I have often met walkers and sometimes anglers.  On the stretch to the south, on both sides of the canal, from Monasterevin to Fisherstown, County Laois, where I have ridden many times, I have never met a pedestrian.  Yet, the canal authorities maintain that by riding along those banks I make life difficult for people who want to walk there.  This, in places where I have never seen a pedestrian.</P>
    <P>To my great regret, repeated representations to the Minister's predecessor and to three previous Ministers of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works have been met with what I call charitably a blank and uncomprehending refusal to change a policy which seems to have come about because the Office of Public Works won a case in Mullingar in which it wanted to keep a riding establishment off a section of the bank on which it had spent a lot of money to make it suitable for residents who wanted to walk there.  That was the right approach in that case. However, they have expanded that victory beyond its proper boundaries.</P>
    <P>The matter was not helped by the learned judge in the case who, according to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16 March 1995, said that allowing people to ride horses along the canal bank would be &ldquo;.akin to declaring that the public had a right of way on the platform of a railway station, even though they were present for no purpose ancillary to the railway company or its passengers.&rdquo;  That is a judicial gaffe if ever I heard one.  To liken the banks of the canals to the platforms of railway stations is to stretch the ingenuity of our revered Judiciary beyond its limits.  The judge went on to say, reportedly, that in essence the claim by the operator of the riding centre was &ldquo;.that there existed a public right of way to persons on horseback along the canal towpath.&rdquo;  He found that the presumption is that there is not such a right of way.  That may well be the case.  It is within the gift of the Minister to give such a right of way, if she wishes, to allow access to people on horseback for certain stretches of canal.</P>
    <P>I hope she will ignore some of the advice received by her predecessors.  In a letter to me in November 1994 one of the Minister's predecessors in function, not in office, included in the objections that people in the area of Monasterevin found that the banks were being cut up by horses.  The letter indicated that there had been wide consultation with various groups that use the canal banks, one group representing horse riders and all the other groups representing people on foot or in sedentary occupation on the canal banks.</P>
    <P>It is no surprise that it was found that the majority of these groups were against horses <Col N="349" /> using the canal and extended that objection to parts of the banks they did not use.  Then I was told that in one case a family with several young children was potentially in danger from people riding horses along the canal bank.  I know the family well and urged Kildare County Council to build their house on that spot.  Whenever I rode along that stretch and the children were around, I made a point of stopping to have a chat with them.  There never has been the slightest question of danger because there is a road along that stretch of the canal bank.  The children are more at risk from their mother or visitors travelling along there in cars than from people riding horses.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to rethink this section.  If she does not want to take the risk of having too many areas for pedestrians along the bank, then at least sections of canal bank should be made available preferably for horseback riders.  I assure the Minister there is plenty of room for everybody on the canal banks, especially for those riding far lighter horses than the ones the banks were originally built to carry.  I hope the Minister will listen to this rather more impassioned plea than I am used to making and have second thoughts.  I hope she will build a little on the slight encouragement in her charming and somewhat disarming letter of September 12 by announcing at the end of the debate that there is room on the banks of our canals for people who just want to ride through the countryside and admire it from a facility that was put in place for us more than 250 years ago.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill which is a great step forward in allowing for the multi-functional use of canals. I live in Galway city, the Venice of the west, as does the former Minister, and the possibilities for our waterways are limitless.</P>

Tá an Bille seo, ainneoin nach bhfuil ann ach píosa beag, ag tabhairt cumhacht don Aire déileáil leis na fadhbanna seo agus féachaint chuige go gcuirfear na báid ar fáil agus fordheontais, más gá.</P>

Beimid ag díriú air sin,</P>
    <P>I am pleased that, as Minister of State, it will fall to me to redress a serious wrong that has been perpetuated over the years.  As an Irish speaker who has devoted a large part of his life to the Irish language I never understood why it was considered that non-Irish speaking islands were not entitled to services of equal quality to those on Gaeltacht islands, particularly in terms of the provision of ferry services.  Non-Irish speaking islands were at a serious disadvantage.  I am pleased the Bill provides the legal means to remedy that and the Government can press forward with plans to ensure all islanders enjoy equality of service.</P>
    <P>One of the crazy anomalies of the previous arrangement in place until recent times, was that the Gaeltacht islands were dealt with in terms of transport services, etc., by agencies which used only the English language.  Both sets of islanders were wrongly treated &mdash; one on the basis of service, the other on the basis of being forced to deal with the State in a language other than their own. I am delighted these matters have been addressed through a series of rapidly taken steps since the Government assumed power.  There is a dedicated Irish unit in the Department that can deal with the islanders' questions.  The staff are bilingual and can deal with the islanders through whichever language they find most convenient.</P>

Is féidir leis an Teachta Kenny a bheith cinnte tar éis mo chuairte ar Inis Bigil &mdash; mar a gheall mé dó, chuaigh mé ar cuairt ann &mdash; go bhfuiltear ag déanamh scrúdú grinn ar na moltaí éagsúla atá déanta chun teacht thar na fadhbanna atá ag an bpobal sin.  Ní thitfidh sé d'aon rialtas eile seachas an rialtas seo na fadhbanna seo a réiteach mar faoin am go nimeoidh muide as rialtas beidh soláthar ceart seirbhíse iompair ann go hInis Bigil.</P>

      <P>The position of education on the islands is a matter that ought to receive some attention.  People who live on islands suffer from an educational point of view.  Inhabitants of Inisturk in Clew Bay have to board either in Westport or in Clifden if they wish to attend second level education which is not available on the small islands.  This causes difficulties for the families, particularly since there are no boarding schools in the towns concerned.  It is necessary for the young people to take lodging in a boarding house and go to school from the house of a stranger.  That is not satisfactory from a social point of view.</P>
      <P>I have written to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, about this matter following a visit to Inisturk during the summer. The techniques of distance learning should be pioneered on the offshore islands.  There is an experiment with it at a new third level college at Skibereen.  An experiment with distance learning at second level would have considerable potential for the offshore islands to enable young people to stay on the island for the junior cycle or for the first two years of the junior cycle rather than have to board out at the age of 12 to attend a school in Westport or Clifden.  I agree that in the long run this is not viable as a means of bringing people up to leaving certificate level, it may not even be viable as a means of bringing people up to junior cert but it should be possible for the first year or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A problem is that there is a rigid distinction between primary education and primary teachers and secondary education and secondary teachers. That a primary teacher might supervise a student using distance learning in the first two years of second level would cause some difficulties in this very rigid division in the teaching profession between primary and secondary.  I do not underestimate the problems the Minister would have in pioneering distance learning at second level but <Col N="352" /> it is an issue that needs to be tackled.  People want to live on the islands but they must have as good or better an education as people living on the mainland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the criteria for a second teacher &mdash; not the same on the islands as on the mainland &mdash; in respect of which the Department has one rule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably a better example of the case than the one I have cited.  We should recognise we have technological means available to us now, which we did not have five years ago, to solve some of these problems.  I urge the Minister to look carefully at this matter so far as the position of the islands is concerned to ensure the provision of second level education is a priority.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, and have received a courteous reply but I have not heard that he will do anything about it.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to inform me about this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  It has been useful to hear the different points of view expounded by Deputies.  This Bill does not expand policy, rather it deals with the powers and functions of the Minister.  It is an enabling Bill.  I listened with interest to the different points of view particularly the need for further co-operation and integration of Departments on various issues.  We have agencies with great expertise.  The Government recognises the tremendous expertise, commitment and work done by the Office of Public Works.  The contribution by local communities is important not only to the functioning of the canals but to the history of our industrial heritage along the canals.  There is a good relationship with the local communities, as outlined in my opening speech and other examples have been alluded to by other speakers.</P>
      <P>The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has a close liaison through the regeneration officer with local groups, communities and schools.  I concur with the view that local schools should have an opportunity to learn about our canals and their heritage with a view to appreciating, looking after and promoting them in later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of co-ordination and co-operation between the various Departments, Deputy Kenny said Bord Fáilte has an important part to play in managing, promoting and marketing our canals.  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is attempting to provide that product by means of the renovation projects which are proceeding.  The allocation of moneys, not only by this Government but by the previous Government under the leadership of the former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, shows a strong commitment to our inland waterways.  We <Col N="353" /> have alluded not only to their use in terms of tourism but their value to the local ecology.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the role played by FÁS in the promotion of our inland waterways and congratulate all those involved in the various programmes. They have done invaluable work and have made the inland waterways more acceptable to the public and more accessible.</P>
    <P>I refer to the new cross-Border initiatives particularly the Ulster canal.  I could not agree more with Deputies on the importance of this canal.  People interested in inland waterways will be aware a report on the Ulster canal is being drawn up which I expect will be completed shortly.  I will be interested to read that feasibility study and from there we can decide how best to proceed.  In fairness I will not need any nudging northwards on this or any other project because as stated when I became Minister I have a great interest in seeing what we can do regarding cross-Border projects not only in inland waterways but in the arts generally.  There is a tremendous opportunity in the arts area to avoid being party political.  The arts can act as a facilitator in bringing groups and organisations together.  I hope that will happen during my tenure.</P>
    <P>While in the United States recently on business I attended the World Canal Conference as well as an informed conference on inland waterways at which I outlined in a positive light what has been done here and what we intend to do in future.  I agreed to host the 2001 conference in association with the Rivers Agency in Northern Ireland.  The occasion will present us with an opportunity to enhance knowledge and appreciation of our inland waterways.  The association of pleasure craft organisations in Britain is holding its annual general meeting in Dublin this weekend.  I am sure the delegates will be enthralled by the facilities which have been provided and the refurbishment works undertaken on our inland waterways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the Eglington Canal which, as he is aware, is owned by the Corrib Navigation Trustees with whom discussions are taking place about the Parkavera Lough project.  When I receive more information I will look at the matter in detail to see how the project can be progressed.  I will communicate with the Deputy directly.</P>
    <P>Deputies Gilmore and Sargent raised the question of pollution and highlighted the importance of clean drinking water and leisure activities such as fishing.  As all Deputies will appreciate, this is an enabling Bill.  These issues do not fall within the remit of my Department, although I realise their importance.  That is not to say we do not have a moral obligation in the broader meaning of the word to push for improvements.  I am aware of the difficulties caused by pollution in Lough Derg to which Deputy Sargent referred and have taken the opportunity on several occasions to highlight the issue to find a solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes made representations to me in <Col N="354" /> recent weeks with regard to towpaths.  In the days when they had large horses to which he referred they were used for a particular purpose and they did not have to worry about motorbikes or other vehicles.  Decisions were made by previous Administrations.  I am looking at the matter in detail and will communicate with the Deputy when I have reached a decision.  As he will understand, it is not a matter on which decisions can be made lightly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Deputy's views into consideration.  Although these issues may be regarded as amusing, they are nonetheless serious as we have to ensure the safety of all concerned, particularly pedestrians and fishermen.  They have to be considered in detail.</P>
      <P>There is need to conduct a detailed study of island life, with particular reference to health and education services.  The issue of education services was raised by a number of speakers, including Deputy Bruton.  The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Ó Cúiv, has been and will remain in constant contact with the Minister for Education and Science about the matter.</P>
      <P>Inis Biggle was mentioned by Deputy Kenny. He also mentioned it at Question Time recently. I am confident the Minister of State will base his decision on what local people want.  He has taken the opportunity to visit all the islanders to seek their views and learn of their difficulties and the issues they want to see resolved.  He does not believe a decision should be imposed from Dublin.  He has adopted the right approach.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore expressed concern that parts of our heritage may be sold off.  While I share his concern, it is not the intention to sell off any of our inland waterways.  If he wishes to seek further clarification I will be happy to provide it.  We will have an opportunity to discuss the matter on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>On the provisions dealing with intellectual property rights, the legal advice available to me is I do not have the power to acquire copyright or intellectual property.  We hope to rectify this in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the House on the recent Annual Report on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union prepared by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.  That centre was established in 1994, its headquarters in Lisbon.  Its task is to provide objective, reliable and comparative information at European Union level concerning drugs, drug addiction and their consequences.  The centre is governed by a management board with a representative from each member state in addition to nominees of the European Commission and Parliament.  The centre produced its first report on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union in 1996 and published its second report recently.</P>
      <P>Its 1997 report shows cannabis remains the most commonly used illegal drug throughout the European Union.  Depending on the country, it also demonstrates that between 5 per cent and 30 per cent of the relevant population have at least tried the drug at some time in their lives.  In most European Union member states amphetamines are the second most frequently used illegal drug, generally tried by up to 3 per cent of adults. Although fewer than 1 per cent of adults have ever tried heroin, it is the drug which gives rise to the greatest social and public health problems. It is estimated there are between 750,000 and 1 million heroin addicts in the European Union.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this second report which provides an important base for European Union policy formulators to compare and contrast the effectiveness of policies for drugs and drug addiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Ireland, a recent European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs &mdash; ESPAD &mdash; indicated that 37 per cent of the 2,000 16 year olds surveyed here had tried cannabis at some stage.  While the position in Ireland <Col N="356" /> is on a par with the position in the United Kingdom, this was high by comparison with other member states.  This data illustrates that we must continue to orientate our drug prevention policies toward our young people.</P>
    <P>I will avail of this opportunity to clarify certain facts in the arrest and subsequent release of the five suspects in relation to last weekend's cannabis seizure.  As most Members will be aware by now, the five suspects were arrested under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 and detained for an initial 48 hours.  In accordance with the provisions of that Act, the Garda then obtained a warrant from the District Court extending their detention for a further 72 hours. Later it became apparent to the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions that the District Court judge concerned had not been nominated for the purposes of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.  The nomination of District Court judges is a matter for the President of the District Court.  Members opposite are endeavouring to imply that I, as Minister, have some responsibility in this area.  Had the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 provided for the Minister to nominate judges and had there been a failure on my part to do so, I would be the first to accept responsibility.  However, the Act does not make any such demands on the Minister.</P>
    <P>By the time it became apparent there were difficulties with the continued detention of the suspects, the Garda and Director of Public Prosecutions had sufficient evidence to make an arrest for the purpose of bringing charges.  Therefore, the suspects were released and the Garda attempted to re-arrest them for the purpose of charging in accordance with section 4(5) of the Act which specifically provides for such circumstances.  However, the District Court judge refused to allow the re-arrest of the suspects and ordered their release.  I am also informed the District Court judge later refused to issue warrants for their arrest.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to the House &mdash; as will be evident from the facts I have just outlined &mdash; that this case revolves around a series of judicial decisions.  It is well established that it is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to comment on those decisions.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice shall exercise responsibility for the administration and business generally of public services in connection with the maintenance of public order.  This responsibility is discharged through various functional relationships which exist between the Department of Justice and what are generally referred to as law enforcement agencies, principally, the Garda Síochána, courts and prison services.</P>

Within our democracy, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day cannot, under any circumstances, be responsible for decisions made independently by the Judiciary. Were it otherwise, it would amount to interference with our courts by the Minister of the day.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's concern about the tragic circumstances of this case and I extend my deepest sympathy to the parents on the death of their baby daughter.  The provision of obstetric care in Sligo General Hospital is a matter for the North Western Health Board.  In response to representations about the case referred to by the Deputy, which were received in the Department of Health on 12 February 1997, the Department contacted the North Western Health Board for a report. Following direct contact by the family concerned with the North Western Health Board, the board on 13 March 1997 provided replies to the Department on each of the points raised.  A number of additional points were raised in the representations submitted to the Department by the family on 12 February 1997 and they were followed up by the health board during the period March to August 1997.  The health board submitted a detailed report to the Department on 19 August 1997, the contents of which would indicate that the matter has been referred to the Medical Council.  As the Medical Council has statutory responsibility for these matters, I hope the Deputy will appreciate it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this case at this stage.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree it is a matter of public concern to ensure the best possible maternity care is made available to a woman giving birth in a hospital, such as Sligo General Hospital?  Will he also agree that this matter should be further inquired into by his Department to allay any public concern that might arise and to ensure all questions raised by the parents who suffered this tragedy are fully and comprehensively answered?  Will the Minister indicate whether the responses received by his Department to date from inquiries made through the health board with the hospital will be made available to the parents of the deceased child to afford them an opportunity to raise any further queries <Col N="365" /> they may wish to raise?  Does the Minister regard the information supplied to the Department as in some way private and not available to the parents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was brought to my attention by way of the parliamentary question tabled by the Deputy.  In some respects it is difficult to comment beyond what I have said on the basis that the parents' solicitors may be involved and the board's reply to the Department in relation to the parliamentary question implied that civil proceedings may be taken.  I must investigate whether that is necessarily an outcome and whether we can make further information available in the light of the possibility of legal action, which the Deputy will appreciate is a constraint. The reply I gave is the most I can say about the matter at the moment.  The Deputy was kind enough to discuss it with me privately.  I will make further inquiries and revert to him in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If the parents were willing to give a written assurance to the Minister that they will not proceed with a civil action arising out of this matter would the Minister feel free to make available to them the information that is within his Department?  If his Department has not done so, will the Minister follow up, by way of inquiry, the detailed medical reports obtained from expert medical practitioners in England, which give rise to grave cause for concern regarding the background to this matter, and raise any queries that are required arising out of those reports to give satisfactory responses?  Will the Minister acknowledge that the parents, particularly the mother who had such a tragic experience in hospital, has a right to the fullest information and understanding of the events?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern regarding the rights of the mother and the need to be seen to try to deal with this matter adequately as far as they are concerned, however difficult that may be to achieve.  The fact that there have been solicitors' letters automatically means that people may not get further information which they would like.  There are constraints in that regard.  I am prepared to consider the position if the undertaking to which the Deputy referred is given by the parents.  Before they give me that assurance it would be incumbent on me to find out what more I can do prior to them waiving any rights they may have in that respect.</P>

He will appreciate the Medical Council is the body that deals with competence and fitness to practise and those type of issues. The Deputy indicated that his information is that the Medical Council is suggesting it will not be taking any further action and has no further point to make on this matter.  That information was not available to me in the short time I had to consider this file.  The best thing to do at this stage is to join the Deputy in noting and extending our sympathy to the family and trying to see how we might progress matters to their satisfaction, if that is possible.  I will keep the Deputy informed and will discuss the matter with him again shortly on that basis.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap l997-2001&rdquo; was published earlier this year and is based on information from the National Intellectual Disability Database.  The assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential-respite places and 1,036 new day places over the next five years.  As outlined in both &ldquo;Partnership 2000 for Inclusion Employment and Competitiveness&rdquo; and An Action Plan for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with a mental handicap in line with the needs outlined.</P>
      <P>I recently met the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland and I am fully aware of their views.  I am not yet, however, in a position to comment on the overall level of funding which may be available for any service in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a clear commitment in the Programme for Government to implement a five year plan for the development of mental health services.  I would have thought there should be some provision in the abridged version of the Estimates already published.  Will the Minister indicate, for example, what the staffing implications of the plan are and what plans he has to come to grips with them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be incorporated in the overall provision.  As the Deputy is aware, the <Col N="367" /> plan sets out the number of increased services that will be required over the period.  The real issue that concerns the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland is the need to deal with the requirement of new places.  The database confirms 1,439 new residential respite places and 1,036 new day places.  I intend to make significant improvements in the number of day places that will be made available in 1998.  On that basis I had a fruitful discussion with the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland some weeks ago.  Their concern is to make serious inroads in the provision of new places.  From 1998 onwards we will be able to do that.  In the past funding was used to deal with a backlog of places which, as far as I can see, had not been officially in the system up to now. Therefore, the amount of money that was being spent was not adding much to net new places in the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in some difficulty and I am not trying to score points.  I am genuinely trying to elucidate information.  In his response, the Minister seems to accept implicitly that the assessment identifying needs for residential and day places is a reasonable one based on the information available.  He will know that the assessment also details how much such places would cost and comes up with a total of £63.5 million. The Minister is able to say he will make significant improvements in 1998, yet he cannot give any information as to the nature of those improvements.  I am seeking information on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under section 8 of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1992, the provision of family planning services is, in the first instance, the statutory responsibility of the health board.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Athlone centre, I understand it was not until September 1997 that the Well Woman Centre made the Midland Health Board aware it was having serious problems recruiting doctors.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Well Woman Centre was in touch with my Department regarding difficulties in relation to referrals from the centre to Portiuncula Hospital.  My Department advised the centre at that time to contact the chief executive officer of the Midland Health Board to discuss the problem and possible solutions.  The hospital authorities have indicated to my Department that their consultants have not been approached along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>So far, the Midland Health Board has paid £30,000 set up costs to the Well Woman Centre in Athlone, £40,000 in revenue for 1996 and £30,000 to date in revenue this year.  The Well Woman Centre provides an alternative for women in the region and I share the health board's view that it would be a matter of regret if the service should cease.  I am aware that informal discussions have taken place between the health board and the general practitioners' representative organisation.  I have asked the Midland Health Board to continue its efforts to find a solution to the Well Woman Centre's current difficulties in Athlone.</P>

Will he assure the House that the difficulties the Well Woman Centre has experienced will be resolved within a relatively <Col N="369" /> short period?  Will he indicate whether he accepts there has been opposition from local general practitioners to the Well Woman Centre providing the service in Athlone?  Is he aware of the reasons for this opposition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the specific complaint about consultants being told there would be a problem if they were to take patients from the Well Woman Centre, as a result of inquiries made by the Department the consultants say that is not the case.  We have to take the consultants' word for that.  While Athlone is reasonably near to me, I am not aware of any local GP problem either, although I am aware from public comment that there seems to be some dispute regarding that.</P>
      <P>Informal discussions are taking place.  The possibility of the Well Woman Centre redeploying some of its people in Dublin to continue the service in Athlone is an option available to that organisation.  In the meantime, informal discussions will continue.  I cannot guarantee the outcome but the Deputy can accept the bona fides of the Midland Health Board, as expressed by the chief executive officer.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that in addition to providing the necessary medical services, the Well Woman Centre in Athlone exercises an important educational function in the context of dealing with women's issues and family planning?  Will he acknowledge that in its brief lifespan it has had more than 1,000 patients, which confirms the need for such a centre?  Based on information available to him, is it the Minister's view that the main objection, as voiced by the representative of the IMO in that area, appears to be that there is resentment among some members of the medical profession that the health board has partly funded the provision of this centre?  Does the Minister agree the Well Woman Centre is providing additional services over and above those normally provided by busy general practitioners?</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Well Woman Centre provides educational and counselling services.  It is an alternative to existing family planning services which the health board has supported and would be prepared to continue to support if it were possible to resolve some of the issues there at the moment.  It has not just provided services for Westmeath &mdash; people from adjoining counties also have availed of the services available in the Well Woman Centre in Athlone.

      <Quest>the extent of the risk of patients contracting new variant CJD from blood products supplied by the Blood Transfusion Service Board; whether all red blood cells will be filtered in order to eliminate the possibility of BSE related agents getting into blood products; the steps, if any, he is taking to ensure that the medical profession is vigilant in identifying possible cases of new variant CJD; and whether he intends to sanction additional consultative posts in virology and infectious diseases for the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20018/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>CJD is an exceptionally rare disorder of the brain which causes rapidly progressive dementia and eventually death.  Research has shown that CJD is caused by a unique prion protein which exists in a non-infectious form in all humans.  The mechanism whereby this non-infectious prion protein becomes infectious and causes CJD has been under intense study for many years.  Four types of CJD have been identified to date, including sporadic or classical CJD, the cause of which is uncertain, and new variant CJD. New variant CJD has only been identified in the past three years and is associated with a variety of symptoms and signs different from those found in sporadic CJD.  There have been no cases of the new variant CJD identified in the country to date.</P>
      <P>Scientific evidence from the UK has been reported which indicates that the prion protein in the new variant CJD cases shares similarities with the prion protein that causes BSE in bovines, thereby providing convincing evidence that these new variant cases of CJD, which occurred in the UK, were linked to BSE and almost certainly occurred because of the ingestion of BSE contaminated tissue.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the World Health Organisation held an international meeting which considered the risk of transmission of CJD by blood and blood products.  The meeting concluded that &ldquo;there is no proven or even probable instance of transmission of CJD by blood, blood components and blood products&rdquo;.  It was, however, acknowledged that clinical and neuropathological observations suggest that new variant CJD may behave differently from classical CJD and that further studies were warranted in this area.  In that regard, new evidence suggests that the agent which causes new variant CJD may be present in the lymph glands of patients with the disease.  In particular, the agent has been demonstrated in the tonsils of patients with new variant CJD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No data is available in relation to the transmissibility of new variant CJD by blood transfusion and early clarification of the potential for such transmission appears unlikely.  Notwithstanding the lack of concrete evidence in this regard, precautions are currently in place at the Blood Transfusion Service Board against possible spread of any infectious agent by blood transfusion.  These precautions, which are in line with <Col N="371" /> international practice, include the exclusion from donation of the following groups: persons with a family history of CJD &mdash; this is because on rare occasions the occurrence of CJD may be more common in persons with relatives who have been affected by the disease; donors who have had treatment with material known to have spread classical CJD in the past &mdash; dura mater grafts and extracts of human pituitary, for example, human growth hormones.</P>
    <P>There is no test available internationally for screening blood donations for CJD at present.  It is anticipated that a test will become available within two to four years.  My Department, through its CJD advisory committee, is maintaining close links with researchers in this area and a consultant haematologist at the BTSB is a member of this committee.  I am committed to introducing effective measures as they are developed to maintain the safety of the blood supply and minimise the risk of transmission of any infectious agent.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to a process of filtering blood donations in order to eliminate the risk of new variant CJD being transmitted through blood transfusions.  There has been recent confirmation that the agent which causes new variant CJD is the same as that which causes BSE.  This agent has been detected in lymphoid tissue indicating the possibility that it may circulate in white blood cells.  White cells can be removed from blood donations using special filters.  This process is called leucocyte depletion.  However, I am advised that there is currently no direct evidence that leucocyte depletion will improve the safety of individual blood components.</P>
    <P>Arising from recent recommendations from a UK Government advisory committee, the National Blood Authority is to start work towards the possible extension of leucodepletion of blood so that they are prepared in the event that the risk assessment indicates that this would be a sensible precautionary measure.  The practicability and feasibility of this process are currently being assessed by the BTSB to allow for immediate implementation should it emerge that this would be a useful precautionary step.  The BTSB is also examining the practical requirements of extending leucocyte depletion for all donations.  Currently certain categories of patients already receive leucocyte depleted blood products to prevent immune reactions.  In addition, a large proportion of platelets used in Irish hospitals are filtered.</P>
    <P>In any examination of the transmission of blood-borne infections, special consideration must be given to frequent users of blood products, particularly pooled products.  It is important to note that there has never been a reported case of CJD in haemophiliacs, despite many years of treatment with plasma-derived products.  Notwithstanding this, I have decided that plasma-derived Factor 8, which is currently used to treat haemophiliac patients, should be replaced as soon <Col N="372" /> as practical with a synthetic product, recombinant factor 8.  The BTSB is at present finalising product supply arrangements with a major pharmaceutical company and supplies of recombinant product will be available from next January. Recombinant factor 9 is not currently available, but my Department will be instructing the BTSB to replace plasma-derived factor 9 as soon as this is feasible.  The full year cost of these measures will be in the region of £3 million.</P>
    <P>The BTSB, as part of its overall development plan, has drawn up a report on consultant manpower requirements.  While the overall proposals are being progressed in ongoing discussions with Comhairle na nOspidéal and the special committee of Comhairle na nOspidéal on haematology services, a post of consultant virologist is being examined separately as a matter of priority. Funding will be available to allow the post to be filled as soon as it is approved by Comhairle na nOspidéal.  In addition, a post of consultant in infectious diseases is currently under review in the context of the consultant manpower plan.  It is important to note, however, that existing consultant staff in the BTSB have extensive experience in infectious diseases linked to transfusion of blood and blood products.  In addition, a formal link exists with the microbiology department in St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the risks from CJD or new variant CJD are purely theoretical at this stage and any potential risk of contracting new variant CJD through blood transfusions is far outweighed by the real risks of compromising health through not accepting a transfusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is important, given the difficulties experienced by the BTSB, that everything possible is done to give the public confidence in blood supply and blood products?  Does he accept that the reported statement of Dr. William Murphy, who is the medical director of the BTSB, in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> that new variant CJD may be passed through blood products, that his organisation was powerless to eliminate this and that approximately 21 people in Britain may have lost their lives in these circumstances is a cause of concern and alarm?  It is important to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to reassure people they are not at risk in this context.  Does the Minister agree or disagree with Dr. Murphy's claim that current research suggests that all red blood cells should be filtered in order to eliminate the possibility of BSE related agents getting into blood products?</P>

      <P>My lengthy detailed reply is based on the advice available from the organisation to which the Deputy referred.  It is difficult for any newspaper to publish that level of detail.  It is acknowledged that we must be far from complacent and that we must do everything possible in this regard. If any organisation has had to learn its lesson, it has been the BTSB.  It is keeping an eye on <Col N="373" /> ongoing research in the UK and as soon as we can transfer the operation to St. James's Hospital with its new management structures and equipment, I am sure there will be opportunities to continue existing research.  I can assure the Deputy that everything possible to ensure the safety of blood and blood products managed by the company is being done.  The level of consultation and outside advice which is continually being sought through the various committees and links with university departments and other specialist departments is an indication of the BTSB's preparedness to take advice from all available specialist areas to make sure that it is up to date and following the best international practice.  That is the mission statement of the new BTSB and I believe it is undertaking that responsibility with great care and seriousness.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board has a co-ordinating role in relation to the provision of accident and emergency services by six major hospitals in the Dublin area.  Arising from the work of the Accident and Emergency Steering Group, the board has requested funding for a series of proposals aimed at relieving pressure on the accident and emergency services during the coming winter.  These proposals refer mainly to anticipated spending in 1998 and my Department will consider the board's request as part of its <Col N="374" /> overall consideration of estimated budgetary requirements for the coming year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the steering group has advised him that, to ensure that the accident and emergency services will be in a condition to meet the expected demands to be made on them this winter, this extra financial injection is required, that it is important in the context of forward planning that the health board is advised at a very early stage as to whether this funding will be made available, and that it is not adequate that a decision should be made and funding made available only some time after the new year?  It is essential that this issue is immediately addressed by the Minister, decisions communicated and the necessary action taken so that the accident and emergency services know they will be in a position to cope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that of course it would be far better had the Eastern Health Board been able to provide funds which would not have required it to wait for the 1998 allocation since it has been involved in positive measures in 1995-6 and 1996-7.  However, far from having the allocation in reserve, the Deputies will be aware that the ability of health boards to keep within budget has been problematical, but it will have to be done from now, given the accountability legislation.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has identified a number of priorities for this winter to relieve the further pressures which are expected.  These proposed measures range from a major publicity campaign to discourage inappropriate attenders to the provision of additional long stay facilities, mainly for elderly patients, to free up acute hospital beds which are inappropriately occupied. The focus of attention will be the further development of community support and levels of care more appropriate to meet the medical needs of the patients, thereby ensuring the most efficient and effective use of the acute hospital bed resource.</P>
      <P>Some of the voluntary hospitals have submitted requests for funding for initiatives aimed at improving the management of services in the accident and emergency departments.  These initiatives include additional training for nurses and the extension of the triage system where nurses are trained to make immediate assessments and decide which patients require immediate care, together with the reorganisation of staff, etc.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there are proposals in the Department and I would hope to be able to assist them in this regard as soon as the 1998 allocation has been decided finally.</P>

      <P>I am arranging meetings with all the health boards in the next few weeks prior to allocations to impress upon them that there are major responsibilities which must be taken up as and from 1 January and they will be required to provide service plans that are within budget on the basis that supplementary estimates will not be available to them next year.  That is an important departure in the delivery of health services.  The statutory responsibilities lie with the health board and it is important, before giving out the allocations, that health boards are reminded of the new additional responsibilities.  When the boards sit down to draw up their service plans they may set out their priorities and one of these may be among them.</P>

When the allocations become available, they will have to incorporate the total demand on the health boards.

      <P>I ask the Minister to make that decision, particularly for the Dublin hospitals which should be given an additional allocation this winter.  I further ask him to bear in mind the exceptional demands that are placed on the Dublin hospitals' accident and emergency services.  I remind the Minister that he has a duty as 1998 approaches to ensure that those services are adequately funded to ensure that the best possible medical care is available to those who require it.</P>

    <P>There is an important problem to be resolved in the accident and emergency services in Dublin hospitals which will require a great deal of co-ordination <Col N="376" /> and a mechanism for taking away from the equation those who are clearly inappropriate attenders.  At present it is cheaper to attend an accident and emergency service than to go to a GP for the most basic requirements.  That has been ducked for a long time and it needs to be addressed if we are serious about trying to ensure that those who require accident and emergency services can avail of them.  It is quite clear, from speaking to people on the front line in those wards, that there are people attending who are depriving them of the ability to deal with those who should be there.</P>

      <Quest>the number of sudden infant cot deaths in each of the years from 1994 to 1996; and the moneys made available for research into the causes of these deaths for the same period.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of sudden infant cot deaths registered in the years concerned was as follows: 1994, 36; 1995, 35; 1996, 28.</P>
      <P>My Department has provided funding to the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association for the operation of the National Sudden Infant Death Register, which has been in existence since 1991 and provided much valuable information in respect of the incidence of sudden infant death in Ireland.  The amounts provided towards this project are as follows: 1994, £70,000; 1995, £66,072; 1996, £40,000</P>
      <P>A further sum of £103,231 has been provided in 1997.  In 1994 and 1995 the association also received grants totalling £53,760 from my Department for a research study on the alleged link between cot death and the presence of antimony in cot mattresses.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit of my Department provided the ISIDA with funding of £5,990 in 1995 and £5,000 in 1997 to facilitate the printing of information booklets and posters alerting parents to the factors which may contribute to sudden infant deaths.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that one of the greatest calamities that can befall any family is to lose an infant through cot death. Does he accept that, following a period of apparent decline, the numbers of cot deaths are on the increase?  Statistics in recent press releases from the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association suggest that cot deaths have risen to five per month. Does the Minister agree that this problem is a nightmare for those involved and that moneys are needed for further research into the causes and increasing rate of cot deaths?  Will he make available, <Col N="377" /> within reason, the funding required for such research?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have access to the statistics to which the Deputy referred and I do not know the length of time over which they were compiled.  If the amount of research available was directly proportional to reducing cot deaths, there would be a case for providing further funding. However, if the figures to which Deputy O'Keeffe referred are correct, an unprecedented amount of money was spent on research this year while cot deaths increased.  It is clear that other factors are involved.</P>
      <P>I agree that a family can undergo no more traumatic event than to find that their baby has died in its sleep for no explicable reason.  Most of us are familiar with this type of tragedy through members of our family or friends whom it has befallen.  I cannot explain why there was an increase in cot deaths because there is no discernible reason.  It may be that there is no statistical reason but that it merely happened in recent months.  However, in light of the figures to which I referred in my original reply, I am not sure how accurate it is to state that there have been five cot deaths per month in recent times.  The level of research moneys does not seem to have had a bearing on the figures.  The research must be carried out on its merits but there are other things we must do to ensure that these tragedies do not happen.  I do not believe it is merely a matter of providing funding for research.</P>

      <P>I do not have access to the departmental files relating to this matter.  My information comes from press releases from the association which were published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Tuesday last and again today. The figures given state that there were 48 sudden infant deaths in the first nine months of 1997. That represents an alarming increase on the figures provided by the Minister.  The article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> contains comments from paediatrics professor Tom Matthews who makes it clear that the situation relating to sudden infant death syndrome is far from being resolved.  Will the Minister seek to obtain updated information on this alarming issue?  In so far as further money is required for research, particularly taking account of the alarming reversal in the downward trend in sudden infant cot deaths, will he make such money available?</P>

If what has happened this year is totally against the trend, it might be timely to have a meeting with the association to review the initiatives supported by the Department and discover how it might be of further assistance.  I undertake to arrange such a meeting.</P>

      <P>The number of consultants in the health services in Ireland has increased steadily in recent years.  Between 1984 and 1996, the total increased by 19 per cent and it can be expected that the numbers will continue to increase in light of new service developments, expansion of existing services, the introduction of new medical technologies, increased activity levels in individual specialities, the service requirements towards ensuring regional self sufficiency in medical and surgical specialities, and requirements regarding postgraduate medical training.</P>
      <P>Towards ensuring that there is an appropriate framework in place to facilitate a medical manpower plan, the issue is being addressed and discussions are currently taking place with a range of appropriate organisations in the areas of training, education and regulation of the medical profession designed to match consultant numbers to service and training requirements.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.

How many requests has the Minister received from health boards to increase the number of such posts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the information requested in the latter part of the Deputy's supplementary question available to me but I will try to obtain it.  The Department is currently conducting a medical manpower review designed to address the problems identified in the existing hospital and medical manpower structure by, among others, the Tierney report of 1993.  We are also aiming at moving towards consultant provided services with a view to providing an improved quality of patient care, improved programmes of training for non-consultant hospital doctors and an improved career structure for hospital doctors.</P>
      <P>To date the Department has met key participants in respect of medical manpower including the chief executive officers of the health boards and the Dublin acute hospitals, the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Irish Committee for Higher Medical Training of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland.  When those consultations are completed, the Department will be able to evaluate the possible options involved.  There is no doubt that we will be obliged to deal with the issue of medical manpower in our hospitals.  When the consultations have been completed, I hope we will have gained a clearer picture of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe so.  Because of new regulations coming into place which will affect non-EU doctors in our hospitals, a situation will arise in future for which we must make plans.  I assure the Deputy that this matter has arisen at management meetings in the Department, which I chair.  We are commencing work to plan for the future.  We need a better career structure for non-consultant hospital doctors.  We also need to disabuse people of the idea that one has to gain consultancy experience abroad before one can obtain a consultant post at home.  That was the trend in the past, the reason being that we did not have sufficient medical training programmes in place in our hospitals where non-consultant hospital doctors could get training and experience in the specialties in which they were interested and move on to registrar and consultant posts without there being a perception that experience elsewhere gives an advantage to prospective applicants.  Many of our medical graduates are emigrating to obtain work.  Given that there will be a reduction in the availability of non-EU medical doctors to work in hospitals, it is clear we must make them a more attractive workplace for our medical graduates.  The problem is in its early stages, but it has been recognised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to change.  I cannot commit myself to one or other option.  I recognise that if the <i>status quo</i> is not addressed there will be a serious shortage of medical manpower in the years ahead and the first hospitals to suffer will be the smaller ones down the country which, from certain consultants' point of view, may be less attractive than larger hospitals where the specialties are based.  It is an issue we have to work on, and I am committed to doing something about it.</P>

      <P>I have no specific plans.  I recognise what the Deputy says regarding demographic trends.  The same could be said of the increased number of elderly people who will require services from the health boards in the future.  Comhairle na nOspidéal is the expert group that advises the Department on the need for the provision of consultant posts as trends emerge and there are pressures on services.  The problems will be no different than in other specialties.  The number of consultants has increased by 19 per cent in a relatively short time.  We are committed to a consultant-oriented service to provide the optimum level of care, and the cost will have to be factored into health planning in the years ahead.</P>

      <Quest>the number of heroin addicts currently receiving treatment and the numbers awaiting treatment for each health board area.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19851/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board informed me that the number of addicts currently receiving treatment for heroin abuse is 2,666. Heroin addiction is a problem mainly confined to the Eastern Health Board area and there are no waiting lists in other health boards for treatment services.  The waiting list for treatment with the Eastern Health Board is currently at 273.  This number relates to those requesting treatment in the health board's addiction centres.  The Drug Treatment Centre in Pearse Street works a monthly appointment system whereby persons ringing for an appointment will be seen in the following four weeks.  No waiting list is therefore kept at this centre.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has made considerable progress in developing treatment services following the report by the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs which outlined as a priority the elimination of waiting lists by the end of 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has extended its drug services and now has six addiction centres and 15 satellite clinics across the city.  In recent months new satellite clinics have come on stream in locations such as Darndale, Dún Laoghaire, Bray and Deansrath, and the mobile clinic is currently being extended to a third location.  In addition the board has recruited an additional 40 general practitioners and 55 pharmacies in the community who are now providing methadone treatment service. Other new developments include a telephone help-line which commenced in July and is handling on average 55 calls per week &mdash; this service provides information, support, guidance and referral; employment of six education officers as <Col N="381" /> well as teams of outreach workers and counsellors &mdash; the board plans to employ another four education officers over the next few months; an anti-heroin campaign in the areas most affected by heroin within the board; the production of a video on the satellite service to provide information to communities where it is proposed to commence such a service; the establishment of an emergency service and assessment at a number of addiction centres.</P>
    <P>The board has indicated that as services have increased it has led to a raised awareness of drug treatment options available.  Consequently, more clients are making contact with the network of services available.</P>
    <P>The board has outlined that further service developments are planned in a number of areas, including locations such as Bray, Cork Street, North and South Inner City, Clondalkin, Dún Laoghaire, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Finglas, Cabra, Ringsend, Crumlin and Rathfarnham.</P>
    <P>The board will continue to monitor developments in relation to the number of persons seeking treatment but it is hoped that these planned new services, together with the developments already in place, will provide adequate places for those coming forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gives a figure of 273 heroin addicts in the Eastern Health Board area.  I assume that figure reflects those who requested treatment and for whom treatment is not currently available.  Would the Minister agree that that does not reflect the measure of unmet need inasmuch as addicts are reluctant to present themselves unless they are pretty well guaranteed immediate treatment, and that it is of absolute importance that we be in a position to offer immediate treatment to anybody who does present himself or herself to any of the centres to which the Minister refers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that this does not reflect the unmet need.  In the debate on drugs last week we referred to anything up to 8,000 addicts in the Eastern Health Board area. Clearly there are many people addicted to heroin who are not in the system and who may at the moment, because of the nature of their addiction, not have any inclination to deal with the system. We have to encourage and persuade as many of these people as possible to use the system and ensure that it is as responsive and immediate as possible.  We are improving the situation gradually.  The last Government is to be congratulated on the work it did and we have to build on that. There is a recognition that more needs to be done.  We must continue on the commitment and not allow the momentum to stop.</P>

      <P>Within what timescale will treatment be provided to the 273 people on the waiting list?  Are we talking about one, two, three or four months' wait?  Will the Minister acknowledge that there is a difficulty, to which Deputy <Col N="382" /> McDowell referred, in dealing with addicts in that a moment can occur when an addict decides to go for treatment, and if that is not acted upon and there is a wait of two or three months, even if an appointment is given, the addict may not turn up and his perspective and world may have changed substantially in the interim?  By what date is the Minister saying the health board will effectively be able to give appointments virtually at the time they are sought by addicts who seek assistance to come off their addiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a precise date, but I can assure the Deputy that resources will be made available on a continuing basis to continue the current rate of improvement.  I hope we can be the victims of our own success in that if we can encourage more people to avail of treatment there may continue to be a waiting list, no matter how quickly we try to provide a service.  One way of resolving the problem is for all areas where this menace has permeated communities to meet their obligation and make their contribution by accepting treatment and satellite centres in their areas.  Those who have provided services for addicts in their areas are carrying a much greater burden than they should reasonably be expected to carry.  The board is working in conjunction with communities in an effort to encourage people to allow treatment centres to be established in all the areas to which I referred.  When this is done the time delays will be greatly decreased and hopefully a greater number of people will avail of the service in an attempt to end their addiction.  We do not have sufficient treatment centres available to increase the number of addicts receiving treatment.  A majority of heroin addicts are not part of the treatment service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears there will be a waiting list on 31 December.  However, it will be much shorter than the one which existed two or three years ago.  There may be a residual problem but substantial progress has been made in achieving the objective and the problem is not of the same magnitude as it was previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but as long as there is a waiting list new addicts looking for treatment will not be able to receive it when they need it.  If addicts are given treatment at the optimum time then there is some hope they will continue counselling, <Col N="383" /> treatment and rehabilitation.  However, if they are told to come back in a week then the chances of them doing so are not great.  These addicts will continue to use heroin, thus continuing the cycle.  I am disappointed the health board has not been able to achieve its objective.</P>
      <P>I presume we are referring by and large to methadone when we refer to treatment.  Does the Minister have any figures on the number of detoxification facilities available?  Is the health board looking at alternative methods of treatment other than simply dispensing methadone to addicts?  Some centres provide detoxification facilities together with long-term rehabilitation programmes which can extend to 12 months in some cases.  This is the type of treatment needed if young people are to be helped break their addiction.  Is the health board considering allocating more funding to this type of treatment?  Methadone maintenance programmes are a harm reduction operation and are basically aimed at helping people to stop using heroin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that methadone should not be seen as the be all and end all in terms of treatment.  Under the programme one is basically replacing an illegal opiate with a legal one.  Some people involved in methadone maintenance programmes have raised with me the necessity of having a programme which is medically based and which works.  Unfortunately, some people have died from methadone overdoses.  I have received representations from business people in the Inchicore area who are trying to operate in very difficult circumstances.  This is not acceptable and we need to address the issue and to limit the level of dispensing in various locations.  I am dealing with this matter.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's points about detoxification programmes.  A contractor has been appointed to carry out the necessary extension to the board's specialised detoxification unit at Cuan Dara. While it was initially planned to have 15 beds in the unit, a review of the plan has allowed the board to increase the number to 17.  Work on the project is well advanced and the extended service should be available before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Phoenix Hall in St. Mary's Hospital has been identified as a suitable location for the 20 bed downstream unit.  Plans to carry out the necessary renovations are being drawn up at present.  The board is fully utilising the downstream beds being operated by the Merchant's Quay Project in High Park, Drumcondra.  A proposal has also been received by the board to fund the existing detoxification and aftercare programme at Cuan Mhuire in Athy which has been particularly effective.  The proposal is under consideration and I hope to provide some assistance to the programme.</P>
      <P>The board is in the process of selecting a suitable premises for the establishment of a 12 bed inpatient stabilisation unit.  Working protocols for admission are being drawn up for this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> There is also the young person's programme which will provide a medical stabilisation and detoxification service.  This programme has been in place in Baggot Street since August last year and there are 38 persons on it.</P>
    <P>The approach to the issue is multifaceted.  This is a major issue and I am anxious to continue the momentum which has built up.  We are starting to achieve success in the criminal justice and treatment areas and we must press ahead.</P>

      <P>The Minister understandably confined his reply to the Eastern Health Board area.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children, the Adoption Board and the Irish Embassy in Beijing have been actively seeking to finalise arrangements with the Chinese authorities which would enable Irish residents to adopt children from that country.  The Chinese authorities have been seeking assurances as to the position with regard to the recognition in Ireland of adoptions effected in that country.  Deputies will be aware that the Supreme Court ruled in July 1996 that Chinese adoptions have essentially the same legal effect as an adoption order and thus qualify for entry in the Register of Foreign Adoptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Adoption Board recently wrote to the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs in order to clarify the position.  During his recent visit to China the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, raised the issue with the Chinese Minister for Civil Affairs.  He assured Minister Woods that his Department would expedite its examination of the documentation provided by the Adoption Board.  Our Embassy in Beijing has been given a verbal assurance that the Ministry of Civil Affairs is satisfied that adoptions effected in China qualify for recognition in Ireland.  I am informed by the Embassy that the Ministry of Civil Affairs must consult with the Ministry of Justice which is responsible under Chinese law <Col N="385" /> for the notarisation of adoption orders.  This process of consultation is under way and is being followed closely by the Embassy.  When the various consultations at official level have been completed, it is my intention to travel to China to finalise the adoption agreement.  I hope when this is completed all outstanding applications can be processed without further delay.</P>

      <P>When was the Adoption Board asked to clarify to the Chinese authorities the legal position in Ireland regarding recognition of Chinese adoptions?  Why has there been confusion in the context of the Chinese authorities' perspective of the position, bearing in mind it is almost a year and a half since the Supreme Court pronounced on the issue and said such adoptions are recognised?  Will the Minister accept the delay in formalising arrangements is causing great distress to couples anxious to adopt in China.  The Chinese authorities have no objection in principle to Irish couples adopting babies from orphanages in China.</P>

      <P>Procedures were clarified by the Adoption Board in September 1996.  It was agreed the Adoption Board would forward to the Ministry for Civil Affairs in Beijing documents in respect of adoptive parents.  Following intensive lobbying by International Orphan Aid, that body was approved in April 1987 for the purpose of transmitting documents.  Since then we have pressurised the Chinese authorities through the embassy in Beijing to have this matter concluded. In recent weeks we received a response from the Chinese authorities and the Department of Justice there must now finalise matters.  We are at present actively engaged in that process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister, Deputy Woods, intervened on this issue when in China. Since the Adoption Board replied in September 1996, did that response give rise to confusion or difficulty?  Was the Supreme Court position clearly stated, that adoptions effected in China would be recognised, or was the position described in a more complex and obtuse manner by the Adoption Board, giving rise to concerns on the part of the Chinese authorities?</P>

      <P>I am not aware that events took place as the Deputy described.  The Chinese authorities were concerned and took considerable time to satisfy themselves about the procedure here.  Since coming to office in July I put much effort into convincing the Chinese authorities to move quickly and make the necessary decisions. When the Minister, Deputy Woods, was in Beijing recently he took the opportunity to further this initiative and reached a verbal agreement with the Chinese Minister.  Since then I have been in contact with the embassy about the matter.  I cannot answer for delays or inadequacies that existed prior to this Government coming to office.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clarify the nature of any further agreement he envisages may be necessary?  Will it be an agreement between the State and China or will there be an informal arrangement?  What exactly is required?  Will the Minister confirm my understanding that what is required is, first, that the Chinese authorities are satisfied that we recognise their orders and, second, that there is an agreed body such as the Adoption Board or a non-governmental organisation such as International Orphan Aid, sanctioned by the Department, through which documentation may be transmitted confirming the suitability of prospective adopters.  That, effectively, should allow adoptions to proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The embassy has been trying to establish the reason for the delay in processing applications.  There was a doubt on the part of the Chinese authorities as to whether Chinese adoptions qualified for recognition in Ireland.  That matter has been clarified and accepted by the Chinese.  The current difficulty to be overcome is the organisation of adoptions, the normal procedure that must be gone through by Irish people who go to China to adopt babies.  Two agencies here are dealing with the matter, the Adoption Board, which is processing a number of applications, and International Orphan Aid, a voluntary organisation which has been approved for the purpose of transmission of documents.  The administrative side needs to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Part of my purpose in visiting China is to establish a system whereby when people go there proper procedures are in place and there are contacts through which they can work.  We are anxious to facilitate as many people as possible who wish to adopt Chinese babies.  From the level of inquiries to the Adoption Board and International Orphan Aid, a significant number of people are interested in adopting Chinese babies.  We want to facilitate that and to make it as inexpensive as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today I made a statement to the House on this issue.  For the benefit of those Deputies who were not present, it is important that I should repeat the facts on the arrest and subsequent release of the five suspects in last weekend's cannabis seizure.  The five suspects were arrested under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, and detained for an initial 48 hours.  In accordance with the Act the Garda then obtained a warrant from the District Court extending the detention for a further 72 hours.  It later became apparent to the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions that the District Court judge concerned had not been nominated for the purposes of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.  The nomination of District Court judges in this respect is a matter for the President of the District Court.</P>
      <P>Deputies are trying to imply that I as Minister have some responsibility in this area.  If the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, had provided for the Minister to nominate judges and if there had been a failure on my part, I would accept responsibility.  However, the Act does not make any such provision or demand on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the time it became apparent that there were difficulties with the continued detention of the suspects, the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions had sufficient evidence to make an arrest for the purpose of bringing charges.  The <Col N="389" /> suspects were, therefore, released and the Garda attempted to rearrest them for the purpose of charging in accordance with section 4(5) of the Act, which specifically provides for such circumstances.  However, the District Court judge refused to allow the rearrest of the suspects and ordered their release.  I am informed also that the District Court judge later refused to issue warrants for the arrest of the suspects.</P>
    <P>As will be evident from the facts I have outlined, this case revolves around a series of judicial decisions and it is well established &mdash; I humbly submit there are good reasons for this &mdash; that it is not appropriate for me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to comment on those decisions.  Responsibility for the assignment of judges in the District Courts is a matter for exercise of his function by the President of the District Court and the District Court judges.  The separation of the courts and the Administration is central to our criminal justice system.  As will be evident from the facts I have outlined, this case revolves around a series of judicial decisions and it is well established that I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, may not comment on those decisions.</P>
    <P>I understand three of the suspects were rearrested overnight, two have been remanded in custody and one was released again.  Clearly, there is a legal issue to be resolved urgently.  In this context, I understand the Director of Public Prosecutions has already taken steps to instruct counsel to seek an urgent High Court order of <i>mandamus</i> in this case.  I understand also that it is open to the two suspects in custody to make a High Court application for release forthwith. Should this happen the matter will be challenged by the State.</P>
    <P>Comments by Opposition Deputies on this issue seem to show a lack of understanding of the relationship between the Executive and the Judiciary.  The Government as the Executive arm of State brings forward legislation, the Oireachtas enacts it and the courts interpret it.  It is not for the Minister to answer for the actions of an independent Judiciary in implementing its constitutional functions.</P>
    <P>While I am always willing to answer for actions in respect of which I have responsibility, I wish to make it clear for the umpteenth time that I am not prepared to interfere with the independent functioning of the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody will be astonished to hear the Minister persisting with this line when clearly, as outlined in the SMI, he has a responsibility in this regard.  A series of disasters occurred. The debacle goes back to the initial application to the court for an extension of the detention order.  Will the Minister confirm there was no legal representative for the State present when the Garda made that application?  If such a person were present, it is not likely he or she would have known the judge did not have jurisdiction in this regard?  Is <Col N="390" /> it the case that the failure to have a State solicitor present led to the most serious occurrence under a Minister for Justice in recent times, where five people charged with a serious crime involving £3 million pounds worth of drugs were released?  The Minister is trying to make out that he does not have responsibility.  He has fundamental responsibility as outlined in the SMI statement.</P>
      <P>This issue started the ball rolling, so to speak, in this debacle.  Was the Chief State Solicitor represented in court?  The Minister is responsible for that failure.  Had the legal representative been present the subsequent events would not have occurred.  Will the Minister clarify that point.  It has been reported that the representative was not there.</P>

When the matter was heard in court by Judge Windle nobody was present from the DPP's office or the Chief State Solicitor's office and thus there was nobody to advise the Garda Síochána.  Notwithstanding that, even in the absence of legal advice is it not the responsibility of the Garda, representing the State and its citizens, to be fully briefed on the consequences of the legislation and the status of the court in which they are presenting a case?  When did the Garda become aware that there was a doubt about the validity of the warrants?  When did the Garda or officials in his Department notify him and when did they decide to take action?</P>

He did not say why it was only yesterday or at what time.  He came into the House today, having received notice on the Order of Business and been given time before Question Time to make a long, rambling, bombastic, irrelevant statement. He is now asking the House to accept he does not know whether the Chief State Solicitor's office was represented at the initial stages of this shambles.

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As of now my information is that no final decision has been taken about the future of this plant.  There is huge concern among its workforce in Rathfarnham that, of its very nature, this plant important not merely to the Rathfarnham area but to the Dublin area generally, is at risk of being closed within the context of a rationalisation programme at present under discussion between the Avonmore-Waterford Group with regard to its future operations.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste should intervene in this issue.  I am very anxious to ensure that this plant remains open.  It is very much part of the infrastructure of south Dublin and has played an important role in the area, being the old HB dairy.  Indeed, as a boy in short trousers living in the area, I can recall it being one of the major plants providing work in the Rathfarnham area.  Its workforce is not now confined to that area only and many come from Finglas, Tallaght and other parts of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential to the infrastructure of the area that this plant should continue to operate.  Within the context of Waterford Foods, a rationalisation programme was put in place prior to the Avonmore-Waterford <Col N="408" /> Group amalgamation, the object being to optimise the output and efficiency of its operations.  Workers from the Finglas plant are now operating out of Rathfarnham.  In the past two years, an investment project costing in the region of £5 million was put into the Rathfarnham plant.  Some workers in the plant have been there all their working lives &mdash; ten, 20, 30 or even 40 years &mdash; and they are now faced with the worry of a possible closure.</P>
    <P>Not only is there in excess of 300 people working in the plant whose livelihoods are dependent on it, there are others conducting milk rounds who are supplied by the plant, who entered into financial arrangements with Premier Dairies and who have depended in good faith on those arrangements in planning their futures.</P>
    <P>This is not a special pleading for this plant which has been operating in an efficient and profitable manner in the context of being part of Premier Dairies, the Waterford Group and, now, Avonmore-Waterford Group.  I ask the Minister to meet the workers in the plant, to contact those in charge of the Avonmore-Waterford Group and do what can be done at Government level to ensure this plant remains open and operational as the only major dairy plant in the Dublin area.  The workers deserve that consideration.</P>
    <P>Those in management positions would acknowledge that there are many who have contributed to the success story of the dairy industry. Many people in Dublin are dependent on output from that plant and it would seem an extraordinarily foolish exercise in economics for it not to be maintained in the context of the extraordinary financial investment made in it.</P>
    <P>If this plant were to be closed it would be an extraordinary breach of faith on the part of management with the workforce and the unions which have co-operated in ensuring that this company is successful and profitable and that the contribution made by it to the group is of the optimum benefit.  I hope we will get an assurance not just from Deputy Brennan, as Chief Whip, but also from the senior Minister with responsibility in this area that an early meeting can be held so that the workforce can convey its concerns which can then be conveyed to management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter.  I regret the Minister is not here because I wanted to impress upon her the level of distress that the prospect of job losses at the Premier Dairies factory in Rathfarnham is causing among the 300 people employed there and the 300 to 400 people who have downstream jobs - delivery and distribution personnel &mdash; in the area.  I wanted to impress upon her the shock being felt by those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This plant has operated in Rathfarnham for generations.  It was regarded as the jewel in the crown of the Waterford Group.  The workforce believed their jobs, and the future of the plant, were totally secure even if some jobs were lost as a result of the merger.  There was a major investment <Col N="409" /> in the company recently to the tune of £8 million to provide it with a new chill unit.</P>
    <P>This plant is the biggest liquid milk production unit in Ireland and the only one supplying milk to the Dublin market.  One can imagine, therefore, the shock felt by workers who believed their jobs were totally secure when they heard the plant was to close.</P>
    <P>I wanted to impress on the Minister the anger felt by the workforce which is directed primarily at her because they believe she knew this closure was on the cards.  It was the Minister who revealed it inadvertently to a delegation from Dungarvan who came to Dublin to question her about the future of their jobs, only to find that the decision had already been made to close some of the plants and, in particular, Rathfarnham.  The workers are wondering when the Minister knew that this closure was on the cards.  Did she know it when she sanctioned the merger many months ago with great fanfare?</P>
    <P>Avonmore is a large multinational company which probably bases its decisions on criteria that far transcend any local considerations, but the Minister is responsible for jobs in Ireland.  She is one of the few Dublin TDs and she represents many of the workers affected in the adjoining constituency of Dublin South West.  One would have thought this would have been to the forefront of the Minister's considerations.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister said when she sanctioned the merger that she hoped there would not be any abuse of monopoly position, there is a strong feeling that there has been such abuse, that if there was any other supplier operating in the Dublin market now, this plant would not be closed.  There is also a belief that Dublin has been let down again by one of the few Dublin Ministers in that this is a farmer-focused company and it is easier for a plant to be closed in Dublin where workers are dispersed and do not have the same muscle that they might have in a small town.  The belief is that Dublin was the easy option.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to meet the workers, satisfy their fears and tell them there is no prospect of this factory closing.  If such a prospect exists, what does the Minister intend to do about it?  We want action.  This is a viable, successful company which is operating at a profit.  It has a future and it should not be sacrificed for the sake of rationalisation by a large multinational.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter and Deputy Mitchell for raising this matter which has also been the subject of discussions with the Tánaiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As previously indicated to the House, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is taking a strong interest in the employment implications arising from the merger of the Avonmore and Waterford Groups.  She has had meetings with the new group's senior management <Col N="410" /> and with the trade unions over the past few weeks about future employment.  In this context, the purpose of her discussions with the Avonmore-Waterford Group management was to seek to ensure that job losses arising from the merger were kept to the minimum possible.  The merger should create a major global player in the food processing industry and secure employment and growth in the group in the long term.</P>
    <P>In her meetings with both sides, management and trade unions, the Tánaiste strongly encouraged them to deal with the restructuring of the group on the basis of dialogue and partnership. Such co-operation is essential in this and other industries if we are to have an industrial base capable of meeting competition at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I understand that the group's decisions on future plans for the Rathfarnham and other plants are expected to be taken shortly.  The industrial development agencies are closely monitoring the situation in relation to the Avonmore-Waterford Group plants, including the Premier Dairies facility in Rathfarnham, and everything possible will be done to assist any workers affected by redundancy at the group's plants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise once again the tragedy of the recurring flooding in and around Clonmel, in my constituency, which has caused hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage to property and great upset to families and businesses.</P>
      <P>I want to record my appreciation to all the agencies which again have come to the rescue in these circumstances, including the Army, Civil Defence, the local authorities, voluntary organisations and the townspeople in Clonmel.  Many people will have seen the coverage on television - I hope the Minister saw it also &mdash; of this tragic occurrence in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is aware of the extent of the flood damage which has occurred on three occasions this year and up to seven times in the past three years.  I know and accept that the Office of Public Works has carried out extensive investigations and research into the causes and consequences of flooding in this area.  Following a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, I know he is prepared to give priority to the town of Clonmel when a decision is made on the option to be followed.  However, pending that <Col N="411" /> decision there is no doubt in my mind or in the minds of others in south Tipperary that urgent action is needed to alleviate, to some extent, the possibility of further flooding in the event of further heavy rainfall.</P>
    <P>Many of the locals, some of whom experienced some form of flooding dating back to the 1940s, confirmed that the town of Clonmel is flooded almost immediately following up to 24 hours of heavy rain. They also hold a view the Rivers Ara and Aherlow come into spate much more quickly than heretofore.  Those two rivers, which join the River Suir before reaching the town of Cahir, are already in spate because they are fed first from the mountain streams on the Galtees and from large tracts of lands, many of which have been drained.  That leads to a much faster flow into the river waters creating the problem and gives rise to a large volume of water entering Clonmel via Ardfinnan, which is under water.  The school there is closed and Newcastle is also flooded because of the River Tar which joins it there having flooded Goldenbridge.  To compound matters downstream from Clonmel town many developments have taken place on lands which were originally natural flood plains.  Those lands are immediately flooded by the River Anner which joins the River Suir at that stage and because the River Anner is flooded a combination of those rivers flow down to Carrick-on-Suir where the flow of water is obstructed by high tides.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem of flooding in Clonmel that requires urgent and immediate attention pending the major scheme promised by the Minister of State's office.  The question of compensation for the unfortunate victims of flooding must be central to any Government reaction.  The previous Government, in addition to commissioning a major report which is in the Minister of State's office, was required to and did pay compensation to those affected.  Today, three days after the commencement of this flooding, which was still affecting Clonmel this morning, the people await the urgent response of the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this question.  I appreciate his honest and fair assessment of this problem and I hope others take their cue from his sensible and realistic approach.  I express my sympathy and that of my Government colleagues to all those who suffered during the recent flooding, particularly those in the south east area which was the worst hit.  This topic was the subject of an Adjournment debate on 21 October when the up-to-date position was given. Since then my officials, with the consultant engineers, made a presentation of the report to Clonmel Corporation on 4 November, to Tipperary County Council on 10 November and to Carrick-on-Suir UDC on 10 November.  I also met some of the members of Carrick-on-Suir UDC the <Col N="412" /> same day.  The report is available in the town hall and public library in Clonmel and in the town hall in Carrick-on-Suir for those in the Clonmel and surrounding areas who may be interested in reading it.  A copy of it has also been placed in the Oireachtas Library for the benefit of Members.</P>
      <P>The report offers three possible options as solutions to the flooding problem in Clonmel.  They are the provision of walls and berms excluding channel widening which would provide alleviation for a 25 year return period flood; the provision of lower flood defence walls with channel widening as far as Dudley's weir to provide a 25 year return period flood; and the provision of flood defence walls and berms together with channel widening as far as Sir Thomas's Bridge to provide alleviation for the 100 year return period flood.  The Government has wasted no time in putting the different options identified by the consultants to the people of Clonmel.  I want to convey the message that they, through the local authority, must decide what is acceptable and let my officials know as soon as possible because the procedure is in the hands of the local authority.</P>
      <P>Any works identified will be subject to a full environmental impact assessment and I know Deputy Ferris realises that is the way we must proceed.  That has been signalled by the consultants and it is necessary to gather data during the growing season from May until September next year and then complete the assessment.  That process will take one year to complete, and that is fast tracking it.  Any scheme found effective, environmentally acceptable and cost beneficial must be put on public exhibition and all observations taken on board before it can be confirmed by the Minister for Finance.  That process, which is a statutory requirement, will take a further year.  That message must get through to the members of the local authorities.  Legal obligations must now be followed which I intend to pursue as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>It is only after that stage work on site can commence.  The commencement date and duration of work will depend on the availability of Exchequer funding at the appropriate time.  I appreciate the concerns of the people of Clonmel who have been affected by the recent flooding, but I assure them as soon as an indication is received from the local authority of what is acceptable the scheme will proceed through the various processes without delay.  In the meantime, if emergency steps can be undertaken to alleviate the problems, even on a temporary basis, they should be undertaken, by the local authority under its existing powers and funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this matter and the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply to it.  I welcome this opportunity to raise this matter.  The question of home help might not seem very important to many people as they go about their daily business, but there are those in our urban and rural communities who depend and rely heavily on the small input and short visit of a home help on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Home helps are usually women who may be long-term unemployed and because of their circumstances they may be unable to qualify for a permanent allowance or work and decide to devote a few hours a week to support and care at a high level for their neighbours, friends and relations who are usually frail, old and have a significant disability.  Home helps care for people in their homes.  It is important to realise the valuable work done by home helps in caring for others in their home surroundings.</P>
      <P>That small intervention, while most important to the recipient, is inadequate.  The average rate of pay or allowance, if it could be called either of those terms, of £2 per hour for part-time work is a disgrace.  We hear much criticism of abuse in the areas of child labour and part-time workers. However, the rates paid to young people and part-time workers who work in the evenings or at weekends in supermarkets, pubs and petrol stations are reasonable compared to what is on offer to home helps.</P>
      <P>This group of workers can do little to improve their pay or conditions.  They will not withdraw their service from dependent older people because their social consciousness, commitment and the recognition of the great need to help old people will not allow them to do so.  They have no rights within the workforce.  I see it as an abuse of a committed group of volunteers.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister or the Department ever realised the cost savings as a result of maintaining old people at home rather than in a nursing home where the average rate demanded to maintain them is from £200 to £300 per week?  Living in their own homes in familiar social surroundings is best for aged people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State should urgently review the rates of pay and allowances for this important group of workers.  He should recognise and acknowledge their important contribution in maintaining a vulnerable and dependent section of our society within its own community and surroundings.  I ask him to provide funding to health boards to enable payment at a rate of at least £4 per hour so they can continue their work and be recognised as workers.  Their work combines that of a nurse, social worker and housewife in helping <Col N="414" /> elderly people.  I do not know why it is only in the last 12 months that the rate has been increased from £1 to £2 per hour.  All too often health boards will say, when they are only a short time into their budgetary year, that the funds for this service have been allocated.</P>
    <P>As budget time approaches, we should recognise the important work that home helps have provided down the years.  We should recognise them and substantially raise their allowances so they can continue without interruption the magnificent work they have been doing.  It could even be extended so that greater demands on State resources could be diverted from institutions to allow people have comfort in their own homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for raising this important issue on the Adjournment.  For many years the main focus of the care of older people has been to enable them to continue living in their own homes for as long as they wish to do so.  It is recognised that the home help service contributes enormously to the maintenance and dignity of frail and dependent older people at home.  There are approximately 20,000 beneficiaries of this service at an annual cost of some £17 million.</P>
      <P>Under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who, but for the provision of such a service, would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide or support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
      <P>Health boards are not limited in the categories of persons they can assist at home and may charge for the service.  The services are, however, usually provided free or at a nominal charge.  The health boards consider individual cases on the basis of need and in the light of resources available to the scheme.  In practice, about half the home helps are provided by voluntary organisations with funding from health boards.  The remaining home helps are employed directly by health boards.  The balance between voluntary and health board input to the home help service varies from health board to health board.  Home helps are predominantly part-time, though a number of full-time home helps and home help co-ordinators are employed by some boards.  Voluntary involvement also strengthens the sense of neighbourly obligation towards the elderly and encourages the self-development of the home help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a community based good neighbour scheme which attracts people primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community service.  Accordingly, the remuneration of volunteers does not come within the realm of conventional employment.  Volunteers who work as part-time home helps are paid a stipend or gratuity for the service they provide. <Col N="415" /> As operated in many areas, this is meant only as a contribution and is not intended to compensate fully for the task undertaken.</P>
    <P>The service is essentially a local client-based service.  The rate paid to part-time home helps employed varies from place to place and is related to the particular requirements and type of task undertaken in each case.  It is a matter for each health board to decide on the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.</P>
    <P>The issue of funding for the home help service has been raised on a number of occasions in the recent past.  My Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, has under consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within health boards for the provision of this service.</P>
    <P>Following these discussions it was decided to have an examination of the operation of the <Col N="416" /> home help service carried out by independent consultants, under the supervision of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, which will advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective manner with the other community-based services.  Work has commenced on this project and will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>When the results of this examination are made available to me, I will be in a better position to consider how best improvements may be brought about in an overall organisation and development of the home help service.  Related issues, such as rates of payment for home helps, will be considered as part of this process.  My Department has allocated additional funding to three boards in 1997 for the purpose of increasing pay rates to home helps.  It is my intention to facilitate the improvement of the provision of the home help service, including pay rates, on a phased basis as resources permit.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 November 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 39, 50, 59 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of the services, including day care, respite care, residential care, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.  The report makes specific recommendations for the provision of additional places and additional therapist posts.  It estimates the cost of implementing all its recommendations at £50 million over a five year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of implementing the recommendations of the report is under way.  As a first step, the health boards are in the process of putting in place the co-ordinating committees recommended by the review group to examine and prioritise the future development of services at local level.  As recommended by the review group report, an additional £2.188 million was built into the health board allocations in 1997 to help put existing physical and sensory disability services on a more secure financial footing.  In addition, a further £1 million <Col N="418" /> revenue was provided in 1997 for priority developments mentioned in the report.</P>
    <P>I recently approved a once-off grant of £600,000 towards the capital costs of Donamon Castle, County Roscommon, a new national centre providing residential, respite and day activity services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>Recently the Government, with the agreement of my colleague Deputy Dermot Ahern, Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, decided to devote £4.325 million savings on his Department's Vote to the purchase of aids, appliances and equipment for people with disabilities.  It is estimated that about 11,000 people with disabilities will benefit.</P>
    <P>In the context of a Supplementary Estimate for my Department I announced in the Dáil yesterday the provision of a further £4.5 million to be devoted to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Going into 1998, this Government has provided a total of over £9 million for these services.  This is a significant commitment from the Government towards improving the quality of life of people with physical and sensory disabilities and will have a significant impact on services in 1998 and beyond.</P>
    <P>My Department's Assessment of the Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, which is based on information from the national intellectual disability database, provides information on the current and future needs of persons with mental handicap, including the need for respite care facilities.  Account will be taken of this need in the allocation of resources for the provision of new residential places.  That assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential-respite places and 1,036 new day places over the next five years.  Additional funding of £12 million was made available in 1997 to begin the process of meeting these needs.  As outlined in both Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services for persons with a mental handicap in line with the needs outlined in that assessment.</P>
    <P>I am not yet, however, in a position to comment on the overall level of funding which may be available for any particular service in 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 15, 85 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of <Col N="420" /> a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  It should be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>In the view of this special provision it is felt that it is not justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the arrangements referred to above the Government has identified as a key priority in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millenium, a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and my Department is currently making the necessary arrangements to advance this review with the health boards.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of renewal of medical cards for the elderly, the health board chief executive officers have recently reviewed their administrative procedures with a view to streamlining the renewal process to ensure that this is done in the most appropriate, efficient and cus-tomer-friendly way for various categories of applicants, including the elderly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views recently expressed by the Ombudsman in relation to the regulations made under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, concerning the assessment of children's circumstances.</P>
      <P>One of the principal objectives of this legislation is to ensure that those most in need of nursing home care and without the resources to fund such care should receive assistance from the State.  It has long been accepted that adult sons and daughters of persons in nursing homes would contribute towards the costs of their parents' nursing home fees if they could afford to do so. The nursing homes regulations were drafted with this in mind.  I might add that the State recognises the contribution made by sons and daughters toward their parents' maintenance costs by allowing income tax relief on such contributions. However, given the views expressed by the Ombudsman, I am currently having the matter reviewed in my Department to determine whether any changes need to be made in the regulations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of family services is in the first instance the statutory responsibility of the health board.  I am aware of the current difficulties being experienced by the Well Woman Centre in Athlone but I understand it continues in operation.  So far, the Midland Health Board has paid £30,000 set up costs to the Well Woman Centre, £40,000 revenue in 1996 and £30,000 to date in revenue this year.  I am of the view that the Well Woman Centre provides an alternative for women in the region.  I share the health board's view that it would be a matter of regret if the service should cease.  I have asked the Midland Health Board to continue its efforts to find a solution to the centre's current difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards other aspects of its work the position <Col N="422" /> is that the Well Woman Centre has received a total of £189,000 in 1997 from the Eastern Health Board in respect of a range of services, including the services in Coolock, as well as other pregnancy counselling services and research on the prevalence of chlamydia.  The board is of the view that these services are adequately funded at present.  I am informed that the board has various reservations about supporting the helpline and, consequently, it informed the Well Woman Centre that funding would not be available for this initiative.</P>
    <P>In relation to information-education, I understand the Eastern Health Board's view that local groups should develop an ownership of and delivery of educational initiatives on women's health matters on an ongoing basis and I believe this may differ from the approach proposed by the Well Woman Centre.</P>

      <P>As Minister I am concerned at the substantial premiums being paid by health agencies to deliver a wide range of health services.  To ensure that better value for money is obtained, the major public voluntary hospitals in Dublin have since the early 1990s come together and gone to the market jointly to obtain insurance on a competitive basis.  Provision is made by this group to review all insurance premia on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>In regard to the health system generally, it is my intention to ensure that all potential economies are pursued by the agencies.  Insurance is one such obvious area and my Department will encourage those agencies which have not already done so to make such arrangements as are necessary to achieve real value for money in this area.</P>

      <P>The new hospital in Tallaght will incorporate the services currently being provided at the Adelaide, the Meath and the National Children's Hospital, together with acute psychiatric services currently being provided at St. Loman's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> The Meath Hospital is a voluntary hospital and has full ownership of its site.  When the services transfer to Tallaght, the hospital site, like the sites of the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospital, will be sold as the premises will no longer function as acute hospitals.  Since agreement was reached on the development of the new hospital &mdash; the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital &mdash; it has always been understood that the three constituent hospitals would close once the new hospital is opened.  However, my Department, with the Eastern Health Board and the hospitals concerned, is currently examining the health service needs of the south inner city catchment population following the transfer of the acute hospital services to Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is providing a range of services for older people in the south inner city.  A 25 bed community nursing unit which has respite, extended care and day care facilities, is operating at Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital.  A 50 bed community nursing unit which will provide similar services at the South Circular Road is nearing completion and is planned to open in 1998.  The Eastern Health Board has, in addition, identified the need to provide secondary rehabilitation, extended care and day hospital facilities for older people living in the area surrounding the Meath Hospital.  The possibility of acquiring the Meath Hospital campus for these and other primary care services is being examined.</P>
    <P>Casualty services in the Dublin area are planned and co-ordinated by the accident and emergency steering group under the chairmanship of the Eastern Health Board's programme manager.  Sympathetic consideration will be given to any proposals which the steering group may put forward, following the transfer of services from the Meath Hospital to Tallaght.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 30, 41 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is some public concern about possible adverse health effects from exposure to radiation emissions from telecommunication masts associated with mobile phone systems.  All significant research in this area is monitored by the Department of Public Enterprise with which my Department liaises regarding the human health aspects.  The general body of scientific evidence to date has not established a definite link between this form of radiation and ill-health.</P>
      <P>Telecommunications companies operating here are licensed by the Department of Public Enterprise.  Companies are required to operate within emission limits set by the International Radiation Protection Association in 1988.  These limits were re-examined last year by the Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection using criteria produced by the World Health Organisation.  The commission endorsed the IRPA levels.  Measurements taken here show that exposure levels are well within the recommended safety levels.</P>
      <P>The Office of Director of Telecommunications Regulation was established earlier this year by the Minister for Public Enterprise.  Its function is to ensure that licensed operators of telecommunications systems comply with all the conditions of their licence, including emission standards.  Emissions are to be monitored on a regular and nationwide basis.</P>
      <P>Early next year my Department will co-sponsor with the Department of Public Enterprise a conference on health issues and the telecommunications infrastructure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The development plan for the Blood Transfusion Service Board provides for major reorganisation and redevelopment of the service to ensure it is in a position to meet international standards in transfusion medicine.  As part of the necessary reorganisation of the Blood Transfusion Service Board significant developments are taking place nationally, including at the Cork centre.  In particular new appointments in information technology, quality assurance and future consultant appointments will strengthen the entire organisation.  My Department has recently made available a capital allocation of £500,000 to the BTSB to progress the vehicle and equipment replacement programme at the Dublin and Cork centres.</P>
      <P>The BTSB is fully committed to ensuring that the Cork centre continues to meet the standards required by the Irish Medicines Board.  The board, in conjunction with my Department, has decided that the Cork centre requires major replacement.  An options appraisal study is under way to assess the options available to meet laboratory and donor clinic requirements.  It is also necessary to address interim refurbishments of existing accommodation and architects are being engaged to oversee these refurbishments.  My Department will make available the necessary resources to achieve the above objectives.</P>
      <P>As regards the manufacturing licence, the current licence expires on 30 November next.  A special condition attached to the licence refers to the area used for the processing of donations at the Cork centre.  The Irish Medicines Board requires a timetable for the upgrading or replacement of this area.  A meeting between officials of the IMB, the BTSB and my Department took place on 29 October last to agree how best to proceed to meet the requirements of the IMB.  Arising from the meeting a detailed timescale for refurbishment-replacement will be submitted to the IMB in the next few days to meet the requirements of a renewal of the manufacturing licence.</P>

On 29 October I received a further letter from Positive Action raising additional legal queries and that letter was also brought to the attention of the Attorney General. I might also mention that I received a letter on 31 October from the family of the late Brigid McCole requesting that there be a full Garda investigation into the death of their mother and that all avenues be explored in relation to any legal action which might be taken against those they consider responsible.

      <P>In relation to secondary care services, treatment for those who contracted hepatitis C from the receipt of blood or blood products is being provided at special consultant staffed clinics at six designated hospitals: Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and St. James's Hospital in Dublin, Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.  These services, provided under the Health Act, 1970, are free of charge and include access to both in-patient and out-patient treatment, as required.  Special funding has been and will continue to be provided by my Department for these services, to ensure that the needs of hepatitis C patients are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, in November 1996, the Consultative Council on Hepatitis C was formally established <Col N="428" /> to advise and make recommendations to me as Minister on all aspects of hepatitis C, including health and counselling services and the funding, organisation and delivery of these services.  The council also monitors the heal-thcare requirements and other needs of hepatitis C sufferers.  I understand that concerns have been expressed recently at the consultative council in relation to the services at one of the designated units and that the council will be making certain recommendations to me on this matter shortly. My Department will address these concerns in association with the hospital involved as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>As regards counselling, it is recognised that both medical and non-medical counselling has an important role in assisting persons diagnosed positive for hepatitis C who may require support. There is a range of such services available.  General practitioners provide a pre-test counselling service and a counselling service for persons diagnosed positive for hepatitis C virus/antibodies. Counselling services are also made available by health boards under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, and provided by hepatology nurses in the six designated units.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that following a recent meeting with Positive Action, I have agreed to initiate a review of services for hepatitis C sufferers.  The detailed arrangements for this review are being examined in consultation with the representative groups.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of extreme inconsistency in the services provided by the health boards but I will be glad to address the matter further if the Deputy is in a position to bring specific examples to my attention.  I do, however, accept that service levels can vary for many reasons including demography, different pattern of eligibility, location of regional and national specialties and the extent to which a health board responds to particular needs.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the principle of equity remains a cornerstone of our health strategy and I am committed to ensuring that access to health care is determined by need rather than ability to pay or geographic location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 27 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1996 there was a total of 53,641 nurses registered with An Bord Altranais.  Of these 44,822 were eligible to practise having paid the annual retention fee required by An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>The number of nurses employed in the public health service has increased steadily in recent years.  Between 1990 and 1995 the whole-time equivalent number of nursing staff employed in the public health service funded directly by my Department increased from 24,732 to 27,359 &mdash; an increase of 2,627 or 10.6 per cent.  Indeed the rate of increase in the number of nursing staff employed has been higher than that for health service employment generally over the same period.  At December 1996 the number had stabilised at 27,264.</P>
      <P>Over recent years the traditional apprenticeship model of pre-registration nursing education and training is being replaced by a new diploma based programme.  Nursing students on the programme are supernumerary to service requirements.  The &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; student nurses' service contribution is being replaced by an appropriate grade-skill mix of qualified nurses and other grades.</P>
      <P>Thus, there is an underlying trend away from less qualified student nurses to fully qualified nurses.  Another factor which should be taken into account is the increasing trend in recent years among health service employers to facilitate nurses who, for personal reasons, do not wish to commit themselves to full-time work.  There are now nearly 4,000 nurses working in formal job-sharing arrangements in addition to the significant number who work part-time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evolving role of the qualified nurse together with structural and work changes appropriate for the effective discharge of that role is central to the terms of reference of the Commission on Nursing chaired by Ms Justice Mella Carroll.  The commission, which recently published its interim report, will issue its recommendations <Col N="430" /> on these matters in its final report.  If it is the case that some of the tasks undertaken by nurses are inappropriate to nurses and can be undertaken by other grades of staff, and it seems from the commission's interim report that this is the case, then issues relating to the availability of nurses must be viewed in that light.  It will be necessary to review this very valuable resource to ensure that nurses are not used inappropriately for non-nursing duties.</P>
    <P>While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, I have asked my officials to keep the overall issue of the availability of nurses under review and to examine with health service employers whether any special initiatives are required in relation to recruitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 36, 111, 129, 130, 132 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of persons awaiting treatment under the specialty of general surgery on 30 June 1997 was 2,995.  The number awaiting ophthalmic surgery on the same date was 2,486 and the numbers awaiting hip replacements amounted to 1,299.  Hip replacements are available from all hospitals that provide orthopaedic surgery as a major specialty.  In 1996 there were 3,971 hip operations in Irish hospitals, or an average of 11 such operations per day.  The number of children awaiting ENT procedures on 30 June 1997 was 2,821.  I am circulating the more detailed information requested by Deputies on these statistics in a set of tables.</P>
      <P>Patients on public waiting lists are of course entitled to avail themselves of private treatment. I have no information on whether those waiting for lengthy periods on public waiting lists are being offered early private treatment.  However, the incentive for public patients to opt for private treatment could be expected to decline as public waiting times are reduced.  I am committed to taking all possible steps to reduce waiting lists and waiting times for patients.  In 1997 the Government allocated £8 million towards the cost of waiting list work and I am confident that this money will have a positive impact on waiting lists by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be notifying health boards and hospitals of revised arrangements for implementing the waiting list initiative in 1998. Among the primary steps to be taken for 1998 are: health agencies will be required to replace a waiting list plan specifying their targets for the year; agencies will be notified of their waiting list funding at a much earlier stage of the year than previously, provided they have submitted a satisfactory waiting list plan; agencies will be asked to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work, if they have not already done so; the importance of validating waiting lists, including those in cardiac surgery, will be emphasised to ensure that we have an accurate and up-to-date picture of the situation; and there will be a continuing focus on waiting list times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait more than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialties targeted for attention.  As part of the revised arrangements for 1998 I will shortly commission an independent evaluation of the waiting list initiative to examine how it has performed and to identify other possible areas of development.</P>

      <P>Smoking prevalence in Ireland has fallen substantially over the past 20 years and my Department is committed to continuing this trend.  This will be effected primarily by way of a combination of health promotion and regulatory measures relating to advertising, sponsorship and restrictions on smoking in certain public places.</P>
      <P>My Department continues to target young people as is evident from the health promotion unit's most recent multi-media anti-smoking campaign, "Say what you like &mdash; smoking kills".  This campaign used a degree of dark humour to encourage smokers to question their reasons for smoking, encouraging them to quit the habit and used television, radio, outdoor and print advertising.  Results of an evaluation of the campaign suggest an encouragingly high level of awareness of the message.  However, it is important to recognise that even the most creative multi-media campaign cannot by itself dissuade people from smoking or encourage smokers to quit.  It is only through a concerted effort involving both statutory and non-statutory groups with an interest in this area that a reduction in the incidence of smoking can be achieved.  Accordingly initiatives such as this form part of an ongoing, wider programme to reduce smoking prevalence.  These efforts include joint initiatives with the health boards and voluntary organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society which seek to prevent children from taking up smoking in the first place.</P>
      <P>Examples of this process can be seen in my Department's two schools programmes.  The Smoking Reduction Action Programme is a peerled anti-smoking programme for schools which was developed by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society, the National Youth Federation and with support from the Department of Education and Science.  Materials were distributed on a widespread basis in 1995 for use as support resources in the junior classes in secondary schools.  The "Smoke-busters" project was developed by the Irish Cancer Society, the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science and the Eastern Health Board.  It is aimed at primary school children, 7-11 years, in an urban environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> Stopping smoking is one of the most immediate and worthwhile contributions anyone can make to the improvement of health, both on an individual and on a collective level.  Obviously, preventing young people from taking up smoking is preferable and my Department will continue its work in this area.  It is essential that the downward trend in the incidence of smoking continues and my Department is working to ensure this decline persists through a combination of health education, health promotion and legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>At present, access to birth records by adopted persons is restricted under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952.  Where circumstances permit, an adoption agency will do what it can to facilitate contact between adopted persons and birth relatives by mutual voluntary consent provided it is satisfied, through counselling, that both parties are fully cognisant of the consideration and implications involved in such a step.  The increased volume of tracing requests to adoption societies and health boards in recent years is an indication of the strength of feeling and strong desire for information by the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>There is a clear need for legislation on this issue in order to provide a structured, coherent and equitable post-adoption contact system. However, it would be prudent to await clarification of a number of constitutional and other legal issues surrounding the question of access to birth records, heard by the Supreme Court in July, before proceeding with legislation in this very sensitive area of human relationships.  The issues heard by the Supreme Court go to the very heart of post-adoption contact as they deal with the right of a child to know the identity of its birth mother and the right of the birth mother to confidentiality.  It is expected that the Supreme Court will deliver its judgment in the case shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An adoption contact register is only one element of a post-adoption contact system and, on its own, will not provide a solution to those experiencing difficulty in tracing a birth parent or child given up for adoption.  Therefore, I do not propose to proceed with the establishment of <Col N="435" /> such a register before finalising proposals on the structure of the wider post-adoption contact system.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, currently there are five MRI scanners in Ireland, four in Dublin and one at Cork University Hospital.  Of the four MRI scanners in Dublin, the only public MRI scanner currently in service is located at Beaumont Hospital.  The fifth MRI scanner located at Cork University Hospital is privately owned.</P>
      <P>The Department has been aware for some time of the need to carry out an overall assessment of MRI scanning facilities in the public hospital service.  Accordingly, an expert study of the existing arrangements for the provision of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilities nationwide and likely future demand in this area was carried out by Professor David Banta, MD, MPH, an international expert in health technology assessment.  Professor Banta identified the need to develop MRI facilities at University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital and the new Tallaght Hospital, with the Galway location as the top priority.  A timescale of three years is envisaged for the programme of enhancement for MRI facilities at the three sites.  Professor Banta's recommendations have been adopted by the Department.  As soon as the MRI programme is completed on the basis of Professor Banta's recommendations the need for future MRI facilities can be examined.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The health board orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through the operation of a consulant-led orthodontic service in each health board.  A primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff. This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and a service of high quality.</P>
      <P>Six health boards now have consultant orthodontists in place together with their supporting teams.  High service levels are being achieved by these boards with reductions in waiting times.</P>
      <P>The two remaining boards have not yet succeeded in recruiting consultants despite a number of attempts.  However, one of the remaining boards proposes to readvertise the post through the Local Appointments Commission in the near future and is hopeful of filling the post on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I will, in conjunction with the health boards, continue to develop the consultant-led orthodontic services over the course of the dental health action plan.  The ultimate objective is to bring the level of service provision in line with the level of treatment need.</P>

      <P>The interim Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which was established on 7 November 1996 on a non-statutory basis by the previous Government, has met on 12 occasions on the dates set out in the following table.  The role of the interim Authority was solely to put in place the necessary administrative structures in advance of the appropriate legislation being enacted.  A much wider remit for such an Authority is envisaged by this Government which has now decided to bring forward a Bill setting up the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to honour the commitment given in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>The Authority will be independent and science-based and will take over the functions relating to food safety currently discharged by other State agencies and Government Departments.</P>

      <P>The current cost of the home help service throughout the country is approximately £17 million.  The number of beneficiaries is around 19,674. It is important to emphasise that the underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a community based good neighbour scheme which would attract volunteers primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community service.  The service does not come within the realm of conventional employment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has raised the cost of the service in the context of discussions on a national minimum wage.  As he is aware discussions are taking place under the aegis of the National Minimum Wage Commission.  The commission has not yet reported to Government and therefore it would not be appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of such deliberations.  The application of an increase as the Deputy has outlined would have a very significant impact on the costs of the service as currently provided, would have implications for the operation of the service and would have to be considered in the overall context of the care of older people.  It would not be appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of the review of the home help service currently being undertaken; or to make provision for increases of this order in the 1998 Estimates.  I have sought increased funding in relation to the general provision of care for older people, through a variety of services and I expect that some of the additional funding will be directed to the home help service.</P>

      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which were introduced under Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, came into operation on 31 December 1996.  The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cre ches, some childminders and other similar services <Col N="442" /> which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Pre-schools are subject to inspection by the health boards to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Child Care Act and the regulations.  Where a pre-school provider and-or her premises does not meet these requirements, details of the deficiencies will be outlined in writing and she will be given a specific period of time within which to make specific improvements (provided such a delay would not adversely affect the welfare of the children).  A further inspection will be made after that date.</P>
      <P>One of the terms of reference of the Expert Working Group on Childcare which was established under Partnership 2000 was to consider the implementation of Part VII of the Child Care Act.  In this regard a working group to monitor the implementation of Part VII of the Act and to deal with any difficulties which might arise was recently established in my Department.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the operation of the regulations will be reviewed after three years, with a view to effecting any changes considered necessary at that stage.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if the logical conclusion from the recent Garda report regarding crime in Dublin would be that crime could be massively reduced were every heroin addict to be urgently provided with a place on a treatment, rehabilitation and after care programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17068/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised that there is an association between heroin misuse and the incidence of crime.  The Garda Síochána annual report for 1996 shows that almost all controlled drug proceedings involving heroin in 1996 took place in the Dublin metropolitan area region, where they accounted for 35 per cent (430) of total drug proceedings in that area.  We know also from the Health Research Board and from the reports of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs that the heroin problem is confined in the main to the greater Dublin area and that it is most acute in the areas of the greatest social and economic disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy to prevent drug misuse recognises that a multi-sectoral approach, involving supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment programmes, coupled with a comprehensive co-ordinated structure to ensure effective implementation is required to tackle the heroin problem.</P>
      <P>The ministerial task force identified a response to the heroin problem as a priority and its recommendations in relation to service provision included that the Eastern Health Board waiting list be eliminated in 1997.  The health board produced a service plan to achieve this target and since the beginning of the year the board has made significant progress on implementation of the plan.  Services have been expanded in the areas of education, prevention, detoxification, treatment and rehabilitation.  Since the beginning of the year over 900 new people have been provided with treatment, through the board's six addiction centres, 15 satellite clinics or through their general practitioners.  Other locations have been identified for treatment facilities, and the board is working, in consultation with local communities, on the establishment of these facilities in the coming months.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the elimination of waiting lists for treatment will have a significant impact on reducing the heroin problem.  However, expanding health services alone will not solve the problem.  Consequences of opiate abuse and addiction on personal lives and community life include becoming involved in crime and obtaining a criminal record, which in turn negatively affect a person's future chances of obtaining employment, of breaking the cycle of addiction and of reintegration into society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason new co-ordinating structures have been put in place involving the establishment <Col N="444" /> of a Cabinet subcommittee on drugs, a national drugs strategy team and 13 local drugs task forces in priority areas where the drugs problem was most acute.  Twelve of these are in Dublin and one is in north Cork city.  A sum of £10 million was made available for the implementation of service development plans in the task force areas and £3 million for estate improvements by local authorities.  A number of initiatives are under way in the priority areas.</P>
    <P>The response to the drugs problem must be part of a wider response which will also tackle the issues of poverty, deprivation and social exclusion.  The brief of the Cabinet sub-committee has been expanded to include social exclusion and local development as well as drugs.  This Government is focused on dealing with this problem.  A Minister of State was appointed at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation with special responsibility for local development and the national drugs strategy team.</P>
    <P>Solving the heroin problem in Dublin is a concern for a large number of Government Departments and other agencies.  The Eastern Health Board, for its part, is working at full capacity to expand its services to provide treatment and care for all who need it, but it must be supported in its efforts by local communities in allowing it establish treatment facilities in areas where the need for such treatment facilities has been identified.  The board is being supported in its endeavours by the local drugs task forces.</P>

      <P>With the aim of ensuring equity in its operation, the indicative drug target (IDT) scheme has undergone a number of modifications since its inception, for example, to take account of matters such as changes in the structure of a doctor's patient panel and cases where patients due to the nature of their illness, incur higher than normal prescribing costs.  In this regard, discussions are currently under way between the Department, the health boards and the Irish Medical Organisation with a view to introducing some further refinements in the scheme for 1998.  I expect these discussions to be completed within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been the subject of an independent review by a group under the chairmanship of Professor Michael Murphy, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology, University College Cork. The recommendations in that report, particularly in regard to the measurement of the quality of care and the greater involvement of patients will be taken on board in the further development of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied with the success of the <Col N="445" /> IDT scheme.  Most doctors are now achieving more rational and cost-effective prescribing.  The average annual rise in the General Medical Services drug costs has fallen to approximately 6 per cent compared to 10 per cent prior to the inception of the scheme.  This containment in costs is in no small way directly related to the impact of the IDT scheme and the achievement of more effective prescribing by doctors.  Arising from savings made under the scheme, significant resources have been provided for the development of general practice which, in turn, has resulted in a more comprehensive and better quality service for patients.  It is important to point out that the IDT scheme does not provide the general practitioner with a personal remunerative advantage, rather it provides a means for investment in facilities, equipment and services in his-her own practice in the first instance and for other practices in the health board's area.  Such investment is to the advantage of all patients.</P>
    <P>Agreement in principle has been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation to co-operate in developing initiatives aimed at achieving more cost effective prescribing under the community drug schemes.  However, further analysis of prescribing under these schemes is required before detailed discussions can commence on the format of any initiatives in this area.</P>

    <P>Information as to the ages of those affected is not available.  The majority of cases of the disease are known to occur in babies, children and persons under the age of 25.</P>
    <P>As part of my Department's response to the rise in the number of cases of meningitis, the working group on bacterial meningitis was established in 1996 under the chairmanship of a deputy chief medical officer of the Department of Health.  Its remit was &ldquo;to examine the incidence of bacterial meningitis and related conditions, and to make such recommendations as may be required to strengthen the surveillance and control of these conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The working group produced its report in January 1997 and made a number of recommendations relating to improved procedures for the diagnosis, surveillance and treatment of meningitis.  These are being implemented by the health boards and other agencies concerned.  The working group has continued in existence to monitor the situation and to provide advice on the surveillance and control of meningitis as required.</P>
    <P>My Department has taken a number of steps to raise awareness of meningitis.  The health promotion unit has produced a revised leaflet for the information of the public generally and a leaflet for general practitioners.  An updated press facts document is being issued to the national media. My Department has also provided financial assistance to the Meningitis Research Foundation to enable an information and education officer to be employed for the next three years.  The foundation carries out valuable work in ensuring a high level of public awareness about meningitis and there is co-operation between the health boards and the foundation in relation to public talks and local awareness campaigns.</P>
    <P>The chief medical officer of my Department has recently written on my behalf to the director of public health in each health board, requesting that they take all necessary measures to ensure the highest possible awareness in relation to bacterial meningitis, principally meningococcal meningitis, among professionals, parents and the public generally.

      <P>I am aware that there is a continuing need to promote public awareness of the risk of HIV infection and AIDS.  For many years now, my Department has been working to address this issue. Initiatives developed by the health promotion unit of my Department include information literature, training programmes and mass media campaigns.</P>
      <P>Mass media campaigns involving radio, television and newspaper advertisements, with a strong message emphasising the use of condoms in reducing the risk of sexually transmitted HIV, have in the past been formulated and transmitted. Such campaigns are usually transmitted to coincide with World AIDS Day and Irish AIDS Day.  To mark World AIDS Day 1997 the health promotion unit of my Department in conjunction with the education and prevention sub-committee of the national AIDS strategy committee is organising a conference in Dublin Castle on 21 November.  This conference will review the communication strategies that have been employed to date to create awareness about this virus and will make recommendations for future awareness raising initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's narrowcast advertising initiative (convenience advertising) continues to be very successful.  This initiative involves the placement of AIDS awareness and sexual health messages in washroom-toilet areas of third level colleges, selected entertainment venues, pool halls and community centres.  As a media strategy this campaign shows high rates of recall and succeeds <Col N="448" /> in reaching the target audience with appropriate messages.  The messages are continually reviewed and updated.</P>
    <P>The unit has also produced an AIDS education video entitled &ldquo;Don't Turn Away&rdquo;.  The video deals with how transmission of HIV occurs and with ways of preventing infection.  It has been widely distributed to health boards and other selected outlets.  Recognising the fact that attitudes and behaviours acquired early on in life greatly influence patterns of behaviour in later life, an AIDS education resource pack for second level schools was developed by the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science, in the early 1990s.  Its dissemination was accompanied by training seminars for teachers. As well as providing information, the pack aims to encourage amongst students a mature attitude in assuming responsibility for their own health and the health of others.  In order to support school and community based AIDS education programmes, the health promotion unit disseminates information literature and posters relating to HIV and AIDS.  These resources are distributed widely to health and education agencies and other relevant agencies.</P>
    <P>My Department is very aware of the role of the voluntary sector in HIV-AIDS education and prevention and supports projects and initiatives carried out by voluntary organisations.  In order to support the work of AIDS educators and workers in the statutory and voluntary sector, the health promotion unit has organised training seminars and information days and also published a set of Guidelines for Effective HIV/AIDS Education.</P>
    <P>I am also very conscious of the link between drug misuse and AIDS and since the publication of the national AIDS strategy in 1992, which identified the close connection between HIV/AIDS and intravenous drug misuse there has been an emphasis on putting in place a comprehensive treatment network for intravenous drug misusers in order to prevent the spread of HIV in this way.  The most recent statistics for HIV show that 45 per cent of positive cases are intravenous drug misusers.  Intravenous drug misuse is confined in the main to the Eastern Health Board, which has been engaged in a major expansion of its services in order to eliminate waiting lists for treatment.  The board at present provides drug treatment services in six addiction centres, 15 satellite clinics and a mobile clinic in the Greater Dublin Area.  Services, which are available at these facilities may include education, counselling, HIV testing, needle exchange and methadone treatment.</P>
    <P>Specific educational initiatives in place to tackle substance misuse are a video entitled &ldquo;My Best Friend&rdquo;; a substance misuse prevention programme entitled &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; and a national youth health programme which develops and implements health education initiatives in the non-formal education sector.</P>
    <P>The community health division of my Department <Col N="449" /> is providing financial support for the position of project director who will assist with the implementation of the recommendations of the GLEN/NEXUS report on HIV prevention strategies and the gay community.  This report is based on a study of the needs and capacity of gay community organisations to carry out effective HIV prevention work.</P>
    <P>You may be assured that my Department will continue to use appropriate communication strategies and to work closely with the statutory and voluntary sector in raising public awareness about the HIV virus, risk of HIV infection and the resultant consequences of infection including developing AIDS.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of separate facilities in maternity hospitals for mothers suffering from post natal depression is essentially an operational matter for the hospitals concerned.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of maternity hospitals and I am advised that the incidence of severe post natal psychosis is relatively low and estimated at four to five cases per one thousand deliveries.  I am assured that there are protocols in place to deal with post natal depression.  In most cases post natal depression is treated on an out-patient basis.  However, I understand that if the mother's depression warrants in-patient treatment the practice is that the mother is admitted to a psychiatric unit in a general hospital and where possible with her baby.  I am not aware of particular difficulties in the provision of this service.  However, if the Deputy has a particular case in mind, he might bring it to my attention and I will refer it to the appropriate agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board, which was published in March 1997, made six key recommendations and the following is the current position in relation to their implementation:</P>
      <P>1.  BTSB's Development Plan</P>
      <P>The BTBS's development plan details a major renewal, reorganisation and investment programme over the coming years.  Implementation of the key elements of the plan are progressing as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>As regards the construction of new national headquarters at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, I understand that a detailed sketch design has been agreed with the board and an application for full planning permission was submitted to Dublin Corporation on 30 October 1997.  It is expected that the building contract will be placed for tender in November.  The cost projection is £25 million.  In respect of the Cork centre, an investment programme will involve upgrading or replacing existing buildings.</P>
      <P>A new information technology department has been established at the BTSB and it expects to complete contract negotiations for a new software system shortly with a leading international supplier.  My Department will be making available approximately £2 million to support the accelerated implementation of this new IT system.  Significant new appointments have been made recently in the medical scientific and technical, and Quality Assurance areas.  My Department will continue to work closely with the board to provide support and rapid decision making in relation to the implementation of the plan.</P>
      <P>2/3.  Monitoring of the BTSB by the Irish Medicines Board and the reporting of abnormal reactions</P>
      <P>Arrangements have already been put in place to conduct more regular inspections at the BTSB as recommended by the tribunal.  In relation to the separate annual report to be prepared by the Irish Medicines Board, I understand that a report will be submitted to me by the end of this year concerning the outcome of these inspections and any report of abnormal reactions or blood product transfusion.  The Irish Medicines Board and my Department will have consultations with regard to the appropriate format of this annual report which I will publish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> In addition, the BTSB and my Department are developing proposals to establish on a pilot basis a haemovigilance programme to build on the current reporting of serious adverse reports by effective, timely and reliable co-ordination and evaluation of reports from hospitals.  Discussions have already taken place with the Irish Medicines Board on the most effective implemention of such a haemovigilance system.  The Irish Medicines Board already has in place a pharmacovigilance system for monitoring adverse reactions to medicinal products.</P>
    <P>4.  Blood Service Consumers Council</P>
    <P>I will shortly be establishing a standing committee on transfusion medicine to support the development of best transfusion practice in hospitals.  This committee will include consultants from major surgery specialties and will develop blood utilisation guidelines and key indicators of quality in clinical transfusion practice as well as having a role in understanding and informing patients' attitudes and concerns about transfusion.  The tribunal report recommended that a major contribution to the maintenance of public confidence in the supply of blood products could be made by the establishment of a Blood Service Consumers Council.  In that regard my Department is currently preparing proposals on the role and function of this advisory council which will complement the separate roles and functions of the Irish Medicines Board, the consultative council on hepatitis C and the standing committee on transfusion medicine.</P>
    <P>5.  Product Recall</P>
    <P>In relation to the recommendation concerning procedures for the recall of products, the BTSB has in place standard operating procedures for recall of products and these are reviewed regularly by the Irish Medicines Board.  As an additional support to hospitals, the BTSB will shortly issue a revised protocol for use by hospitals to assist in the tracing of products to a named patient.</P>
    <P>6.  Replacement of Blood or Blood Products</P>
    <P>The BTSB has arrangements in place, should the need arise, for the immediate replacement of blood components such as red cells, platelets and plasma.  As regards other blood products, the BTSB and the Irish medicines board are finalising arrangements for the alternate supplies of licensed blood products.  In addition, my Department is currently preparing legislation to provide a statutory framework for the supply and use of unlicensed products where such use is considered necessary by clinicians to meet the particular needs of individual patients in special circumstances.</P>

Information of this nature is not normally held by my Department.  The details are being sought from the health boards and I will write directly to the Deputy advising him of the position.</P>
      <P>The Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed (INOU) has met with officials of my Department regarding the implementation of the 1996 budget provision on the retention of medical cards by persons who have been on the live register for at least 12 months who take up paid insurable employment and, also, by participants on approved schemes aimed at the long-term unemployed.  Health boards have been made aware of the concerns of the INOU and arrangements are being put in place to address these concerns.  I am advised that the Department of Social, Family and Community Affairs has commissioned an independent review of secondary and other benefits (such as the medical card), in relation to their effect on labour market participation.  This review will examine, <i>inter alia</i>, any anomalies in the operation of the provisions relating to retention of medical cards by persons participating in community employment schemes.</P>

      <P>The national alcohol policy was launched in September 1996.  It is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption. Because alcohol problems are multidimensional the policy sets out multisectoral solutions requiring both environmental and individual strategies.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the policy, a number of elements of the Action Plan has been put in place.  The most significant of these are: the national alcohol surveillance centre has been established; a contract for a national lifestyle survey has been awarded; a contract for a new advertising campaign which will emphasise the message of moderation in drinking has been awarded.  The campaign will run in January 1998.</P>
      <P>Work is ongoing on a number of the longer term elements of the action plan, including developing the school curriculum to include a significant level of health as part of the curriculum, based on a lifeskills approach; development of policies in relation to health promoting schools, hospitals, workplaces and campuses which would include policies in relation to alcohol use; discussions with the drinks industry on their response to the policy, with particular reference to the problems of under-age drinking and the consumption of &ldquo;alcopops&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is intended to continue with the elements of the plan already commenced, and to make progress in relation to initiatives involving other Departments.  Co-operation with industry groups will continue with a view to encouraging the industry to play its part in encouraging moderation in alcohol consumption.  In addition, actions taken on the basis of the plan will be evaluated on an ongoing basis, so that the policy can be focused and effective.</P>

      <P>My Department has been aware for some time of the need for improved co-ordination and consultation in the delivery of paediatric services for the Dublin area.  Following discussions with my Department, the chairmen of the three Dublin children's hospitals &mdash; Temple Street, Harcourt Street and Crumlin &mdash; have recently agreed to examine methods to allow the three institutions work together to provide improved care for children.  In the course of this exercise, the hospitals propose to: (a) clarify current clinical links between the three hospitals; (b) identify each hospital's plans for development; (c) develop proposals for co-operation in provision of non-clinical services and in the training and education of staff.  The Deputy may also wish to note that the hospitals have enlisted the services of Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien to act as a facilitator and I would hope that the discussions can be completed early in the new year. When I have the benefit of the combined thinking of the hospitals on the matter, I will be happy to consider whatever proposals may emerge regarding the development of secondary and tertiary hospital services for children.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses.  The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.  I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>

      <P>The national AIDS strategy committee was established in 1991 to examine various aspects of HIV and AIDS.  Sub-committees were in turn set up to deal with surveillance, education and prevention, care and management and anti-discrimination.  These expert committees have met on numerous occasions since then and have dealt with a variety of issues related to HIV and AIDS.

      <P>I have requested the board of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital to consider a phased opening of the new hospital at Tallaght with the majority of the services being transferred by May of next year.  I have also asked that the hospital ensure that the St. Loman's service should transfer as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that the hospital should open at the earliest opportunity.  I have met the board of the hospital in this regard and it is in no doubt as to my views and requirements. The Department has requested comprehensive <Col N="457" /> and detailed plans from the board of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital for the opening of the new hospital as soon as possible.  These plans are scheduled for discussion between the Department and the hospital early next week.  On receipt of the plans for opening and following the discussions with the board the precise details as to the hospital's opening will be clearer.</P>

      <P>Monitoring of standards of care and standards of accommodation provided for patients in psychiatric hospitals is carried out by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  The inspector carries out annual inspections of all psychiatric hospitals, including St. Ita's Hospital.  In his report for 1995, the inspector noted the enhancement of the overall appearance of clinical areas and also the improvement in staff morale in the hospital but acknowledged that further improvement in standards was necessary.  In his rpeort for 1996 the inspector referred to the continuation of the upgrading and refurbishment of patients facilities. A total of £500,000 was spent on upgrading facilities in St. Ita's Hospital in 1994 and 1995.  In 1996 my Department provided a further £250,000, while the board provided £60,000 from its own resources which enabled further substantial upgrading to be carried out in all patient care areas throughout the hospital.</P>
      <P>The board's current development plans in relation to the St. Ita's Hospital campus provide for the closure of old wards in the main hospital block in line with the reduction in patient numbers in the psychiatric service and mental handicap service of St. Ita's.  It is envisaged that the main hospital will be closed as a residential facility.  This will be facilitated by the provision of purpose built residential facilities in the community and on the hospital campus for residents with a mental handicap, and the transfer of long-term older psychiatric patients from the main hospital block to more modern accommodation on the hospital campus as vacancies arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1997, the board adopted a development plan &mdash; St. Ita's Mental Handicap Service Development Programme 1997-1998 &mdash; which provides for the replacement of the older facilities in the hospital by the commissioning of four community residences and two village complexes providing a total of 85 places in the community. Implementation of the plans is under way with capital funding of £650,000 and revenue funding of £625,000 being made available this year by my <Col N="458" /> Department.  This will facilitate an additional 50 places in the community.</P>
    <P>I met with the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board on Monday 10 November, 1997 to discuss this matter and the measures required to implement the remaining elements of the board's plan for the overall development of the campus.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the board are committed to the continuing implementation of this development programme.</P>

      <P>The provision of additional cardiac surgery facilities is a matter of national importance and one which will require significant capital and revenue investment over the next few years.  The policy decision to locate a third cardiac surgery unit at St. James's Hospital was based on the recommendations of the cardiac surgery option appraisal group and was announced a matter of days before my appointment as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>On taking office, I undertook to examine the report of the cardiac surgery option appraisal group to satisfy myself in relation to the policy basis for this major service development.  The question of the provision of cardiac care services overall is under review at the moment.  However, I hope to be in a position to bring my proposals to Government in this regard in the very near future.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of respite services for children with disabilities is a vital part of the support services required by families in caring for children with disabilities.  Respite care is provided in a number of ways.  In some cases it is provided in a residential setting.  It is also provided by host families through the various share a break schemes.  The <Col N="459" /> home support services can also provide shorter respite breaks for carers.  In particular additional funding amounting to almost £69 million has been invested in services to persons with a mental handicap since 1990 which has resulted in an enhanced level of residential, day and respite facilities.  The respite care services will continue to be expanded.  Account has been and will continue to be taken of this need in the allocation of additional resources for the provision of new residential facilities and the enhancement of other schemes which assist families in this area.</P>
      <P>I recently met with one of the founder members of the Jack and Jill foundation to discuss the research work carried out for the foundation by the UCD marketing development programme.  In addition to the need for increased respite facilities, the report also raised other issues related to the early intervention services generally.  The development of better diagnostic techniques and improved early intervention services is vital in assisting both the families and individual children with delayed development to maximise their full potential.  Improved access to these services and better communication between both the various professionals involved with the services and the families are key components of the overall development of services.  I have recently provided additional funding of £25,000 for a pilot project, in conjunction with the Mid-Western Health Board, on the early intervention services in that region.  The purpose of this project is to look at the processes of referral and access to support services, beginning with the earliest stage in the maternity hospitals working through the roles of the various multidisciplinary inputs which children with delayed development may require and the services which they provide. This would include paediatricians, directors of community care, counselling nurses, public health nurses, community based multidisciplinary staff and specialist diagnostic and treatment services in the hospital system.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the importance of the initiation and maintenance of the lines of communication necessary to enable parents to freely access the various services which their child requires and on the provision of information regarding their entitlements, the support which may be available to them and how to access that support.  It is my intention to use the report on this project to highlight methods of best practice in this area and to disseminate this information to other health board regions.</P>

I understand from the board that the person in question was placed on the waiting list for renal dialysis in October 1997.  The new dialysis unit opened in March 1997 catering for 32 patients per week.  In May 1997 additional funding of £100,000 was provided by my Department to enable the hospital to provide dialysis for patients that were on the waiting list at that time.  The unit is working at full capacity with a total attendance of 42 patients per week.  I understand the board is currently reviewing the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fisheries Council of Ministers of 30 October 1997 discussed and decided on a proposal for a Council regulation laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources and a proposal for amending the existing Council control regulation to provide for catch reporting.</P>
      <P>The Council agreed a package of fishery conservation measures which will protect and rebuild stocks.  The following key conservation measures were agreed and will be implemented on a phased basis over the next 18 months, the introduction of square mesh panels in nephrop nets; an increase in net mesh size to 100 mm for whitefish stocks such as cod, haddock and whiting; new rules on fish discards which will ensure that the levels of fish thrown away at sea are minimised; a commitment from the Commission to scientifically assess the need for conservation boxes, and to introduce them if required, for valuable hake stocks in Irish waters.</P>
      <P>At the Council, agreement was also secured to the introduction of &ldquo;real time&rdquo; catch reporting from next year by fishing vessels.  This proposal entailed amending the existing Council control regulation to provide that in addition to fishing boats having to report when entering and leaving zones they must also report the quantities of fish on board by species.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that both of these measures will be of direct and fundamental importance for Ireland as the coastal State most directly concerned.  They will contribute significantly to conservation and control objectives to the benefit of the Irish industry, and will be of special importance in addressing the problems associated with the operation of flagships in Irish waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council also reviewed EU policy on fisheries agreements with third countries.  The Council reaffirmed its commitment to fisheries agreements as an essential and integral component of the Common Fisheries Policy.  It was agreed that a cost benefit analysis will be carried out to be completed by June 1999 when policy guidelines will be reviewed.  The Council also concluded on <Col N="463" /> the principles that should decide the negotiation and implementation of fisheries agreements in the interim period.  I will be continuing to push for maximisation of all realisable opportunities for the Irish fishing sector in all such agreements.</P>
    <P>Under any other business the Commission agreed to consider the position in relation to the EU autonomous tariff quota for cod in light of the concerns of some member states.  It also noted the situation on drift nets where the UK signalled a policy change in the direction of banning drift nets in the tuna fishery.  We will be carefully considering the implications of the new UK stance for the Irish position in light of likely developments on the issue during the UK Presidency in the first half of 1998.  The Spanish delegation provided information on the establishment of a Spanish fishery protection zone in the Mediterranean.</P>

      <P>In the 1992-93 milk quota year the member states concerned were granted additional milk quota to deal with the problems resulting from the implementation by them of the quota system.  At the same time the national quota of <Col N="467" /> all other member states was increased by 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>While the Santer package as set out in Agenda 2000 supports the continuation of the quota regime until the year 2006, detailed proposals by the Commission on the future of the dairy regime will not be submitted until early in 1998 when negotiations will begin in Council.  In these negotiations, which are expected to cover a wide range of issues related to the sector, I will be seeking the best possible outcome for the Irish dairy industry.</P>

      <P>No such arrangement was signed between Ireland and the EU.  When milk quotas were introduced in 1984 it was widely acknowledged that Ireland did particularly well by comparison with other member states.  There have been many developments since then in relation to the operation of the EU dairy regime, including overall increases and decreases in national quotas.  By and large, Ireland has done relatively better than most other member states if the effects of these also are aggregated.  The future of the dairy regime, including that of the milk quota system will feature in the negotiations on the Santer package.  It will be my objective in that context to achieve the best possible outcome for Ireland.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> ¹ This rate is due to be increased on phased basis w.e.f. 1 July 1997 as part of a proposal by the SHB which is awaiting agreement by the Union.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a community based good neighbour scheme which would attract volunteers primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community service.  The service does not come within the realm of conventional employment.  Income in respect of services provided is a payment which is not intended to compensate fully for the nature of the task undertaken.  Such income does not come within the scope of the PAYE code and is not taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a home help, or the spouse of a home help, is in receipt of a means-tested social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>This issue has been raised on many occasions in the House.  My Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, is considering a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within the health boards for the provision of this service.  My Department has arranged to have an examination of the operation of the home help services carried out by an independent body, under the supervision of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, which will advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services.  Work has commenced on this project and will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>When the results of this examination are made available to me, I will be in a better position to consider how best improvements may be brought about in the overall organisation and development of the home help service.  Related issues such as rates for home helps will be considered as part of this process.  My Department has allocated additional funding to three boards in 1997 for the purposes of increasing rates of pay to home helps. It is my intention to facilitate the improvement of the provision of the home help service, including pay rates, on a phased basis as resources permit.</P>
    <P>The application of the increase outlined by the Deputy would have a very significant impact on the costs of the service as currently provided, would have implications for the operation of the service and would have to be considered in the overall context of the care of older people.  It <Col N="470" /> would not be appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of the review of the home help service currently being undertaken; or to make provision for increases of this order in the 1998 Estimates.  I have sought increased funding in relation to the general provision of care for older people, through a variety of services and I expect that some of the additional funding will be directed to the home help service.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of hospital services in Dublin is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has put in place in recent years the following services which have allowed older patients who have completed the acute phase of their medical treatment to transfer to the level of care which is appropriate to their medical needs: 280 additional intermittent-respite, convalescent-rehabilitation and extended care places; 60 additional day care places; 23 community ward teams which support older people in their homes and a rehabilitation/stroke day service at Baggot Street Hospital.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed by the Eastern Health Board to build further community units for older people strategically located throughout its area to meet the increasing needs of older people in the light of the demographic information available.  A community unit is nearing completion at South Circular Road, and further units are planned for Glasnevin, Raheny, Beaumont, as well as Dalkey and north Kildare.  These units will include a full spectrum of services including respite-intermittent care, convalescent/rehabilitation care, extended care and day care.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, patients who wish to avail of step-down care from an acute hospital setting can do so in Caritas and Beaumont convalescent homes and are entitled to financial assistance from the board.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to change the basis of entitlement to health services in Ireland to provide free general practitioner medical services to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> Approximately 35 per cent of the population hold medical cards under the general medical services scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are drawn up by chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, those whose income exceeds the guidelines may qualify for a medical card if their health board considers that they are unable to provide necessary medical care for themselves or their family.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision it is felt that it is not justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to everyone without reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the finite resources available to meet them.</P>

      <P>I am aware there is some public concern about possible adverse health effects from exposure to radiation emissions from telecommunication masts associated with mobile phone systems.  All significant research in this area is monitored by the Department of Public Enterprise with which my Department liaises regarding the human health aspects.  The general body of scientific evidence to date has not established a definite link between this form of radiation and ill health.</P>
      <P>Telecommunications companies operating here are licensed by the Department of Public Enterprise.  Companies are required to operate within emission limits set by the International Radiation Protection Association in 1988.  These limits were re-examined last year by the Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection using criteria produced by the World Health Organisation.  The commission endorsed the IRPA levels.  Measurements taken here show that exposure levels are well within the recommended safety levels.</P>
      <P>The Office of Director of Telecommunications Regulation was established earlier this year by the Minister for Public Enterprise.  Its function is to ensure that licensed operators of telecommunications systems comply with all the conditions of their licence including emission standards.  Emissions are to be monitoried on a regular and nationwide basis.  Early next year my Department will co-sponsor with the Department of Public Enterprise a conference on health issues and the telecommunications infrastructure.</P>

      <P>Public waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis.  The figures for adults are recorded in two categories, those waiting between three and 12 months and those waiting over 12 months.  In respect of children, the figures are recorded in two categories, those waiting between three and six months and those waiting over six months.  At the end of September 1997 there were 1,586 patients, adults and children, on the cardiac surgery waiting list; 77 per cent of adult patients have been waiting over one year and 68 per cent of children have been waiting over six months.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that I have recently approved a sum of £1.7 million under the 1997 waiting list initiative, specifically for cardiac surgery patients.  I am confident that this will impact positively on the cardiac surgery waiting list.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional cardiac surgery facilitates is a matter of national importance and one which will require significant capital and revenue investment over the next few years.  The question of the provision of cardiac care services overall is under review at the moment.  However, I hope to be in a position to bring my proposals to Government in this regard in the very near future.  An announcement will then be made on the location of additional cardiac care services.</P>

      <P>The Government's commitment to the ongoing development of services to persons with physical disabilities or mental handicap is clearly outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  I will be seeking additional funding for 1998 so that the process of meeting these needs can continue.</P>
      <P>In relation to the identification of service requirements such as residential and respite places for persons with a mental handicap, the National Intellectual Disability Database is now providing my Department, the health boards and voluntary service providers with comprehensive information on the population of persons with a mental handicap and their needs over the next five years.  The database does not hold details of service requirements over a ten year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001 which is based on information from the National Intellectual Disability Database, identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential/respite places and 1,036 new day <Col N="476" /> places over the next five years.  It is estimated that the cost of providing these services would be in the region of £63.5 million over the period. Additional revenue funding of £12 million was made available in 1997 to begin the process of meeting these needs.</P>
    <P>Respite care is provided in a number of ways. In some cases it is provided in a residential setting, which may be in places specifically designated as respite, or alternatively through the use at weekends of places vacated by people who are in receipt of five day residential services.  It is also provided by host families through the various share a break schemes.  The home support services can also provide shorter respite breaks for carers.</P>
    <P>With regard to people with physical disabilities, the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996, recommended that 200 respite places and 100 residential places should be provided.  A new national respite centre in Donamon, Roscommon, run by the Irish Wheelchair Association, which provides up to 60 places for respite and holiday breaks, was officially opened in June this year.  In addition, 18 new respite places have been established in four health board areas in 1996-97. There is also a fund of £500,000, transferred to my Department in 1995 from the Department of Social Welfare, for the payment of grants to voluntary organisations providing respite care services.  This fund is administered by the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 144 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The membership of Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was provided for on their establishment in the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993.  The number of elected members on Dublin City Council was determined in the Local Government <Col N="480" /> (Reorganisation) Act, 1985.  There are no proposals at present to amend these provisions.  I have no plans to revise the administrative boundaries of the Dublin authorities, nor have any of the authorities made submissions in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are no constitutional or statutory requirements relating to equality of representation between local authorities.  Each local authority operates within its own administrative area and the main priority is that the relevant council has sufficient members to carry out its functions effectively.</P>
    <P>There are significant variations in the councillor to population ratios as between local authorities.  The question of an appropriate level of local representation is a complex and difficult one affecting all local authorities.  I will consider this matter in the context of the overall programme of local government renewal.  Later next year, I hope to bring forward a local government Bill to underpin the reform programme and to modernise local government law.</P>

      <Quest>if consideration has been given to pre-1953 social insurance contributions being calculated for old age pension eligibility where there is a minimum shortfall in post-1953 contributions.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of the retirement pension, registered since January 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.  The yearly average condition will be reduced to ten contributions for the new <i>pro rata</i> old age (contributory) pension from 21 November next.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable &mdash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions.  These gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
      <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of this pension.  However, as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of the satisfying of the yearly average test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, social insurance paid before 1953 <Col N="481" /> under the national health insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age contributory pension in satisfying the first two conditions, set out in the first paragraph above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>

      <Quest>the reason disability benefit has been refused in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare in view of the fact that her general practitioner is adamant that this person is not suitable for the type of wide range of employment suggested by the appeals officer and that no medical practitioner could certify her as fit for alternative employment unless mistaking the facts thereby incurring possible liability to an employer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 15 April 1993.  Payment was disallowed by a deciding officer from 24 March 1997 following an examination by a medical assessor who considered that she was capable of work.  The person concerned appealed this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office and in the context of her appeal she was examined by another medical assessor who was also of the opinion that she was capable of work.  The case was also considered by the Department's deputy chief medical adviser.</P>
      <P>Following an oral hearing of her appeal on 14 October 1997, and taking account of all the evidence available in the case, an appeals officer decided that she was not incapable of work within the meaning of the social welfare Acts and disallowed her appeal.  She was notified of the appeals officer's decision on 10 November.  The appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive in the absence of new evidence or new facts or any change of circumstances since the decision was given.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of policy that prisoners are provided with comprehensive medical treatment broadly equivalent to that available to citizens covered by the public health-general medical services.  Part-time medical officers are assigned to each prison and inmates have access, if required, to these doctors on a daily basis. Where it is not possible to treat an offender in the prison environment he or she may be escorted to and from a local hospital for outpatient treatment or may be transferred to hospital if a longer stay is required.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy and I am satisfied that appropriate medical treatment is available to the prisoner in question.  I understand, however, that the prisoner is often unwilling to accept medical advice and has consistently failed to comply with his treatment regime.</P>

      <P>It is routine practice in most primary schools now to assess the progress of pupils at the end of each year and particularly at the end of the final year at school.  This assessment usually involves the administration of a range of tests which are based on the work of the year and include tests of literacy and numeracy as well as other aspects of the curriculum.  The tests used include standardised tests in reading and mathematics as well as teacher designed instruments for the assessment of other aspects of the curriculum.  The results of such testing form the basis of progress reports to parents and of reports on <Col N="484" /> pupils transferring to second level for the information of their schools.</P>
      <P>The administration, under the supervision of my Department, of a standard test for literacy and numeracy at the end of primary schooling is not envisaged at present.  However, the assessment of pupil achievements generally within the curriculum in primary schools is being reviewed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and a committee has been established by the council to advise on the matter.  The report of the council on this matter will be available later in the school year.</P>

      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio for second level schools is 19:1.  A number of EU funded programmes at second level attract a teacher allocation of 1.25 per group of 20 pupils.  This equates to a PTR of 16:1.</P>
      <P>Additional allocations are made in respect of posts such as principal, vice principal, remedial, resource, disadvantaged area and guidance where these may be granted on an ex-quota basis within current regulations.  Taking the allocation of teaching posts for all daytime pupils into account, the average actual PTR for second level schools in County Meath is 16.6:1 compared with a national average of 15.8:1.</P>
