      <P>It is proposed to take No. 4a, Youth Work Bill, 1997 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages &mdash; and No. 28, Statements on the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 41a shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister of State at the Department of Education.  The following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 28: the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>I am sure you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Taoiseach, the leader of a centre left Government, will join with me in sending traditional May Day greetings to the workers and trade unionists of this country.  My party and I have the honour of having given workers the May Day bank holiday.  I am sure that in the true terms of James Connolly you will be proud to send those greetings to workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much.  May <Col N="1138" /> Day is an important holiday.  It is also an important religious feast.  It is a day that celebrates the work people have done to make a better life for themselves.  We should convey to all who work in whatever capacity, by hand or head, our good wishes.</P>

      <P>It is, indeed, lá Bealtaine, a great pagan feast day in Irish history.  I am unclear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Living under the shadow of Newgrange, occasionally the Taoiseach mixes up his eras.  As the niece of a famous trade unionist &mdash; as the Tánaiste will be aware &mdash; may I also send greetings to the workers of Ireland today? Also may I send greetings to the vast ranks of the unemployed, many of whom live in my constituency, and sound a note of hope in the day that is in it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach arrange for the Minister for Finance to take the opportunity at Question Time, in reply to questions tabled by Deputy McCreevy, to state clearly and unambiguously the Government's exchange rate policy?  It is not good enough to say it is a matter for the Central Bank.  The Government sets exchange rate policy and the Central Bank administers it on a day to day basis.  Obviously statements have been made.  The Minister for Finance says he has been misinterpreted but he should not allow the day go by without clearly stating the exchange rate policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The exchange rate policy is governed by our membership of the European exchange rate mechanism.  That is the guiding principle for our exchange rate policy.  Obviously the Minister for Finance will be happy to deal with that matter at Question Time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Order, please.  There are questions tabled on the subject for answer by the Minister for Finance today.  The Chair is concerned to ensure that Members who went to the trouble of tabling Priority Questions in the matter shall not be upstaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the turmoil in the currency market, can the Taoiseach rule out an increase in mortgage increase rates?  Is he concerned about the upward pressure on inflation arising out of the weakness of the punt?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you give the Taoiseach an opportunity to comment?  It is a very serious issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the matter of the proliferation of alcohol pop drinks with the Taoiseach some time ago.  He seemed to agree with my concerns. I said this issue required legislation or new regulations from the Government.  He will be aware there has been a sinister development over the past few days with the sale of alcoholic milk drinks which are clearly aimed at teenagers.  It is an unacceptable breach of trust by the drinks industry.  Will he consider introducing legislation or regulations to deal with preventing the sale of these drinks before it becomes a serious problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have dealt with the matter in a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an urgent matter and that is why I raise it.  I have no other way of raising it with the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many other more appropriate ways of dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want a response from the Taoiseach. He responded when I raised this on a previous occasion and this is a new development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be drawn into a discussion of such an area without more detailed study of it.  Alcohol is sold in many forms and it is important that people should know what they are buying.  The matter could be dealt with under the consumer information legislation which already allows for making orders to display certain information on products where it is considered that more prominent information ought to be given about their ingredients.  The provision of information to consumers so that they are made aware is the course to follow in this matter. The concept of a ban would raise much wider policy considerations and one would have to refer to other forms of alcohol which involve blending milk products, some of which are world famous Irish products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach make his views known to the Director of Consumer Affairs as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my views known here today.  I presume the relevant authorities will take note of them.  However, I will ensure they are communicated to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the healthy economic reports and the fact that the Celtic Tiger is rambling <Col N="1140" /> over the country, will the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare get together and put some of the poorer people back on the Celtic Tiger and restore the butter vouchers which they have taken from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Deputy tables a question on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a shame.  The Taoiseach has an opportunity to introduce legislation to restore butter vouchers to those people.  Why is he running away from it?  The contrast must be embarrassing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's comments trivialise the problem of poverty.  The Government has published a comprehensive national anti-poverty strategy which will involve the activity of every Government Department in dealing in a systematic way with targeted reductions in long-term unemployment and poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined in great detail yesterday that I will chair the Cabinet subcommittee which will discuss Government action to reduce systematically the level of poverty and social exclusion in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is taking away butter a new Labour Party policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It requires a much broader approach than that being adopted by the Deputy where he trivialises the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should put the butter back on the table.  He should start with basics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it necessary to introduce legislation to require Government Departments to do the honourable and decent thing and pay <Col N="1141" /> their bills promptly and fully?  Could the Taoiseach not issue a directive to each Department to do so?  Why is scarce Dáil time being fouled up by putting legislation of this nature through the House when it could be done by order of the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy not wait for the measure to come into the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very good advice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I questioned the Taoiseach about the hepatitis C legislation and putting the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis.  He told me on Tuesday that the heads of the Bill would be issued within 48 hours.  That deadline expires in a few hours.  Will they be published today or has the matter not been discussed, even though there have been three Cabinet meetings this week?  If they are published, will the 15 per cent compensation for aggravated damages be included?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for the Environment to invoke his powers under section 1 (1) (i) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1993, to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from giving a licence to Monsanto for genetically engineered sugar beet until there has been a full debate in the House?  Will he provide time next week for a debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be too late.  The Environmental Protection Agency is about to make a decision on this and there was no debate here. <Col N="1142" /> Will the Taoiseach give us an opportunity to have a debate as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be recognised that an independent Environmental Protection Agency was set up and we invested confidence in its capacity to make judgments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If every time a difficult decision has to be made by an independent body, there is a requirement to have a debate in the House, it would perniciously undermine the independence of bodies established by Statute by requiring them to make their decisions on the basis of political rather than environmental considerations. While I stated that if the Deputy made a request for a debate next week it will be considered, he should also reflect on the requirement of ensuring there is not ongoing parliamentary interference in the work of independent bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Act was passed and it included section 1 (1) (i) which allows for the Minister to &ldquo;interfere&rdquo; in important decisions of the Environmental Protection Agency.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>It is estimated that approximately 1,000 children per year do not make the transition from primary level to second level education. Given that there have been a number of recent court cases involving young children on the streets, when will the school attendance Bill, which will deal with young children who are not in a position to participate in the education system for a variety of reasons such as social disadvantage, be published?</P>

      <P>When I raised the issue of the non-nationals Bill about three weeks ago the Taoiseach informed me that it would not be taken this session.  As a result one of the oldest textile firms in the country will go to the wall shortly with the loss of several hundred jobs in this city because of an argument within the offices of the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;over the way the case of a non-citizen who wishes to invest in the firm in question should be dealt with.  The person concerned was included on the old list.  It is very unfair &mdash; on May Day &mdash; that several hundred workers will lose their jobs because of a lack of activity in dealing with legislation.  I am aware of the complexities involved but it is unfair that the firm in question should go to the wall as a result.</P>

      <P>It is the considered view that this matter must be dealt with on the basis of legislation.  If, in a competitive market, a company has access to resources to which a competitor does not have access, there is a risk of challenge. To ensure, therefore, the scheme is not open to challenge and to being undermined it must be placed on a statutory footing.  That is the reason legislation is being introduced and will be published before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;In this Act, youth work means a planned systematic educational process <Col N="1146" /> which assists and enhances the personal and social development of young people, is complementary to the defined school curriculum and is implemented primarily by voluntary groups and organisations.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;youth work&rdquo; is much too restrictive and my amendment is based on the definition generally agreed by those who participated in the consultative process.  The wording in my amendment underlines the importance of youth work in the non-formal education process.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, does not give due recognition to the primacy of the volunteer in youth work. Voluntary youth organisations, which are the main providers of youth work, make a significant contribution towards improving the lot of young disadvantaged people in society.  Within youth services, voluntary activity has been the catalyst and the main engine for growth.  The delivery of such services is dependent to a large extent on voluntary activity.  Statutory organisations also make a welcome contribution in this area.  I hope the Minister accepts my amendment.</P>
    <P>There are two or three omissions which I hope the Minister will address.  The Bill does not address the issue of youth information, while the issue of funding is not clearly addressed.  No boundaries seem to be set between the functions of the Department in funding youth organisations at national level and the extent to which the education boards will fund the activities of youth organisations which are organised on a national basis.  It should have been possible to clearly indicate that educational infrastructure, for example, school buildings, halls and recreational facilities, should be made available and be accessible, within reason, to organisations which provide this very valuable service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general scheme and heads of the Bill approved by the Government on 2 July last year and subsequently submitted to the office of the parliamentary draftsman included a definition of youth work as a planned systematic educational process which assists and enhances the personal and social development of young people, which entails the participation of young people on a voluntary basis, is complementary to the formal education and training system and is implemented primarily by voluntary groups and organisations.  The definition of &ldquo;youth work&rdquo; in the general scheme of the Bill was based on the definition produced by the consultative group on the development of youth work which reported to the former Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs, Deputy Liam Alyward, in November 1993.  One of the tasks set for the consultative group was to devise a definition of youth work which was more precise than any of the definitions in previous policy reports.  This task was decided upon to promote good youth work practice and to facilitate interlinking with other forms of work with young people.  Above all, the intention was to devise a <Col N="1147" /> definition which reflected the objectively recognisable value of youth work as an out-of-school programme of education activity aimed at the personal and social development of young people.  The definition in paragraph 3.1 on page 12 of the consultative group report forms the basis of the general scheme definition.  The consultative group definition was changed by the addition of the phrase &ldquo;entails the voluntary participation of young people on a voluntary basis&rdquo;. This is generally accepted as a crucial defining characteristic of youth work.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the general scheme definition, and in consultation with the Department of Education and his office, the parliamentary draftsman produced the following definition phrase in appropriate legal language:</P>
      <P>In this Act, &ldquo;youth work&rdquo; means a programme of activity that is designed for the purpose of providing developmental and educational training so as to assist the personal and social development of young persons which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  requires the voluntary participation of young persons, and</P>
      <P>(b)  is complementary to academic or vocational training, and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.</P>
      <P>The main change between the two definitions is that the phrase &ldquo;and is implemented primarily by voluntary groups and organisations&rdquo; has been deleted as it is not an absolutely defining characteristic of youth work, that is, it is possible even in the context of the situation envisaged under the Youth Work Bill for non-voluntary organisations to provide youth work programmes and services in certain, admittedly, exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>Since it is not a defining characteristic, it was decided that the phrase in question should be omitted from the definition.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the definition of youth work in the Bill is preferable to the one suggested by Deputy Smith.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The Minister, while promoting the integration of socially and economically disadvantaged young people in youth work programmes and youth work services, shall endeavour to ensure that particular attention is paid&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I are at one on the need to ensure specific resources are targeted at disadvantaged young people.  Targeting resources is not confined only to the disbursement of funds but also includes programmes and specialist services to help young people.  It is essential that a proper balance is struck in prioritising services for the disadvantaged and youth work so that they are inclusive.  I hope we do not create two tiers in the area of youth work, with specific youth work for the disadvantaged and a different type of youth work for those who are more advantaged. This work must be as inclusive as possible, while at the same time targeting specialist services at those most in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 3 meets the kernel of the underlying concern in Deputy Smith's amendment.  I have taken on board in my amendment the concern expressed during my recent consultation with the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The council was concerned that the existing wording might be interpreted by some or all education boards as meaning that the needs of disadvantaged young people are dealt with prior to all others.  In the interests of consensus, I have accepted the council's proposal that the word &ldquo;priority&rdquo; should not be used.  The replacement phrase which specifies that &ldquo;particular regard is had&rdquo; to the youth work requirements of disadvantaged young people aged between ten and 21 is satisfactory in terms of achieving the essential aim of the original wording.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith's proposal to include the phrase &ldquo;... the integration of socially and economically disadvantaged young people in youth work programmes and services...&rdquo;, is not necessary and might be seen as negating the need for special provision for disadvantaged young people in certain circumstances.  Deputy Smith can rest assured, however, that the appropriate integration of disadvantaged young people will inform the Department's ongoing performance of its youth work functions.</P>

      <P>I have proposed my own amendment in section 11 which goes a long way towards meeting the objective of Deputy Smith's amendment. I decided on my amendment following recent consultation with the National Youth Council of Ireland which asked that the Department's commitment to partnership be explicitly stated in section 11 which deals with membership of the national youth work advisory committee.  I indicated in the explanatory memorandum on the Youth Work Bill my basic commitment to equality between the representatives of the prescribed body representing voluntary youth work organisations on the advisory committee and the representatives of other Departments and agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On consideration of the views expressed, I have included provisions for this equality in section 11. However, I wish to retain the right of the Minister to appoint an additional person to act as chairperson and at least one, and not more than three, direct ministerial nominees who would be experts with special knowledge of or experience in youth work.  In other words, these appointees cannot be taken into account for the purpose of the 50/50 representation of the voluntary and statutory sectors. <Col N="1151" /> I assure the House it is not the Government's intention to use this last provision to permit the appointment of representatives of youth work organisations which choose to opt out of membership of the single prescribed body representing voluntary youth work organisations.</P>
    <P>I have included a provision, by amendment of section 11, for the nomination by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a representative on the advisory committee.  This has been done on the recommendation of the National Youth Council of Ireland and in recognition of the increasing European and wider international dimension to youth work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned, as are most of the youth organisations, about the exclusion of employees of prescribed national voluntary youth <Col N="1152" /> organisations from membership of voluntary youth councils.  That provision is unfair and will not be helpful to the development of the youth service.  People with such expertise are needed on those councils.  I have the utmost respect for voluntary youth workers but on occasion they may not have the requisite knowledge or expertise necessary in respect of the deliberations of the proposed youth councils.  I appeal to the Minister of State to reconsider this matter.  On my reading of the Bill, the exclusion of staff of the voluntary youth organisations would also exclude such people from participating in the youth work committees. If that was the case those committees would be deprived of the value of the professional youth work input.  I hope it will be possible for the Minister to accept my amendment because being exclusive is not good from a legislative point of view.  People should not be barred from membership of either the councils or the work committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Smith's amendment proposing that employees of youth work organisations should be eligible for election to the voluntary youth councils.  From a very early stage in our work on the Youth Work Bill we envisaged that paid employees of youth work organisations would not be members of the voluntary youth councils.  We decided early on that voluntary youth councils would be composed of volunteer youth leaders.  Subsection (2) of section 15 of the Youth Work Bill clearly and unambiguously states that membership of voluntary youth councils is limited to volunteer youth leaders.</P>
      <P>Our reasoning for limiting membership of voluntary youth councils to volunteer youth leaders is derived from a number of key objectives that have informed our work on this legislation.  One of those objectives is that we want to introduce a structure which will truly empower local communities, permitting them to play a key role in the development of appropriate responses to the youth work needs of young people.  Another key objective is that we are anxious to afford youth work groups at local level a significant input to the formulation and implementation of youth work policy at local and regional level.</P>
      <P>We are also motivated by an awareness that it is through the work of volunteers that the bulk of youth work opportunities are provided in communities throughout the country and that volunteerism is something quite special to the Irish youth service which needs to be fostered in every way possible.  Accordingly, we strongly believe that voluntary youth councils composed of volunteer youth leaders elected in the way described in the Bill will meet our key objectives which I have just described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voluntary youth councils will also be the vehicle for the representation of the voluntary youth work sector on the education board youth work committees. In fact, one of the crucial functions of the councils will be to nominate persons for appointment to the youth work committee of the relevant education <Col N="1153" /> board.  It will be possible for voluntary youth councils to nominate whomsoever they wish for appointment to the education board youth work committees, including, as requested by the National Youth Council of Ireland, the National Youth Federation, Foróige and others, employees of youth work organisations.</P>

      <P>With regard to the composition of the youth work committees, my reading of the Minister's amendment to section 14, specifically, lines 23 and 24, on page 14 of the Bill, is that only members of the voluntary youth councils could be appointed to the youth work committees. What the Minister said in his last contribution would seem to be the opposite to my reading of his proposed amendment to section 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment to section 14 was withdrawn.  I decided to withdraw the Government amendments to sections 14 (2) (b) and 18 (2) (c) circulated on 29 April 1997.  I arrived at that decision following discussions during the last few days with the National Youth Council of Ireland and the National Youth Federation and in the light of discussions I had with Foróige leaders at its conference last weekend.</P>
      <P>The first of the two amendments withdrawn entailed changing section 14 (2) (b) of the Youth Work Bill, 1997, to: &ldquo;nominate persons who are members of that Voluntary Youth Council for appointment to a youth work committees&rdquo;.  The second of the two amendments withdrawn entailed changing section 18 (2) (c) of the Youth Work Bill to: &ldquo;persons nominated in accordance with paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section 14 by such voluntary youth council or voluntary youth councils as may be prescribed in relation to that education board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The voluntary youth councils will be the representative fora for the voluntary youth work organisations operating within the functional area of the councils.  One of the crucial functions of the councils will be to nominate persons for appointment to the youth work committee of the relevant education board.  One of the fundamental objectives of the Youth Work Bill is to empower the volunteer youth leaders in communities up and down the country who form the bedrock of our youth service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of withdrawing those amendments is that it will be possible for voluntary youth councils to nominate whoever they wish for appointment to the education board youth work committees, <Col N="1154" /> including, as requested by the National Youth Council of Ireland, the National Youth Federation, Foróige and others, employees of youth work organisations.</P>
    <P>I stress, however, that I decided to withdraw those amendments without prejudice to my fundamental belief that people who are members of a voluntary youth council are normally in the best position to represent the views and interests of that council and without prejudice to my commitment to the empowerment of the volunteer youth leaders in local communities who give the Irish youth service its unique character and who provide the bulk of youth work opportunities.  Nevertheless, having carefully considered the well argued representations made by the National Youth Council of Ireland in particular, I accept that there may be special circumstances in which a voluntary youth council may wish to be represented on the relevant education board youth work committee by employees of youth work organisations rather than, or as well as, members of the council itself.  Accordingly, I withdrew the amendments of sections 14 (2) (b) and 18 (2) (c).</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to withdraw that proposed amendment.  When I studied the Bill it was on the basis of the amendment circulated on Tuesday night.  I welcome the fact that if voluntary youth councils decide to nominate people who are full-time employees of voluntary organisations, they would not be excluded from membership of the work committee. It is very important that if a council decides to nominate such a person they should not be debarred from membership.  I welcome the Minister's change of mind in that respect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" />&ldquo;(3) A general register of youth work organisations will be compiled by the Department of Education.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if a regulation rather than legislation is required to establish a register of youth work organisations.  Those organisations do tremendous work on a voluntary basis for young people but safeguards must be built into the system for participants in youth activities and for those involved in the organisations.  We do not want unsuitable people getting involved in youth work.  Safeguards must be provided to guard against unsuitable individuals getting involved in youth services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not necessary. Subsection (2) (b) provides for a system for prescribing national youth work organisations which is tantamount to establishing a register of recognised national voluntary youth work organisations. In this context, my officials have recently embarked on a process of consultation with the National Youth Council of Ireland in regard to the criteria for use in prescribing national voluntary youth work organisations.  This most recent initiative will assist in the process of establishing a proper mechanism for legal recognition of national and voluntary youth work organisations. I am satisfied the amendment proposed is unnecessary.  However, I agree with Deputy Smith that there is a need to put in place safeguards to ensure only suitable people get involved in youth work.  National organisations and their constituent bodies are already dealing with this matter.  My Department has dealt with the question of a code of practice for dealing with young people in sport and recreation.  Youth organisations, which apply high standards, are conscious of the need for safeguards.  I am confident the ongoing consultations will result in decisions that will meet Deputy Smith's requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to see this important Bill on youth work pass through the House.  It has had a long incubation period, dating back to the 1984 Costello Report.  I thank everybody involved in the long consultation process.  During the past two and a half years I met the national organisations and many of their constituent bodies.  Everybody involved adopted a positive approach based on partnership to deal with the major issues facing young people today.</P>
      <P>In recent times there has been an increasing realisation that youth services, along with sport and recreation activities, are the best preventative measure in the fight against crime and drugs and the other negative attractions to young people. Investment in youth services and sport and recreation reduces the need for even greater investment in many other services that would have to be funded to deal with problems.  The message has got across to people that investment in these services will bear fruit.  Much of the work done by the ministerial task force on drugs reflects what is happening in youth services.  A large part of future action programmes will involve youth work services and sport and recreation.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for his constructive approach and for facilitating its speedy passage through the House.  I hope it will be passed as soon as possible so that the service can be placed on a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the legislation and the officials who have worked on this process for some time.  Previous holders of the Minister's office were involved in initiating this legislation which is necessary to put youth services on a statutory footing.</P>
      <P>The Minister correctly referred to the constructive role played by so many youth and sporting organisations.  I compliment the officials of those organisations, in particular the volunteers who give a great deal of time and effort to provide facilities for young people, but their work is often unsung.  There are active youth and sporting organisations in every rural and urban parish. Financial resources should always have been provided for such facilities because of the nature of such investment and the need to provide proper recreation outlets for the energies of our young people.  I was disappointed on coming into the House this morning to hear a large number of amendments I tabled were ruled out of order on the basis that they involved a potential charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to address the concern of many organisations about the need to establish some type of arbitration or appeals procedure on the decision-making of the proposed <Col N="1157" /> education boards, particularly on tendering for the provision and delivery of youth services, for the possible withdrawal or reduction of funding and also for cases where a board may decide proposals submitted by the voluntary organisations are not adequate and it may decide to provide such services.  The Minister and his Department should consider establishing an appeals procedure or arbitration mechanism to assure voluntary organisations that statutory bodies will not be judge and jury in their own case where they may be tendering for such work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the passing of this Bill.  I compliment those in the Department of Education, in political life and in the voluntary youth organisations who were involved in initiating and progressing this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to briefly respond to the points made by Deputy Smith.  We have no control over the disqualification of his amendments. Regarding arbitration, I would be concerned about bringing too many layers of bureaucracy into the process.  We opposed that measure because we thought it would add to the cost of the administration rather than focusing resources on areas where they are needed most, at the coalface of activities.</P>
      <P>I am conscious the roles of the volunteer and voluntary organisations are paramount and everything that will be done will be to protect their roles.  I thank the officials in my Department for their detailed work down through the years and the long process of consultation in which they engaged.  Without them this Bill would not be at the stage it is now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities will be the cornerstone of future Government policy in the area of disability.  Never again will any policy-maker believe it is possible to see disability as a problem that can be dealt with by kindness or charity. Never again will any policy-maker be able to see disability as a medical problem to be dealt with in hospitals and institutions.  Never again will any policy-maker be able to treat disability as a minority issue or as a nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission was required, among its tasks, to examine the current situation of people with a disability and the organisation and adequacy of existing services, both public and voluntary, to meet their needs; to advise the Government on practical measures necessary to ensure people with a disability can exercise their rights to participate, to the fullest extent of their potential, in economic, social and cultural life; and to make recommendations setting out necessary changes in legislation, policies, organisation, practices and <Col N="1158" /> structures to ensure the needs of people with disabilities are met in a cohesive, comprehensive and cost effective way.</P>
    <P>The report deals comprehensively with the position of people with disabilities in Irish society.  It examines a wide range of issues which impact on their lives and makes a total of 402 recommendations aimed at improving the position of people with disabilities, their families and carers in society.</P>
    <P>The report is in essence an equality strategy which will, if implemented, set about removing the barriers which stand in the way of people with disabilities who want to live full and fulfilled lives. This equality strategy involves legislative solutions, proposals for new policy initiatives and new structures for the delivery of quality services within a framework of rights, not of charity.  The report has developed a model of service which places the user of the service at the centre of the process of service delivery, from the planning stage right through to implementation.</P>
    <P>The report has a number of great strengths. First, it represents and brings into sharp focus the views of people with disabilities.  In the past there had been reports about disability, but the real experts &mdash; people with disabilities, their families and carers &mdash; had not been consulted or involved. When I established the commission, I decided a clear majority of its members should be people with disabilities or their families.  Therefore, it was predominantly drawn from people with direct experience of the way in which disability can impact on a life or on a family.</P>
    <P>One of the first decisions the commission made was to engage in an extensive consultative process with people with disabilities, their families and carers.  A key part of this process was in the 30 listening meetings held throughout the country, where the views of people with disabilities, their parents and carers and other interested parties were carefully recorded.  An invitation to present submissions constituted a second element of the consultative process.  In response some 600 written submissions were received.  The consultations produced an outpouring of anger, not, let me hasten to add, at the commission but at a society that excludes people with disabilities from almost every aspect of economic, social, political and cultural life.  People with disabilities told how they are frustrated, marginalised and denied much of the access and opportunity that people without disabilities take for granted.  They suffer from fragmented services, exclusion from planning, lack of basic information and above all, from misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>The commission brought together its submissions in two volumes.  One volume outlines the main concerns expressed about policy and service delivery; the second volume documents the life experiences of people with disabilities, their parents and carers who chose to tell their stories to the commission in the hope of securing change. Those two documents constitute a very powerful account of the changes required in society if <Col N="1159" /> people with disabilities are to move in from the margins.</P>
    <P>A second great strength of the report lies in the decision made by the commission members at a very early stage, where effectively they decided that if people with a disability are equal citizens of Ireland, then they are equal with each other too.  It would have been very easy for the commission to approach its work on a factionalised basis, with members lobbying for the disability they knew best.  Instead, they have learned and worked together, ensuring that parity of esteem across the range of disabilities is one of the key features of the report.  The third great strength of the report lies in the united and totally coherent approach of its members.  Many of the 402 recommendations are radical and far-reaching, many of them call for a fundamental shake-up of important institutions, some of them are controversial, but there is no dissenting voice, no minority report.  The civil servants, the Departments of State, the agencies, service providers and people with disabilities all speak with one voice here.</P>
    <P>These three great strengths make this report unique and historic.  It means that for the first time, people with a disability are speaking with one loud, clear and insistent voice which is saying that the bottom line is that disability is, fundamentally and above all, an issue of rights.  People with a disability have a right, an entitlement, to live full and independent lives to the maximum of their own individual potential.  After all, that is no more and no less than the basic right any citizen would rightfully demand.</P>
    <P>The clear difference between this and previous reports is in the insight that disability is a social issue, not a medical one.  People with a disability are not sick or unhealthy.  If a building refuses to admit a person in a wheelchair, that is the fault of the building, not of the person.  If a person who is blind cannot pursue a third level course in literature, that is the fault of the system, not of the person.</P>
    <P>Until we come to a full realisation of the social nature of disability, we will continue to treat people with disabilities as people who have a medical problem.  They do not, however.  Where disability is concerned, the right to a full and independent life is constantly interfered with by barriers society creates: barriers of ignorance and prejudice; barriers of cost; barriers of structure and inadequate service delivery.</P>
    <P>The challenge this report puts in front of us all is to begin the task of tearing down those barriers. The report tells us that the time has come, if it is not long overdue, to move to a view of disability that is based on rights, not charity.</P>
    <P>The commission's report deals comprehensively with the issues facing people with disabilities. One of the single largest areas of concern raised with the commission was the question of access and transport.  The report states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> Clearly the built environment and most forms of transport are inaccessible for people with disabilities... these problems are not just mechanical ones but ones that have several important consequences.  They mean that people are denied full access to education, employment and training, to cultural and leisure events.</P>
    <P>The commission also found another major failing to be the lack of information available to people with disabilities and their carers, and the difficulty in obtaining access to entitlements and services. The absence of easily accessible information is clearly a major factor in the isolation and marginalisation experienced by so very many people with disabilities, and their families and carers.</P>
    <P>The report found serious concern among the submissions regarding education.  A failure to provide comprehensive education for people with disabilities results in their being denied access to employment and training opportunities comparable to those available to people without disabilities. Other areas which attracted a large number of comments in the submissions included employment and training, income support, health and personal support.</P>
    <P>Another theme to emerge from the consultations was that of marginalisation.  This word took on a stark reality from the hundreds of pages sent to the commission from people with disabilities and their families.  Many people with disabilities felt they were being either kept at, or pushed to, the margins of society and were not being allowed to realise their potential or to participate as fully as they are entitled to in every day life.</P>
    <P>The report also found that disability can have major implications, not only for individuals who are directly affected but also for those in the role of informal carers.  The commission received 100 submissions from family members of people with disabilities.  This material was full of strong feelings and emotions, and underlined the point that caring for people with disabilities can be an ongoing physical, mental and emotional strain accompanied by a terrible sense of isolation.</P>
    <P>The issues I have mentioned already form the basis for the main elements of the recommendations put forward by the commission.  These include:</P>
    <P>(i)  The introduction of further disabilities legislation to promote equality for people with disabilities in relation to services provided by public bodies, services provided by private bodies, employment and education.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The establishment of a National Disability Authority to monitor policy, standards and the implementation of the Commission's recommendations.  The Commission holds the view that in order to achieve the primary aim of ensuring equality for all citizens, it is necessary to create an executive body to monitor the impact of public policy and services on people with a disability.  Such a body should not only <Col N="1161" /> be in a position to monitor the system at local level but should have the power to intervene in particular cases in order to ensure equity.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The establishment of a Disability Support Service.  The Commission found existing supports and services for people with disabilities to be poorly co-ordinated and people had great difficulty in obtaining information on entitlements and accessing these from the multiplicity of agencies involved.  The Disability Support Service is the focal point of collection and distribution of information.  The report envisages establishing a national network of disability resource centres which would be a single point of contact for information, advice, support and advocacy.  Support co-ordinators would be trained to guide individuals or their families through the range of services they might need at different stages of their life.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The centring of responsibility for policy development in one Government Department. To change the lives of people with disabilities for the better requires a concerted and organised response from the whole administrative machinery of this State.  The report recommends that the Department of Equality and Law Reform be given prime responsibility for the development, monitoring and implementation of policy for people with disabilities, and be given the necessary resources for its task.  To do this to the maximum effect, the Commission recommended that a disability equality unit be established within my Department.</P>
    <P>(v)  The recognition that people with a disability have a right to income support and such support must recognise that it is expensive, in many cases, to have a disability.  The report states research carried out by the ESRI shows that households headed by people who are unable to work due to illness or disability are one of the groups in society most likely to live in poverty and to experience basic deprivation. It calls for a payment to compensate for loss of income due to an incapacity for full time work &mdash; a disability pension &mdash; and for a graduated payment to meet the additional everyday cost associated with disability.</P>
    <P>(vi)  The report recommends that the universal right of access for all citizens becomes the overarching principle which guides all relevant legislation, policy and practice in Ireland.  It is my view that a completely new approach to the whole issue of access is required in relation to buildings, accommodation, streets, shops, offices, beaches, playgrounds, cinemas and theatres, pubs and sports venues &mdash; in other words, all the places we lead our lives.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the decision to publish the Commission's report, I secured Government approval for the establishment of an interdepartmental task force, chaired by my Department, to draw up a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities based on the report.  This task force <Col N="1162" /> has been operating since January of this year and is due to complete the plan of action around the middle of the year.  The task force is also considering, in conjunction with the Commission's report, the report of the Review Group on Health and Social Services for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Government also authorised the establishment of a monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of the Commission's recommendations.  I launched the monitoring committee, chaired by my Department, on 18 April.  It comprises some former members of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, representatives of social partners, a nominee from the National Rehabilitation Board, the South-Eastern Health Board, the Disability Federation of Ireland, Departments and the newly established Irish Council of People with Disabilities.  I considered it essential to establish this committee at an early stage.  It would also be appropriate for it to provide advice and support to the interdepartmental task force.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations in the Commission's report is the proposal to establish a permanent Council for the Status of People with Disabilities. In March, the interim council, now known as the Irish Council of People with Disabilities, was launched.  There is a need for a permanent independent voice to constantly highlight issues of concern and to ensure that the rights of people with disabilities are never off the agenda.</P>
    <P>I was anxious that the council should be established on the firmest footing.  That is why, in addition to the £100,000 provided for it in the 1997 Estimates for my Department, I secured agreement from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to provide a further £200,000 for the council in this year's budget.  I have no doubt this sum will ensure the council is set up on a proper professional basis, which is important given the work it has to do.</P>
    <P>Another initiative I have taken which promotes equal opportunities for people with disabilities is the establishment of pilot community projects.  I have referred already to the listening exercises carried out by the Commission where one of the major problems identified was that of access to information.  People expressed frustration about the availability of information.  There was a distinct lack of information in appropriate formats and the absence of a single local centre where information needs could be satisfied with the minimum of hardship.</P>
    <P>To address these problems, I have decided to set up a number of pilot community development projects aimed at people with disabilities.  These projects are being undertaken in Counties Clare and Cork and in Tallaght and Clondalkin.  My Department is making funding available for the recruitment of project workers and to meet associated costs.  What I would like to see achieved is access at local level by people with disabilities to all information in appropriate formats on issues affecting their lives.  I would also <Col N="1163" /> like to see if a way can be found to facilitate the active participation by people with disabilities in local area partnerships and other community fora, thus empowering them to influence the decision-making process and to play an active part in their communities.</P>
    <P>During the recent Irish Presidency of the EU, I sought to ensure that agreement was reached on a detailed resolution by the European Union of the question of equal opportunities and elimination of discrimination for people with disabilities. It is a source of pride that such a resolution was passed last December.</P>
    <P>On the domestic scene, the Equal Status Bill passed all Stages this week.  This legislation will provide, for the first time, protection against discrimination outside the field of employment.  It deals with discrimination on grounds of disability, among other categories.  It is based on the principle that everyone has an equal right to participate in our society.  People should not be denied access to services, facilities, or amenities just because of disability.  Each person should be treated on his own merits and not on the basis of prejudice or stereotype.  The Employment Equality Bill, currently before the Supreme Court, seeks to provide protection from discrimination in the workplace for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>We seek to change forever the negative perception of disability which has existed in the past in certain strata of Irish society.  We have made significant progress in this area already.  We have made more progress than at any previous time in the history of the State.  I am determined to see this work continued to bring about a situation where society will recognise, as a matter of course, that disability issues are issues of mainstream political, social and economic rights.  The Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities marks the first step towards the realisation of that aim.</P>

      <P>In the course of their work, all Deputies come across examples of the barriers facing people with disabilities.  The lack of appropriate day and residential care places, the inaccessibility of transport, housing and public buildings and the absence of educational choice are among the many issues about which people approach us.  These contribute to the fact that people with disabilities from one of our most marginalised and excluded groups.  The failure of public policy to properly address the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities and their families should concern us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the range of areas involved, it is clear that a piecemeal approach to tackling disability does not and cannot work.  Only a fully comprehensive agenda, touching all aspects of public life, can realistically hope to vindicate the rights of people with disabilities.  Because we recognised this basic fact, Fianna Fáil supported <Col N="1164" /> the establishment of the Commission when in Government.</P>
    <P>When the Commission published its report last November, we welcomed its work and recommendations. Through an active programme of consultations, the use of expert advice and the commitment of its members, the Commission's report represents a strategy for equality.  The welcome it has received from groups representing all those concerned about disability is a testament to its success.  We stand together with all other parties in the Dáil in congratulating the Commission on its work.</P>
    <P>One of the most important points made by the Commission was the need for urgent action. However, it is six months since the report was officially published and today is the first opportunity we have had to discuss its recommendations and to make a contribution to directing its implementation.  We first asked for a full debate before Christmas.  Eventually one was agreed for March, but it was cancelled, rescheduled, cancelled and finally set for today.  The short time allocated for this debate was only granted because of continuous pressure from the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip and the anger expressed by many disability organisations at the idea that this report would be left undebated before the election.</P>
    <P>Instead of the nine or ten hours which are normally allocated to debates on important reports, we have less than half this time to discuss the 402 recommendations contained in one of the most important documents on social policy to come before us in many years.  I suggest that the treatment which the report has received in this respect is part of an overall problem where the issuing of press releases seems more important than the substance of concrete action.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to us we should concentrate on critically engaging the major issues with which the commission has dealt.  We must recognise its radical agenda.  After six months, we must forget about the recitation of lists of small-scale initiatives and recognise the simple fact that public policy on disability has failed in the past, is failing at present and will fail in the future unless there is a complete change in the way Government deals with disability issues.  The reality of change must match the rhetoric of change.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years, as my party's spokesperson on disability issues, I have dealt with issues of concern to every Department.  This work has been directed by an ongoing dialogue with people with disabilities, carers, families and advocates. Since the publication of the commission's report, I have received many approaches concerning its recommendations and their treatment by Government.  I would like to comment on all of the issues of concern to them, but I shall concentrate my remarks on a few specific areas and discuss how their treatment in official policy demonstrates the need for change.  Crucially, I also suggest that the very structure of decision-making <Col N="1165" /> on disability issues must also be changed if the commission's objectives are to be realised.</P>
    <P>Education is probably the area about which I am most often approached by disability organisations. They rightly see education as central to defining the opportunities available to people with disabilities and establishing their position in society.  It is through education that our views of ourselves, our community and the wider world are formed and, in terms of disability, it is through education that we can be socialised in exclusion or inclusion.  It is unfortunately the case that our education system has promoted exclusion and taught us to focus on difference and maintain an ignorance of each other's needs and aspirations.  The challenge of radically altering the way in which we provide education opportunities for people with disabilities is the most important part of providing for the future of young people with disabilities in Ireland.  The key must be educational choice, where parents are able to find a place for the specific needs of their child.  Ranging from fully integrated mainstream schooling to properly resourced special schools, educational choice will help children with disabilities to develop their full potential.  The existing proposals for designated schools run the risk of merely creating another tier of slightly less segregated schooling and undermining the concept that every school has the responsibility to cater for children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Many parents' groups have approached me about their concerns with these proposals. Designating schools will not provide the integrated setting which so many parents want for their child.  It may actually stigmatise these schools in the eyes of the wider community so that other parents will send their children elsewhere. If designated schools continue to be the primary focus of the Department, it is clear that there will be no effort to make inclusion a reality.</P>
    <P>This was recognised by the commission in its recommendation that there should be no further development in this area until there has been extensive research allied to an inclusive dialogue with parents.  It is unfortunately the case that the Minister has, in reply to questions tabled by me, refused to commit herself to following this recommendation and has even declined to give specific details of her plans for designated schools.  This attitude fits into a wider problem with the Department of Education, where it does not seem to be constructively engaging the concerns of the Commission.  For example, the Department was not represented at the first meeting of the implementation task force.  Action on even a simple recommendation, such as the appointment of support co-ordinators in third level institutions, will not be implemented until late 1998 at the earliest because of a refusal to deal with it now rather than waiting for the implementation report.  A longer-term concern is the continued refusal of the Minister to address the recommendation of the SERC committee to re-establish the committee to direct deaf education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> The behaviour of the Department of Education during the O'Donoghue case is important in illustrating the need for reform.  Even after the High Court had established the right of Paul O'Donoghue to an appropriate education, it was decided at the highest level to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.  The uncertainty and pressure which this imposed on the O'Donoghue family was completely unacceptable.  This happened after the commission had reported.  Over £0.25 million was spent by the Government in pursuing this case, money which could have been used to commence implementing some of the commission's many recommendations on education.</P>
    <P>There is a sense that what matter is a centrally determined policy, where the agenda is not set by constructive dialogue.  If there is to be real action on this area, inclusion must be given real, rather than token, priority.  I would suggest that the millions of pounds which are currently earmarked for the establishment of a new regional education bureaucracy would be better spent on implementing the commission's many valuable recommendations on education.</P>
    <P>The need to reform and expand health services for people with disabilities should be obvious to everybody.  There must be a move towards transparent and inclusive procedures which deliver accessible and appropriate health services throughout the country.  The commission pointed to many of the necessary reforms and it has specifically supported the implementation without delay of the report of the Review Group on Physical and Sensory Disability Services.  The review group's report has been referred to the same committee to which the report of the Commission was referred and I want to make some comments on it.</P>
    <P>I have received many representations from organisations concerning the treatment of the review group's report.  The review group was established five years ago and had substantially completed its work by late 1994.  For some reason, the group held no further discussions for over a year until I raised the matter in this House.  Subsequently, a continuous series of delays was put in the way of the group's completion of its report. It was suggested to me at that time that few administrative resources were available to the group because the Department was eager to put off having to make any funding commitments. Following a number of Adjournment debates on the matter, the report was finally published a few days before last Christmas.</P>
    <P>The specific recommendations of the report concerning immediate needs for the next 12 months have already been ignored and the small funding which has been made available was provided only in light of the anger expressed after the budget announcements in January.  One organisation wrote to me saying: &ldquo;We are not only disappointed but deeply frustrated by the failure of the Minister for Health to make any meaningful comment regarding the implementation of the report or, for that matter, to make <Col N="1167" /> himself available to organisations and people with disability to discuss his plans for the future of services for people with disability.&rdquo;  Another major national organisation wrote to me last week saying: &ldquo;Our organisation, like many others, is concerned and angered by the fact that no provision was made in the budget for the implementation of the report's recommendations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies who met with the many demonstrators outside Leinster House yesterday will be aware of the scale of anger which exists about the ignoring of this report.  This is a textbook example of the type of approach from which we need to move away if there is to be any radical action on tackling major disability issues.</P>
    <P>The inflexibility of many health schemes and the way they promote dependency can be seen in the Department's attitude to supports such as the long-term illness scheme.  This non-means tested support is not available to people with spinal injuries even though their impairment is exactly the same as another group which does qualify. This means that many are simply not able to risk taking up employment because of the loss of their health benefits.  It is obvious that a more generous attitude to this group would both promote independence and save the Exchequer money.  The conservative and closed minded attitude of the Department on qualification for the scheme must be reversed.</P>
    <P>The need to tackle the outstanding backlog in the provision of day and residential care places is obvious to everyone.  The &ldquo;on one year, off the next&rdquo; approach to this must be abandoned and a definite timetable must be put in place to end the waiting list.</P>
    <P>Respite care provision should be a vitally important part of the services available to support people with disabilities and their families.  Deputy Woods's initiative in establishing the respite care fund was a valuable beginning but little has been done to add to that initiative.  The alterations to the administration of the scheme in 1995 made it more bureaucratic and less efficient.  As the report published earlier this week shows, the absence of respite care facilities is a major contributor to the pressures faced by families with significant caring responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Support of the idea of independent living is a central part of the recommendations of the commission and the review group.  Independent living touches on most areas of policy, including housing, transport and the built environment.  The need to develop a range of personal assistance services has been accepted by both bodies and by a special expert group which examined the area. Even though considerable commitment has been shown by voluntary organisations in working to develop these services, Departments have opted out of making any constructive contribution. There is no excuse which can justify this continued inactivity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> The levels of poverty faced by people with disabilities and their families was of particular concern to the commission.  In its recommendations it made many points concerning changes that are required in income support policies.  Perhaps the most important of these is the need to move towards a non-means tested allowance based on the costs of disability.  The transfer of the principal welfare payment from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare was a welcome initiative instigated by Deputy Woods. However, it should not have taken his successor a year and a half to implement this initiative and it should not have required repeated questions from Deputy Joe Walsh and myself to prompt the Minister to hold discussions with people with disabilities on the details of the transfer.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Department of Social Welfare to send a representative to the first meeting of the implementation task force was regrettable. The Minister's recent statement during Question Time that we now have a comprehensive system of income support for people with disabilities represents the type of complacency that the commission is trying to challenge.</P>
    <P>Overall, as I pointed out, the response of individual departments to the commission's report leaves much to be desired.  There is a general air of complacency and Ministers are content to pat themselves on the back for small-scale changes and their self-perceptions are increasingly divorced from reality.  Policy continues to be directed towards improvements which are sporadic and unco-ordinated.  Rather than the radical approach which is needed, this policy continues to be essentially conservative and incremental.</P>
    <P>The very structure of the way that Government tackles disability issues lies at the root of this problem.  In the six months since the commission reported there is much to indicate that this lesson has not been learned.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has demonstrated his personal commitment to promoting the interests of people with disability.  However, it is clear that his Department is effectively sidelined and powerless when many of the most important decisions concerning disability are taken.  I cannot imagine that he had anything to do with the decision to bring the O'Donoghue case to the Supreme Court.  Similarly, I cannot believe that he was party to the last year's decision to vote against and delay my Disabled Voters' Bill in face of the support it received from disability organisations.</P>
    <P>The failure of the budget to seriously address the commission's agenda is obvious to everyone. The £500,000 allocated in respect of Equality and Law Reform for implementation represented less than 33 per cent of the funding announced on the same day for the then unpublished sports strategy. It took a number of weeks before the Department of Health was able to say where its allocation was to be spent.  It is clear that the Department was desperately trying to deal with <Col N="1169" /> the loud protests coming from disability organisations which were in shock following the budget.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a question I tabled in January the Minister confirmed that he does not hold serious discussions with his colleagues on budget decisions relating to their areas.  In effect, the Minister with principal responsibility for disability does not have a serious role in deciding funding for most areas of concern to people with disabilities.  In another reply, he confirmed that no Minister or political adviser has contributed to the work of the implementation task force.  In effect, six months after it was published, there has been no serious political consideration of an implementation agenda for the commission's report.  If there is to be radical change, decisions must be taken at a political level.  The monitoring committee, while important, does not change this basic fact.  Similarly, without this change the extremely welcome establishment of the Council for People with Disabilities will simply mean that another body will become frustrated in its efforts to achieve advances for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Both equality Bills represent important advances but they will achieve little without being accompanied by a comprehensive series of positive action measures across the full range of policy areas.  These will fall to different Departments and, without changes, Equality and Law Reform will continue to be marginalised in important budgetary discussions.  As a result, at least two significant changes are required if the implementation process is to deal quickly with the commission's recommendations.  There is a need to appoint a Minister of State with specific responsibility for co-ordinating policy development in the key Departments of Education, Social Welfare and Health.  The individual involved could also report to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  There must be an ongoing interdepartmental committee to co-ordinate policy which operates at a political level.  Only in this way will there be a realistic opportunity for disability to be placed firmly on the priority list of every Department.</P>
    <P>The commission has done its work well, and taken with the report of the review group, the problems which need to be addressed are clear and the agenda for tackling them has been established. It is time that politicians made a proper contribution to the debate.  The lessons we have learned have been uncomfortable.  The very way in which we deal with disability has helped to promote dependency and to marginalise a vulnerable group.  The lack of transparent, inclusive and appropriate services and procedures has been almost all-pervasive and has yet to be tackled in any meaningful way.</P>
    <P>We can no longer be complacent or satisfied with what continues to be a focus on incremental, small-scale improvements that ignore fundamental failures.  We must not be fooled into believing that any radical change has been completed.  The disillusionment of so many individuals and organisations gives the lie to this.  The commission's <Col N="1170" /> report challenges everyone, we should commit ourselves to breaking the mould and showing that we are serious and not only concerned with implementing occasional initiatives but with changing the very way we develop, implement and discuss disability.  Unless we do this, the commission will not have received the response which it rightly deserves.</P>
    <P>I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy de Valera.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle An Leas-Cheann Comhairle">

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wallace for sharing time and I congratulate her, as our party's spokesperson on disability, for the work she has carried out during the past two and a half years. I understand she has met all the major groups concerned which involved no less than 200 meetings in all.  She produced, on the party's behalf, a useful document which sets the agenda on how the area of disability can be addressed.  Fianna Fáil also introduced the first ever Disabled Voters' Bill which represents an acknowledgement of disabled people's rights.</P>
      <P>One of the important issues under discussion involves trying to end the process of dependency. Above all, the disabled want their independence and it is up to Governments and Government Departments to facilitate them.  To do so we must examine departmental functions to ascertain how best this objective can be permanently placed on their agendas.  The basic principles that must inform this approach is that disability is a social issue which must be dealt with by co-ordinated action across all sectors, thus ensuring an end to marginalisation of disability as a simple health issue.  Policy must promote individual empowerment by allowing each individual to achieve his or her potential and promote independence and choice.  Services should be accessible, responsive and transparent in dealing with people with disabilities, their families and organisations. The right of people requiring significant care to appropriate services must be recognised and such services provided as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>We spoke about the need for a change in attitude to the disable.  The very fact of our having this discussion on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities may well change society's view.  I hope it will and that this report will not remain dormant on some departmental shelf, as so many others have done.  I hope its very sensible, practical recommendations will be implemented in a co-operative manner by respective Departments as soon as practically possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall education of people with disabilities is another major consideration.  As a former teacher and psychologist, I see this as an extremely important facet of any strategy to deal with the issues and difficulties encountered by them.  We should work toward mainstream <Col N="1171" /> schooling which will require additional funding and commitment to provide the requisite number of resource teachers.  In my constituency, resource teachers are urgently needed in our mainstream schools as are psychological services in all our primary and secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Another issue that affects people with disabilities in my constituency is the lack of sheltered workshops.  If we are to afford the disabled their right to work, we must make workplaces accessible.</P>
    <P>There is also enormous need for residential care, particularly for disabled persons over the age of 16.  The overall matter of respite care is another which must be given urgent consideration. I can speak with authority about my own constituency only, where constituents come to see me and discuss such issues, where the Brothers of Charity continue to do a tremendous amount of work but are hampered by lack of funding.  There are many families and friends of the disabled who maintain that the type of facilities needed, particularly in sheltered workshops and residential care, are non-existent for those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>We must also facilitate independent living for the disabled.  Fianna Fáil, in Government, introduced the first ever funding for personal assistants and is committed to extending the availability of this service nationwide.  The disabled people of Clare have referred on numerous occasions to the need for such a fund.  My party certainly supports the principle of independent living.  I hope the personal assistants service can be extended and the requisite funding forthcoming to fulfil our responsibility in that respect.</P>
    <P>The matter of education in the arts and facilitation and encouragement among the disabled also needs to be addressed immediately.  I hope the Arts Council will highlight the need and ensure that a much greater proportion of its funding will be allocated to art among the disabled. One cannot over-emphasise the need for training and employment of the disabled, more than 80 per cent of whom are unemployed.  This takes me back to the need for sheltered employment and training places which should be properly funded to allow for increased pay for trainees and employees, to put such places on a sounder financial footing.  In the Fianna Fáil document on the subject, my party has already committed itself to providing additional places to meet the current shortfall.  The successful support employment scheme introduced by my party in 1994 will be extended and made permanent if we assume office in the next few weeks and employees' benefits will be protected.</P>
    <P>We hear much about the importance of the Civil Service quota <i>vis a vis</i> the disabled which I hope will be extended to public sector employers as well.  A great deal of consultation will be necessary for this purpose but it is not sufficient to adhere to the Civil Service quota within the overall public service.  That shortfall must be recognised <Col N="1172" /> and recruitment extended because current trends are unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party will also support open employment through assistance to workplace adaptations, the abolition of existing benefit traps, the extension of public education programmes and the enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation.</P>
    <P>Our spokesperson, Deputy Mary Wallace, through her work in this area, has been able to highlight the immediate needs of the disabled. The Fianna Fáil Party, in Government, will do its utmost to address these issues immediately, to afford the disabled an opportunity to lead a full life in every sense of the word and be recognised, as is their right, as full citizens.  That we are discussing their concerns today highlights the fact that every party in this House now recognises their importance, their many talents and society's concerns about them.  As a people it is our obligation to ensure that we enable and empower the disabled to enjoy the same rights as all other citizens.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I contribute to this debate with a certain reluctance.  I would much prefer to hear Members &mdash; who might happen to suffer from significant disabilities &mdash; speak of their experiences at first hand and of how they foresee the recommendations in this report helping them to achieve greater rights within society. Indeed it is a sign of how unequal is access to our political system that there are not any Members who suffer from any disability to a great extent. Were I in a wheelchair, I wonder how I would even gain access to the Chamber to contribute.  It is with a sense of respect and understanding of how easy it is to give expression to platitudes, nice words or intentions that I make my comments today.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, I appreciate the opportunity to do so because the report before us is one of the most thorough, radical and far-reaching to emanate from any group or organisation to date.  Anybody reading it must realise that any debate here, no matter how long or short, can do little justice first, to the effort put into its compilation and, second, the gravity of its recommendations.  Implementation of the recommendations will require sustained, committed and competent political support in this House and outside it.  They must be put into law so that we do not have to come back here in two or three years' time to debate them again.</P>
      <P>I thank the people who, when the commission was set up, made their views known at meetings throughout the country.  Those people put many of us in public life to shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> Before the opportunity was given for contribution by the public to this process, many of us assumed we knew something about disability.  We assumed that because we were in contact with disabled people in the course of our everyday work we were in tune with their needs.  I am sure the Minister, Department officials and many other people believed they had a commitment to disability issues, but they would be put to shame by the people who expressed frustration and anger at those meetings.  This is a better report as a result of their contributions.  It was not produced by a group of experts.  It reflects the needs and frustrations of people with disabilities and, in many cases, those of parents and carers who have suffered silently down the years.</P>
    <P>This is not a debate for party political point scoring, but this report would not have been produced if there had not been a commitment to establish the Department of Equality and Law Reform, if the Government of which Deputy Wallace's party and my party were members in the period 1992-4 had not decided that equality should be a major political issue and that there should be a Minister at the Cabinet table to ensure the needs of those with a disability were dealt with at the highest level of Government.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Taylor, who will retire from this House at the next election, for his work.  He is extremely humble in the way he goes about that work.  We would not be debating this matter today had he not had the determination to negotiate for a Department of Equality and Law Reform in 1992 and applied himself in a steady, committed way to the work of that Department. In his humility he would not wish me to elaborate further, but without his work we would not be dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>There are two basic principles behind the work of the commission.  Its approach is based on rights rather than charity.  We have a long tradition of charity, without which, for the last 150 to 200 years, many people in need would not have received attention.  However, charity sometimes blinds us to the real needs.  I compliment the commission on saying that any approach to disability issues must be based on rights, full participation and full citizenship, not only as citizens of Ireland but of Europe.  It is significant in the context of the work being done at European level that Ireland has fought strongly for inclusion in the draft Intergovernmental Conference treaty of the rights of people with a disability.  I hope at the Amsterdam meeting Ministers representing member states will ensure they are included.</P>
    <P>The other principle is the concept that the user of a service must be at the centre of its delivery. If I have a disability which curtails my ability to go outside my four walls, I should not be at the mercy of a fragmented bureaucratic system for the services and supports I need.  I must be in control and determine my own needs and the delivery of services to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>I have learnt much from the work of the various centres for independent living throughout <Col N="1174" /> the country, including the one in my home town of Tullamore.  I learnt that none of us is independent, that we all have different degrees of dependency. There is truth in the cliché that no man is an island.  We all depend on each other to a greater or lesser degree to live and work in society.  The whole concept of independent living is expanding and the Government should respond to the needs in this area.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed no financial allocation was made this year for the establishment of independent living funds.  The report states that there must be choice in the delivery of services to people.  People with disability should have the choice to direct their own services, have a personal assistant to help them and be at the centre of the service deliveries.  I urge the Government to respond by setting up independent living funds which would work in partnership with persons with disability and health boards.  I had an opportunity to learn of the way funds are worked in Britain.  They are not a panacea since there are difficult practical questions to be dealt with in terms of independent living.  To ensure the user is at the centre of the service there must be an independent living fund.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of recommendations in the report.  It is not correct, as Deputy Wallace claimed, that there has been a delay in implementing the recommendations.  There is a recommendation on legal rights.  Unless people have legal rights they are dependent on good will and charity, on the understanding and whim of others to get that to which they are entitled. Under the direction of the Minister, Deputy Taylor, great progress has been made in the area of legal rights.  I mentioned the work being done by the Government at European Union level.  I hope the commission that will review the Constitution will include rights for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Bill is very important in terms of non-discrimination in the supply of goods and services.  I look forward to cases being taken to court to test the provisions in that legislation. In many cases good will may exist, but very often unless we are forced to do something we will not do it.  The Equal Status Bill gives a strong legal basis to the prevention of discrimination. Since the Employment Equality Bill is before the courts we are limited in what we can say on that Bill.  The intention behind that legislation will be met and that will make a significant contribution in this area.  I look forward to cases being brought in that regard also.</P>
    <P>In cases such as the O'Donoghue case arguments have been made for the establishment of basic rights.  We are providing for that in the Equal Status Bill and the Employment Equality Bill.  This House will have the determination provided there is a clear political commitment to include them.  There is one question I would like to ask Deputy Wallace and the other Opposition party which is not represented here today.  Will both parties state unequivocally that, if returned <Col N="1175" /> to Government, they will continue to give a lead at Cabinet level to this work, by ensuring the Department of Equality and Law Reform continues with a full Minister of Cabinet to fight for the implementation of this report in the years ahead?</P>
    <P>I agree with everything that has been said on the need for monitoring and implementation. That is a dry subject which I will leave to others. There is no point in providing for it if it is not implemented, hence the need for the continuance of the Department.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority involved in public life in my own area, I wish to refer to a few other practical aspects.  The first concerns access.  We all have a responsibility to ensure access is given the highest priority in buildings, streets and public facilities in our own areas. Recently, as a member of Tullamore Urban Council, I participated in the drafting of the development plan.  As councillors we had to fight hard to ensure provision was made for access to new buildings and new developments.  Even at that stage, one is only half way on that road.  Even if a building is constructed to the supposed requirement somebody must ensure that what is on the plan is delivered.</P>
    <P>One of the most interesting and educative experiences I have had in recent years was an invitation from the local access committee last year to spend an afternoon trying to do my business in my home town in a wheelchair.  I was shocked.  I do not know how anybody can do it on a daily basis without becoming angry at the absence of basic requirements and the sins of omission and commission which confront them if they try to go up the main street of the local town to go to the bank, to use the telephone, the ATM machine, cross a road, get down off a footpath and so on.  I thank the access committee in Tullamore for that opportunity.  It has certainly informed my response to issues that have come before me since then, particularly our development plan.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to financial reliefs in respect of people with disabilities.  A review of the tax reliefs scheme was undertaken a number of years ago but is in need of radical review by the Minister and his Department.  There has been much talk about a gender proofing policy which must be analysed to ascertain its implications for access.</P>
    <P>I am dealing with a person who is seeking to provide a hackney service for persons with disability in our own area and we are running into problems with the VRT regulations of the Department of Finance.  The lower rate of VRT applies to vehicles with a capacity for under 13 persons.  If one gets a normal minibus type vehicle and adapts it for the use of persons with disability it will accommodate only three wheelchairs.  This falls below the 13 person limit for Customs and Excise and VRT regulations.  The person who has taken the trouble to set up a project to provide <Col N="1176" /> transport for people with disabilities and who will take two people off social welfare will have to pay an extra VRT bill of between £4,000 and £5,000 because the adapted vehicle will cater for fewer than 13 people.  That is a matter on which I am working with the Minister for Finance.  It illustrates the type of nitty gritty that has to be gone into if we are to ensure the barriers identified here are broken down.</P>
    <P>What is the cost of non-participation?  I would like somebody to quantify that in financial terms. Whenever one goes to a Government Department with a particular request one is told it will cost so much.  I hope the council which has been set up by the Minister will undertake a study of that nature.  If that study were done one would find that the costs of non-implementation of this report, the cost of forcing people to stay out of the workforce and not participate in society, far outweigh any cost that might be put in place to enable them participate as full citizens.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> Given the enormity of the work done and the scale of the work that remains to be done, the commission has brought to the surface the tip of the iceberg. Most of the work that remains to be done is buried far beneath the surface of many people's ordinary everyday experiences.  Unless we ensure the political commitment remains to deal with it and that people with disabilities are sitting on some of these seats to continue to fight for these issues on an ongoing basis, we will not achieve the necessary degree of implementation.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my call to the parties opposite to state publicly that, if returned to Government, they would ensure the Department of Equality and Law Reform continues in an unemasculated state, that there remains a full Minister at the Cabinet table to ensure that this report does not stay on any shelf and to fight in a measured, consistent and determined way, as the Minister, Deputy Taylor has done.  This would ensure we are not back here in three or four years' time debating how little of this report has been put into practice.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on this debate. This debate is timely and opportune.  In response to Deputy Pat Gallagher, if I were the incoming Taoiseach I would ensure the Department of Equality and Law Reform remains in place. When Deputy Bertie Ahern takes over Government after the next election I am sure there will not be any problems in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this may be the last opportunity I will have, given that I will probably have to canvass <Col N="1177" /> for the next few weeks to hold on to my seat, I thank the Minister, Deputy Taylor, and pay tribute to him for his work in that ministry.  During our time in Government with him we found him courteous and helpful and I wish him and his family all the best in his retirement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher made a relevant point at the outset which is worth nothing for the future, that people with disabilities should be allowed address this House at some stage.  I do not know how that can happen under the Constitution.  If people with disabilities were allowed address this House and share their experiences with Deputies we would find they are in line with how we are thinking.</P>
    <P>As a parent of a child with a disability I am concerned about the way such people have been treated in the past.  I have noticed in the past year that people with disabilities are on the move. They have made up their minds they will no longer accept the status of being on the margins of society or depend on local representatives to fight the cause for them.  As a result they have become a powerful lobby group to fight for a better standard of living, equality in normal life, equality in the workforce and their independence. The cause of people with disabilities which we are now pursuing will become as big a fight as the women's movement in the 1960s.  It is only right that people with disabilities should stand up for themselves, demand their rights, an independent way of living and services from the Government of the day regardless of who is in Government. In the past too much lip service has been paid by the public and Government generally.  One only has to look at the difficulties faced by people with disabilities in their normal day to day movements to find out how much they have been ignored and left to one side.  I welcome the fact that they have become a major lobbying force.</P>
    <P>This document is wide-ranging and provides much food for thought.  It gives us an opportunity to see at first hand the difficulties faced by such people and to try to implement its recommendations over a given period of time.  Those with disabilities do not expect miracle overnight but they expect us to implement the report's recommendations, many of which are worthwhile.  In the area of equality and law reform, many important issues arise on a daily basis and I welcome that the Minister is giving priority to this issue and the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>I have first hand knowledge of the centre for independent living in Wexford and have seen how important personal assistants are for people with disabilities.  If Minister Taylor had the money, he would have been allocated it for the provision of personal assistant in the budget. The difficulty with developments for people with disabilities is that they are spread over too wide an area.  Why must people who need personal assistants depend on the Minister for Health and the health boards to decide whether the money will be allocated?  They have failed in their <Col N="1178" /> responsibility to allocate money to this cause. Personal assistant have provided independence and a new way of life for these people.  Minister Taylor very much wishes to see this happen as it would give a major boost to these people at a small cost.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities have told me that they are too often categorised as being under the responsibility of the Department of Health.  That needs to be examined as it is not necessarily a health issue.  These people have disabilities but want to lead normal lives.  Their position should be addressed by other Government Departments. It would be better than being told if the Minister for Health does not allocate the money it is too bad and they will be left aside.  The money could be allocated from a number of areas.  National lottery money is spread up and down the country to every Mickey Mouse project.  It was a move forward to give these people independence but we shied away from allocating more money for personal assistants.  Deputy Cowen has given a commitment on this if Fianna Fáil returns to Government but we should not have to wait until then.  The Government, even at this late stage, and at a time when money is being thrown around like confetti at a wedding, could allocate this money to allow people to have personal assistant on a permanent basis.  Will the Minister put pressure on the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister of the Finance to ensure money is made available?</P>
    <P>Access is another area that needs to be looked at.  The document refers to the importance of education.  However, if one looks at modern schools there are no facilities for people with disabilities. It is not the Government's faulty, but that of successive Government and the Department of Education.  New schools have two or three flight of stairs with no wheelchair facilities or lifts.  At the same time, we encourage people with disabilities to attend normal schools.  The facilities provided in the schools are deplorable.  Very few are wheelchair friendly or have facilities to allow children to go up to the second or third floor of the school and continue their education in the normal way with their classmates.  For example, my daughter attends St. Aidan's primary school, Enniscorthy, and the principal and teachers have made every effort to ensure the school is accessible to her and three other children in wheelchairs. However, the class usually remains on the ground floor each year because they cannot move up.  That is not a great inconvenience but in modern buildings we should seriously examine how this problem can be dealt with.  It should be mandatory when applications are made for planning permission for new schools, that such facilities be included.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher referred to transport.  I am amazed at successive Governments lashing money into organisations such as Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann as Iarnród Éireann cannot even provide a carriage on the train from Dublin to Rosslare on a Friday to cater for the five or <Col N="1179" /> six wheelchair bound people who work or attend college in Dublin.  I am sure this is the case elsewhere. These people have to do the best they can with existing train facilities, usually leaving the wheelchair in the corridor between carriages while trying to get themselves into seats.  It should be possible to provide one carriage on a large train travelling to the major port in the south east at least on a Friday.  However, when one writes to the chief executive of Bus Éireann or Iarnród Éireann, one usually receives a reply stating that they are happy that the facilities are adequate. They are not and everybody knows that.  I hope future Ministers allocating money to them will tell them that they must provide such facilities for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>There are many issues to be dealt with.  Our spokesperson, Deputy Mary Wallace, has published a policy document on disability &mdash; Meeting the Challenge of Equality.  It contains very worthwhile suggestions and ideas.  She has put a great deal of time and effort into meeting people with disabilities throughout the country and her document lays down what should be done in future.  I hope the incoming Fianna Fáil Government will implement her ideas and suggestions.  We can no longer decide what is best for people with disabilities. We have to listen to what they are saying and learn.  I am pleased they are now a strong lobby demanding their entitlements.</P>
    <P>The first sheltered community workshops were established in Enniscorthy and New Ross, County Wexford in the 1960s by Father Anthony Scallon who was way ahead of his time.  They provide courses in carpentry and gardening among other things to give people with disabilities an opportunity to lead normal lives.  This has encouraged many people with disabilities to do things for themselves and move beyond sheltered employment.</P>
    <P>On the question of open employment, there is a 3 per cent quota in the Civil Service.  I compliment Wexford County Council and Wexford Corporation for playing their part.  Their switchboards are manned by people with disabilities.  I doubt if other local authorities are doing likewise. I fail to see why the people with disabilities cannot be employed on a far greater scale by local authorities and other public bodies.  Will the Minister outline the number of people with disabilities employed by local authorities?</P>
    <P>On the question of job training and opportunities, there should be greater interaction between employers and people with disabilities. Employers may see them as a burden but many people with disabilities are well educated. Employer bodies should take a keener interest in the matter and encourage their members to seriously consider employing people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Open employment is the area where people with disabilities encounter most barriers to equal opportunity.  The extension of equality legislation to include disability &mdash; a measure agreed when <Col N="1180" /> Fianna Fáil was in Government &mdash; is an important advance but it will achieve little unless there is a comprehensive positive action programme to promote access to open employment. As the commission stated, there must be a proper public-private partnership with a mixture of financial assistance incentives and wider availability of advice, information and support services which can make such a difference in opening up job opportunities to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The commission also stated that there are many people with disabilities for whom open employment is not the best option.  It supported the employment model funded under the pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities as showing the value of integrated work settings.  The pilot programme was established by Fianna Fáil in 1994.  The consistent message from the enterprises funded is that it has made an immense contribution to the personal development of all employees, not just those with disabilities.  The programme should be placed on a permanent basis without delay and people with disabilities allowed to retain permanently their existing secondary benefits.  The initial allocation for this initiative was £3.6 million which has been reduced to £1.2 million this year, a reduction of two thirds.  The Minister should seriously consider reversing this decision.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a range of employment opportunities open to people with disabilities, there must also be a range of training opportunities. The full range of individual needs and abilities must be catered for through appropriate placements which provide each individual with an opportunity to develop to his or her full potential.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report.  I hope it marks the start of something exciting and will result in all of us sharing a common cause with people with disabilities. It is important that we listen and learn and not try to solve problems about which we know little or nothing.  We need to implement the suggestions of people with disabilities to improve their quality of life and allow them lead normal lives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the report and congratulate all those involved in its production.  I have every confidence that its 402 recommendations will be implemented.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Taylor who is to retire from politics at the next general election.  He has been a model Minister with the besides manner of the best of the old type doctors and possesses the ability to placate those who get very excited about the contents of <Col N="1181" /> legislation.  He has played a leading role in giving meaning to his ministry of equality and law reform.  He has done a wonderful job.  I regret that he is leaving us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the firm commitment given by the Government in the &ldquo;Equal Participation&rdquo; section of the Programme for Government which states:</P>
    <P>We regard the work of the Commission for the Status of People with a Disability as fundamentally important.</P>
    <P>We will take specific action to end discrimination and to ensure equal opportunity for participation by all our people in Irish life.</P>
    <P>The Government has also committed itself to introducing a disabilities Act to set out the rights of persons with a disability, together with the means of redress, for those whose right are denied and to put in place mechanism for full and equal participation by every citizen with a disability in every aspect of our economic and social life.</P>
    <P>Even if it does not fulfil it to the letter of the law, it is very important for Government to make a commitment to various causes.  I have no doubt the Government will live up to its commitments in this area.  Unlike my namesake, Deputy John Browne from Wexford, I have no doubt the Government will be returned to office and will continue to implement it policies in this area. There will be a different Minister for Equality and Law Reform but there will be no change in the Government.</P>

      <P>The commission has done tremendous work. The Minister must be congratulated on appointing to the commission people who have first hand knowledge and experience of the problem.  I have a certain knowledge of the problems experienced by disabled people as I am chairman of the Delta Centre in Carlow which looks after 43 people, the majority of whom have a mental handicap.  I have been involved in this centre for many years and do everything I can to advance the cause of these people.</P>
      <P>Given that minority groups may sometimes want to go in a certain direction, I am glad all the members of the commission, the disabled members, civil servants etc. agreed on the recommendations. The 402 recommendations cover all issues and the implementation of even the first 40 would be a major advance on the present position. The decision to make this a social rather than a health issue should help to highlight the problems in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could talk all day about the problems of disabled people but it is more important to debate the action being taken.  In this context, I am glad the Minister proposes to implement <Col N="1182" /> some of the initial recommendations made to him.  For example, it is proposed to introduce further legislation to promote equality etc. and to establish a national disability authority and a disability support service.  It is also proposed to set up an interdepartmental task force which will draw up a plan of action on the rights of people. This is very important as it means action will be taken and the recommendations will not be left on shelves to gather dust.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to set up a monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of the commission's recommendations.  This is very important in ensuring committees do not sit idly by and matters are advanced.  I very much welcome the establishment of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities as it will give the people directly involved a special status and an independent voice.  The allocation of an extra £200,000 to the council shows that it is not merely an aspiration but a reality.  The pilot schemes in various areas are also very important.  The success of the Minister in getting the EU to give backing to the promotion of equal opportunities and the elimination of discrimination is a major factor and shows the important contribution which can be made by small countries like Ireland.  We can be rightly proud of the marvellous job done by the Government during our Presidency of the EU.  I congratulate the Minister on making the EU understand the significance of this problem.</P>
    <P>The lack of access to transport for disabled persons is a major problem.  The commission stated that all new and used rail rolling-stock and road vehicles used for public transport should be accessible to all users from 1 January this year.  It also stated that all CIE, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus depots should have at least one accessible bus by 1 June this year.  One could not accuse the members of the commission of going overboard in this respect.  Maybe it meant there should be at least one accessible bus in every town.  It should be possible in this day and age to make all buses, including older buses, accessible to disabled people.</P>
    <P>Many of the buses used to bring mentally handicapped children to special schools do not have safety belts.  These children are not as alert as ordinary school children and it is dangerous to transport them on buses without safety belts. Serious consideration should be given to this matter. Newer buses may have safety belts but I am aware of a school which had to have safety belts installed in its bus.  It is essential for buses carrying mentally handicapped children to have safety belts.</P>
    <P>Those involved in licensing taxis seem to be ahead of bus operators in this respect.  For example, in Carlow at least one taxi has to be able to take a wheelchair.  While this gives a lead, it only relates to taxis and does nothing to solve the problem of accessibility to trains and buses for disabled people.</P>
    <P>I compliment people with disabilities on how they cope, including those involved in the Independent <Col N="1183" /> Living initiative, one of whom is a very good friend of mine.  This person is highly intelligent but, as a result of an accident, is now disabled. His condition is a reminder to me of what needs to be done in this area.  People with disabilities have a great sense of independence and it is marvellous to meet them because they have a better sense of humour and attitude to life than many of the rest of us who think we have serious problems.</P>
    <P>I thank all those who work with people with disabilities for the job they are doing, particularly families who must do so much at great inconvenience, and often expense, to themselves. There is a reference to payment in the report, and I hope we will be in a position to help these people in that way because they deserve it.  It is not a question of sympathy, they have equal rights and I hope it will not be long before many of the report's recommendations are implemented by this Government when it is returned to power.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this report on the status of people with disabilities, an issue of major importance to many people.  I congratulate Deputy Mary Wallace for the interest she has taken in this subject and the policy document she published in this regard.  I want to refer to the overall approach taken in that document, which covers many of the issues we should be examining in terms of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>In regard to individual impairment, Deputy Wallace's document states that people with disabilities are one of the most marginalised and excluded groups in society.  Our policy should be to allow people with disabilities an opportunity to achieve their potential, thereby promoting individual choice.  We must move from the bureaucratic and restrictive operation of existing support schemes and those we may introduce in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of inclusion and transparency, the document states that all public agencies should develop a culture of openness and inclusion in their dealings with people with disabilities and their families.  A chain of advocacy and consultation should be a central part of public policy development and implementation. There should also be an appropriate provision of <Col N="1184" /> support services.  The idea that the health agencies should have responsibility for these services only encourages people to regard social issues as medical matters and promotes further marginalisation. All public agencies should provide these services to meet the needs of people with disabilities. They could be centralised through a health agency but not made exclusive to that agency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace also states in her policy document that we should value people who are different. Society has its own perception of what is normal, but we should expand our idea of normality. It is important that we accept some people need extensive support from others, without undermining an individual's worth and right to equal treatment. We should promote consensus.  The radical policies in Deputy Wallace's document require the involvement of all social partners, but we do not want to polarise debate.  There should be inclusive consultation and advisory bodies should be established at every level.</P>
    <P>Another point in Deputy Wallace's document is that innovation must be fostered.  Governments must address disability issues in partnership with individuals, groups and organisations.  That would help to create an environment which actively encourages innovation in the provision of services, policy development and representation. That links to the issues raised in the report before the House.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the various group who lobbied outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday, as I welcome the groups here today.  I am sure physical access to this building was not easy for those people.  Accessibility is an important question for people with disabilities in terms of the lack of lifts, etc.  However, other types of access are not catered for.  Some people will not have access in real terms unless all types of disability are catered for.  I welcome the presence of a singer in the public gallery today, because signing represents another type of access for people with a hearing difficulty.</P>
    <P>We have much to learn about disabilities.  Some of us have first or second-hand knowledge of individual disabilities.  However, one thing I have learned over the past year is that in talking face to face with the people concerned, it is possible to get a better idea of the issues that concern them than one can get from reading books and reports.  That is why it was important to meet and talk with the different groups such as those who were here today and yesterday to promote the idea of working together in partnership with people who have disabilities.  People with disabilities live longer nowadays and there is a better survival rate among people with severe disabilities. This issue will have to be addressed in the long term because, as people live longer, more facilities will have to be provided.</P>
    <P>Social inclusion and social exclusion have become buzz words in the European Union, and anybody who wants a grant to combat social exclusion is very welcome.  One would think, <Col N="1185" /> therefore, that we should not need lobby groups, but we do.  I thank the groups who came to me over the past year and told me, face to face, about their problems.  In this context, I will give the House an example of a situation in my constituency where the Government could have acted but has not yet done so.  I refer to Scoil Íosagáin in Buncrana where efforts are being made to include children with disabilities.  Alongside the mainstream school, this school has a class for 12 children who have a moderate mental handicap, and there are plans for another class to cater for children with a profound mental handicap.  The class catering for the 12 moderately mentally handicapped children has a classroom assistant, but it is proposed to remove her from that class and assign her to the new class.  A classroom assistant is a necessary resource in a class that is to cater for profoundly handicapped children, but to deprive the other class of such assistance is not living up to our ideals.  The salary of a classroom assistant is just under £9,000.  I cannot see how saving this amount can be justified when set against the psychological and physical problems children will have in the absence of such an assistant. In terms of access to education we want action, not talk.  I appeal to the Minister to have a word with the Minister for Education and ask her to keep this case in mind, because this school is taking action and providing special classes within its grounds to promote social inclusion of children with a disability, and it needs every assistance to realise the dreams of the people involved in the project.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland and England children with a handicap have an assistant beside them to help them to move around an area, and that is a great help to them in terms of education.  We have a long way to go in looking after disabled children within an ordinary class.  Looking after 30 children in the normal class situation is difficult enough.  Someone with special needs requires that extra bit of attention, and teachers should have this help available to them.  I hope after today, we will back up our good intentions with money to directly assist schools like the one in Buncrana and the 53 special schools we have.</P>
    <P>There is also a lack of educational psychologists in our education system.  In my constituency there is one between two counties, and this should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The campaign of the Centre for Independent Living for the provision of personal assistants for people with a disability has been to the forefront of discussions about disability in the past year.  I know a person with a disability who, for the past year, has had a FÁS trainee as an assistant.  During that time they have created a bond between them.  They enjoy each other's company, and trust each other.  Trust is very important when someone has to reply completely on another person to look after them properly and has to allow that person the run of their house.  However, under existing guidelines, as soon as people are trained and a bond has been built, they must move on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> Personal assistants are very important to a disabled person's quality of life.  Therefore, I add my voice to the pleas for an independent living fund to help people to become independent.  Surely independence is not too much to ask for.  Disabled people should be able to live in their own environment with their families.  Enabling them to do so would enhance their sense of well-being and of belonging in the community, and this in turn would lead to contentment for their families. This cannot be measured in financial terms.  Even if it were, it would cost the State much more to institutionalise them than to provide them with assistants.</P>
    <P>In the past few days the practice of peer counselling between the Irish Wheelchair Association and the National Council for the Blind of Ireland has come to my attention.  Peer counselling began in 1994 and, to date, 200 clients have been counselled on a one-to-one basis.  The provision of a psychological service to a disabled person by another disabled person is a very good idea from the point of view of the person being counselled because nobody is more knowledgeable about a situation than somebody who is in it and there is the spin-off of a job for the person providing the service.  I understand this service receives minimal if any support from the Government.  Will the Minister consider allocating funding to keep the service going?</P>
    <P>I urge people to support the concept of peer counselling.  Access to public buildings for people with disabilities is improving.  Commitments have been given at local authority meetings in my constituency to make public buildings more accessible to wheelchairs but, obviously this is more than a local authority issue.  One of the first requests made at meetings about village renewal is to make footpaths more accessible for wheelchairs and prams.  People are becoming more aware of the difficulties facing those with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Wallace on her efforts to make polling booths more accessible to such people.  I hope the work done in this area will be rewarded by a large number of people with disabilities casting their vote in polling booths in the near future.</P>
    <P>Transport is a major problem for people with disabilities.  A large family, two of whom are disabled, living in a rural area has great difficulty getting around if they do not own a car.  They depend on other people to take them out for a day.  It is a sad reflection on our society that people can be so isolated.  We still have a long way to go to include everybody.  Buses are not designed for people with disabilities.  A pensioner confined to a wheelchair contacted me this week to tell me he cannot avail of free travel because of his disability.  When purchasing buses we should ensure they are wheelchair friendly.</P>
    <P>Respite care is crucial.  Those caring for people with severe disabilities need a break as much as the person with the disability.  I urge the Government to provide respite care for people with all levels of disability.  Such assistance would enable <Col N="1187" /> the family and the person with the disability to have a break and that would enable them to cope better with their difficulties.</P>
    <P>As a music teacher, I would welcome more music therapy for those with disabilities.  Like Deputy de Valera, I would welcome more access to, and participation in, arts events.  In conjunction with cross-Broder organisations, the hospital in Carndonagh organises musicals, plays and other events for those with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I compliment people on the tremendous work they do for people with disabilities.  On days such as this one could easily get depressed about the things that are not being done for such people, but many things are being done.  We should compliment those who are helping to make all our citizens equal and I hope this debate will assist in that regard.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keaveney should compliment all the groups that have campaigned on behalf of people with disabilities for as long as I can remember.  Because of their persistence, organisational ability and refusal to accept the current position, they have improved facilities for people with disabilities.  It is only when one notes the number of people with disabilities that one realises they cannot be excluded from society. They have as much right as the rest of us to be included in all activities in society.  Our ability to see, hear, walk, speak and use all our organs does not give us the right to insist others should be excluded because of a disability.  Those who work with people with disabilities do a marvellous job and I hope their needs will be addressed in the near future.</P>
      <P>Future planning should not exclude any person in society.  While it may not be too difficult to plan for proper physical structures, it will be difficult to put in place facilities that will educate those with disabilities and allow them enter the workplace.  With a booming economy, over a number of years I hope we will be able to write the cheque that will include everyone.</P>
      <P>In 1994 my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, and I prepared Democratic Left's submission to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> We called this submission Focus on Ability. Rather than focusing on people's disabilities we focused on ways of harnessing their abilities to the benefit of all.  Like the question of women's inclusion in society, as long as we continue to exclude people from society, all those in society will lose out.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left has always recognised that economics are at the root of social exclusion.  For that reason we concentrated mainly on education, training and employment as routes out of poverty and marginalisation.  We focused, in particular, on the need for the people with disabilities to have access to mainstream employment and to be paid the going rate for the job.  Achieving a minimum wage &mdash; which will be soon &mdash; is one way to tackle that.  We also focused on the extra costs, such as transport, diet, heating and the provision with a special equipment, incurred by persons with a disability.</P>
    <P>Most people welcomed the comprehensive report of the commission published towards the end of last year which focuses on almost every area of life.  For the first time ever we have a complete and comprehensive study of the exact problem.  We understand the difficulties faced by people we know with disabilities, but none of us knew of the broad range of difficulties they face.  If implemented, the report's recommendations would make a great difference not only to the lives of the disabled, but to those of their friends and families.  Anyone who spends one day with a friend with a disability would realise the obstacles they encounter in their everyday life.  Having spent time a number of months in a wheelchair and on crutches two years ago, I understand the difficulties faced by people with disabilities.  That is why I began by congratulating the groups who joined us today, who joined us yesterday and the other days we discussed this issue.  It is easy to adopt the attitude that coping with a disability is too much of a struggle and is not worth the bother.  It is a chore for people with a disability to get up every morning and say to themselves that their disability will not defeat them and that they will get out.  We could learn what it is like to have to depend not only on others but on physical access facilities.</P>
    <P>I went on a walking trip in Cork with a friend who is in a wheelchair.  Many of the payments are too narrow to accommodate a standard wheelchair.  Cork is an old city.  Its centre island and streetscape are virtually unchanged since it was built.  It has narrow laneways and streets and very narrow footpaths.  While footpaths on one side of a road could accommodate a standard wheelchair and were dished, when we got to the other side of the road the footpath was not dished and we found ourselves in the terrifying position of being struck in the middle of the traffic, an everyday experience for people in wheelchairs.</P>
    <P>People in wheelchairs find that even before they try to gain access to public buildings, parking spaces for the disabled are almost invariably <Col N="1189" /> occupied by other vehicles.  Public transport is not an option for them.  Few buses are wheelchair accessible.  While many trains are accessible stations often are not.</P>
    <P>In Cork CIE has taken delivery of eight new buses, one of which is wheelchair accessible.  That ratio is part of its ongoing policy in renewing its bus fleet.  That wheelchair accessible bus serves only one route which is also served by eight other buses.  Multiplying the number of bus routes in Cork by eight gives one an idea of the number of buses in Cork, and of those only one on each route will be wheelchair friendly.  It costs approximately £4,500 to make a bus wheelchair friendly. It would have taken only approximately £22,000 to make four of the eight new buses wheelchair friendly, a mere drop in the ocean in terms of Iarnród Éireann's overall budget.  I propose that half of the new fleet should be wheelchair friendly.</P>
    <P>Transport is not the only obstacle facing people with disabilities.  Once they have reached their destinations, the problems multiply.  Steps are narrow, doorways, revolving doors and heavy carpets present an almost insurmountable obstacle to anyone with mobility difficulties.  Ramps are few and far between and, where they exist, they are often obstructed.  Where lifts are provided they are often in areas of a building which are impossible to access.  Those and other problems are not confined to private or small commercial buildings.  The majority of public buildings, where people must go to transact essential business, are inaccessible.</P>
    <P>Two years ago Democratic Left's Limerick organisation conducted a survey of public buildings in the city, including public houses, major shops, financial institutions, hotels as well as a random sample of churches, pubs and smaller shops.  They found 80 per cent of entrances to those buildings had obstacles such as heavy doors, narrow doorways, door saddle, narrow openings and angles, while 50 per cent of buildings lacked necessary ramp entrances.  A total of 72 per cent of the buildings, all multi-storey, lacked a lift, while only 20 per cent of the buildings surveyed had wheelchair accessible toilets. Access is not only an issue that affects people with permanent disabilities, it also affects parents with buggies, the elderly, those with temporary disabilities like I had and which thousands of others have every month.  At some point we will all know of a friend or relative who will be denied access and it even might even be ourselves.</P>
    <P>Problems of access are not confined to outside the home.  One of the issues identified in the report is the need to design housing for life; houses which are easily and cheaply adapted to changing circumstances.  Our population is an ageing one.  We may not think that, but it is.  For that reason this issue must be addressed by the public and the private sectors.  Probably the single greatest problem confronting many people with disabilities, apart from their disability, is poverty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> The most effective route out of poverty is through employment.</P>
    <P>This subject is close to my heart and I could talk about it forever.  Our document, &ldquo;Focus on Ability&rdquo;, deals with the need for integrated schooling, proper training and worthwhile employment for people with disabilities.  Very few Departments fulfil the 3 per cent quota of employing people with disabilities.  In some Departments the figure is as low as 1 per cent and in the private sector it is virtually non-existent, and we need to address that.  We need to address this matter similar to the way we have sought positive discrimination towards women for a number of years, but this matter is more urgent. We should set down clear rules and regulations in that regard.  If we do not start to do that now, we will never start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms. F. Fitzgerald Ms. F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms. F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report.  I am delighted it is on the agenda of the Dáil today and that we are giving it this sort of attention.  It deserves the widest support and dissemination of the information in it.  It should be required study in all our schools.  It is a most striking report.  It is depressing, but it is also optimistic.  The summary report states that people with disabilities are the neglected citizens of Ireland.  It states that on the eve of the 21st century many of them suffer intolerable conditions because of outdated social and economic policies and unthinking public attitudes.  It also states that changes have begun to come about influenced by international recognition that disability is a social rather than a medical issue, but many of these changes have been piecemeal.</P>
      <P>It is important this commission was set up and that the Minister has taken action on a series of the recommendations of its report.  Action is needed in every area of life if we are to remove the barriers that exist for people with disabilities. I note the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is present.  The report contains a section on access in the area of arts and culture for those with disabilities.</P>
      <P>There is much work to be done in the area of education.  Despite the progress made in recent times, one only has to think of the lack of psychological assessments available to pick up disability at the very early stages.  We are not doing enough in primary schools to provide services for young children with disabilities.  If we do not identify disability at a very early stage and provide the necessary services, what hope is there for those with disabilities in later life?  There is work to be done in every area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had some experience of dealing with commissions, particularly the Commission on the Status of Women.  What was important about it was that it took place, it was comprehensive, the recommendations of its report have begun to be implemented and there were mechanisms of their implementation.  We have here a bible of what needs to happen, a description of the current situation. That is terribly important because we are <Col N="1191" /> behind many other countries and the time is ripe for accelerated progress in this area.  Public attitudes are changing and there is a new understanding that it is not about charity but about human rights.  Women's rights are human rights, as are the rights of the disabled.</P>
    <P>Far too often we still see stereotyped stories and illustrations about the disabled.  It is not about that any more, it is about an understanding of basic human rights.  If we approach the question from that perspective we will get it right.  This report spells that out in detail in every area.</P>
    <P>The report says that about 10 per cent of the population has a disability.  In fact, the numbers and percentages affected by disability are far larger if one takes into account temporary disability, the effect on families and carers, as well as the demand on the public services.  This is a wide issue about the quality of life for all our citizens.</P>
    <P>A few examples have come to my attention recently.  One concerns a young woman &mdash; whose case has been mentioned by some other Deputies in recent days &mdash; who raised the issues of being able to have a list in braille of candidates going forward for the election, and being able to cast her vote on a ballot paper in braille.</P>
    <P>The question of access and transport is mentioned throughout the report.  This week I met a woman who has multiple sclerosis and who cannot get into her local post office.  We must have statutory provision to enable disabled people to avail of public and private services.  This woman cannot gain access to a new post office because there is a step down and the door is too heavy for her to push and use her aid at the same time.  That is a practical example of what can occur.</P>
    <P>A man phoned me recently to describe an extraordinary situation concerning his attempts to obtain tax relief on a commercial vehicle. Because his arm is paralysed he is not eligible for the sort of exemptions for other disabilities, including a paralysed leg.  Nonsensical and arbitrary criteria are being used in relation to claims for this tax relief.  It is a ridiculous irregularity that should not be there.  The report is full of such arbitrary piecemeal approaches to services for the disabled.</P>
    <P>I could go on.  We have a huge amount of work to do in this area.  I met the post-polio support group during the year.  They have enormous difficulties trying to get their concerns taken seriously as well as having their group, condition and the implications for their daily lives recognised, for example, in terms of extra costs.  The extra cost of disability features throughout the report. There are strong recommendations about changes in income support towards which we need to move if we are to make sure that people with disability are not inhabited by pure poverty from participating in our social, economic and political life.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal more to be said about this report.  I congratulate the groups involved in writing <Col N="1192" /> it, as well as the groups who are lobbying for change.  I pledge to work with them in whatever way I can to ensure the recommendations in this report are implemented in the shortest possible timeframe.</P>

I hope we will have action in the near future.  I welcome all those people who visited us during the past few days.  They can see their visit to Dáil Éireann to obtain their rights was worthwhile and that today's exercise is not just paying lip service.</P>
      <P>The Minister and all Members feel they can give these people their rights, but I wonder if we will forget about the matter all too quickly as soon as the wheelchairs roll out of Leinster House.  I commend all the groups.</P>
      <P>I have been involved with the disabled for many years, particularly at the workshop in New Ross, which is an industry we are pround of.  We are now seeking funding for the continuation and expansion of that workshop, but it appears as if we are begging for, rather than seeking, money for the expansion.  People are inclined to look at it in that fashion.  If the Minister cannot tell me now, I would be anxious to know at some stage whether there is a commitment to the community workshop in New Ross.  I commend those people who have taken up the cudgels for the disabled.  I commend the disabled people themselves for the wonderful lobbying work they are doing.</P>
      <P>I will quote from a letter I received from Mr. Kenneth Kilduff, a good friend of all the Oireachtas Members in County Wexford.  He states:</P>
      <P>Dear Hugh,</P>
      <P>Just to let you know that we are still here and that we mean business [it is all said in those few lines.  Whatever about us forgetting about it, the people who are lobbying certainly intend that we should not].  Furthermore, to prove to you that we are not talking through our hats, our colleague in Tipperary in the centre for independent living, won the European gold medal award presented to him in Brussels.</P>
      <P>An article appeared in the <i>Wexford People</i>newspaper on Wednesday, 4 December 1996, which described adequately what we all must strive to do.  Under the heading &ldquo;Wexford's first centre for independent living&rdquo;, the report stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two Wexford students, who have not let their disabilities stand in the way of their education, <Col N="1193" /> were presented with national education awards from the National College of Industrial Relations recently.  Kenneth Kilduff from Ballycanew, and Catherine Murphy from Oulart, were presented with their social studies certificates after they completed a one year course in the Dublin based college.  The couple had their educational dream made possible through the help of personal assistants who worked with them on a full-time basis as carers. According to Kenneth, without his assistant he could not have lived and studied in Dublin as his apartment was not wheelchair adapted and he needed other physical assistance.  Kenneth and Catherine have set up the first Wexford centre for independent living in Westlands and have secured FÁS funding for one year.  At the moment they are employing one full-time supervisor and 13 part-time personal assistants, enabling nine other people in the Wexford area to have their own personal assistants.  However, this is still not enough, Kenneth says, as, through the FÁS scheme, the personal assistants can only work a certain number of hours a week and funding is not guaranteed beyond a year.  They hope that instead they will be put on a more permanent footing by being grant aided by the central Exchequer.  Nationally the centre for independent living has made a pre-budget submission for an independent living fund.  If it comes about there will be up to 50 full-time jobs provided in County Wexford, said Kenneth.  He adds that he does not believe that the centre for independent living is nationally asking for too much by seeking £17 million over the next five years.  We are only asking the Government to help us to boldly go where everyone else has gone before.</P>
    <P>That is a description of what these people are prepared to do.</P>
    <P>Since the Government seems to be able to find cash at the drop of a hat, it is not too much to ask for £17 million over five years for people who have proven they can create employment.  Perhaps these people are too reasonable in their demands.  They are not here begging the Government for money but lobbying for support.</P>
    <P>Personal assistants would help these people to overcome their difficulties and give them confidence. It is well known that people who work in workshops do well when they are employed outside them because of the confidence they have gained.  I am a farmer and some years ago I employed a young man who was hard of hearing. As a result, I now know how to do sign language. I did not employ him because he was disabled but because he was one of the best farm workers in my parish.  These people should be given a fair chance.</P>
    <P>The quota of disabled people for the Civil Service is 3 per cent.  However, I have been told that it could be as high as 18 per cent in some Departments and 1 per cent or less in others.  That is not good enough.  A famous person once said that if one's head is in the fire and one's feet are in the <Col N="1194" /> fridge, on average one should be comfortable.  We should not use averages to boost our cause.  The public service should ensure that at least 3 per cent of its workforce comprises people with disabilities. Wexford County Council employs a blind person as a telephonist and he is probably the best in the county.</P>

However, will we deliver to these people or will we say that because they did not vote in previous elections we can ignore them?  That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare said in a reply to a parliamentary question that he would provide travel passes for people with disabilities, but these people cannot use public transport because they cannot access it.  There is no point in giving them free transport if they cannot use it.  I do not know how much it would cost to adapt a bus or train, but we should provide proper facilities to accommodate the disabled.  When we are returned to power, action will be taken to relieve the difficulties faced by these people.</P>
      <P>Last week I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance.  Since then, I have received five telephone calls asking me to explain my request.  I am looking for money for a disabled person so that she can adapt the seat in the car driven by her husband.  Perhaps Department officials do not know that some people are disabled and that schemes have been established to help them.  They should be able to provide answers to the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of house price inflation largely reflects very strong demand for housing, which is related to the strong economic growth in recent years.  Lower interest rates and the expectation that they will remain low, increased real disposable incomes and unprecedented employment growth have all contributed to the upward pressure on house prices.  The changing demographic situation, with more young people looking for housing, has also had a role to play.  These factors have fuelled the demand for houses, resulting in a rate of house price inflation which is currently considerably higher than the general inflation rate.  Despite the fact that house prices are not included directly in the consumer price index, there are clear grounds for concern that persistent high house price inflation may generate inflationary pressures indirectly in other areas of the economy.  The trend over the near future will require close attention.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank is responsible for regulating and supervising credit institutions so that their financial stability and well-being are maintained and that shareholders' and depositors' funds are protected.  I understand from the Central Bank that it has recently completed a survey of mortgage lending practices which has found that the standard of mortgage lending practices is generally being maintained.  I also understand that the bank will continue to keep mortgage lending practices under careful review in its ongoing supervision of credit institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the suggestion that a temporary tax or surcharge might be put on new mortgage borrowers, I would point out that the value of mortgage interest relief has been considerably restricted in recent years through the phased introduction of standard rating.  Furthermore an increase in stamp duty for houses over a certain value was introduced this year.  The introduction of a temporary tax or surcharge is not proposed. It would of its nature, discriminate against young people entering the house market for the first time and might not have a pronounced effect on reducing demand.  The better and more sustainable approach is to look at increasing the supply <Col N="1196" /> of developed land and houses and the Minister for the Environment has been examining what measures might be considered in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister, like the rest of us, is concerned about the considerable inflation in the housing market which will inevitably spill over into other forms of inflation.  As he will be aware, the CPI measurement of inflation gives no indication of rising house price inflation because it is not designed to do so.  If house price inflation is allowed to continue at its present rate, it will inevitably lead to higher wage demands and higher costs in the housing market.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is ruling out the tax on mortgages as proposed by the ESRI, will he expand on his statement yesterday regarding the increase on the supply side, which both he and the Taoiseach indicated was the way to dampen down house price inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a somewhat complex area with which the Deputy is more than familiar as he lives in County Kildare.  There are a number of factors.  The supply of housing, of its nature and gestation, is a medium to long-term rather than an instant and short-term factor.</P>
      <P>The demand has been growing for some time because of the substantial increase in employment. The price inflation is marked with regard to secondhand houses where, in effect, the supply is fixed.  Wherever there is a situation in which there are increased salaries, employment and prosperity as a function of the economic growth about which we have spoken &mdash; one must bear in mind the ESRI forecast for the next ten years &mdash; it is inevitable that secondhand house prices will rise in the short-term, particularly for certain sectors of the market.  There seems to be some evidence to suggest the rise at that end of the housing market is factoring its way through the entire housing market.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the construction industry and lending institutions with whom I have meetings on this topic that there is a shortage in the supply of suitably serviced land.  The local authorities in the greater Dublin region &mdash; although this problem is not confined to that region &mdash; would say there is an adequate supply of suitably serviced land, but the response which has been given to me by some of the housing players in the construction industry and credit institutions associated with house mortgages is that the location of that land is not necessarily in the areas where the demand might be highest.</P>
      <P>What we need to do, and what the Minister for the Environment is doing, is to have meetings and discussions with officials in his Department and officials of the relevant local authorities to see how the fairly substantial public capital programme for sanitary services and road development can be used in such a way as to ensure that an orderly supply of suitably serviced land can be brought to the market as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Now that the Minister has given his views about the supply side of the housing market, is he ruling out forever a tax on mortgages as proposed in the recent study?  Is he also ruling out any intervention in setting the lending criteria?  Is the Minister firmly set against either intervention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not ruling out or ruling in anything entirely.  All my instincts would be against penalising first-time house purchasers, and I would suspect these are the Deputy's instincts also.  The first-time purchase is the most difficult house purchasing decision for anybody.  I know some people desire to buy a house now because they have a more secure job than they did three or four years ago or they actually have a job. They are in a position to buy a house.  All parties in this House have always encouraged home ownership and I do not think policy will change in that respect.</P>
      <P>The concern I expressed some months ago was that, because of intense competition, the various lending institutions would engage in imprudent lending practices either by discounts to first-time purchasers or discounts over the first three or four years and lock people into a commitment in real mortgage terms, after the discounts have been washed out, to a level of payment which might be imprudent.  I welcomed the action which the Director of Consumer Affairs has taken with regard to ensuring that the real costs of mortgages are conveyed properly to would be borrowers.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Central Bank, in fulfilling its statutory function of regular supervision of the credit institutions in the housing market, will bring to the attention of those institutions its concerns that the disastrous experience which occurred in the UK should not occur here.  There is no evidence whatever that the irresponsible lending policies in which institutions engaged during Mr. Lawson's tenure as Chancellor for the Exchequer in the UK will be replicated here.  It is not in the interests of either the depositors or the lending institutions that it should.</P>
      <P>We are looking at one of the bottlenecks to which the Taoiseach referred in welcoming the ESRI report which, because we have effectively nearly 200,000 extra people in work, some of whom are earning substantial salaries relative to those which they earned previously, is factoring itself into the housing market demand.  The only way to address that is to improve the supply.  Putting surcharges or taxes on particular categories of people would not address the problem because it would not increase the supply.  It would simply make it more difficult for those who do not own a house to buy their first house and that would be inequitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Except in the general way in which the Minister is a member of Cabinet and, therefore, collectively responsible, he does not have a direct input into the housing supply side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> Would he agree that a more interventionist role could be taken by the Central Bank in looking at the lending criteria applied by a number of the institutions?  He is correct that it is the intense competition among the institutions which is inspiring much of the housing price demand.  I do not think that former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Lawson, set out to destabilise the housing market in the UK but what occurred resulted in a desperate situation.  Nor do I think that the Minister or anybody else is trying to upset the situation here.  However, we do not want to see it end in tears.  The Minister must agree there are similarities between the situation in Ireland at present and that which existed in the UK a decade ago.  Unfortunately, those similarities are great and perhaps lightning might strike twice in the same place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny the Deputy's assertion that there are similarities between the current situation in this country and that which existed in the United Kingdom in the 1980s because the lending policies are different.  Under the criteria applied by lending institutions in the UK, multiples of four times the annual salaries of two people, without any kind of relationship, sharing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are, the lending institutions involved are imprudent.  The Central Bank has written to each of the credit institutions seeking clarification and confirmation that they are adhering to the sound principles that have informed the policies of such institutions.  The Central Bank is the regulatory authority and it can take a range of actions against any lending institution it believes to be behaving improperly. A number of the chief executives of the various lending institutions clearly stated that they do not intend to replicate the disastrous lending policies utilised by their UK counterparts in the 1980s. We would be crazy not to learn from the experience of a neighbouring state with which Ireland has many friendly connections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  The Government is currently examining the most appropriate corporation tax structure for the long-term having regard to the central importance of the 10 per cent rate for inward investment and employment creation.  As Deputies will be aware, the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing industry and certain internationally traded services is due to continue to end-2010 while the 10 per cent rate for the IFSC and the Shannon Zone is due to continue to end-2005.  While the deadlines are still a considerable time away, the Government recognises the need to clarify the position as soon as possible to facilitate new investment by overseas firms wishing to locate in Ireland and by firms already established here.  I expect that the examination which is currently under way will be completed at an early date and that it will be possible for the Government to make an announcement in the near future.</P>
      <P>On the question of tax harmonisation, I am not aware of any plans at EU level for a general harmonisation of income tax or corporation tax. There is, however, broad acceptance among EU Finance Ministers of the need to achieve greater co-ordination of taxation policies between member states to ensure that these are consistent with European Union objectives in respect of economic and monetary union and the Single Market. A high-level policy group under the chairmanship of Commissioner Monti has been set up to examine these issues and report to the Council in due course on what initiatives might be considered in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this question on a previous occasion.  During the past number of months, the Minister indicated that the Government will be introducing its strategy in the near future.  Recent newspaper reports indicate that the Government is about to make an announcement in that regard.  When will that announcement be made?  The international companies involved would like a decision in the near future. Will the announcement be made within the next week or so?  I am sure the Minister read the recent reports to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced in the budget on 22 January that we would be addressing this issue. Like the two Deputies opposite, who are their respective parties' spokespersons on Finance, we met different groups which expressed concern, particularly in respect of companies that are already established here and contemplating substantial capital investment programmes &mdash; notably in the pharmaceuticals area &mdash; and said they would like an indication of what the rate might be after 2010.  We recognise their concern and are working towards clarifying the situation. However, a number of issues and factors must be taken into account.  The more this matter has been discussed, the more relevant these issues have become in terms of resolving or addressing <Col N="1200" /> the consequences of either putting in place a single rate or a range of rates.</P>
      <P>In addition, the non-10 per cent rate has been decreased.  The relevant rates are now 36 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively.  The direction of the non-10 per cent rate is converging towards what might be regarded as a probable or possible single rate.  However, this matter involves many complex issues and we are trying to resolve as many as possible before a final decision is made.  I am not in a position to inform the Deputy when that decision will be made.  The newspaper reports to which he referred reflect the impact of our ongoing work.</P>

      <P>When I saw the rose and tie worn by the Minister, I could not help but remark upon his appearance.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the considerable media coverage of an EU Commission agenda to investigate the harmonisation of corporation tax and income tax rates?  Articles about this matter have appeared in various journals and some leading financial institutions in this country have informed me they apprehend that such an agenda is afoot.</P>
      <P>With regard to the manufacturing and the IFSC rates, does the Minister agree that there is cross-party consensus that a rate of between 10 per cent to 13 per cent is required in respect of all services? Is there substance in the suggestion that, in approaching a low standard rate for manufacturing and services, the Department is examining the introduction of a different rate in respect of passive income such as rentals, investments, etc., rather than core manufacturing, services and production activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the harmonisation of income tax and corporation tax, various proposals have been put forward by those countries <Col N="1201" /> in the European Union with relatively high corporation tax rates.  However, these countries do not want to see the introduction of high excise duties on alcohol.  They are attempting to reduce what they regard as a competitive disadvantage without seeing the other side of the coin.  Under the European Union Treaties, the question of taxation for individual member states is governed by unanimity and there are no proposals to change that.  The principle of subsidiarity must allow and enable individual member states to adopt a tax regime they are prepared to take on to maximise the potential for economic activity within their own jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be familiar with the situation in the United States where different corporate tax structures prevail side by side.  I visited the offices of Merrill Lynch which are situated in Wall Street on the island of Manhattan and I was shown the company's corporate support offices across the Hudson River in New Jersey.  I was informed that the support offices are situated in New Jersey because the tax rate in that state is considerably less than the combined tax rates in New York City and New York State.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the European Union can proceed to establish a standard rate of income tax and corporation tax.  I know of no federal, federalist or post-federal country where such a regime exists.  A regime of that type would not be in the interests of the Union or of the member states. Therefore, I do not expect that one will be introduced.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's second question referred to differentials between traded income &mdash; if one wants to use that phrase &mdash; and passive income.  That issue must be addressed because the movement down from, say, 36 per cent or 28 per cent to a low rate of the order the Deputy suggested, without anything else happening, could bestow an extraordinary windfall advantage on people, with no material benefit from the point of view of the economy and without creating any extra employment or wealth.  It is the very complexity of those issues that necessitates our examining very carefully how we should address people's very real desire for some degree of certainty post-2010.</P>
      <P>As a country, one of the great advantages we have had is that, for some considerable time, we have provided tax certainty in respect of both domestic and foreign direct investment on which we have had all party support; it has not become a domestic political football as has been the case in other jurisdictions.  I welcome that and supported it when in Opposition.  Indeed it has been one of our key strengths and will be the factor which will influence my considerations in all of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We went over this ground on the last occasion on which the Minister answered questions here.  As he correctly points out, we have all been lobbied by IBEC and its subsidiary groups in this respect.  The Minister announced at budget time that a decision on this matter was <Col N="1202" /> imminent.  Over recent weeks it appeared that that decision would be taken.  The Minister could be more forthcoming and state whether it is intended to strike a rate, indicate the range of rates and whether it will discriminate between passive and traded income?  Although this occurs in the case of all Governments, press officers of Departments are now more in tune with informing their friends in the media than Members of this House.  It is legitimate that Members should know first-hand as it was obvious over the past ten days or so that a decision on this matter was imminent.  The Minister should be more forthcoming in informing us of the announcement we can expect within the next two weeks or so, if not before.  At the very least, can the Minister say whether this decision will be taken within the next fortnight and, if so, what it is likely to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect Members of this House and, in the course of replies I have been as direct, honest and frank as possible.  No decision has been taken; the matter is under active consideration. We are also aware of the increasing demand for clarity on this and of the general desire that such decision be taken sooner rather than later.  We have not clarified the issues; we have had some discussion on some of them.  Since the benefit of all of this is to provide certainty in the marketplace and to would-be investors, a decision that would not constitute an answer to supplementary questions and leave much ambiguity hanging over it, would not be helpful to anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister <Col N="1203" /> said about tax harmonisation.  Indeed the message should emanate from this House that the overall objective of a harmonised income and corporation tax regime in Europe is anathema to this country and we do not want to go down that road.  Will the Minister confirm that it will be made very clear at the next ECOFIN Ministerial Council meeting or whatever &mdash; if this is part of the European Union Commission's medium to long-term agenda &mdash; we want to have no hand, act or part in it?</P>
      <P>On tax harmonisation, does the Minister agree that in some areas of so-called passive income one would need a scalpel to divide what is passive from what is active income?  I have in mind in particular our banking institutions because some contend that a section 84 loan was the nearest thing to passive income there ever was.  Does the Minister agree it would be very difficult to divorce what is happening within the International Financial Services Centre from ordinary banking activities?  Will he say to his European colleagues, with his hand on his heart, he is not engaging in an aid to geographical distortion?</P>
      <P>If the Minister is going to draw a distinction between passive and traded income, does he agree that that will have to be very clearly and concisely signalled to the market so that people, when making plans, will know, roughly speaking, which side of a difference between 12 per cent or 10 per cent and, say, 25 per cent or 30 per cent, their industrial or market activities will fall?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>By his question Deputy McDowell is illuminating the reasons we are taking time to examine all of these issues.  On the timeframe of 2010, were we in a totally open position, we would not be proposing to change it.  The expectation is that we will be required to change it in some form or other and it is for that reason we are addressing that issue.  The complexities of tax harmonisation are ones I support.  I can confirm that we have adopted a position, with regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, that unanimity of voting in ECOFIN on taxation issues will remain, so that we retain our independence to determine tax rates within the broad parameters of what does and does not constitute State aids.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister avail of this opportunity to clarify the remarks he made some weeks ago on the rate at which he would like to see the Irish punt enter the new exchange rate which, without any shadow of doubt, has led to speculation against the Irish currency over recent days?  Speculators have taken the Minister's word as affording them an opportunity to have a go at the Irish currency and force the Irish punt down to its present rate, when wholesale interest rates rose by half of 0.5 per cent this morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in March 1995, prior to attending an ECOFIN meeting when the Irish punt was trading just under parity with sterling, that Government policy with regard to currency was that the Irish punt should trade comfortably within the exchange rate mechanism band, and that that would be our position as we moved toward membership of the single currency on 1 January 1999. Since then sterling has strengthened considerably to the point at which it is now a very strong currency relative to its position in the league some 12 months ago.  We do not know how long this will last or where it will go but, as I said yesterday in the course of an interview with George Lee, the position is that no decision has yet been taken on the rate at which the Irish punt will be fixed and enter the single currency.  There are two rates at present, the first, the central rate for all currencies and, second, market rates and, because of the increased strength of sterling in relation to the dollar, the Irish punt was pulled up in the band.  As a consequence, the Irish punt rose in value against other Continental currencies in addition to coming down in value relative to the pound sterling.  Finance Ministers have not decided on the rate at which currencies will be fixed in the context of the single currency.  Different currencies may fix at different rates relative to the central rate that prevails.  We will propose a rate that best meets the needs of the economy in the medium to long-term.</P>

My comments reflected <Col N="1205" /> what many people had said in the trade sector of the economy, that the Irish pound has appreciated in value against the deutschmark, the French france and other currencies, and that we were not trading as comfortably as I would like.

Government spin doctors told the media that is in response to careful remarks by the Minister, which signalled a change in Government proposals, but in the same newspapers we read that the Central Bank was spending money trying to prevent that movement in currency.  Will the Minister agree there is a fundamental conflict between his remarks that signalled a change in Government attitudes, which was designed to bring about a realignment of currency values, and the Central Bank flinging away taxpayers' money to prevent that realignment? Will he indicate how the Central Bank's change in policy is reconcilable with suggestions in the media that this is a planned and wished for realignment of currency values?</P>

      <P>It is inevitable, as we move closer to European Monetary Union, that the rates at which currencies join the single currency will be a matter for interpretation and that the markets will take different views in that respect.  The market has clearly indicated that Ireland will quality for the single currency and that we will join on the first day.  I have said, and our policy has been consistently repeated, that we want to trade comfortably within the ERM band.  That policy was reaffirmed by me to the Central Bank.  The actions of the Central Bank on a day to day basis are a matter for it.  The bank has a responsibility to implement policy.  Government policy, that we trade comfortably within the ERM band, has not changed.</P>

      <P>I have been particularly careful over a long period not to say anything that would endanger the Irish currency, despite great temptations at times to do so.  I spent years, before I became spokesperson on Finance, monitoring Union currencies.  The Minister made a grave error in his recent comments.  I accept anyone can make an error in an off-the-cuff remark, but in regard to currency matters a shut mouth is often the best policy &mdash; that is the case not only in an Irish context but worldwide.  There are clear demarcation lines here.  The Government sets exchange rate policy and the Central Bank implements that policy &mdash; the law of the land is explicit in that regard.  Interest rates and other issues are different matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told a newspaper a few weeks ago that he wished to see the Irish pound going downwards and a few day later he tried to correct that. He is now saying that his remarks were misinterpreted. It is as a result of those remarks that the <Col N="1206" /> Irish pound has been speculated against in recent days.  Speculators do not need broad hints from the Minister for Finance to speculate, they can do so of their own free will at any time.  The Minister's remarks are the direct cause of what has happened in the financial market in recent days, and that is in nobody's interest.  In future the Minister should be more cautious.  There will be some chaos in the run-up to the date of joining the European Monetary Union, but if the Minister continues to do as he did in recent weeks, he will create absolute chaos.  His remarks were irresponsible and unwise.  They were not in the long-term interests of the economy and we will pay a price for that.</P>

I accept the Central Bank is a separate institution which makes decisions to buy or sell the Irish pound without seeking the Minister's advice, and perhaps it is just as well that is the case.  Will the Minister confirm that it is normal for a Minister for Finance to warn the Central Bank of his intentions before announcing a general desire for a realignment of currency, so that taxpayers' money is not wasted by that bank pursuing a different policy?

      <P>There is no confusion on my part as to the roles of the Minister for Finance, the Government and the Central Bank &mdash; this is a pet subject of mine &mdash; although there may be confusion in the eyes of some people.  The Minister said he was concerned about the strength of the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> other EU currencies. Since the Minister for Finance sets the policy, that was a clear indication to speculators that he wanted the Irish pound driven down.  While it would be unacceptable for the Irish pound to join the new exchange rate mechanism at the rates <Col N="1207" /> which prevailed in recent months, it is even more unacceptable for the Minister for Finance to signal to speculators to drive down the rate, as has happened.  The Central Bank is obliged under Irish law to operate the policy as announced by the Minister for Finance.  That is why the Central Bank has to pull out of the market.  The Minister will have to accept at this stage that his comments were unwise.</P>

      <P>The national debt stood at £29,912 million at the end of 1996.  Generally speaking, the main factor affecting the year-on-year change in the national debt is the Exchequer borrowing requirement which was estimated on budget day to be £637 million for 1997.  However, other factors such as discounts or premiums on bonds and, in particular, exchange rate movements can also either increase or decrease the stock of debt outstanding.  Given the sensitivity in the financial markets to any indication of official expectations for interest or exchange rates, it is not the practice to publish forecasts of national debt.  Nevertheless, if these latter elements are assumed to be neutral in their effect on the national debt, it would be expected that the debt would rise by the amount of the target EBR of £637 million to £30,549 million at end-1997.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his Budget Statement told us the national debt had fallen by £300 million.  He attributed this to the high value of the punt against foreign debt currencies.  Do I take it from the Minister's reply that with the punt on the slide we can expect that type of improvement will no longer continue, that we will have the reverse and the national debt will increase, and if the Exchequer borrowing requirement of £637 million is added we may have a national debt increase of £1 billion in the current year?</P>

Will the Minister agree when he and his pals are taking the alkaseltzer tomorrow morning, after the party in Lansdowne Rugby Club to celebrate Tony Blair's victory, that English money market people will probably be at work dealing with a boost in the value of sterling, based on the landslide?  The situation will not get better, it will get worse.

The underlying trend is that the debt ratio to GDP is falling satisfactorily and it is possible, in light of the circumstances outlined by Deputy O'Hanlon, there could be shifts in the size of the debt.  It is definitely probable, if not certain, that the debt to GDP ratio will fall significantly this year.  Recent calculations are that it will fall to somewhere in the order of 69 per cent.  The reference criteria in the Maastricht Treaty is 60 per cent.  The debt to GDP ratio is below the European average.  A <Col N="1209" /> number of factors will alter the size of the debt but the critical factor is the ratio of debt to GDP. In that respect we are moving, as the European Commission has adjudicated, in a satisfactory manner towards the reference criterion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Both my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, and I have previously answered questions from the Deputy on this topic.  It might be useful if I were to outline again the general rules which apply in this area and the thinking behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994, a review of the treatment of maintenance payments for the purposes of levies and PRSI was undertaken by officials of my Department, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of Social Welfare, Health and Enterprise and Employment.  With regard to the health contribution and employment and training levy, it was agreed they should not be imposed on that part of the payer's income which is paid to his or her separated spouse under an enforceable maintenance agreement.  The appropriate changes in the law were included in the Social Welfare Act, 1995, and had effect from 6 April 1995.  This brings the treatment of maintenance payments for the purposes of the levies into <Col N="1210" /> line with their treatment in the income tax system.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental review involving separated spouses also concluded there should be no change in the PRSI treatment of maintenance payments.  The payment of separate PRSI contributions enables each spouse to build up a social insurance record in their own right, and they can both, in due course, qualify for a pension.  A provision in the Divorce Act, extends this treatment to people who obtain divorces within this country.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to a social insurance pension is a valuable right and affords protection to separated or divorced spouses.  It is, therefore, important for the protection of their individual pension rights that social insurance contributions be made by the recipients of maintenance payments.  Maintenance payments are not regarded merely as a transfer from one individual to another, but in these circumstances each individual's income is regarded as being a separate entity for social insurance purposes.  The logic behind both parties paying PRSI is that social insurance contributions confer substantial benefits on the contributor and ensure an adequate level of social protection.  It is believed the arrangement whereby recipients of maintenance payments make social insurance contributions is equitable.</P>
    <P>It appears the Deputy is seeking to equate, for PRSI purposes, the treatment of a married couple with that of a separated couple.  It must be accepted that a separated or divorced couple are now two distinct entities whose pension rights should be individually catered for, rather than as a single unit, which clearly they are not.</P>
    <P>In relation to introducing a tax allowance for PRSI purposes, I have no plans to introduce such an allowance either for separated or divorced persons on equity grounds or in general on the grounds of cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of separated people are not aware of the PRSI liability on maintenance payments between husband and wife.  They do not pay it and would be astounded to hear they are liable for it.  I fail to grasp the Minister's logic that there is a stronger case for imposing PRSI on two people whose marriage has broken down to the degree that they have formalised their payments on a monthly basis when one ignores married couples who are just getting on in a loose arrangement with money being put on the kitchen table with no PRSI deduction.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate what rate of PRSI applies to such payments?  Does the paying spouse have to make a deduction in PRSI?  Must the receiving spouse, normally the wife, send in a portion of her maintenance to the Revenue Commissioners? Most people are completely unaware of this and would consider it deeply unfair and inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern. <Col N="1211" /> The questions are complex as are the replies and I will try to facilitate the Deputy with the information available to me.  PRSI is paid at a rate of 5 per cent on maintenance payments.  Deputy McDowell wants to know why is it higher than the generally applied class A rate of 4.5 per cent and why the PRSI free allowance of £80 is not available to the recipient.  The estranged person on maintenance is clearly paying a higher contribution than the payee and he wants to know how this is justifiable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The PRSI arrangements for class A employees are as follows: an employer pays 8.5 per cent on earnings up to £260 per week and 12 per cent where earnings exceed that subject to a ceiling of £27,900 and the employee pays 4.5 per cent on earnings up to £23,200 with a PRSI free allowance of £80 per week.  Self-employed and persons receiving maintenance payments pay 5 per cent on income over £20 per week.  These contrasting arrangements, having regard to the entitlements which ensue, are considered equitable for the different categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who considers them equitable because they are astonishingly draconian.  A wife must cough up 5 per cent of what she receives under a maintenance agreement and is told this is equitable because if she was working and receiving the same amount of money her employer would to have pay PRSI also.  This is an outrageous imposition on people, most of whom cannot afford it.  They are in enough difficulty running two households because they have separated.  Does the Minister agree the proposition that a wife must cough up 5 per cent of her maintenance payments to the Revenue Commissioners is astonishing?  If the public knew about this, there would be a revolution. The fact that it is unknown is the only reason it has not been changed.  If it were widely known, would the Minister agree it would be the cause of huge uproar?  Does he agree that the vast majority of separated people do not comply?  I have never heard of a wife who sent money to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is an extraordinary imposition and tax on people whose lives are blighted enough normally.  Most Irish people cannot afford two households out of one salary and this is an outrageous imposition on maintenance payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware of the economic hardship which can result from marital breakdown. It is precisely because separated couples face different economic circumstances that the current arrangement for social insurance contributions was introduced.  The protection of the estranged spouse was at the core of this issue at the outset.  Maintenance payments are not subject <Col N="1212" /> to double taxation and the remaining anomaly in this regard &mdash; the issue of the double payment of the levies &mdash; has been resolved.  Social insurance is not a tax.  It is based on a contributory principle by which future benefits can be secured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of vital importance that the pension rights of both spouses are protected in the event of marital breakdown and this is the sole reason that social insurance contributions be made by the payer and recipient of maintenance payments.  I am sure the Deputy will concede that future individual pension rights are in the best interests of separated couples and this situation is fundamentally different from that of married couples.</P>

      <P>I declare an interest in the matter. Perhaps the Minister's officials could issue details in regard to this for Members because it is complicated.</P>
      <P>The reason it is rated at 5 per cent is because it is based on the self employed PRSI rate.  That is the only justification for it subject to a minimum of £215 per week in 1996/7.  Will the Minister confirm that the 5 per cent rate only covers future pension entitlements and does not entitle a person to any other benefits under the social insurance contributions?</P>

      <P>Capital Acquisitions Tax, CAT, is due whenever a person receives a gift or an inheritance, subject to certain exemptions, thresholds and reliefs.  One such relief which is available <Col N="1213" /> under the CAT code exists where property is inherited from an elderly sibling with whom the beneficiary has been living.  This relief, introduced in 1991, recognises the special circumstances of elderly siblings living together and eases the tax burden associated with inheritances in such situations.  The relief allows the value of a house or part of a house which is inherited to be reduced for CAT purposes by 60 per cent or £60,000 whichever is the lesser.  The original relief had a threshold of £50,000 or 50 per cent and this was subsequently increased to £60,000 or 60 per cent with effect from April 1995.</P>
      <P>To qualify for this relief the successor must fulfil the following conditions: be either a brother or sister of the disponer; have attained the age of 55 years; have resided in the house with the deceased sibling &mdash; disponer &mdash; continuously for a period of not less than five years ending on the date of the inheritance and not be the beneficial owner of any other house or an appropriate part of any other house.</P>
      <P>The relief works as follows: an elderly person might share a house worth £120,000 jointly with a brother or sister.  On inheriting their sibling's share worth £60,000 the individual would be entitled to reduce this inheritance by 60 per cent to £24,000.  Given the Class II CAT - free threshold of £24,740 for the 1997 calendar year, this inheritance of a half share in a house worth £120,000 would result in no CAT being paid.</P>
      <P>Yesterday on Report Stage of the Finance Bill, I introduced an amendment to this relief which has the effect of increasing the existing threshold of £60,000 to £80,000 in the case of the elderly siblings' relief.  This increase is based on the increase in the average house prices since the threshold was previously increased.  I am confident that such a move will greatly satisfy the increasing concerns of elderly siblings living together.</P>
      <P>A general tax exemption for close relatives of the disponer who inherit a house in which they are already residing could have significant Exchequer cost implications and would significantly reduce the yield from CAT.  Finally, in cases where payment of inheritance tax would cause excessive hardship for the beneficiary, the Revenue Commissioners will consider proposals for the postponement of the payment of the inheritance tax.  Accordingly, I do not propose extending the sibling relief further.</P>

      <P>As we did not have the time yesterday to discuss the increase, which I noted, it went through without discussion.  It was provided for by the Minister in response to the discussion on Committee Stage.  Will he agree there are many situations where this sibling relief is not adequate to deal with the matter?  One can have complicated arrangements where a cousin brought up by the family lives in the home &mdash; a quasi-sibling.  In others, one has nephews and, particularly, nieces living in the same house looking after elderly uncles and aunts, doing what <Col N="1214" /> their mother used to do and performing the exact same social functions, in terms of being a carer.  I received a letter from an elderly lady in the north Dublin suburbs in which she stated that the arrangements she had made in relation to her niece were unravelling and that her niece will be plunged into an economic disaster when she dies. Will the Minister agree that, while there has been some movement on the financial side, there are relatives &mdash; nieces, nephews and first cousins &mdash; who do not have a share in the home but who regard it as their family home?  They should qualify for the same relief.</P>

      <P>This issue was the subject of an extensive debate on Committee Stage when I was disposed to move in the direction outlined by the Deputy.  The difficulty was that, in the limited time available between Committee Stage and Report Stage, we were not able to calculate the cost of the proposed change.  There is no argument in equity against it.  Where it is the inheritor's principal residence in which he or she has lived for a specified period &mdash; a period of five years is specified in the legislation &mdash; and there is no entitlement to a share in any other property or residence, the logic behind the proposal is acceptable.  The matter should be addressed in the next Finance Bill.  The Deputy has referred to one case, I can think of others.  It is likely the number will increase.  No taxation relief should be provided, however, unless one has some idea of what the cost will be.  We will have to examine CAT returns to calculate the total loss, in terms of yield, and to determine the conditions that should apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to an antiavoidance provision in this year's Finance Bill which is designed to counteract certain packaged schemes which have come to notice involving groups of individuals investing in hotels.  Typically, such schemes invite individuals to join a partnership for the purpose of investing in the construction of an aparthotel.  Under an agreement in place at the time the investment is made, individual investors, after drawing down all the capital allowances available, are each to receive ownership of a nominated suite in the hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enhanced capital allowances were provided for hotels in recognition of the important role played by them in the tourism sector.  However, it was never intended that such allowances would give rise to the type of schemes now emerging.  Diverting hotel capacity, which has been provided at considerable Exchequer cost, to private use once <Col N="1215" /> the capital allowances have been claimed is a clear abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill provides that there will be no entitlement to capital allowances where, at the time of the investment, any agreement or arrangement exists which provides that individual investors are to obtain a room or suite in the hotel at the end of the capital allowance write-off period.  This restriction will not affect genuine hotels or aparthotels which are not subject to such agreements or arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied this change will not have any negative effect on the provision of additional tourist accommodation.  Rather, it should have a positive effect by ensuring tax resources are focused on bona fide hotel projects.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, the Revenue authorities have made to target criminal and drug barons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that targeting the people to whom he refers is being undertaken by the Criminal Assets Bureau which was set up in July 1996 specifically for this purpose and which was placed on a statutory basis on 15 October 1996 following the enactment of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996.  The bureau was established to bring together in a more structured way the resources and expertise of the various agencies, including the Garda Síochána, the Revenue authorities and the Department of Social Welfare, involved in this difficult work.  All the agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, are co-operating fully in the work of the bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objectives of the bureau are identification of assets, wherever situated, which derive or are suspected to derive directly or indirectly from criminal activity and the taking of appropriate action to deprive the asset holders of those assets or the benefit of them.  The bureau is headed by a chief superintendent and has staff drawn from the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  This ensures close and concerted co-operation between all State agencies in dealing with the proceeds of crime.  Working together and with the back-up of general Garda resources, bureau staff have mounted a focused attack on the illegally acquired assets of criminals involved in serious crime by seizing and freezing their assets, ensuring that such assets are made liable to tax as appropriate and ensuring social welfare <Col N="1216" /> payments are withdrawn from those not entitled to them.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996 enables the Revenue Commissioners to provide information to a Garda chief superintendent, including the head of the Criminal Assets Bureau, where they have reasonable grounds for suspecting the information relates to a person who has derived profits from an unlawful activity, where they are of the opinion that it may be of value to an investigation and that it is in the public interest to provide it.   This provision has enabled the Revenue Commissioners to provide much valuable information to the bureau.</P>
    <P>While it would not be appropriate for me to go into operational details of cases being pursued, it is clear the Criminal Assets Bureau is making a huge impact with the co-operation of the Revenue Commissioners and other agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the value of assets seized or frozen by the Criminal Assets Bureau, the establishment of which was welcomed, say, in the last three months of last year and the first three months of this year, the assets which have been sold and the number of social welfare payments withdrawn?  What progress has been made?  Members of our communities are suffering because of the activities in which these criminals are engaged.  I appreciate that certain individuals are behind bars in other jurisdictions but there are others who own fine properties who seem to be able to retain their assets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable assets in one form or another have been seized.  Some of these have been sold &mdash; the Deputy will be aware of a recent case involving the sale of a vessel in Galway.  I do not have the information with me but I will obtain it from the relevant authorities and the CAB and send it to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it been brought to the Minister's attention that some of the bureau's powers need to be strengthened?  I tabled this question because of the perception in the community that the Minister for Justice has been soft on crime and that the criminal was the winner in 1996.  I would like to think that the bureau, under the Minister's direction, will put paid to this perception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau, which has been very successful, reflected policy propositions made by Deputies, including members of my party, and was welcomed by all sides of the House.  Deputy Gregory had called for some time for the establishment of a bureau along these lines.  There have been explicit reports in the media on a number of cases taken by the officers of the bureau.  I am in regular contact with the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Chief Superintendent of the bureau and I have not been requested to give the bureau additional <Col N="1217" /> powers.  However, I would respond positively to such a request.  I had meetings with the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and others concerning the increased powers given to the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda in the confiscation of illegal cigarettes.  These powers were provided for in the Finance Bill which was passed by the House yesterday.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the bureau has made an impact.  One case which is under appeal relates to the taxation liabilities of the wife of a well known criminal who is behind bars.  As that case is before the courts I will not comment further on it.  The bureau is working well and I have not received a request to give it additional powers or resources.  However, if such a request is made I will respond to it positively in view of the concerns we all have.  We are getting on top of the problem, however slowly.</P>

      <P>The Minister is obviously constrained in terms of what he can say about the case which the CAB effectively lost and is now under appeal.  I would not expect him to comment on the merits or otherwise of the judgment.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if it transpires a change in the law is necessary so that spouses must justify much more clearly their assets and take responsibility for the significant assets in their possession then that change should be implemented?  Will he also agree that any necessary change in the law to trace assets to family members and proxies who hold assets for people should also be introduced?  Will he further agree there should be a presumption in law that in certain circumstances the onus will be on the recipient, family member, spouse or proxy to show that the assets are not Criminal Asset Bureau type assets?  At present the onus is on the CAB to prove that a son or daughter knew or ought to have known that the moneys in question were derived from criminal behaviour.</P>

      <P>Beneficiaries of resources which have been derived by others from criminal activity are covered by the legislation.  The case to which I referred related to taxation and not to matters under the remit of the CAB.  This case is under appeal and, pending the outcome, I cannot comment further on it.  Our intention is in line with the proposition put forward by the Deputy. I will have to await the judgment in this case to see what subsequent action, if any, is necessary.</P>
      <P>We set out with the CAB to attack criminals by stripping them of assets which had been illegally obtained in every sense of the word.  To the best of my knowledge, and without revealing operational secrets, the CAB is operating effectively and vigorously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Having campaigned in favour of it and tabled questions to the Minister, I welcomed the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  However, I am concerned that minor criminal cases which come to the attention of the <Col N="1218" /> Revenue Commissioners and minor cases which come to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; for example, where a person involved in drug dealing in a small way is claiming social welfare &mdash; are referred to the Criminal Assets Bureau.  This is being done because officials in the Department who lack the anonymity of those in the bureau are, rightly, afraid to get involved in even the most minor cases.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau does not have the manpower, resources or time to deal with this huge volume of work.  I am not talking about cases involving major drug dealers but rather the range of criminal activity which the bureau, rightly, appears willing to take on.  I hoped the bureau would make the major heroin dealers a priority at the start.  Will the Minister examine this matter to see if the workload is such that many of the cases being brought to the attention of the bureau cannot be acted upon because it does not have the time, manpower or resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise the matter with the relevant authorities to see if this is the case.  It was not the intention when it was being established, or when I spoke to the operational personnel who head it up, that the bureau would deal with minor cases of the type referred to by the Deputy.  The intention was that its primary focus would be on serious crime and criminals.  In so far as one wishes to make a distinction between serious and petty criminals, it was not intended to give the bureau this responsibility.  I will make inquiries and let the Deputy know the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main achievements of the Garda has been the move against a heroin dealer named Mullins, who is referred to as the boxer.  That individual is now in custody in Britain and has been brought before the courts. This case highlights the growing trend among drug dealers to move to Britain where they invest in property and businesses.  With the exception of Mullins, who was caught red-handed with a great amount of money, drug dealers appear to be able to do this at will.  Dealers who have invested the money they made from drug dealing here in businesses in England appear to be eluding the Garda and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Will the Minister inquire from the bureau whether there is a need for additional powers or a new strategy to deal with that problem?  It would be an appalling injustice if these people were allowed to set up business in Manchester, Birmingham or even Amsterdam and live in luxury on the misery of their victims in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern which I suspect is the concern of every Deputy.  I will make inquiries along the lines he suggests and, depending on what my inquiries reveal, we will then decide the type of action that is necessary. During the Irish Presidency, the Taoiseach highlighted the need for greater co-operation between the various police forces of the European Union, <Col N="1219" /> specifically to address the issue of cross-border crime and drug related crime in particular.  Our position in this area is well known and we would be anxious to pursue people who might be availing of the possibilities to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to a European convention on extradition, we need a convention on criminal assets.  I acknowledge money laundering legislation is in place, but at the next European conference the Minister attends he should raise the possibility of setting up some type of criminal bankruptcy order system.  That would enable every EU member state do what is currently being done in relation to the McCracken tribunal.  The Criminal Assets Bureau would be entitled to go to the English courts and get an order in aid to freeze assets in certain circumstances. If such a measure was introduced under a European wide convention, people would not be buying flats in Marbella, Amsterdam or London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  We need more integrated forms of co-operation in this area.  The Deputy will recall that at the Cannes Summit, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, raised various difficulties about greater EUROPOL co-operation, particularly where the question of access to courts might be perceived in the UK as an infringement on the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.  If there is a change of Government in the United Kingdom, and I hope there is, that kind of reservation will go.  Nobody benefits from providing a safe harbour for criminals from another member state of the European Union, particularly when most if not all of these crimes are drug related.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer is yes, the country can afford Partnership 2000.  The commitments on pay, tax and social inclusion contained in the partnership agreement were incorporated in the 1997 budget and in the published projections for the 1998 and 1999 budgets under the multi-annual budgetary process.  In fact, the 1997 budget made a significant step in implementing the partnership, with particularly marked progress on the tax commitments.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the partnership extends over the three-year period 1997 to 1999.  It is important that over that period we continue to manage our economy prudently in order to underpin the continuation of our good growth record of recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the partnership and in our budget projections <Col N="1220" /> there is a strong commitment to the Maastricht criteria and to the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.  We must continue to ensure, as the partnership requires, that we observe these economic disciplines &mdash; they provide the necessary framework for the continued success of our policies and for ensuring thereby that the provisions in the partnership agreement are fully met, to the benefit of all sections of our community.</P>
    <P>The recent ESRI Medium Term Review 1997-2003 highlighted the strong potential of the economy provided that we observe the required disciplines, a view with which I would be in wholehearted agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister's opinion that the country can afford Partnership 2000. However, he should cast his mind back to a short time before the agreement was signed when his party leader went over his head in regard to his view on the commitment to Partnership 2000 and forced that agreement through.  Will the Minister comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a debate on this issue on Report Stage of the Finance Bill for which the Deputy was not present.  Partnership 2000 is the fourth agreement of its kind.  The commitment to reaching an agreement probably diminished with each agreement because the memories of the various participants are not as strong now as they were in the mid-1980s when the necessity for such agreements became relevant.  Partnership 2000 was not carried by an overwhelming majority of the workforce.  One of the largest trade unions identified an opposition candidate to the candidacy of Jimmy Somers for the presidency of SIPTU.  She stated her opposition to Partnership 2000.  The commitment of the social partners to Partnership 2000 must be reinforced and renewed on both sides, as I made clear yesterday in this House.  We can afford Partnership 2000 provided we keep the disciplines.</P>
      <P>We can afford increases in public sector pay in return for restructuring, better productivity and the application of the strategic management initiative over a period of time.  It was on that basis I was happy to support Partnership 2000 and recommend it to this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that this debate was so hard fought for.  Since the commission's report was published in November, the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip has been looking for time to debate this, and it has taken until now to get it.</P>
      <P>Much work has gone into the commission's report.  I congratulate my party colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, on her policy document.  I also congratulate all those who participated in bringing forward the reports.</P>
      <P>This Government is very much inclined towards commissioning reports and involving consultants.  I tabled many questions on consultancies, and the amount of money that has been spent on consultancies during the lifetime of the present Government is shocking.  I would be happier if those funds were directed into much needed services for the disabled.</P>
      <P>The Review Group on Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities has reported, and we now have 402 recommendations which have been hived off to another group for another report.  However, we have failed to put in place appropriate facilities or to remove the barriers against people with disabilities.  It is disappointing that so much money is being spent on reports and so little on providing the services required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the Eastern Health Board I congratulate all those involved in the delivery of <Col N="1222" /> services for people with disabilities.  It is only since I became involved in the Eastern Health Board that I have had a real appreciation and a proper understanding of the dedication and vocation of those who, either in a professional capacity or on a voluntary basis, participate in the provision of services for disabled people, particularly those who are more profoundly disabled. One can only admire them.</P>
    <P>It is frustrating to see the half-hearted efforts that are made to train disabled people.  Having undergone training for several years and worked in a sheltered environment the State fails to follow through, and they are left to walk the plank, so to speak.  I appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary resources.  So far the Government has failed to do this.  I am tired of asking questions in the Dáil and getting nowhere.  What would speak volumes would be if the Government provided the necessary funding.  These are the final hours of this Dáil.  The election campaign has already begun.  If there is a real desire to address this matter, it could be done as part of an election campaign.  However, I believe the Government will again fail miserably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not pretend to be fully <i>au fait</i> with how people with a disability feel, but I share some of the sense of alienation in this House that disabled people experience in the wider world in their efforts to achieve their full potential working within the system as it is.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party I am happy that, having been postponed twice, this debate is taking place.  Even as they listen to this debate, people outside this House must wonder what is to come after it.  I hope the Minister will be able to elaborate on that.  The recommendations in the report have been welcomed right across the various political parties.  However, that is only part of the work.  The main work has still to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the area of respite care policy that attention is lacking here, compared with other EU countries.  As this is May Day, I would remind the House that parents and others caring for people with disabilities are on their own and do not get the relief or time off that is a fundamental, long-held and hard fought for right for other workers. We need to catch up quickly with our neighbours in the EU in the context of that policy, because Ireland is very far behind other EU countries. People with disabilities are constantly asked to submit information for means testing and so on. I urge the Government to focus on need rather than means.  A man of 80 years of age who has been disabled all his life told me recently his disability allowance is being cut.  He has received the allowance since he was approximately 16 years of age and needs a carer now more than ever.  His allowance is being cut because he is selling land to purchase his county council house and as the money will go to the county council he will no longer qualify for disability allowance.  His carer will also be affected by this change.  This is an <Col N="1223" /> example of how the disabled can be messed around by the system.</P>
    <P>Lack of funding is not the entire problem. More understanding of the needs of people with disabilities is required.  There is no person with a disability on the interdepartmental task force on disabilities.  It comprises principal officers and assistant principal officers from various Departments and, while I am sure they are driven by high motives, they provide only second-hand information on disability.  People with disabilities should participate on that task force.</P>
    <P>Schoolchildren with disabilities are generally encouraged to take up positions in the Civil Service. Consequently, the majority of people with disabilities who are in the workplace are employed in the Civil Service.  Why has none of them risen through the ranks and become part of the task force on disability.  We must take immediate measures to ensure people with disabilities serve on the task force so it can benefit from first-hand information of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>During questions to the Taoiseach a few weeks ago we were told a sum of £15 million was being made available to supply computers to schools. Much of the debate focused on VAT on computers and the need to ensure all schools would benefit.  It was an oversight not to provide computers for those who simply want to communicate with others rather than for those who may want to secure a job in the IFSC or become computer programmers.  Basic needs, such as communication, should be considered when allocating the £15 million for the installation of computers in schools.  They should be addressed before the more general and luxurious needs of some of our educational institutions.</P>
    <P>Many public buildings have provided ramps, lifts and other facilities to enable people with disabilities gain access to them and great care was taken with historical buildings.  In future architects should place the needs of people with disabilities to the forefront when designing buildings. Ramps should be provided at the front door of the building, not at the back or side of it.  This would also benefit old people and those with a temporary disability, such as a broken leg.</P>
    <P>Funding for the provision of facilities for people with disabilities has lagged behind in terms of the priority given to other matters. People with disabilities have been left in the slow lane while those in the fast lane accelerate and celebrate because of the economic boom.  Alienation is not simply a matter of personal misery or grief, it is a social malaise.  Many other social problems are rooted in the sense of alienation and those with disabilities can speak in confidence about that feeling.  Funding must be provided to address the increasing divide between rich and poor.  The national strategy on poverty has found that people with disabilities are most likely to be hit by poverty.  This can be dealt with <Col N="1224" /> only through the equitable distribution of resources and funding.</P>
    <P>I compliment those with disabilities and people working with them, whether carers in the home or working in a voluntary or professional capacity with people with sensory or physical disabilities. They have the great quality of being able to do good work day in day out without seeking the type of adulation on which others might insist. They include people working in St. Michael's House, Rehab and various centres in my constituency of Dublin North in Skerries, Rush and Swords.  They do fantastic work and it is a pleasure to meet and talk to them.</P>
    <P>This debate should be the beginning and not merely an event recorded in the Official Report. It ought to be provocative and should result in the Minister giving a commitment as to what will happen, how the report's recommendations can be implemented and a timeframe for doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have been given time to contribute to this debate.  I join our spokesperson on disabilities, Deputy Mary Wallace, our spokesperson on equality and law reform, Deputy McDaid and our Whip, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in speaking on this matter.  Nine other members of my party wish to speak on it. Questions to the Minister for Finance extended beyond the time allocated for them and that time should be provided to allow my colleagues who wish to participate in this debate to do so either today or next week.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is one of the most significant documents concerning social issues which we will have to consider in this House for many years.  That is why Fianna Fáil has called for a full debate on that report since it was published last November.  I am glad that after many delays the Government agreed to hold this extremely limited debate.</P>
      <P>People with disabilities form one of the most marginalised and disadvantaged groups in society.  The are faced with inaccessible services, inflexible bureaucracies and general public ignorance which compounds their exclusion.  Study after study has shown that people with disabilities are dramatically more likely than others to be faced with unemployment, poverty and isolation. Education, transport, health and income support policies have failed to deal effectively with this situation.  Society suffers as a result, not only because we fail to vindicate the rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens, but also because we limit the diversity which informs who they are. However, there is hope.  From visits to different parts of the country I am continually struck by a range and vitality of achievements by people with disabilities and I am glad that so many of them have joined us here as have many of those who work so successfully with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to see successes like the ever expanding centres for independent living or the work of groups like the Irish Wheelchair Association, <Col N="1225" /> Cerebral Palsy Ireland without being struck by what can be achieved by people working to break down barriers faced by people with disabilities. Another example is the work of companies operating under the supported integrated employment initiative, for which I was proud to introduce funding when I was Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The overall message to us is clear.  While there are many examples of people with disabilities who develop their full potential and make an immense contribution, most of their achievements are made in spite of public policy rather than because of it.  The need to constructively address the issues of concern to people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates is one of the most important challenges facing society.  For public policy makers it poses the specific challenge of radically changing the way we deal with disability and putting it where it needs to be, at the top of our agenda.  Because we believe this challenge must be dealt with in a co-ordinated and comprehensive manner Fianna Fáil in Government supported the establishment of the commission, pursued it and was responsible for it.  When the commission's report was launched last November I welcomed it as a blueprint for achieving equality of respect and opportunity for people with disabilities.  I also said that the publication of the report would achieve little without real political commitment to turn its aspirations into concrete action.</P>
    <P>We must critically engage the issues raised by the Commission and face up to the idea that a fundamental change affecting every arm of public life is needed.  The change can come about only if decision makers at the highest level recognise their responsibilities and make a proactive contribution. Specific principles need to underline our actions and we must redirect public policy to make it empowering and focused on the individual. We must ensure that services are responsive and accessible and we must vindicate the right of people requiring significant care to appropriate services.  Perhaps the most critical element of this report is that disability must no longer be seen as solely a health issue.  It is a social issue which requires co-ordinated action and it must be permanently on the agenda of every Department and public body.</P>
    <P>Since becoming leader of my party I have sought to ensure that we make a real and constructive contribution on disability issues.  In addition to asking each member of our Front Bench to include disability in the issues with which they deal, I appointed a specific spokesperson to be responsible for co-ordinating and developing overall disability policy.  During the past two years, our spokespersons, Deputy McDaid and particularly Deputy Mary Wallace, have held more than 200 meetings with disability groups throughout the length and breadth of the country, and I commend her for her diligent work in this regard.  Questions on disability have been tabled to every member of the Government.  Disability <Col N="1226" /> issues have been raised by Fianna Fáil spokespersons during committee meetings, discussions on legislation, Adjournment debates and Private Members' Business ensuring that the issue has been addressed during the life of this Government more than it has been since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I am proud that the first legislation to enact one of the commission's recommendations was Fianna Fáil's Bill on disabled voters passed in December through the work of Deputy Mary Wallace.  We are fully committed to ensuring that people with disabilities can play a full role in political life.  I am pleased to announce that Fianna Fáil has consultations on its positive action programme. This aims to promote participation by people with disabilities at all levels of the party's activities, including representation, and to ensure that issues relevant to all people concerned are at the core of our policy discussions inside and outside this House.</P>
    <P>Early last year we published the most comprehensive policy document on disability ever produced by an Irish political party.  When I launched it I stressed we viewed it as a part of an ongoing process of consultation and dialogue.  We received many approaches from individuals and organisations to discuss it and they have made a valuable contribution to developing our thinking on a range of issues.  I thank all those who helped in any way in our ongoing preparations and with the finalisation of our document on disabilities.  I stress we are committed to maintaining and developing proactive dialogue into the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Council on People with Disabilities as it will play a vital role in the change of advocacy which will ensure that the views of all people actively concerned with disability are heard.  My party held a meeting with representatives of the council and we intend to continue those consultations on a regular basis. In addition to discussing the commission's report, we should also address the report of the review group on physical and sensory disabilities.  After significant and unsatisfactory delays in the Department of Health, that report was finally published before Christmas.  It deals with many important issues and deserves our full attention.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing us is to stop being observers of the process and to critically engage with the issues addressed by the commission.  In discussions in this House during the past few years the commission has been used as an all purpose excuse for not addressing a range of disability issues.  The report has been passed to another committee and the standard reply from Departments to questions on disability is they are awaiting the report of the new committee before considering action.  The net effect is that most Departments have failed to undertake even the most obvious and widely needed initiatives.  The need for comprehensive action does not obstruct the fact that much of what needs to be done is obvious to all and there is no reason to delay in taking action.  Failure to provide significant funding <Col N="1227" /> for implementing the commission's proposals has caused justifiable outrage inside and outside this House.  We must all demonstrate our willingness to act on the agenda which both the Commission and the review group have set up. Because of this, my party if returned to Government will put in place a funding framework for both reports and will commence the allocation of this funding in the budget later this year.</P>
    <P>On the submission by the Centre for Independent Living for setting up an independent living fund, I have discussed this at length with my front bench colleagues, including our Finance spokesperson, Deputy McCreevy, and our Equality spokesperson, Deputy McDaid.  We have reached agreement on the issue and will include it in our election proposals.</P>
    <P>No matter how many reports are produced by committees of civil servants or outside management groups, the bottom line is that the Government will take decisions that matter.  Political commitment will decide whether the aspirations of the Commission and all those concerned with disabilities are fulfilled.  For those who did not already appreciate this, the Commission has reinforced the point that radical action is needed and must touch every arm of Government.  The only way this action will be taken is if disability becomes central to what we do in this House and in the broader political process.</P>
    <P>Through its wide-ranging and inclusive consultation process, its extensive research and the commitment of its members, the Commission has produced an impressive blueprint on equality.  I congratulate its members for their work and support the report.  I hope Deputies will use the opportunity of this debate to show that we are all committed to showing the necessary political will to realise the Commission's objectives.  Some ten of my colleagues remain to contribute but I do not know if they will have the necessary time in which to do so.  I am glad we have had an opportunity to debate this report and to display my party's total commitment to it.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the number of Government Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  As my party leader indicated, we have quite a number of speakers who wish to contribute from this side of the House.  Unfortunately, the Government seems embarrassed and is putting in speakers at the end of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an aversion to the words &ldquo;mentally handicapped&rdquo; in the context in which they are generally used.  This description has too often been applied to a range of conditions which include, for instance, cerebral palsy.  Victims of cerebral palsy are inflicted with severe physical disabilities which include lack of co-ordination, frequent spasms and a marked inability to communicate in a normal manner.  Not many years ago such people would have been incarcerated for life in what were then known as lunatic asylums, <Col N="1228" /> in spite of the fact that there was no mental disability involved.</P>
    <P>This fact was dramatically highlighted in the cases of two of our most celebrated writers, the legendary Christy Browne, author of &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;, and the award winning Christopher Nolan. The film producer, Noel Pearson, won two Oscars with &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo; and also produced another important film, &ldquo;Frankie Starlight&rdquo;, highlighting the disadvantages for people of small stature.  As a medical practitioner, I was embarrassed, having seen that moving production, at my lack of knowledge of the disadvantages that such people encounter.</P>
    <P>Both Christy Brown and Christopher Nolan had cerebral palsy and both had remarkable mothers who showed great love and extraordinary patience.  These women observed a spark of genius in their sons and ensured, with a devotion only a mother could achieve, that their genius would find full expression.  That is all any of these people are looking for &mdash; the right to equality and the right to full expression.  The average onlooker watching these young men growing up, would have regarded them as being mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Too many of us have been handicapped by our blindness to the real plight of the disabled.  It is not that we lack compassion.  Indeed, Irish people as individuals are among the most generous in the world in subscribing to every good cause under the sun.  However, when we dig deep into our pockets at the church gates or elsewhere, perhaps we assume this or that group have been taken care of for another year by voluntary subscriptions and whatever grants the State allows.</P>
    <P>It is not that simple.  Unfortunately, ours is a small country and the provision of extra resources is always a major problem.  It is cynical, when in Opposition, to demand large amounts of money for just about everything.  All parties have been guilty in that respect.  This is supposed to be good politics but it is high time we all acknowledged that it is not.  Even if we could pluck a further £100 million out of the hat tomorrow, it would not guarantee that the problems we are discussing today could be solved to any great extent.  We must establish our priorities and then do our best to ensure value for money with whatever expenditure we can afford.</P>
    <P>The Constitution charges us with the responsibility of cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  If there is to be discrimination, however, it should be in favour of, rather than against, the disabled.  I doubt whether many of us who are blessed with good health and all our faculties would object to that.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important debate but the delay of six months in discussing the report is indicative of the lack of concern this Government has about disability issues.  The time allowed for the debate is a fraction of that allocated to other matters. The only reason this debate is being held today is Fianna Fáil has steadfastly maintained political pressure on the Government.  The Government's <Col N="1229" /> indifference to disability is symptomatic of a wider societal malaise.  This makes its lack of leadership all the more serious.</P>
    <P>People in general, and that includes most people in politics, have a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude to disability.  People with disability are seen as a separate group.  Reactions may vary from indifference to sympathy and support.  A sense of otherness, however, generally pervades the entire spectrum of opinion.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are not disabled should remember, and if necessary be reminded, that we are only temporarily able-bodied people.  We were all born disabled.  We are alive now by virtue of having had the benefit of a totally supportive and life-giving environment as infants.  In the course of our lives many of us will suffer from disability, if not permanently then certainly for a period.  A broken limb or a serious illness may give some of us a temporary insight into the reality of disability.  Most of us, however, not only recover, but forget as well.</P>
    <P>At the end of our lives most of us will become disabled.  We will again become dependent, lose our power to make decisions, lose our mobility and, in many cases, our dignity.  The disability brought with old age will vary in extent and duration but for most of us it is an inescapable fact. By then, it will be too late for us to address the issues in the Commission's report.</P>
    <P>Some people face disability not only at the beginning and end of their lives but for all or most of it as well.  Legislators are being asked to address the issues affecting them in their daily lives.  We should do so in the knowledge that their circumstances could at any time be our circumstances and almost inevitably will be at one time or another in our lives.  The report of the Commission is to be welcomed because it lays bare a stark reality.  We must now find the resources to implement it.  Fianna Fáil supports the report's call for an integrated approach to the issues surrounding disability.</P>
    <P>Disability is seen by this Government as a health issue.  The extreme reluctance of the Minister for Education to address her share of the agenda and the foot dragging by the Minister for Social Welfare in relation to taking over responsibility for disability payments from the health boards is evidence of this.  Long-term solutions must begin with the education system.</P>

We should be concerned about this issue.  Five or six years ago this House was completely inaccessible for wheelchair users.  A parking bay and ramp have since been provided, but Members obstruct them almost on a daily basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tom Kitt and I visited Mr. Danny McNamee at Full Sutton Prison on 21 April last with the full co-operation of the Danny McNamee support group.  This is one of the most serious miscarriages of justice among a litany of such miscarriages, including the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire cases.  This case must be seen on the same level as the Maguire case and others.</P>
      <P>Mr. Danny McNamee is an exceptional risk category A prisoner.  The other two elements under this category are standard risk and high risk.  Mr. Danny McNamee has been transferred from prison to prison, including Brixton, Parkhurst, Whitemoor, Belmarsh and now Full Sutton. He has spent ten years as an exceptional risk category A prisoner, although the average is four years under this heading.  He is being held in cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions in a special security unit which denies remand prisoners the right to a fair trial and is a violation of the United Kingdom's obligation under international treaties.</P>
      <P>The most serious aspect of this case is that he was originally charged with conspiring to cause explosions within the United Kingdom from January 1983 to January 1984.  However, ten days before his trial, the conspiracy charge was pushed back to 1982, which would include the Hyde Park bombing.  When the prosecution case concluded, it was found that he could not have been conspiring to cause explosions within the United Kingdom because at the time he was living in the North of Ireland.  The charge was amended to suggest that he was conspiring within the United Kingdom or elsewhere to cause a conspiracy within the United Kingdom or elsewhere from 1982 to 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> His appeal for re-categorisation came before a committee of the British prison services recently and I am anxious to know if he has been re-categorised. His case in relation to the possibility of another appeal is before the criminal case review committee, which replaced the system of appeals to the British Home Secretary at the end of March.  The McNamee case must be given priority.</P>
    <P>Another serious element in this case is that in 1991 Mr. Dessie Ellis was extradited from Ireland to Britain to stand trial as an IRA bomb-maker whose fingerprints covered the item in the Saicey Forest cache where one of Danny McNamee's prints was allegedly found.  Mr. Dessie Ellis is a self-confessed IRA member who served a ten year sentence in Ireland, having been found in possession of bomb making equipment, including identical home made circuit boards as in the caches.  Mr. Danny McNamee has always said he was not a member of the IRA and the IRA acknowledge that fact.</P>
    <P>A British jury acquitted Mr. Dessie Ellis on the basis that evidence from the caches had already been used to imprison him in Ireland in 1981 and that he had already served his sentence.  He states he made the items which Danny McNamee was accused of making and all the forensic evidence supports this.  Documents have been discovered which prove that the Crown knew of Dessie Ellis's existence and that the evidence pointed to him four years before Danny McNamee's arrest. It had matched prints in the arms caches to Dessie Ellis.  In clear breach of its legal responsibilities, it deliberately did not disclose this to Danny McNamee's defence at the 1987 trial or the original appeal in 1991.  Had the jury at Danny McNamee's trial been aware that the police and the prosecution knew of the identity, background and evidence pointing to the probable manufacture of the devices which he stood accused of making, it is likely they would have taken a different view of the evidence in this case. It is clear that the Crown prosecution was guilty of nondisclosure, which is now the central focus point of his new application for an appeal.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to contact its British counterpart to protest in the strongest possible terms about the imprisonment and mistreatment of Danny McNamee under British law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Tánaiste, I welcome this opportunity to make a statement on the case of Mr. Danny McNamee who was convicted of explosive charges in connection with the Hyde Park bombings in London in 1982 and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.  For ten of these years, Mr. McNamee has been imprisoned in a special secure unit and is classified as an exceptional escape risk prisoner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House that the Tánaiste is fully aware of Mr. McNamee's situation and of the <Col N="1232" /> concerns expressed about the possibility of a wrongful conviction in this case.  On his instructions, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in London have closely monitored the case for a number of years.  The House will be aware of the Government's general position with regard to the humanitarian aspects of the treatment of republican prisoners in Britain.  In our representations to the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and at other ministerial meetings, we have consistently emphasised the need for prisoners to be treated in a humane manner.</P>
    <P>We have also expressed particular concern to those authorities about the impact on the health and mental welfare of prisoners of the very restrictive regime operating in the special secure units in which prisoners categorised as exceptional risk, such as Mr. McNamee, are held.  Our concern in the case of Mr. McNamee is heightened by the fact that he has spent ten years in special secure units despite a recommendation by the former British Chief Medical Officer, Sir Donald Acheson, that the time spent in them should be limited.</P>
    <P>Several consular visits have been made to Republican prisoners by officials of the Embassy in London over the past year or so.  On the Tánaiste's instructions, a further round of visits will be made to these prisoners, including Mr. McNamee, next week.  Additional visits have been made to individual prisoners as necessary since last November.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is aware, of course, that many Members of this House, including Deputy Andrews, as well as members of the Seanad have taken a particular interest in Mr. McNamee's case and have visited him in prison in Britain.  Following a visit in March last by members of the Labour Party, the Tánaiste was fully briefed by my colleague, Deputy Joe Costello, on his visit to Mr. McNamee and his subsequent discussion of his case with Mr. McNamee's solicitor, Ms Gareth Peirce.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has also been briefed on concerns about the case as detailed by a member of Mr. McNamee's family and one of his supporters at the special meeting of the Northern Ireland Sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on 12 March last and is aware of the resolution adopted by that sub-committee. On the Tánaiste's instructions, the Embassy in London arranged for a delegation from the sub-committee to visit Mr. McNamee on 26 March 1997 and to examine the conditions prevailing in the special secure unit in which he is held.  The Tánaiste has since received a copy of the subcommittee's report of its visits and this has formed part of our most recent representations in Mr. McNamee's case to the appropriate British authorities.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the concerns expressed both by his legal representative and others about Mr. McNamee's health and mental welfare, the <Col N="1233" /> Tánaiste instructed the Embassy in London to raise Mr. McNamee's case again urgently with the appropriate British authorities on 20 March.  The Embassy requested that Mr. McNamee be removed immediately from the special secure unit in which he was being held in view of the deterioration in his health.  They also asked that the Home Office expedite the consideration of the submission made in 1994 in relation to a referral of Mr. McNamee's case to the Court of Appeal and complete it before the Criminal Cases Review Commission was to be established at the end of March.  In its representations to the Home Office, the Embassy drew attention to the time which had elapsed since this submission was made and the humanitarian dimension.  The Embassy also renewed the request for Mr. McNamee to be transferred to Northern Ireland for accumulated visits as he has sought.  In response, the Embassy was advised that the British authorities were doing their best to have a submission ready for the Home Secretary before 31 March.  They also indicated that if this deadline was not met, it was very likely that Mr. McNamee's case, with a number of other particularly sensitive cases, would be flagged for the urgent consideration of the Criminal Cases Review Commission.  Assurances were also provided that renewed concerns about Mr. McNamee's health would be duly taken into account and that his transfer request was under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that while it is essentially for the prisoner's legal representative to pursue the matter of his appeal, nonetheless the Tánaiste has instructed our Embassy in London to ensure that the particular urgency of Mr. McNamee's case continues to be impressed upon the Criminal Cases Review Commission through the appropriate channels.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Tánaiste is fully aware of Mr. McNamee's appeal for reclassification and that it is currently under consideration in the Prison Service.  On the Tánaiste's instructions, the Embassy in London contacted Mr. McNamee's legal representative on the issue last week and she briefed them on her approach to the case for reclassification and copied them her representation in relation to Mr. McNamee's appeal.  She advised them that she has incorporated a strong medical argument in her representation to the Prison Service.  While I am not in a position to say when a formal decision on the question of Mr. McNamee's classification will be taken, I understand it will be in the very near future.  As I have made clear, we would welcome a positive decision which would result in Mr. McNamee's removal from the special secure unit. Our Embassy in London is maintaining close contact with the British authorities on the matter.</P>
    <P>Pending the decision regarding classification, the Embassy has again made representations on Mr. McNamee's behalf to the British Prison Service further to the approaches they made towards the end of March which I have already detailed. In our most recent contact, we again raised the <Col N="1234" /> possibility of Mr. McNamee being transferred to Northern Ireland to avail of accumulated visits.  I understand that the current position on Mr. McNamee's request for transfer is that it has been submitted to the relevent Home Office Minister but no decision was arrived at before the British general election.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy and the House that we will continue to monitor this case very closely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the issue of stage two of the Bailieborough regional water supply scheme because I am seriously concerned at the delay in its progress.</P>
      <P>This scheme will serve Virginia, County Cavan, and the rural area between Bailieborough, County Cavan and Virginia.  In early February 1995, Cavan County Council submitted the contract documents and drawings, with the certificate of planning, to the Minister for his approval.  In the meantime, I have raised this matter with the Minister in written representations and by way of parliamentary questions on a number of occasions.  I asked the Minister to approve the contract documents and allow the scheme to proceed to the next stage.  Unfortunately, the response has been practically the same from July 1995 to my most recent parliamentary question. The Minister invariably states that the contract documents have been submitted to his Depart-1995 to my most recent parliamentary question. The Minister invariably states that the contract documents have been submitted to his Department but, in view of the high level of commitments under the water and sewerage programmes, he cannot say when it may be possible to approve those contract documents.</P>
      <P>Serious problems exist in Virginia, where the public water scheme is totally inadequate and insufficient to meet the needs of the area from a domestic, business, agricultural or tourism point of view.  Virginia is a fast growing town and the present inadequate water supply will hinder further development in that town and its environs.  For some time, the inadequacy of the present water scheme has created severe problems for local householders, hoteliers, publicans, local industry and people running business premises.</P>
      <P>There are also difficulties for many people living in the rural area between Bailieborough and Virginia who wish to avail, primarily through group schemes, of the second stage of the regional water supply scheme, and there is a demand for such connections from both householders and farmers.  The people living in that rural area also deserve an adequate water supply.</P>
      <P>After a long struggle, the construction of a new sewerage scheme in Virginia has commenced and it would be appropriate, from several points of view, to have the water supply scheme under way at the same time.</P>

    <P>Access to Dublin from Virginia has been made easier in recent years by the construction of the Clonee by-pass.  Many people commute to work <Col N="1235" /> daily from Virginia to Dublin as it is a very attractive area in which to live.  The town has many fine facilities and the area is richly endowed with beautiful scenery, waterways and many other natural resources.  Obviously, there are further opportunities for this town to grow, but the lack of a proper water supply will hinder development in the short term.</P>
    <P>A number of factories in the locality provide valuable employment and they should be able to avail of a proper public water supply, which is not available at present.  The lack of an adequate public water supply causes particular difficulties for one manufacturing firm in the town which provides valuable employment for more than 80 people.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have the contract documents approved without further delay and the tender process commenced as a matter of urgency.  Understandably, the people of Virginia, its catchment area and the people living in that large rural area between Bailieborough and Virginia are demanding progress on this scheme. They realise the importance of the construction of this scheme in the prevention of any hindrance to the further development of agriculture, industry and tourism in that general area and the need to provide people with a proper water supply for domestic purposes.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will be able to respond positively to this justified case which I have made in this House on numerous occasions by way of parliamentary question and through written representations to the Minister.</P>

      <P>My colleague the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, regrets he is unable to be present to reply to this debate and he has asked me to reply on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the need to extend the Bailieboro regional water supply scheme to serve Virginia and, generally, to continue the considerable progress which has been made in recent years with the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure in County Cavan.  Two major water supply schemes have been completed: stage 1 of the Bailieboro scheme, at a cost of £6.302 million and the Belturbet scheme at a cost of just over £2 million.  A sewerage scheme at Bailieboro has been completed at a cost of more than £1 million.</P>
      <P>Three major schemes are under construction in County Cavan: the Ballyjamesduff regional water supply scheme at an estimated cost of £7.2 million; the Ballyconnell sewerage scheme which is estimated to cost £1.3 million and Virginia sewerage scheme at an estimated cost of £1.8 million. These schemes are being co-financed from a number of sources, including the Cohesion Fund and the INTERREG II Programme, as well as directly by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stage 2 of the Bailieboro regional water supply scheme is designed to serve a region in the eastern <Col N="1236" /> part of County Cavan, extending from near Shercock in the north of the county to Virginia and the area surrounding Lough Ramor in the south.  The water supply to Virginia is sourced from Cuilcagh Lough.  The proposed scheme will provide for transferring treated water from the new treatment plant at Bailieboro to Virginia and its environs, serving a projected population of 5,400 persons.  It is estimated the scheme will cost approximately £2.6 million and it is at contract document stage.  However, in view of the high level of commitments under the water and sewerage services capital works programme for 1997, including the commitments in County Cavan which I have already mentioned, it is not possible to say when it may be possible to advance the Bailieboro proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter.  I wish to briefly outline the history of the application for repairs to St. Barbara's national school, Castlerock, County Sligo, which is a one teacher school.  In a reply to earlier representations I made on this subject, the Minister stated that because of the backlog of outstanding projects which accumulated during the period 1988-92 she was unable to fund this deserving project.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to three matters.  First, the application for minor repairs to the school in question dates to 1992, not 1988.  Second, a leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 1 April last stated that moneys available for school building projects had not been taken up by the Department of Education.  Will the Minister comment on why?  Third, seminars have been held in County Galway for several years in respect of one teacher schools and the need to approve accommodation in such schools.  The Minister gave a commitment to take positive action.  I would like to see her words transformed into action.</P>
      <P>As already stated, the history of the application for repairs to St. Barbara's national school dates back to 1992.  That application sought improvements to the heating system in the main classroom and the porch, the replacement of a number of windows in these areas, repairs to the water supply in the sink area and the provision of heating in the outdoor toilets.  Later in 1992, the Office of Public Works visited the school and drew up a comprehensive plan in respect of it. Office of Public Works officials stated the Department of Education would not recommend upgrading any outdoor toilets and this policy had been in place for some time.  The board of management disagrees with this policy as it would involve a substantial cost to transfer indoors the toilets which are maintained at a very high standard. All that is required is the provision of heating in these toilets.  The board of management maintains this ambitious plan should be accommodated because of the low cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1996, a new plan was drawn up <Col N="1237" /> by the Office of Public Works and was submitted to the building section in Tullamore in February 1997.  An officer from the building section examined the school in March and has since submitted his report to head office.  The school is situated in a disadvantaged area at the foot of the beautiful Ox Mountains.  I invite officials of the Department of Education to return to inspect the outdoor toilets.  The school has been visited annually, without prior notice, by officials of the North Western Health Board who stated that it has the best maintained toilets in the country.  Will the Minister make money available for the repairs to which I referred?</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education. I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining the current position regarding Castlerock national school, Aclare, County Sligo.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education is aware this school currently has a staffing level of one principal teacher and had an enrolment of 18 pupils as of 30 September, 1996.  There are three rooms in the current school building.  In September 1996, the Department of Education received an application from the school manager for grant assistance towards the cost of major refurbishment works to the school building.  In November 1996, the Department advised the school manager that it was unable to provide funding for the proposed works due to financial constraints and the project would be considered again in the light of future allocations of capital funding.</P>
      <P>To assess the extent of the proposed refurbishment the Department sought reports on the matter from the local Office of Public Works and the school's inspector.  These reports are now to hand and indicate the works in question will require considerable capital funding.  The House will appreciate that a decision on the provision of funding for the proposed works must be taken in the light of existing contractual commitments and the capital funding available this year.  At present, due to the level of contractual commitments on primary school building projects, there are not enough funds available to provide grant aid towards projects of this nature.  The Minister's current priority is to reduce the backlog of urgent major school projects.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Education took office in 1993, she was faced with a backlog of 300 urgent major school projects.  These projects accumulated because of the substantial reductions in the capital funding of primary schools in the period 1988-92.  In the last four years, the Government has increased the capital funding of schools significantly and substantial progress has been made in reducing the backlog.  I accept fully that more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the urgent projects in the backlog, it is not possible to provide grant aid towards all deserving projects at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> However, I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to progress the proposed project as quickly as possible and I thank him again for the opportunity to outline the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that, once again, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan is wheeled in to impart what will obviously be bad news.  I have never succeeded in getting the Minister to attend and hear any of the very important issues I have raised from time to time.  It appears that, whenever there is bad news to be imparted, the Minister of State must take the rap &mdash; he was good at it in his younger days &mdash; and appears to have to take it now.  Yet, whenever there are protocols or anything good to be said or announced, the Minister is always out front.  I am not being facetious.</P>
      <P>Our Government sought £73 million in matching EU funds for milk, beef, cereals and sugar beet producers.  Some £32 million in matching funds were sought for the beef industry to help beef farmers literally on their knees, £17 million was conceded by the Government after considerable argument.  The question being asked by all farmers, particularly hard-pressed beef farmers, is how much of those £17 million will reach beef finishers.</P>
      <P>I recollect well that, when my colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, was in office farmers were paid £1.06 per lb whereas today they are offered a mere 76p per lb, 30p of a loss.  Even then the Minister for Agriculture accepted that it took at least £1 per lb to break even.  Beef farmers are going out of business and farmers who invested considerable sums in their farming enterprise, were never as badly off.</P>
      <P>At a meeting held recently at the Red Cow one very irate farmer told the Minister that factories would take the £17 million if they could lay their hands on them, a contention repeated many times at that meeting.  This week the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> followed up with a cartoon portraying four factory owners sitting down wondering how they would divide up Ivan's £17 million.  As soon as this came to the fore, factories began to talk down prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When export refunds were again reduced in January the Minister said he would make factories pay a higher price and would set up an interdepartmental committee to ensure factories pay a reasonable price but, to date, nothing has happened. Will the Minister of State say whether that interdepartmental committee was established and whether the Minister ever tried to establish true <Col N="1239" /> returns from factories or the prices they are paying?</P>
    <P>I want an assurance from the Minister that beef farmers will receive these funds, that heifers and bullocks will be eligible at marts, which is where the ordinary farmer sells his cattle.  Of course, the key factor in all this is the opening of third country markets.  I am anxious to know the position in relation to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not attempt to inform us of moneys he received last year, in 1995 or at the end of 1994, saying they will help in the present crisis: that was for another day and another crisis.</P>

      <P>The £17 million compensation package announced during Question Time on Wednesday last led me to question the Minister whether he had not reflected on the possibility that this money would be gobbled up by the factories and not reach those most in need, namely, beef farmers.  I pressed him to do something about paying these funds for eligible cattle being sold at marts.  He refused.  On Tuesday last I received a reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister again refused yet yesterday a partial concession for heifers was announced.  I appeal to the Minister and his Minister of State not to discriminate on gender grounds in respect of cattle going through marts, to allow payment on bullocks and heifers, so that our hard pressed taxpayers, forking out this £17 million, can be assured it will reach its rightful beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to set out the background to the £17 million compensation package and state how it is proposed to disburse it to ensure it is targeted at those beef producers most deserving of aid.</P>
      <P>This is a nationally-funded compensation package arising from the revaluation of the Irish agricultural conversion rate.  Last week the Minister informed the House that this was the first occasion on which, since we joined the European Union, our taxpayers would be financing a scheme to help a very vulnerable sector of our agricultural industry.  This is a clear recognition by the Government of the seriousness with which it takes the current plight of beef producers and its efforts to ensure their future viability is underpinned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not need to remind the House that the current income difficulties in this sector arose from one of the worst public health scares ever encountered in the food sector.  The fall in beef consumption as a consequence of that scare created major problems in the European Union beef market mainly because of the introduction of a GATT ceiling on subsidised beef exports from the European Union.  Everything possible has been done to limit the damage through the various market support measures and compensatory packages we have negotiated at EU level. Unfortunately, the strengthening pound, a direct reflection of a buoyant economy, has had a downside <Col N="1240" /> and led to a reduction in agricultural support prices.  Since November last the pound has been revalued on three occasions: when these revaluations are combined with cuts in export refunds the total reduction amounts to some 29 per cent or approximately 18p per lb on the average steer since November last.</P>
    <P>With regard to reductions in cattle prices arising from the revaluation of the Irish agricultural conversion rate, the EU has already agreed to provide compensation to beef producers amounting to £20 million for the revaluations on 11 November 1996 and 10 January 1997.  The Minister has already announced the arrangements for the payment of this aid.  An additional EU-funded compensation package amounting to £11 million to compensate for the most recent revaluation on 29 March has also been approved.  In addition, the Government is backing up these payments with a further £17 million from national resources.</P>
    <P>In his initial announcement of this package last week the Minister proposed that these funds be targeted at producers who sold cattle to meat export premises and local abattoirs between 1 April and 10 June next.  He has now decided to add a further category, by including heifers sold at marts in that period.  As in the case of all compensation packages agreed to date, our objective is to ensure that the payments go directly to those most affected, not to dealers and middle men. The ownership condition &mdash; which means that only producers who owned the animal on or before 1 April will be eligible &mdash; will ensure that genuine producers only will benefit.</P>
    <P>Factories also have their responsibilities: this package, with all previous and future ones, are for the benefit of producers who provide them with the raw material year in year out; they are not for adding further to factory profits by allowing prices to collapse by an equivalent amount.  Lack of competition in the marketplace, due to the absence of third country live trade, leaves producers very vulnerable to such an eventuality at present.  For many years we have listened to meat producers' complaints about the damage the trade was having on their efforts to develop a value-added beef industry.  They now have an opportunity of demonstrating they have the interests of the development of this industry at heart.</P>
    <P>Next week the Minister will travel to Egypt to attempt to persuade the authorities there to remove the ban on Irish cattle exports.  In recent weeks a technical delegation from Libya visited Ireland to see our controls and were impressed with measures we have in place.  It is hoped that these efforts will bear fruit and that the much required competition for cattle, sadly lacking from the marketplace for the past four months, will be evident again soon.</P>
    <P>Our efforts to reopen the other few remaining markets still closed for our beef exports are continuing. Despite the absence of these third country markets, the demand for Irish beef is still very strong.  Our traders should make every effort to <Col N="1241" /> regain our share of the EU market lost in the course of last year.  Given the relatively high prices for beef on these markets and the competitive advantages now enjoyed by Irish traders because of our low prices, there must be reasonable prospects that our share of these markets can be regained.  The Government is doing everything possible to ensure the future of the beef industry and protect producers from the worst effects of the difficulties on the market.</P>
    <P>The compensation packages agreed to date since the onset of the BSE crisis represent a total of £185 million.  Flexible intervention arrangements have been put in place and every effort is being made to restore export refunds to acceptable levels, but there are major obstacles in this area due to the Uruguay Round GATT limits agreed in 1994.  The price paid by the processor to the producer in a market economy should be <Col N="1242" /> a function of market forces and I hope these forces will prevail in the future.  Deputy Byrne, by his utterances this evening, shows how ignorant he is of the market conditions that prevail.</P>

    <P>The figures of cost provided for each year after 1997-98 represent the cost of each new increment of the proposed changes over and above the cost of the preceding year's phase.  These figures are, of course, provisional and subject to revision.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware Partnership 2000 states that &ldquo;The Government will introduce personal tax reductions to the cumulative value over the three years of £900 million on a full year cost basis.&rdquo;  The first steps towards implementing this undertaking were taken in this year's budget where the personal tax reductions introduced, including income tax levies and employees' PRSI, amounted to £393 million on a full year basis. Assuming the enactment of the changes announced in this year's budget, the further changes proposed by the Deputy for the three year's of Partnership 2000, that is up to 1999-2000, would cost an additional £1,125 million on a full year basis.  This would give a total of £1,518 million in personal tax and PRSI reductions over the period, compared with the £900 million committed in Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The significant improvements made over the last three budgets have been achieved through measures aimed towards reducing the average tax take rather than cutting tax rates.  These measures included increasing personal allowances and exemption limits, widening the standard band, introducing the £80 per week PRSI-free allowance and the 1 per cent reduction in both the standard income tax rate and the main rate of employees' PRSI which were introduced in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Continued progress is, of course, needed towards reducing the tax and PRSI burden, thereby improving the competitiveness of the economy.  There are, however, different views as to the form further reductions in taxation should take, and the groups towards whom relief should be targeted.  Significant reductions, especially in the top rate of income tax will focus the benefit primarily towards people with higher incomes.  A more balanced tax package, than that proposed by the Deputy, which focuses assistance towards those on lower to middle incomes is what is required.</P>

      <P>The flat rate of VAT for unregistered farmers was increased from 2.8 per cent to 3.3 per cent from 1 March 1997 at a cost of £9.3 million in 1997.  VAT law provides that the registered purchaser, usually the co-op or meat factory, must give the farmer a copy of the invoice showing separately the total price, the net purchase price and the flat rate addition.  The actual price, net of VAT, received for an animal depends, of course, on prevailing market conditions at the time.  If the Deputy has any reason to believe that in specific cases the <Col N="1246" /> proper procedures are not being applied he should advise the Revenue Commissioners so that any such case can be investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 16 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>As I have explained numerous times in the House, cross-Border workers are treated no differently for tax purposes than any other State resident.  I therefore can see no reason for devising proposals to improve their tax situation and thus give them preferential treatment over other Irish resident taxpayers.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the issues involved in the taxation of cross-Border workers were throughly investigated by an interdepartmental committee which I established in 1995.  This committee found that the treatment of cross-Border workers for the purposes of income tax if fair and reasonable <i>vis-à-vis</i> other Irish taxpayers.  Consequently, the committee felt that there is no justification for any special income tax treatment of these workers as compared to any other category of Irish resident taxpayers.</P>
      <P>However, the committee did make other recommendations, most notably to exempt cross-Border workers from health and employment and training levies.  As the Deputy is aware, I announced such an exemption in last year's budget and this was introduced in last year's Social Welfare Act.</P>
      <P>The committee also recommended that cross-Border workers should avail of the direct debit system as a means of paying their Irish Tax Liability and this now applies for the preliminary tax payment which was due on 1 November in 1996 and which will fall to be due on 1 November of subsequent years.  Full details of this system, including an explanatory leaflet are available from the Revenue Commissers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further recommendation of the committee was that there should be consultation between the Irish and UK revenue authorities on the scope of Articles 18, which is concerned with the taxation of governmental employees.  Discussions between the two authorities on the scope of Article 18 and whether it should be amended to make it clearer what categories of employment are covered have been in progress for some time and it is hoped, will be satisfactorily concluded shortly.  However, it should be noted that this possible amendment would cover only a small class of government employees and the position <Col N="1247" /> of cross-Border workers generally will not be affected by the outcome of the negotiations.  It is important also to add that the 1976 Irish-UK Double Taxation Agreement is a bilateral one and any changes must be agreed to by the UK Government.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons prosecuted for the sale of unstamped cigarettes in 1996; the number who were sentenced to prison; and whether he has satisfied himself with the enforcement of existing laws on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in 1996, 81 prosecutions were instituted against 61 persons who were detected selling unstamped cigarettes.  To date 31 of these cases have been heard in court resulting in the imposition of fines totalling £19,000.  So far in 1997 a further 104 prosecutions have been instituted.  As the current legislation governing the sale of unstamped cigarettes does not provide for the imposition of custodial sentences nobody has yet been sent to prison.</P>
      <P>As well as prosecutions for selling unstamped cigarettes a further 50 prosecutions were instituted in 1996 for smuggling cigarettes into the country.  To date in 1997, nine such prosecutions have been instituted.  In these cases 36 convictions have been secured resulting in the imposition of fines totalling £25,356 and jail sentences of one month in four cases or 50 hours community service in lieu, if offenders are regarded as suitable for carrying out such service.  These prosecutions are regarded as an important part of the overall enforcement effort aimed at the sources of tobacco products feeding the illicit street trade.  Tobacco smuggling is, of course, a European wide problem and with my agreement, Revenue have taken the issue up at that level with a view to having all aspects of the matter examined.  The EU Commission has, in fact, now agreed with member states to establish a high-level group for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past year, in particular, Customs, in collaboration with gardaí, have intensified efforts in enforcing the law in this area.  The large number of prosecutions secured, as I have already detailed, bears testimony to this effort.  From January 1993 to date, almost 35 million cigarettes and 7,974 kilos of other tobacco products were seized by Customs at import points and from distributors and street traders.  A special team dedicated to investigating smuggling and illegal selling is in operation in the customs investigation bureau.  In addition, the mobile task units in the Dublin area devote a considerable proportion of time and effort to combating this trade.  Therefore, I am satisfied with enforcement of the existing laws.  However, the Deputy will be aware that <Col N="1248" /> the Finance Bill currently before the House does contain specific provisions aimed at further enhancements in this area by increasing penalties for offences and strengthening enforcement powers.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the level of rapid economic growth may be masking the underlying problems of social exclusion, widening inequality and deterioration of social cohesion.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most effective way of reducing exclusion, poverty and inequality is through the creation of jobs.  As the high rate of economic growth &mdash; which is set to continue &mdash; is delivering record increases in employment, the problems of social exclusion and inequality are not getting worse, neither is social cohesion deteriorating.  On the contrary, I have every reason to believe significant improvements are taking place in each of the areas listed by the Deputy.  Considerable progress has been made in the past decade in the alleviation of poverty: a recent study shows that the depth of poverty has fallen considerably since the late 1980s; that there were real improvements in income for the poor, and that there was a very large fall in the average level of deprivation.</P>
      <P>Despite these improvements, however, this Government is fully aware that economic growth alone will not solve the problems of unemployment, poverty, and weak social networks which, together, comprise social exclusion.  The Government is also aware that there is a significant risk of increased social divisions emerging in the future unless effective action is taken to counter social exclusion.  It was for this reason that the representatives of those experiencing social exclusion were involved in the process which resulted in Partnership 2000 for Inclusion Employment and Competitiveness.  The partnership agreement states that social inclusion will not be pursued in any residual way but rather as an integral part of the partnership.  This is reflected in the commitment to spend £525 million on a full year cost basis on social inclusion measures over the period of the partnership.  Among these measures are increases in social welfare rates to the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare (CSW), the introduction of Family Income Supplement (FIS) on a net income basis and the adoption of a National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS).</P>
      <P>In the 1997 budget, I made substantial progress towards achieving the Partnership 2000 target in relation to the CSW rates and I also provided for FIS to be calculated on income net of PRSI and levies contributions.  Last week, the national anti-poverty strategy was launched.  This key strategy is designed to ensure that: &ldquo;the impact of very rapid economic social and demographic changes reduces social inequalities and social polarisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> It will mean ensuring that the benefits of sound economic management and growth are distributed fairly and, in particular, are used to tackle the underlying causes of poverty and social exclusion".  In order to underline the importance of NAPS, all three party leaders were present at the launch in Dublin Castle, and all three committed themselves to ensuring that it would be a success.</P>
    <P>The NAPS will be underpinned by a formidable institutional structure which will include a Cabinet sub-committee &mdash; of which I will be a member &mdash; an Interdepartmental Policy Committee &mdash; chaired jointly by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Social Welfare &mdash; and an SMI team based in the Department of Social Welfare. In addition, the Combat Poverty Agency will oversee the evaluation of the NAPS process; the National Economic and Social Forum will monitor the social inclusion elements of Partnership 2000, and funding will continue to be provided for national anti-poverty networks to enable them to be involved both in monitoring the progress of the strategy and in an ongoing consultation process.</P>
    <P>With all these arrangements in place there will be very little chance of existing problems of social exclusion, inequality and lack of social cohesion being masked, and every chance of continuing to make serious inroads into them consistently, year after year.  We can therefore, with a good deal of confidence, look forward to achieving the NAPS targets of having both the numbers of consistently poor and the rates of unemployment &mdash; both short-term and long-term &mdash; by the year 2007.</P>

      <P>For some time now my Department has been taking steps to ensure that all its computer applications and those in the Civil Service generally take account of the Year 2000 requirements.  In September 1996 my Department carried out an inventory of its own computer applications, in order to identify those which would require amendments to cater for the year 2000.  At present a detailed plan is being compiled to quantify both the cost and total effort required in ensuring that all information technology systems in the Department are Year 2000 compliant by January 1999 at the latest.</P>
      <P>In March last my Department also issued a circular to all Government Departments and offices, requiring them to (i) verify the year 2000 compliance status of their IT infrastructures and systems; (ii) draw up plans to migrate non-complaint systems to Year 2000 compliance; and (iii) procure only Year 2000 compliant products to prevent the introduction of problems in already compliant systems.  This circular also deals with the question of computer systems being able to handle the introduction of the euro.  Departments and Offices are required to submit the information sought in the circular by 1 July next, so that my Department can make an assessment of the overall work involved and advise Government of developments.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental special interest group on the Year 2000, under the chairmanship of my Department, was set up last year and this group meets monthly, to review and keep in touch with developments.  There are electronic mechanisms in place for the dissemination of Year 2000 information and my Department uses these to distribute to Departments-offices, Year 2000 compliance information, as it becomes available, for products that are widely used in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission made a brief presentation on new proposals for the taxation of energy products to ECOFIN on 17 March 1997.  This followed the failure of the EU members to reach agreement on earlier proposals for a carbon energy tax.  In summary, the Commission proposals involve increases in minimum rates for existing mineral oil excises and extending the scope of new excise. to include taxes on coal, turf, natural gas and electricity which are not currently subject to excise. Revised rates would apply from 1998, 2000 and 2002 if the proposals were accepted.  I have arranged to have a copy of the proposals placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The proposals are complex and have to be examined in detail, but very substantial issues arise.  They will need to be considered at EU working group level in relation to the certain technical aspects, and in particular questions arise as to how excises are intended to apply to the new product categories.  Further questions about the effect on inflation and on industrial competitiveness will also need to be considered.  I have already had representations from industry on this aspect of the proposal.  The Government will also need to consider whether environmental benefits may accrue from the proposal.</P>
      <P>These issues will be considered again at future meetings of ECOFIN.  However, I should point out that any decisions to implement proposals in this area can only be taken by a unanimous vote in the Council.  It is already clear that a number of member states are unable to support the proposals as presented.</P>

The vast majority of companies affected by the fall of the Irish pound against sterling are either exporting to the UK or competing with UK imports either in Ireland or in third country markets.

      <P>A key element in tax reform under successive Governments has been to broaden the tax base and to seek to redress the tendency for earned income to contribute an increasing share of total revenues. A number of allowances, reliefs and exemptions have been abolished, restricted or refocused across several tax heads.  These measures have enabled tax rates to be reduced and the proportion of earned income taken in tax to be lessened.</P>
      <P>There is further scope for widening the tax base and this is a matter which receives ongoing consideration each year prior to the budget by the tax strategy group.  Apart from widening the scope of certain taxes, there is also the option of restricting or eliminating tax reliefs and allowances to make more resources available for tax reductions.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a number of reliefs have been restricted in this year's Finance Bill.  I can assure the Deputy that proposals for further base broading will be considered by Government in the normal course in the run-up to the budget and announced in the budget, if agreed upon.</P>

      <P>I intend to reply to Questions Nos. 8 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full year cost of implementing the Labour <Col N="1254" /> Court recommendation on nurses' pay and conditions is estimated at £80 million.  The estimated cost in 1997 is £76 million.  An amount of £27 million was provided in the Abridged Estimates Volume to cover the cost of settlement of the nurses' claim on the basis of adherence to the accepted norm of 5.5 per cent under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> An additional amount of £49 million had to be provided therefore to cover the full 1997 cost of the nurses' award.</P>
    <P>The Government was determined that the nurses' pay award would not result in any further increase in public spending or borrowing.  The Government decided therefore to make reductions in spending to offset the full additional cost of £49 million.  This has been done by reducing the gross post-budget allocations for all Vote groups by 0.3 per cent.  The steps to effect those reductions have been identified and agreed by the Government.  The additional cost of the nurses' pay award and the agreed offsetting savings have been incorporated in the departmental allocations included in the Revised Estimates for Public Services.</P>
    <P>Savings of some £24 million in live register costs was the single biggest item in the package of measures agreed.  I can assure the Deputies that all of the measures involved real reductions in spending which will have a continuing effect. This will ensure that the additional cost of the nurses' pay award will be offset not just in 1997 but on a permanent basis.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the Community Transit System, which is the documentary system for controlling the movement across Union territory of third country goods which have not borne import charges and for controlling the movement of Union goods, such as agricultural produce entitled to an export subsidy, which are being exported from the Union under customs control.</P>
      <P>Concerns have been expressed at Union level about abuse of the system by criminals.  A committee of inquiry into the system established by the European Parliament has earlier this year recommended various measures and reforms. Following extensive consultations, the European Commission is now finalising a package of measures &mdash; which will take account of the Parliament's views &mdash; to improve the workings of the system and to curb abuse and fraud.  Its proposals may be presented in a report to the ECOFIN Council on 12 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community Transit System is currently paper-based.  The volume of transit transactions, at some 15 million per annum, means that the system is extremely unwieldly and criminal elements <Col N="1255" /> have exploited this.  There is general agreement at EU level that computerisation of the system would result in greater efficiency, and provide better control and fraud prevention.  It is accordingly intended to fully computerise the system over the next three years.</P>
    <P>Steps have already been taken to combat fraud in the system.  For example, an alert system, early warning system, has been in place since September 1992 to ensure that customs officers concerned are warned about movements of high risk goods, such as cigarettes; since February 1996, guarantees are required for movements of high risk goods, to cover the full amount of duties and taxes at risk; and since March 1996 provision exists whereby customs can require consignments to take a particular route through the Union, so that movements can be monitored.</P>
    <P>In its report to Council the Commission is expected to propose various further measures, including the electronic stamping of documents, so as to inhibit forgery, more stringent controls on access to the system, the extension of the early warning system, and the conclusion of memoranda of understanding between customs and the trade in order to promote greater co-operation between them in the fight against fraud.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that very few cases of transit fraud have been encountered by Irish customs.  This is because of the relatively low volume of transit operations commenced here and because there is little or no through traffic of third country goods through Ireland.  However, we have contributed fully to deliberations at Union level to improve the workings of the system and the Irish Customs Service collaborates closely with the other member states and with the Commission's anti-fraud unit, UCLAF, to combat abuse of the system.</P>

      <P>Shares and deposits held with credit unions are not subject to deposit interest retention tax.  However, dividends and interest paid by credit unions are chargeable to income tax in the hands of the recipients at the rates relevant to those recipients, including the higher rate where appropriate.  Individuals are obliged to report such income in their annual tax returns to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, sections 226 and 227 of the Finance Act, 1992 provide for the automatic return to the Revenue Commissioners of certain information from financial institutions where they pay deposit interest without deduction of tax.  In 1992 the Revenue Commissioners issued a statement of practice to the effect that returns by financial institutions need be made only of amounts paid <Col N="1256" /> or credited in excess of £500.  This means that credit unions are obliged to make a return to the Revenue Commissioners where the amount of deposit interest paid to the depositor in the year exceeds £500.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Finance Bill, which was passed yesterday by the House, contains no amendments in regard to credit unions. I am conscious of the very significant developments in this area and in particular the recent passage of the Credit Union Bill, 1997 which updates the legislative framework within which credit unions operate.  I have no proposals to change the tax regime applying to credit unions savings but, of course, it will be necessary to keep the position under review in the light of these developments.</P>

      <P>The commitments made in respect of Northern Ireland in A Government of Renewal should be read in their totality, and the Government has in all respects sought, and continues to seek, to fulfil them to the greatest extent possible, while recognising that on most of the broader issues progress can be made only in partnership with the British Government and, as appropriate, with the Northern Ireland political parties.</P>
      <P>In so far as paragraph 8 of that document is concerned, the Government has indeed given priority to the consolidation of progress towards peace and reconciliation in Ireland.  We have worked openly, and continue to work openly in the multi-party negotiations and elsewhere, with every political party which has demonstrated a commitment to the process.  The conditions on which we will resume dialogue with Sinn Fein have been made clear on many occasions.  Furthermore, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was enabled to complete the great bulk of its important work, both at political and at expert level.  All commissioned studies have been published, and the failure to record final agreement on a statement of political principles and realities was not the fault of the Government or, indeed, of the great majority of the parties attending the forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is self-evident that the situation in Northern Ireland has deteriorated since February 1996, above all because of the IRA's decision to end its ceasefire, despite the substantial progress recorded over the preceding period, including the publication of the Framework Document and the unprecedented visit of President Clinton.  Nevertheless, multi-party negotiations have since then <Col N="1257" /> been put in place and will resume on 3 June.  The Government will continue to work both for progress towards a political settlement and the restoration of an entirely peaceful environment, bearing in mind that the primary responsibility for the latter rests on those who use violence for political purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant personal tax reductions have been made over the last three budgets.  The cumulative full year cost of the personal tax reductions introduced, including income tax, levies and employees' PRSI, in the three budgets amounts to close to £750 million even after allowing for the phased standardrating of reliefs for mortgage interest and medical insurance premiums which was introduced in the 1994 budget.</P>
      <P>The last three budgets combined have seen the basic personal allowances increased by £550 single/£1,100 married, or by almost 23.5 per cent; the general exemption limits increased by £400 single/£800 married and those for the aged increased by £500 single/£1,000 married, or by around 11 per cent; the standard tax band widened by £1,700 single/£3,400 married, or by over 20 per cent and the income level at which the top rate of tax is payable rise by around 17 per cent in the case of a single PAYE worker and by 19 per cent in the case of a married couple, one earner, over this period.</P>
      <P>These increases compare very favourably with the estimated CPI increase of around 6.5 per cent over the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, in this year's budget both the standard income tax rate and the main rate of employees' PRSI were reduced by 1 per cent.  A new PRSI-free allowance was introduced in 1995 and increased to £80 per week for most <Col N="1258" /> employees in the 1996 budget.  In addition, the income tax age allowance to those aged 65 and over was doubled to £400 single/£800 married in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the best indicator of the progress made is to look at reductions in the average tax burden. For example, in 1994-95 the average tax burden, including employees' PRSI and levies, for a single employee, earning the average industrial wage, was 31.3 per cent.  In the tax year 1997-98, after allowing for wage increases, the tax burden is expected to fall to just below 27.2 per cent.  For a married couple on the same level of income, the tax burden is expected to fall from 23.4 per cent in 1994-95 to just below 20.1 per cent in 1997-98. This represents a significant real reduction in workers' tax and PRSI burden.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to achieving its policy objectives in a manner which takes account of evolving developments within the marketplace. The proposal in relation to the third banking force contained in the programme A Government of Renewal arose out of legitimate concerns about the level of competition within the Irish retail banking market and problems regarding access to finance and other banking services.  In this respect, much progress has been made by the Government over the past few years in opening up this market, in reducing barriers and in creating greater competition generally, in particular, through the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, the Central Bank Act, 1997 and the introduction of the Credit Union Bill into this House.</P>
      <P>Regarding the future structure of the State banks and the TSB, the dynamic and changing environment in the retail banking sector has obviously had a major impact on our consideration of the future of the State banking sector. There are a number of options available, each of which would have varying impacts on competition, employment and the delivery of cost-effective, customer-based services.  This complex matter is still under consideration and, at this time, no final decision has been reached on a preferred option.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 36 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy programme, A Government of Renewal, includes the following statement in relation to public spending:</P>
      <P>Over the period of this Programme it is intended that the growth of current supply services spending will be constrained to a maximum of 6 per cent, in nominal terms in 1995, and to an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms over the following two years of the Programme.</P>
      <P>The actual growth in gross current spending over the period of the programme compared with the target growth is as follows: in 1995 the target was for a 6 per cent nominal increase and the outturn was an increase of 5.6 per cent; in 1996 the target was for an increase of 2 per cent in real terms and the outturn was an increase of 4.4 per cent in real terms; in 1997 the target was for an increase of 2 per cent in real terms and the budget estimate provides for an increase of 4.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>The increases in spending in 1995 and 1996 were due mainly to exceptional and unavoidable factors such as the payment of equal treatment liabilities of £140 million in 1995 and the EU disallowances or beef fines and BSE related costs in 1996.  In 1997, increases in pay and social welfare account for 75 per cent approximately of the total increase in gross current spending.  Full details of the increase in spending in 1997 are given in the Revised Estimates for Public Services published on 26 March.</P>
      <P>Taking 1996 and 1997 together, the increase in gross current spending in real terms will exceed the target of an annual, average rate of 2 per cent for those years.  However, the 2 per cent spending target must be seen in the context of the overall commitment in the Government's programme to keep Government borrowing prudently below 3 per cent of GNP.  The overall level of Government borrowing is by far the most important budgetary target set in the Government programme. The Government has made certain that the increases in spending have not resulted in an increase in borrowing above its target levels.  The record shows that the Government has succeeded by a comfortable margin in meeting its borrowing target.  In this year's budget the general Government deficit is estimated at 1.5 per cent of GDP; in 1996, the general Government deficit was 1 per cent of GDP.  This budgetary performance stands comparison with any of our EU partners.</P>

      <P>My Department has no responsibility for the types of child-minding services referred to in the question and is not, therefore, in a position to provide detailed information on the likely weekly costs of such services.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of allowing tax relief for the cost of child-minding services I would again point out, as in previous replies to the Deputy, that the question of allowing tax relief on expenditure relating to child care services raises complex issues with very different views on the likely impact of such a measure.</P>
      <P>The Second Commission for the Status of Women in its report to Government in January 1993 considered the matter but did not recommend that tax relief for child care expenses be given to working parents.  The commission considered that it was preferable that any additional State assistance for child care facilities should be provided through increased investment in child care support and services rather than by providing tax relief to parents for work-related child care costs.  The NESC report, No. 1991 on women's participation in the Irish labour market reached the same broad conclusion.  The commission noted that tax relief would do nothing to increase the supply or quality of child care and would not improve the training or the supply of qualified child care workers.  Furthermore, it concluded that tax relief would be of little or no use to those with low or no income and that it would be of more benefit to the higher paid than low earners.</P>
      <P>In this context, I would also like to point out that, for example, it is tentatively estimated that if a tax allowance were introduced for the parents of children under five years to cover the cost of registered child care up to a maximum of £3,000 per annum, then the cost of the Exchequer would be up to £60 million if relief were granted at the taxpayer's full marginal rate.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce tax relief for child care expenses at this time.  As the Deputy is aware tax relief is but one of the methods by which assistance can be provided for children and may not, in fact, be the most appropriate method. The State already provides considerable assistance to parents, in particular through expenditure on child benefit, education and health services.  I will, of course, keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>The Revised Estimates for Public Services published on 26 March provide for an increase in gross non-capital supply services expenditure in 1997 of 7 per cent in nominal terms and 4.7 per cent in real terms over the adjusted 1996 provisional outturn. The 1996 outturn was adjusted to exclude £98 million in rate support grant funding which was taken off the 1997 allocation as part of the new local authority financing arrangements in order to give a proper basis for calculating the increase between the two years.</P>
      <P>While it is too early to give a definitive view on the likely 1997 outturn, I am confident that spending remains on target.  The trend in spending will be closely monitored throughout the year. The Government will seek to ensure that any overruns which emerge will be met from within the departmental allocations already agreed.  The Government's determination to ensure that spending remains on course this year is evidenced by the fact that it has agreed measures to offset the full additional £49 million cost of the nurses' pay deal.  The Government's position on other outstanding pay claims in the public service is that they should be settled within the cost parameters of the PCW for which provision is already included in this year's Estimates.</P>

      <P>In general, stamp duties are payable on documents e.g. deeds transferring property, share transfer forms, and <Col N="1262" /> policies of insurance are all liable to stamp duty. Stamp duties are also payable in respect of items such as credit cards and cash cards.</P>
      <P>In the case of a deed transferring a second hand house duty is charged on the price paid for that house.  If the house is transferred by way of gift duty is charged on the market value of the house.  New houses and apartments with a floor area of 125 square metres or less are exempt from stamp duty.  New houses and apartments with a floor area in excess of this are only subject to stamp duty on the greater of the site cost or one quarter of the combined site cost and building cost.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that from their knowledge no case has been tested before the Irish courts in relation to whether stamp duty should be charged on the market value or the site value of a house.</P>

      <Quest>the reason an elderly old age pensioner living in rented accommodation in a house owned by a landlord living abroad should have to collect tax on behalf of the State from the landlord's rental income; the reason notice of this is not given on the form for claiming tax relief on rent costs; if he will exclude old age pensioners from this task; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that section 25 of the Finance Act, 1969 provides that where rent is paid directly to a non-resident landlord, the person paying the rent must deduct tax at the standard rate and remit this to the Revenue Commissioners.  The obligation on a tenant to deduct and pay over this tax to Revenue arises only where the tenant pays the rent directly to the landlord.  Accordingly, the obligation does not arise where a tenant pays the rent directly <i>via</i> an agent.  In such circumstances, the obligation for collection of the tax rests with the agent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Form Rent 1 has been used by individuals aged 55 years or over to claim rent relief for rented accommodation.  Claims for rent relief by individuals aged under 55 years have been made on form Rent 2.  A new consolidated form &mdash; form Rent 1 <Col N="1263" />&mdash; which can be used by all individuals, irrespective of age, is currently being printed.  The new form contains an explanatory note which sets out the tax deduction requirement applying to tenants who pay rents directly to non-resident landlords. Supplies of the form will be available in tax offices shortly.</P>
    <P>The reason for the enactment of section 25 of the Finance Act, 1969 was to put in place a mechanism for the collection of tax on the rental income of non-resident landlords.  Given the non-resident status of such landlords, this mechanism is the most efficient way of collecting tax.  Accordingly, section 25 does not exempt any category of tenant, for example, old age pensioners, from the obligation to deduct the tax and pay it over to Revenue on behalf of the non-resident landlord.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The testing carried out in maternity hospitals and units to which the Deputy refers is, in fact, part of a programme of anonymous unlinked testing, which was recommended by the Surveillance Sub-Committee of the National AIDS Strategy Committee.  The report on the results of the first three years of this screening programme was disseminated in October 1996 to <Col N="1270" /> maternity hospitals, health boards and other relevant agencies.  The report covers a three year period from October 1992 to December 1995. Out of a total of 160,679 tests, 25 were confirmed HIV positive, giving a rate of 0.016 per cent, confirming a lower prevalence in this population group than in other European countries.</P>
      <P>Unlinked anonymous HIV testing programmes are used as a means of confirming that the information produced by voluntary testing is giving a true indication of the prevalence of the disease. Where such programmes have been introduced internationally they have been aimed at particular target populations such as women of child-bearing age and people who are attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics.  Unlinked screening of the population at large by the testing of all blood samples would be pointless, because they would not necessarily be from representative sections of the population and the costs involved would be considerable.</P>
      <P>It was stressed from the outset of this programme that screening would be anonymous and unlinked for reasons of confidentiality.  Testing is carried out on samples of excess blood, which are unlinked &mdash; anonymous &mdash; and forwarded to laboratories involved in the programme for analysis. For this reason, in the event of a positive test, neither the woman in question nor her general practitioner would be informed.</P>
      <P>Results of testing among various population groups will help to improve the information provided to service planners for HIV and AIDS and will allow interventions to be focused more effectively on various target groups.</P>
      <P>There is no ongoing routine linked testing for women in ante-natal clinics.  However, women wishing to have a HIV test are appropriately counselled and tested and results furnished to them, once again with appropriate counselling where necessary, in ante-natal clinics.  Because of recent advancements in the effectiveness of drug therapies for the treatment of HIV-AIDS and the resulting improvement in health outcomes for both mothers and their babies the National AIDS Strategy Committee and its sub-committees have been examining ways in which women who might have put themselves at risk of HIV infection could be encouraged to opt for an HIV test at an early stage.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The hospital, in common with all other agencies, was notified by the Department in December 1996 of the requirement to produce a service plan within budget for 1997.

      <P>On foot of this agreement, the hospital notified the Department that it had withdrawn its internal memorandum of 14 April 1997 and I have been advised that it will not form the basis of future service plan discussions.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Deputy will wish to know that within the past week a general manager has been seconded to the hospital from the health board and financial expertise has also been engaged to assist the hospital.</P>
      <P>I understand that the basis for service planning discussions will be as follows.  First, service levels for 1997 will be maintained at 1996 levels, in line with other hospitals.  Second, staffing levels will be maintained and all staff contracts will be fully honoured.  Finally, I have been assured that there will be full consultation with all appropriate key hospital staff in the development of a service plan for 1997 prior to its agreement by the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Products of biotechnology are regulated under two EU Directives, which have been transposed into Irish law by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment under S.I. No. 345 of 1994 (Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994).  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the nominated competent authority administering the regulations in Ireland.  The regulations provide, among other things, for various procedural matters in relation to the contained use, deliberate release, placing on the market of genetically modified organisms and notification for consent.  Those using genetically modified organisms, including animals, are obliged to notify the agency.  Users must ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment. A register is kept at the headquarters of the agency and is available for inspection by any person free of charge.  Proposals are now being developed by the European Commission to increase the effectiveness and transparency of the regulatory regime for genetically modified organisms. Ireland fully supports these proposals.</P>

    <P>The number of approved nursing posts in the mental handicap service is not currently available in my Department.  However, on 31 December 1995, the latest date for which information is available, there were 2,155 whole time equivalent mental handicap nurses employed in the mental handicap service provided by the health boards and mental handicap agencies directly funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the traditional model of pre-registration nursing education and training is in the process of being replaced by a new diploma-based programme.  The new programme is operated by the schools of nursing in association with third level institutes.  Student nurses who successfully complete the registration diploma programme will be awarded a diploma in nursing from the associated third level institute and will be eligible to register as a nurse with An Board Altranais.  The objective of the transition to the new model is to enhance nursing education and training to ensure the quality of nursing care in hospitals through the replacement of student nurses by qualified staff.  This is in line with key recommendations contained in the report The Future of Nurse Education and Training in Ireland published by An Board Altranais.</P>
    <P>The new nursing registration/diploma programme will be introduced for the first time in the mental handicap nursing sector in autumn 1997 through the COPE Foundation, Cork and St. Vincent's, Lisnagry, Limerick, which will each offer 20 places on the programme.  This represents an increase of nine training places.</P>
    <P>I am firmly committed to the registration/diploma programme and to providing the necessary resources for its full implementation in all nursing disciplines at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Manpower planning for both the needs of existing and developing services is an issue which is kept under constant review, through consultation with relevant professional bodies, health boards and other service providers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>Both the contained use of genetically modified organisms and the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, for purposes other than for placing on the market, are subject to control by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994.  Detailed notification requirements to the Environmental Protection Agency, which vary according to the type of application involved, are set out in these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency is the national competent authority under the above regulations for the purposes of the procedures laid down by Council Directive 20/220/EEC to regulate the placing on the market in EU member states of products containing or consisting of genetically modified organisms.  These procedures could involve direct notification to the Environmental Protection Agency by a person concerned of a proposal to market such products, or notification to the Environmental Protection Agency by the European Commission of an application made within the jurisdiction of another member state.  Member states are also informed of any <Col N="1301" /> decision within the EU to grant consent for the placing of a genetically modified product on the market; in Ireland such information is transmitted to the Department of the Environment and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>The current EU Directive and the national regulations are based on the fundamental objectives of protecting human health and the environment. These requirements can properly be served by a case by case assessment of particular notifications.  Ireland will support proposals now being developed by the European Commission to increase the effectiveness and transparency of the regulatory regime for genetically modified organisms.</P>

      <P>Returns from South Dublin County Council on the count of traveller families at 29 November 1996 indicate that 66 families were living on unofficial sites or on the roadside at that time; it is understood that the number has increased since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have approved 100 per cent capital funding in the sum of £4 million for the redevelopment-refurbishment of 98 bays on halting sites in the county, work on which is under way or about to commence.  I understand that the county council recently adopted the first phase of a five year traveller accommodation programme to provide <Col N="1302" /> further accommodation for travellers in its functional area.  Adequate capital funding is available to local authorities for the provision of traveller accommodation, and any applications from South Dublin County Council for funding for accommodation under the programme will be considered by my Department as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>Proposals for new and amending legislation providing for a range of measures to facilitate the implementation of the national strategy for traveller accommodation were recently approved by the Government and the Bill is now being drafted.  The proposals provide for requirements on local authorities to adopt and implement local five year accommodation programmes, and for improved powers for local authorities to control unauthorised temporary dwellings.</P>

This includes a new multi-annual programme of works by local authorities for the upgrading and take-over of group schemes where the trustees so wish, a new subsidy scheme towards the operational costs of group water schemes in supplying domestic water, and a scheme of grants for the provision of new or improved individual water supplies to houses.</P>

      <P>Contract documents for this scheme have been submitted to my Department but, given the high level of commitments under the water and sewerage programme, I cannot say when it may be possible to approve them.  In these circumstances, I do not consider that meeting a deputation at this time would serve any useful purpose.</P>

      <P>The distribution of fire appliances among its brigades is a matter for the fire authority, in this case Tipperary South Riding County Council.  A proposal from the council to invite tenders for a new fire appliance is at present under consideration in my Department having regard to the level of funding available for the fire services capital programme and the competing demands on these funds.  A decision will be conveyed to the council as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As already announced, responsibility for the administration of the group water and sewerage schemes programme has been devolved to the local authorities, subject to commitments on foot of approvals issued by my Department.  Where schemes have not yet been approved, such as the Ballymore group sewerage scheme, it will in future be a matter for the local authorities to decide grant applications.</P>

      <P>The board of management of the school in question was recently given approval for the provision of three general classrooms in prefabricated accommodation. Subsequently, a letter was received from the board of management requesting the Department to fund the cost of the prefabricated <Col N="1310" /> accommodation and the board of management would pay the balance in order to build a permanent building.  My Department then offered the school an all-inclusive grant in the amount of £50,300.  The school's design team is currently preparing documentation for submission to the Department, i.e. drawings, specifications, tender documentation etc.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers and of the further detailed documentation in relation to the children in question which has been submitted to my Department.  My Department's inspectorate is currently investigating this matter and I have asked that this investigation be completed as soon as possible.  I would point out that the areas in question are already included in the visiting teacher service.  In addition, there is a special resource teacher based in the Cavan area to cater for children with particular disabilities, including Down's syndrome, attending certain primary schools in the area.  Once my Department's inspectorate has completed its investigation, consideration will be given to possible responses to the needs of the children in question.</P>

      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers has requested grant-aid towards the provision of a general purposes room.  While I am anxious to extend the provision of this facility in primary schools, the pace at which this can be achieved will be dictated by the financial resources available and the priority must remain the provision of essential classroom accommodation and the elimination of sub-standard classroom accommodation.  Therefore, at present, my Department is not in a position to provide funds towards this project.  The Deputy will be aware that there were major cuts in the capital funding of primary schools in the 1988-92 period and, consequently, despite improvements in funding since 1993, there is a backlog of deserving projects.</P>

      <P>In these circumstances, the planning section of my Department wrote to the chairperson of the board of management in March 1997, suggesting that it would be appropriate, at this stage, for the board to consider the future of the school and the possibility of amalgamation with another school in the parish.  A response from the chairperson is awaited.  I should mention that an amalgamation would not take place without agreement of the board, parents and teachers.  In the event that the school continues to operate, its future viability will be kept under review by my Department in the light of the enrolment trends.</P>

      <P>The boys' primary school in question submitted an application to my Department in 1996 for a change of status under rule 33 of the rules for national schools with a view to enrolling boys at junior infants level.  Currently, junior infant boys are enrolled in the local convent school and transfer <Col N="1322" /> to the boys' school at first standard.  Having considered the matter in detail, my Department rejected the application, particularly in view of the effect such a decision would have on the enrolment and staffing of the convent school.  The board of management of the boys' school, having obtained legal advice in the matter, subsequently wrote to my Department requesting a review of the case.  The matter is currently under examination and a decision will be conveyed to the board as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Twelve new vehicles were purchased for the Ministerial fleet in 1995 at a cost of £453,600 and the estimated running cost of the fleet for that year, including petrol, service, maintenance and repairs, was approximately £200,000.  Thirteen new vehicles were purchased for the ministerial fleet in 1996 at a cost of £438,725. Some of the existing cars went into the spare fleet and some of the older cars were disposed of.  It is estimated that the running cost of the fleet in 1996, including petrol, service, maintenance and repairs, was approximately £225,000.  This figure does not include the cost of Garda drivers who work on a week-on week-off basis.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Government jet, this is a matter for the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>Section 59 of the policy document, A Government of Renewal, concerns the establishment of a committee to conduct a full review of all ministerial transport, having regard to issues of cost and cost-effectiveness, efficiency, security and flexibility.  The options put forward by this committee are still under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Justice I have brought forward a number of measures, legislative, administrative and financial, designed to deal in an integrated way with the problem posed to society by criminals.  The measures range from changes to our bail laws, <Col N="1331" /> additional prison places to additional powers for the Garda and the appointment of additional judges.  A summary of the measures is hereunder together with costings, where applicable.  In the case of some of the legislative and administrative changes, e.g. the appointment of additional judges and holding of extra courts, the costs are not separately identifiable but the impact on crime would be substantial through reductions in court delays.</P>
      <P Just="Center">List of measures brought forward by the Minister for Justice to address the crime problem.</P>
      <P>1.  Garda resources.</P>
      <P>(a)  The Minister for Justice has provided almost £460 million in her 1997 budget for the fight against crime, £441 million was provided in 1996.</P>
      <P>(b)  The strength of the force is 10,720 at 31 March 1997.  There are also 655 trainee gardaí in phases 1, 2 and 3 of the current training programme for gardaí.  These trainee gardaí are not included in the above figures.</P>
      <P>One of the main elements of the anti-crime measures which the Minister for Justice announced in July 1996 was the recruitment of 400 gardaí to the force over the period July 1996 to October 1997, in addition to the planned recruitment of 350 each year from 1995-97, bringing the total recruitment to 1,450 during this period.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice obtained Government approval on 19 March 1997 for her proposals to hold a new competition for the recruitment of gardaí over the three year period 1998-2000, inclusive.  The number to be recruited will be decided by the Government shortly and the first trainee gardaí from this recruitment campaign will commence training in January 1998.</P>
      <P>(c)  An IT plan for the Garda Síochána is being implemented at present at a cost of approximately £36 million.  On 20 September 1996 the Minister for Justice signed a contract valued at £10 million with Andersen Consulting in connection with the IT plan which will be developed jointly by the Garda's own IT staff and Andersen Consulting.</P>
      <P>(d)  An automated fingerprinting identification system was installed at Garda headquarters in January 1996.</P>
      <P>(e)  The Minister for Justice will provide a dedicated air support unit for the Garda Síochána. Contracts valued at £5.5 million were signed on 12 December 1996 for the purchase of a helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft for use by the Garda.  It is expected that both aircraft will have been delivered by June-July 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(f)  Extra Civilianisation: an additional 200 civilians will be recruited by June 1997 &mdash; 66 of <Col N="1332" /> this additional 200 have been recruited so far &mdash; so that an equivalent number of gardaí can be released from clerical-administrative-type duties to operational Garda duties.  In addition to the current recruitment process as above, there are already over 680 civilian staff working in clerical-administrative positions with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>2.  Reorganisation of the Garda Force.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has undertaken a fundamental restructuring of the Garda force with the appointment in January 1996 of assistant commissioners to head-up five new regions outside of Dublin, the Dublin metropolitan area was already in existence.</P>
    <P>This reorganisation of the force on a regional basis will provide for a much more co-ordinated and cohesive approach in tackling, on an operational basis, all facets of crime.</P>
    <P>3.  Review of efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved the carrying out of a full review of the efficiency of the Garda Síochána under the strategic management initiative. This review is nearing competion and following its consideration by Government, the Garda Commissioner will be obliged to implement the recommendations of this review.</P>
    <P>4.  Garda building programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has provided almost £9 million in her 1997 budget for the Garda building programme.</P>
    <P>5.  CCTV system as an aid to policing.</P>
    <P>A CCTV system was established in the Temple Bar area of Dublin on a pilot basis in October 1995 and will be extended to other areas.  On 17 December 1996 a contract for the Garda CCTV system for the O'Connell Street area of Dublin at an estimated cost of £700,000 was signed.  The system will become operational on a phased basis over the next month or so with phase 1 comprising CCTV for O'Connell Street itself having come on-stream on 11 April 1997.  The Minister for Justice has also sanctioned funding for a further two schemes located in Finglas and Tralee.  Up to 20 other locations throughout the country have expressed an interest in installing the Garda CCTV scheme.</P>
    <P>6.  Youth diversion schemes.</P>
    <P>The number of youth diversion schemes in operation in urban areas has been increased from four in 1994 to 11 at present, April 1997.  These schemes specifically target young people who are already showing signs of becoming criminals between the ages of eight and 16 years old.  The Minister has plans for the further expansion of this scheme.</P>
    <P>7.  Attacks against the elderly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Considerable resources are being concentrated on putting an end to such attacks and on bringing <Col N="1333" /> the perpetrators to justice.  Community alert with 800 schemes involving over 150,000 households received the first ever money from the current Minister for Justice &mdash; £50,000 to help expand the services, also £4,000 to print an information newsletter. The Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána were also represented on the task force on security for the elderly which was established by the Minister for Social Welfare in 1996 and the recommendations from the task force relevant to the Department of Justice are being implemented.</P>
    <P>8.  Crime strategy paper-crime council.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice will be publishing a statement of strategy for tackling crime shortly. This will be the first such strategy paper ever published in the history of the State.  It will outline plans for establishing a crime council thereby facilitating ongoing, well-informed and broadly-based discussion on crime.</P>
    <P>9.  Victims of crime.</P>
    <P>(a)  The Minister for Justice has provided £3.4 million in 1997 for payments under the criminal injuries compensation tribunal scheme.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Minister for Justice published a Charter for Victims of Crime on 28 February 1997.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Minister for Justice has provided the Irish Association for Victim Support with a grant of £280,000 in 1997, £180,000 provided in 1996.</P>
    <P>(d)  The Minister for Justice is providing facilities for the Irish Association for Victim Support in all major court building projects.</P>
    <P>(e)  The Minister for Justice intends also to publish an information booklet for victims of crime in addition to the charter referred to at (b) above.</P>
    <P>(f)  On 2 November 1996 the Minister for Justice was presented with the report of the working party on the legal and judicial process for victims of sexual and other crimes of violence against women and children.  The working party received funding from the Minister for Justice towards the cost of this report and the report is being examined by the Minister for Justice and other relevant Ministers and agencies.</P>
    <P>10.  Garda National Bureau of Fraud Investigation.</P>
    <P>In April 1995 the Minister for Justice established a National Bureau of Fraud Investigation which is dedicated to tackle this major area of crime with lay accountants involved alongside the Garda.</P>
    <P>11.  Drugs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice targeted a major assault on drug trafficking when she obtained Governmental approval for a series of measures <Col N="1334" /> aimed at tackling drug trafficking and abuse which is at the root of much of the crime in our society.  These measures included: a Garda national drugs unit was established in July 1995 under the control of a deputy commissioner; a memorandum of understanding between the gardaí and Customs and Excise has been signed by agency heads and endorsed by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance; the Criminal Assets Bureau with a senior garda as its chief bureau officer has been established.  This new body which has personnel drawn from the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, will ensure closer and more concerted co-operation between State agencies in dealing with organised crime.  The Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996 has put the bureau on a statutory footing; the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, amongst other things, allows for the detention for questioning of drug traffickers for up to seven days and restricts the right to silence in drug trafficking cases; and on 11 February 1997 the Minister for Justice received Government approval for the drafting of a Bill to deal with drug abuse in dance halls, public houses and other entertainment venues as well as at unlicensed dances whether indoors or out of doors.  This Bill completed Second Stage in the Dáil on 29 April 1997.  The Minister also introduced an amendment at the Committee Stage of the Drug Trafficking Bill (now Act) in the Dáil to amend the 1935 Public Dance Halls Act <i>vis-à-vis</i> entry in plain clothes by members of the Garda Síochána to venues where a Public Dance Hall Licence is in force in connection with investigating suspected drug trafficking offences.</P>
    <P>12.  Drug in Prison.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is taking steps to tackle the drugs problem in our prisons including: opening a secure drugs-free unit in the training unit in the Mountjoy Prison complex on 28 March 1996; the opening of a new drug treatment centre in Mountjoy Prison on 3 July 1996; in Mountjoy and other prisons increased vigilance by staff has substantially increased seizures of drugs from prisons and their visitors; and the Mountjoy complex has had cameras installed in the visitor area and a search room put in place to search prisoners coming from visits.</P>
    <P>13.  Prison places.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice obtained Government approval in 1996 for an accelerated prisons capital building programme to provide over 800 additional prison places in the period up to the end of 1998.  In excess of 160 additional places under this programme became available in 1996, a further 180 places are scheduled to be completed in the current year and the remaining 460 new places will become available in 1998.  A prisons project team is in place in the Department of Justice to ensure the speedy progression of additional prison accommodation.  When all these projects are completed there will be as stated <Col N="1335" /> above 800 additional places over and above the current 2,250 prison places available, an increase of 35 per cent in the total prison capacity.  The estimated overall cost of providing accelerated programme for the provision of additional prison places including new projects, refurbishment works, maintenance and equipment is in the region of £135 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice on 7 February 1997 approved the development of the new special high security unit at Wheatfield to manage violent offenders.  This unit will be ready for occupation by June 1997.  In addition, the Minister has approved the provision of a new 60 person close supervision facility in Portlaoise Prison to hold difficult high-security prisoners.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has established a prisons operating cost review group to review the operating costs of the prison service.  The current average cost of keeping an offender in prison is £46,500 per annum and the Minister hopes that the group will be able to recommend ways to achieve a reduction in this cost.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New supervised early release programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>On 2 July 1996 the Minister for Justice obtained Government approval for a new scheme involving intensive supervision of 100 prisoners, initially, on early release.  The Government approved the recruitment of ten additional probation officers to enable this scheme to be put into effect, in co-operation with the Garda.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Expert group on the establishment of an Independent Prisons Agency</i>
    </P>
    <P>On 12 November 1996 the Government approved the establishment of an independent prisons board or agency to run the prison service on a day-to-day basis and in that context established the expert group chaired by Mr. Dan McAuley to report on the establishment of such a board or agency.  Following Government approval, the Minister for Justice published the expert group's report entitled &ldquo;Towards an Independent Prisons Agency&rdquo; on 26 March 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Probation and Welfare Service</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice in July 1996 approved the construction of a new premises in Ronanstown, North Clondalkin, for the North Clondalkin probation project at an estimated cost of £700,000 which will be funded by her Department. Building work is well under way.  The premises, when completed, will provide facilities for 36 offenders as well as offices for the probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P>14.  Court reform.</P>
    <P>(a)  <i>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995/Courts Act, 1996/Courts Act, 1997</i></P>
    <P>Through the Courts and Court Officers Act the Minister for Justice introduced measures to tackle the problem of delays in the courts and to introduce administrative and procedural reforms which simplify and speed up the processing of <Col N="1336" /> cases through the courts and enhance the overall efficiency of the courts system.  The number of judges authorised at present by legislation in the various courts are as follows: Supreme Court 8, High Court 23, Circuit Court 28, District Court 51.  There is now 102 judges as compared to 86 judges in January 1995.</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>Working group on a courts commission</i></P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice set up this working group in November 1995 to carry out a thorough review of the management and financing of the courts with a view to outlining the way in which reform of the courts might take place.  On 21 May 1996 the Minister for Justice received approval from the Government for the publication of the first report of the working group on a courts commission entitled &ldquo;Management and Financing of the Courts&rdquo;.  The Government also approved in principle the primary recommendation of the report that an independent and permanent body be established to manage a unified court system; this body to be created by statute as an agency of the State and to be known as the courts service and to be managed on a day-to-day basis by a chief executive officer of Departmental Secretary rank.</P>
    <P>On 11 September 1996 the Minister for Justice received approval from the Government for the publication of a second report of the working group on a courts commission entitled &ldquo;Case Management and Court Management&rdquo;.  The Government also accepted in general the recommendations of this report.</P>
    <P>On 19 November 1996 the Minister for Justice received approval from the Government for the publication of the third report of the working group on a courts commission entitled &ldquo;Toward the Courts Service&rdquo;.  That report concentrates on two specific areas &mdash; (a)  the legal framework for the proposed courts service and (b) broad management approaches to the changing structure. The report sets out a broad sketch of the heads of a Bill to establish the courts service and the preparation of this Bill is being given priority. The working group is continuing to do further preparatory work for the establishment of the courts service whilst the legislation is in preparation.</P>
    <P>On 25 March 1997 the Minister for Justice received approval from the Government for the publication of the fourth report of the working group on a courts commission entitled &ldquo;The Chief Executive of the Courts Service&rdquo;.  The report sets out in some detail the role and function of the chief executive of the courts service.</P>
    <P>(c)  <i>Arrangements for additional sittings of the Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Court</i></P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice obtained the agreement of the President of the High Court that the Central Criminal Court sit for three additional weeks commencing on 16 September 1996.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice also obtained the agreement of the President of the Circuit Court for additional sittings of the Circuit Court around <Col N="1337" /> the country, but in particular in the Dublin, South East, South West and Western Circuit areas where delays are generally longer.  Again, the extra sittings of Circuit Courts were for three additional weeks commencing on 16 September 1996.</P>
    <P>(d)  <i>Court delays</i></P>
    <P>The strategy of the Minister for Justice has been to combine the allocation of judicial resources with practical legislative and adminstrative reforms in order to quickly equip the courts system with the means to make inroads on delays in hearing cases and appeals.  The existing backlogs in the courts are well on the way to being cleared.  For example, in the Dublin Circuit Court new litigants in civil cases can now obtain a court date within six weeks of the lodgment of their case as compared to a two-year delay last July 1996.  In family law cases in the Dublin Circuit Court, the delay has been reduced from 16 months to four months and there are now no delays in the hearing of criminal cases in the Dublin Circuit Court.  There have been similar substantial reductions in the hearing of cases in the Provincial Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>(e)  <i>District Court Rules 1997</i></P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice formally launched the District Court Rules 1997 on 7 March 1997.  These rules were last consolidated in 1948 and the entire text of these rules will also be available on computer diskette and CD ROM.</P>
    <P>(f)  <i>Court accommodation</i></P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has provided £8.6 million in her 1997 budget for court capital projects and court maintenance projects.</P>
    <P>15.  Legislation enacted from 1995-7.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act 1995 ensures that in every case of incest the verdict and sentence, if any, has to be announced in public and that although members of the public are excluded from the hearing, bona fide representatives of the press may attend at hearings of proceedings under the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908 while ensuring the anonymity of the person charged by means of prohibiting the publication of matters likely to lead to identification.</P>
    <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 enabled Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons as well as an EU Agreement on the application of the convention among member states.  The basic aim of the convention is to provide for a simple and expeditious procedure under which persons sentenced in a foreign country can serve their sentence or the balance of their sentence in their own country of origin.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 provides for increases in the numbers of judges of the Supreme, High, Circuit and District Courts. It provides that the Supreme Court may sit in divisions and for the abolition of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the transfer of its jurisdiction to the Supreme Court.  It also makes provision for <Col N="1338" /> the establishment of a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to advise the Government on the suitability of persons for judicial appointment.</P>
    <P>The Act also amends and extends the powers of the Master of the High Court, County Registrars and Taxing Masters of the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Act allows the trial judge to decide whether a criminal trial should be transferred for hearing to the Circuit Court in Dublin.  It also removes limitations on the territorial jurisdiction of judges of the District Court in respect of criminal cases.  It makes provision for a number of other matters including the provision of funding for judicial training, qualifying solicitors for appointment as judges of the Circuit Court and reducing the retirement age of judges of the Supreme and High Courts.</P>
    <P>The Courts Act, 1996 provides for an increase in the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court from 24 to 27 judges.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 amongst other things allows for the detention for questioning of drug traffickers for up to seven days and restricts the right to silence in drug trafficking cases.</P>
    <P>The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 enables the High Court to freeze and ultimately dispose of property worth at least £10,000 which it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities is the proceeds of crime.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution Act, 1996</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice tabled substantial amendments to the (Private Members) Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, now an Act, in the Dáil, both to improve the Bill in its own right and to incorporate into it the intention behind the Child Sex Tours Bill, Senator Henry's Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997</i>
    </P>
    <P>The purpose of this Act is to achieve savings in costs and in Garda time through changes in procedure in criminal cases.  Among other matters, the Act gives the Garda new powers to search for evidence relating to serious offences such as murder and rape, extends the period for which a person may be remanded in custody and provides for the giving of certain garda evidence by certificate.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Courts Act, 1997</i>
    </P>
    <P>This Act makes provision for an additional three High Court judges.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Criminal Law Act, 1997</i>
    </P>
    <P>This Act simplifies procedures of arrest and gets rid of the outdated concepts of misdemeanours and felonies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Criminal Justice Act 1994 &mdash; orders-regulations under the Act</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice signed a Commencement Order in March 1995 implementing anti-money <Col N="1339" /> laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>The regulations under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 dealing with the seizure of imports or exports of cash associated with drug trafficking have been made by the Minister for Justice following approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <i>International conventions</i>
    </P>
    <P>On 4 July 1996 the Minister for Justice obtained the approval of the Dáil for the terms of the following three important international conventions on criminal law: the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the Additional Protocol to the Convention was ratified by Ireland on 28 November 1996; the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances &mdash; this UN convention was ratified by Ireland on 3 September 1996; and the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime was ratified by Ireland on 28 November 1996.</P>
    <P>The above three conventions are very important measures which will enable Ireland to co-operate extensively with other countries in the fight against drugs and other serious crimes on an international level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The District Court is a court of summary jurisdiction and consequently where offences are being tried in that court the presiding judge sits without a jury. The question of jurors in the District Court does not, therefore, arise.  However, where offences are being tried in the Circuit Court or the High Court, the presiding judge is obliged under Article 38 of the Constitution to sit with a jury.</P>
      <P>In relation to expenses, the position is that there is no provision in the Juries Act, 1976 for the payment out of State funds of expenses of any kind to jurors.  When the Act was introduced, consideration was given to the matter of expenses but it was decided that expenses should not be paid as performance of jury service is considered to be a basic civil duty which arises relatively infrequently as far as the individual is concerned. In certain criminal trials, where the issue is one of security and protection of the jury, jurors may where necessary be provided with lunch.</P>
      <P>Section 29 of the Act does, however, make provision for employees to be paid by their employers when engaged on jury service.</P>
      <P>Under section 9 of the 1976 Act, a county registrar may excuse any person whom he-she has summoned as a juror from attendance during the whole or any part of the sittings in question if that person shows to the registrar's satisfaction that there is good reason why he-she should be so excused.</P>
      <P>Thus a request for exclusal from jury service in Dublin, for example, should be addressed to the County Registrar, Circuit Court Office, Four Courts, Dublin 7, on the relevant portion of the jury summons form.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that these dealings refer to an application under section 49 i.e. acquisition of title by virtue of long possession of the Registration of Title Act, 1964 and an application for first registration.  The applications were lodged on 1 November 1990 and 3 July 1991, respectively.  I understand that there has been ongoing correspondence between the applicants' solicitor and the Land Registry, and that a reply to queries which were issued on 7 March 1996 and to which a reminder was sent on in July 1996, are awaited from the solicitor.  In addition, replies are also awaited to a further query in relation to a conflict of boundaries, which was issued on 11 December 1996.  These applications cannot proceed until the queries raised have been satisfactorily discharged.  It is not possible, therefore, to estimate a completion time at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology, Deputy Rabbitte, announced the membership of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council on 24 March last. The role of the Council is to advise Government on the strategic direction of science and technology policy, embracing all aspects including scientific research, third-level education, technology and research and development in industry, financing of innovation, public awareness of science and technology and prioritisation of State spending on science and technology.  Appointments to the council were made in a personal capacity and on the basis of particular expertise, including scientific disciplines which will be key to our industrial future, rather than as representative of any sectoral interest.</P>
      <P>The council is not intended to supplant or cut across the work of any special expert groups in any particular area or to otherwise assume specific functions arising out of EU directives.  In the case of the directive referred to in this question, responsibility for this lies with the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>There has been a very high level of interest in the employment horizon programme and this is reflected in the volume of applications for funding, 136 of which have been received by my Department.  The total value of European Social Funding sought is in excess of £36 million and the total funding available is less than £9 million.</P>
      <P>Each application will be subject to an initial technical assessment and will then be further assessed by a broadly based representative selection committee which will, in turn, refer to the eligibility and selection criteria which apply to employment horizon.  The exact composition of the selection committee has yet to be fixed. However, it will be representative of relevant Departments, social partner organisations and organisations from the non-statutory sector.</P>
      <P>A full review of all applications will be completed by the end of July at which stage a letter will issue to all project promoters notifying them of the outcome of the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the income difficulties being experienced by beef producers because of the recent fall in cattle prices.  The main cause of the current difficulties is the series of cuts in export refunds by the EU Commission in an attempt to stay within the GATT limits on EU subsidised exports.  The fall in EU beef consumption arising from the BSE situation has significantly increased the surplus of beef on the Community market and made it more difficult to stay within these limits.  The effect of the reductions in export refunds on Irish producers has been exacerbated by the revaluation of the Irish agriculture conversion rate.</P>
      <P>As regards the reductions in cattle prices arising from the revaluation of the Irish agricultural conversion rate, I should point out that the EU has already agreed to provide compensation amounting to £20 million for the revaluations on 11 November 1996 and 10 January 1997.  I have announced the arrangements for the payment of this aid.  An additional EU funded compensation package amounting to £11 million to compensate for the most recent revaluation on 29 March has also been approved.  I also announced last week a further £17 million would be provided for national resources to help alleviate the income difficulties being experienced by beef producers as a result of the recent revaluation of the Irish agricultural conversion rate.  Subject to clearance with the European Commission, I intend to use the national funds to pay a top-up of £50 per head on all male cattle and heifers slaughtered in meat export plants and local abattoirs and on heifers sold through marts during the period 1 April-10 June 1997.  Applicants will be required to provide proof of ownership of the animals on 1 April 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> The adjustment to the deseasonalisation slaughter premium which I secured last year to ensure the continuation of this premium into 1997 and future years is of major assistance to our winter finishers.  This premium, which will be worth some £20 million to Irish beef producers this year or 7p/lb, should, along with all of the other measures I have mentioned, greatly help to alleviate the difficulties of beef producers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 184 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of pig slaughtering plants last year in the Border region was on the basis of commercial decisions taken by the managements concerned. Since these closures my Department, in liaison with Forbairt, has been closely monitoring <Col N="1353" /> the position.  The facilities of my Department and those of Forbairt are available to any company wishing to commence operations in the pig sector, particularly in the Border region.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific plant referred to, I understand from Forbairt that a group has expressed an interest in reopening this plant and that preliminary discussions have taken place. There are suggestions that other groups may also be interested.  However the resumption of activities at the plant in question, or indeed the establishment of any new facilities, is ultimately a matter for commercial decision by the parties involved.</P>

      <P>This measure is fully funded by the European Union without any national Exchequer contribution.  Ireland is the only member state operating the scheme.  Since 1988, EU legislation requires the Commission to review the scheme every two years.  On foot of a review in late 1996, the European Commission, in its report to the Council, proposed that the scheme should be extended for a further two years at an unchanged aid level.  The Commission also recommended that the monthly entitlement be halved to reflect the general decline in <i>per capita</i> butter consumption in Ireland which has fallen from 2 lbs per month to under 1 lb.</P>
      <P>The Agriculture Council agreed in December to continue the scheme for a further two years on the basis of the Commission proposal.</P>

      <P>An investigation is being carried out into a serious operational incident, involving the civilian employee under reference.  The incident occurred at the naval base, Haulbowline.  The suggestion in the question that pollution would have resulted from the operation is not borne out by the reports available to the Department.</P>
      <P>As indicated, this matter is ongoing and has already been the subject of a meeting between officials of my Department, local Naval Service management and representatives of the trade union of the civilian employee.  As this matter may be referred by the trade union to a third party for external conciliation, it would be undesirable to comment further on the matter at this stage.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the Government has failed to protect and expand the Irish fishing industry as contained in the document, A Government of Renewal, section 88; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past two years there has been progress on all of the objectives set for the fishing industry in the programme, A Government of Renewal.</P>
      <P>The main focus of fishing policy is to maintain and strengthen the contribution to the national economy and in particular its contribution to growth and employment in coastal communities.</P>
      <P>In respect of the sea fishing sector significant growth has been achieved since 1994.  Fish landings have increased from 291,000 tonnes valued at £108 million in 1994 to 320,000 tonnes valued at £136 million in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy, Ireland continued to strengthen the ability of its fishing fleet to avail of national fish quotas and to develop opportunities in new areas <Col N="1364" /> and non-quota species.  Most recently a significant increase in Ireland's 1997 quotas for whitefish was achieved at the December Council, this involved an increase of 1,170 tonnes over 1996 levels.  At the April Council, Ireland achieved, for the first time, an allocation of 12,000 tonnes of Atlanto Scandian Herring for the Irish pelagic fleet.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Operational Programme provides for investment of some £140 million in the fisheries sector over the period 1994 to 1999.  To date over 60 per cent of the total EU funds allocated to the programme have been committed.  In relation to the fleet, current investment support strategies are designed to improve the efficiency, safety and age profile of the fleet.  To date 131 modernisation projects have been approved for over £4 million grant aid in the last two years. The good take up of funding to date is contributing to the objectives of improving the quality, efficiency and safety of the fleet.  In relation to grant aiding new boats, I have Government approval to go ahead with a pilot scheme.  The Department and BIM are progressing practical implementation of the proposal and I am pursuing the necessary additional funding for such a <Col N="1365" /> scheme in the context of the current mid-term review of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Operational Programme, funding is available under the PESCA community initiative to help the fishing industry overcome difficulties.  One hundred and twelve projects have been approved since the programme commenced in 1995 representing total investment of £6.6 million.</P>
    <P>In the area of conservation and resource management, Ireland has been pushing strongly at EU level for the introduction of more stringent technical measures to protect juvenile fish.  Substantial progress was made during the Irish Presidency on a package of new measures which are expected to be agreed later in the year.  National measures are being maintained to conserve inshore fish stocks, such as salmon, sea-trout, bass, lobster, crabs and whelks, which are not controlled under EU Regulations.</P>
    <P>Overall, I can confirm this Government's strong record in the development of the fisheries sector.</P>

      <P>In 1994 both Governments endorsed the recommendations of the review of the operations, funding, structure and staffing of the Foyle Fisheries Commission and authorised the drafting of legislation to give effect jointly to those recommendations of the review which required legislative action.</P>
      <P>The parallel drafting process involving the Attorney General's office and the office of the Legislative Counsel, Belfast and associated discussions between the two sponsoring Departments is progressing in accordance with the proposals authorised by both Governments.</P>
      <P>Respective Ministers have been briefed on the progress to date on the drafting process and of ongoing official contacts in the matter.  While no specific consultative meetings at ministerial level have been held recently in relation to the legislative proposals, Ministers will continue to take appropriate opportunities to discuss progress.</P>

    <P>I understand that the Commission is at present <Col N="1368" /> considering in detail the responses to its consultation document on the aquaculture and sea fishing proposals issued last year to fisheries interests in the Foyle Area and will, on request, meet with interested groups to discuss their submissions.</P>
    <P>The Chairman and Chief Executive of the Foyle Fisheries Commission met the Fisheries Committee of Donegal County Council on 7 April, to brief them on the proposed legislative and current developments generally.</P>
    <P>The Commission also takes the opportunity at meetings of the Foyle Area Advisory Council, which is representative of the various fisheries interests in the Foyle Area, to update members on progress being made by both Governments on the proposed legislation.</P>

    <P>*In the case of certain smaller harbours, the Minister may nominate persons to represent shipping interests.  In such instances, no elections by qualified electors occur.</P>
    <P>Arramara Teo. and the Salmon Research Agency are private companies to which the Minister for the Marine appoints directors-members. The Minister appoints three directors to the board of Arramara Teo.; the remaining two directors are appointed by the Nutra Sweet Kelco Company.  In the case of the Salmon Research Agency the Minister appoints six of the nine members of its committee of management and the six members then elect a further three.</P>
    <P>I will arrange for the names of the board members to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
