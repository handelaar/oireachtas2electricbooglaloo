      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in the House last week, I had a useful and wide-ranging meeting with the four main Church leaders on Monday, 10 February. We had constructive and informative exchanges on the prospects for peace and political progress in Northern Ireland, including related matters such as the forthcoming marching season and the multi-party talks.  We agreed in particular on the need for everything possible to be done to reduce inter-community tension and to promote closer <Col N="3" /> cross-community co-operation in the period ahead.  The Church leaders emphasised their continuing commitment to playing their role, alongside political and community leaders, in this regard.  While there are no plans for a further meeting at present, the House can be assured of the Government's intention to maintain close contact with the broadest possible spectrum of opinion in Northern Ireland in the coming weeks and months.</P>
    <P>On contacts with Sinn Féin, the British Government is, of course, aware of my Government's position, which I set out clearly in this House on 22 January and on a number of other occasions since then.  Obviously, the two Governments exchange views on issues such as this.  Ultimately, of course, it is a matter for the British Government to decide its own position on this question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach get a clear view from the Church leaders of what they thought could be done to defuse sectarian tensions in the North prior to the marching season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I did.  There was a strong emphasis in all that was said to me by the Church leaders on the need for local agreement and for everything to be done at local level to deal with the various difficult local conflicts in a practical way.  We discussed other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach have any discussions with them on the North report and were they disappointed that the British Government does not seem to want to implement the recommendations in that report before this year's marching season?  What was their view, and what is the Taoiseach's view on how to deal with this year's marching season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Church leaders did not express a collective view on the North report. Individual opinions were expressed by the Church leaders but it would be wrong of me to attempt to represent any collective view on this matter.  The view of the Government is well known.  We are anxious to see the provisions of the North report, including its statutory underpinning, implemented without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given what happened in the House of Commons last night, would the Taoiseach accept that no progress will be made in Northern Ireland before the British general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The assumption the Deputy is making is not necessarily correct.  Deputy Kitt made a similar assumption here last week and I said I did not accept the premise of his question either.  There is no guarantee on this matter but one should not make the assumption the Deputy has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="4" />
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Church leaders support the idea of local negotiation. Local negotiation is not a problem for most of the 3,000 marches.  A breakdown in local negotiation only occurs in regard to approximately 20 marches during the season.  Did the Church leaders express a view in this regard or did the Taoiseach ask them to encourage the Orange Order to enter into local negotiations in places such as the Ormeau Road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, in response to Deputy Harney, I strongly expressed the view that there is a responsibility resting on the shoulders of church leaders because the parades which are causing the difficulty in many cases take place to or from a church service.  The same standards of restraint and Christian charity as they would be advised to display while at service in church should be applied by people on their way to and from church.  Any notion of using a procession to or from a church as a means of displaying triumphalism <i>vis-á-vis</i> another community is entirely contrary to the Christian message and the underlying values in any Christian church service.</P>
      <P>This is a view with which the church leaders concur.  They do not have absolute control over what happens outside the church premises.  They can, however, exercise a degree of moral responsibility and leadership in the matter.  I agree with Deputy Burke that the areas where there are difficulties are relatively few in number, the bulk of parades will proceed without difficulty. Where they and I were referring to the need for local negotiation, it was in respect of those difficult cases where local negotiation is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Developing that point, will the Taoiseach agree that the authorities of any church which is the starting point or destination of any particular demonstration which is likely to cause increased sectarianism in Northern Ireland are entitled to be involved in the process whereby their buildings and facilities are used for these purposes and in these circumstances?  Will the Taoiseach encourage the church leaders to assert a role not just as of right but as a duty in participating in the planning of these events?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The church leaders have both a right and a duty in this matter.  It is also the case that in the Reform Church there is a considerable degree of local autonomy and democratic governance in decisions made in individual vestries, presbyteries and places of worship, something with which we are familiar for perhaps four centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Taoiseach's view and that of the House of the marches to Harryville church where the protestations have continued for 24 weeks by a community that does not seem to be following any guidelines, was there unity among the churches?  On the North report, the <Col N="5" /> Taoiseach told me some weeks ago at Question Time that he pursued his line of argument with the British authorities to see if they would accept that any arrangements should be placed on a legislative base within three months.  Is it now his view that there will be no change on this matter this side of the British general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would put the marches in Harryville in a different category, they have deliberately been brought past a church by people who wish to make a point, antagonistic to those who attend the church in question.  That is in a different category to marches to and from a church.  The church authorities have less control over what others do to show antagonism towards their flock than they do over what their flock does on their way to and from church.  I, therefore, regard the Harryville marches to be in a different category to the Drumcree events.</P>
      <P>I expressed strongly my concern about what is happening in Harryville.  The right to worship and to be able to go to and from a church service is a fundamental one.  Any community that speaks frequently of the right to religious liberty as one of its founding principles should contain members who wish to interfere with the right of others of a different religion to freedom of worship.  Most of the majority community in Northern Ireland are opposed to what is happening in Harryville. A number of Unionist politicians have shown by their presence their strong disagreement with what is being done.  Many others have expressed their condemnation publicly and privately.</P>
      <P>The British Government has decided on an eight week consultation period.  This is too long, a consultation period of two to three weeks would be sufficient.  The North report was the subject of lengthy consultation.  It is important that whatever arrangements are to be made are made in good time in full statutory form before the principal marches occur.  The Government will continue to do everything it can within the exigencies of the political situation in Britain to urge the British authorities to have the legislation passed in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach ever asked the church leaders to explain their true obsession with marching which usually involves the same people changing their sashes to suit the occasion, be they Orange, Black Presbytery or Apprentice Boys marches?  While we agree it is a celebration of their civil and religious liberties, all but one of the scores of bands that marched past the church in Harryville last Saturday week stopped to play celebratory tunes.  What is the logic behind this? What is the explanation of church leaders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The church leaders who met me included the leaders of the Presbyterian, Church of Ireland, Methodist and Roman Catholic Churches.  While the question the Deputy has posed might have some relevance to some of those mentioned it might not have the same relevance <Col N="6" /> to others.  I did not put the issue to them in terms of attempting to ask unanswerable questions. That would not be a constructive way to proceed.  The church leaders do not organise these parades, they simply facilitate the services. It is the people who attend these services who have decided for traditional reasons to have processions or marches on their way to or from the church.  The events objected to do not take place within the church but outside it.  As I have said in the House on many occasions &mdash; I also made this point to the church leaders &mdash; there is something very strange in the fact that a group of perhaps 6,000 to 7,000 people gathers to go from a church along a particular route when the church in question only has facilities to accommodate a few hundred worshippers at the service.  To say the least, that seems to be incongruous and suggests that there are motives other than religious ones for the congregation in such numbers for a post-church procession.</P>
      <P>Provocative events affecting both sides of the community have occurred.  There have been marches, perhaps not on a particular date, in other parts of Northern Ireland which have been profoundly offensive to the majority community. There is no monopoly of good behaviour.  It has been drawn to my attention that marches organ-ised by the other side of the community have deliberately passed and stopped to play music outside certain households members of which have been killed by the IRA.  That is just as provocative as many of the activities associated with Orange parades.  It is important that we urge all sides to let their sense of hurt and of being the victims of discrimination be heard but it should be as a prelude to forgiveness because it is only if there is forgiveness that there will be reconciliation and it is only if there is reconciliation that there will be lasting peace.</P>
      <P>We need to hear grievances voiced but that should be done as a prelude to forgiveness, reconciliation and, ultimately, complete peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach's discussions with the church leaders were held after the 25th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I am sure he had an opportunity to raise with them their thinking on what should happen in relation to the now discredited Widgery report.  What were their views? Was there a united view on whether there should be a new report?  What insight did he receive from their understanding of the matter?  I am sure they believe a new report would help to defuse sectarian tensions in this difficult year.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give his view on recent statements by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on whether we are likely to get a review, an apology or any substantial move by the British Government on the events of Bloody Sunday 25 years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="7" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise the Deputy must phrase every question by reference to the meeting I had with the church leaders but it would be better if I were to simply answer the Deputy's question without reference to the proceedings of that meeting as we would have touched on the matter but the discussion was not in great detail.</P>
      <P>I have indicated in response to an earlier question by Deputy McDaid and have said publicly that I believe the concerns and sense of hurt of the victims and families of victims of Bloody Sunday must be heard clearly and their sense of anguish must be given full voice.  Any slight on the character of those who died must be removed in the fullest fashion possible.  I have already said that here many times and I repeat it again today.</P>
      <P>I was glad that the Secretary of State met the relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday and that they had an opportunity to present him with much new material about that day.  As he had received that new material from them, I was surprised by comments which he made subsequently. I know from my conversations with the British Prime Minister that he is willing to look at the new evidence.  For my part, we have instructed the services of the State to assemble all the evidence they can from all sources, internal and external, and we will be making a presentation of these matters in due course to the British authorities. As the House is aware, I will be having a meeting with the relatives later this week to hear their statement of the new evidence at first hand and their views on what can best be done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from media reports the Taoiseach will meet the relatives on Thursday night.  Would it be useful if, prior to that meeting, he was to ask the British Government or the British authorities at some level to clarify the position?  Some British sources are saying that what Sir Patrick Mayhew stated on Saturday is not in actual fact the position, that the Prime Minister has in effect said that he would give an apology.  Rather than allow this matter to drift on, would it be useful if the Taoiseach was to get clarification of the British position &mdash; whether there is to be an apology or if they really are just concerned about criminal damages &mdash; so that he could tell the relatives? The meetings on Friday left them thinking the Secretary of State was examining three separate areas and he effectively ruled out all three of them in an interview 12 hours later.  If the Taoiseach or his officials could get clarification from the British, it could stop an unnecessary merry-go-round on which, unfortunately, the Secretary of State seems to thrive at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly like to hear the relatives in a very careful and full way.  I will take whatever steps are appropriate to prepare for that meeting in terms of obtaining any information on the matter which I do not have already, but it would be best, given the importance and seriousness of this matter, if I did not <Col N="8" /> demonstrably prejudge anything until I have heard the views of the people directly affected.  I will be proceeding on that basis but I thank the Deputy for his suggestions which I will consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said last week that he planned to visit Northern Ireland shortly.  Has he finalised his arrangements for that visit?  Does he believe it is important to have a meeting with the British Prime Minister soon in order to inject some life into the talks process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any meetings with the British Prime Minister which I consider to be useful will, of course, be arranged whenever necessary.  I have obviously had the opportunity of discussing matters regularly with the British Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>As far as my proposed visit to Northern Ireland is concerned, the arrangements are not finalised and it is not customary for me to give details in advance for security reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to find myself in a position of acting as legal adviser to Deputy McDowell.  Subsection (4) states that the categories of files which ought to be retained and not made publicly available in the National Archives are ones which would be contrary to the public interest, might constitute a breach of statutory duty on the grounds that they contain information supplied in confidence, might cause distress or danger to living persons on the grounds that they contain information about individuals or might be likely to lead to an action for damages for defamation.  Those are the criteria which, in their wisdom, the Members of this House <Col N="9" /> decided should apply when they enacted the legislation in 1986.</P>
      <P>I can, however, further sate the Deputy's curiosity by telling him that the Department of the Taoiseach has furnished 21,000 files to the National Archives.  A total of 470 files have been retained, apart from 990 personnel files because there is a practice of not supplying personnel files.  The rate of transfer of files is quite high and the rate of retention of files is quite low.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not decide that.  I do not go through these files one by one.  It is done by an official on a delegated basis.  I presume that if there was some really difficult case about which they could not make up their mind, they might ask me but I have not been asked to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any review process in relation to files which are denied access to the National Archives on grounds of public interest? I know the Taoiseach does not go through them personally, but is there any basis on which the National Archives or the Taoiseach is notified of a decision of this kind being made?  In other words, does anybody second guess the official who does this work on a delegated basis?  Is the public interest synonymous with the interest of the Department of the Taoiseach on these occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is the public interest in a genuine sense.  There is not a corporate interest at the Department of the Taoiseach stretching back 30 years because most of the people who would have been there at that time are no longer in the public or political service.</P>
      <P>In preparation for this question I had a look at the titles of some of the files retained, almost all of which are personal files about individuals.  The Taoiseach of the day will receive letters making outrageous allegations about people, to which the Deputy, if he received them, might not consider it necessary to reply.  However, in the case of an office holder like myself it is necessary not only to reply but to retain them on file even though they may contain statements that are only the fruits of somebody's overheated imagination about somebody else.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that even at a remove of 30 years it would not be desirable to put that type of material into the public arena, where outrageous and unsustainable allegations were made about somebody in the course of correspondence with the Taoiseach of the day.  I have looked at the files, but I understand that is the type of material that is retained.  We have nothing to hide.</P>

      <Quest>the extent to which he considers the programme for renewal has been fulfilled; and the reason for the non-implementation of a number of commitments.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitments in the programme, A Government of Renewal, have been overwhelmingly fulfilled.  Progress is being made towards the implementation of the few commitments remaining to be fulfilled.</P>
      <P>The following are among the major achievements of this Government.  There is a renewed economic and social partnership, as demonstrated by partnership 2000.  We have sustained job creation at the rate of 1,000 jobs per week, a rate never previously attained.  Small businesses, the backbone of our economy, have prospered in a tax regime which has seen their corporate tax rate drop from 40 per cent to 28 per cent.  We have reduced the tax burden on individuals.  A family with one earner on the average industrial wage and three children is £32.50 a week or 15 per cent better off than it was before this Government was formed.  A family with one spouse earning twice the average industrial wage and two children at third level is £5,350 a year better off.</P>
      <P>Over the life of this Government child benefit has increased by more than 50 per cent.  This is a universal benefit, it is not means tested and it goes mainly to women with children.  For the less well off in our community, all social welfare benefits have increased by at least twice the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>The capitation grants in primary schools have gone up by 20 per cent.  Third level fees have been abolished.</P>
      <P>Inflation has been kept at an average of 2 per cent per annum.  The debt ratio has fallen from 88 per cent when we came into office to a projected 69 per cent at the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the process of renewing Government, we have launched the Strategic Management Initiative which is about to be underpinned by the most far reaching and fundamental reform of the public service ever.  The public service management Bill will be published shortly.  It will introduce reform on the premise of starting with people and valuing each individual's contribution towards the running of the public service.  The Bill is aimed at <Col N="11" /> orienting everyone in the public sector towards the customer, the members of the public who use the services of the State.</P>
    <P>The freedom of information legislation will have a major impact on people's access to information in the possession of Government Departments and State agencies, both about themselves and the workings of the Government and administration.</P>
    <P>The reform of the Attorney General's office has been completed with obvious benefits in efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>In the area of crime and justice, the Government has introduced the most far reaching reforms in this area for many decades.  The crime bosses are now being vigorously pursued and being nailed by the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The Government has successfully carried through the bail referendum giving the courts power to stop repeat offenders abusing our system of civil rights.  Legislation is imminent to reform the courts and the prison service.  The biggest programme for providing prison places in the history of the State is under way.</P>
    <P>On divorce, this Government finally succeeded in changing the Constitution so that our laws could be made more compassionate for those involved in the tragedy of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>In relation to Northern Ireland, I have recently listed the achievements of the Government in some detail.  Suffice it on this occasion to point to the successful negotiation of the Joint Framework Document, the international body's report to overcome the problem of the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, the achievement of a fixed date for inclusive all-party negotiations, the achievement of ground rules to provide a fair and balanced framework for those negotiations and the appointment of an independent international chairman, Senator George Mitchell, who with his colleagues from Canada and Finland can give maximum external input to the achievement of a satisfactory outcome to the negotiations.  An historic process of talks, never previously achieved, has now been put in place and if the IRA declares a ceasefire, it will be possible for Sinn Féin to play its part.  I know that all parties in this House are in full agreement on this point.</P>
    <P>Across the whole range of issues in the programme, A Government of Renewal, the record of this Administration has been one of achievement in an efficient and effective manner.  It is a record of which I, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare and all our ministerial colleagues can be justly proud.</P>
    <P>If there is any specific commitment on which the Deputy requires further evidence of this Government's remarkable achievements, I invite him to put down the question to the relevant Minister in the normal way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to be brief, but the Taoiseach must have spent all weekend thinking of things he could say about the Government. <Col N="12" /> If he is so proud of its achievements, he should put it to the test and get on with calling an election.  I note he did not mention water rates. I would like to hear about the Government's proud achievements in that area.</P>
      <P>On a more serious note, the Taoiseach referred to the great tax reform, a reduction of 1 per cent in the standard rate in three years.  He also referred to the number of jobs created and said that rate was never previously attained, but the same figures were achieved in the year prior to the year he took up office.</P>
      <P>The Government's legislative programme is extremely disappointing.  The Taoiseach stated on taking up office, and in reply to many questions put to him here, that he would introduce reform in respect of some of the matters that had been outstanding for many years.  Other than amending the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, to provide for the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, the Taoiseach has not amended it.  He refused to deal with the issue of Cabinet confidentiality, but he appears to have changed his mind on that in the recent past.  He has not dealt with legislation providing for the protection of journalists' sources.  A report has been published on the disabilities Act, but legislation has not been introduced to amend it.  Action has not been taken on the important legislation to which I referred or on legislation on Dáil reform, the aspects of which have been long identified and in respect of which the Taoiseach and his colleagues have drawn directly from the documents Fianna Fáil negotiated with Labour.  The Government changed some of the commas.  Can we take it that the Taoiseach has no interest in dealing with any of that important legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer to that is &ldquo;absolutely not&rdquo;, but I will give the Deputy a longer answer.  On reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, amending legislation, the public service management Bill, will be published soon. Regarding the Cabinet confidentiality issue, the Government is in the process of drafting a suitable constitutional amendment to deal with that. On the protection of journalists' sources, an interesting and useful judgment on that matter was handed down in the European Court of Human Rights, which will need to inform our legislation.  That is being examined currently by the Government.  It is appropriate that any legislation we introduce on that matter should be consonant and consistent with the position adopted by the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Dáil reform, it will be a matter of interest to historians that the document the Deputy's party negotiated with the Labour Party contained provisions on Dáil reform.  Those provisions were identical to those contained in Fine Gael's proposals published prior to that document to which the Deputy referred.  As to who thought of what first, I could claim I was the author of those proposals adopted by the Deputy's party when in Government, but it does not matter who gets the <Col N="13" /> credit for this.  The introduction of business committees in this House for processing legislation has been an unalloyed success as it has allowed Members to take part in a much better way in the passage of legislation, where previously, as many Deputies who were in previous Dáils will remember, large sections of Bills were not debated on Committee Stage because of a lack of time here. At present, virtually all sections of each Bill are discussed fully.  This leads to a better quality of legislation even if Ministers experience difficulties and problems and are obliged to work hard to have their proposals accepted.</P>

Is it not correct that the Government voted down an amendment I tabled to the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill on that subject?

      <Quest>the contingency plans, if any, which are currently in place if a dispute by nurses goes ahead on 24 February 1997 in view of the fact that there will effectively be only two days between the result of the latest ballot and the commencement of the strike; the Government strategy for dealing with the nurses' dispute; and the plans, if any, he has to address the concerns of retired nurses in relation to their pension entitlements under the deal.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I apprised the House on 6 February last of the detailed contingency planning arrangements which had been put in place in the event of a nurses' strike, at that time threatened to commence on 10 February.  Briefly, health service managers held two meetings, on 14 and 31 January 1997, with the alliance of nursing unions to discuss the broad approach to ensuring that emergency and essential services would be maintained for the duration of a strike.  In addition, I met representatives of the alliance on 21 January on the same subject.  In tandem with this, management in all health agencies had drawn up detailed contingency plans for their own organisations on the basis of discussions held with local strike committees. Deputies will be aware of developments that have taken place since I last had an opportunity to address the House on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the threatened strike action by nurses with effect from 10 February 1997, the Labour Court decided to use its powers, under section 26(5) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, to carry out an investigation into the reasons for the proposed action.  The recommendation of the Labour Court issued on 7 February 1997 and provided for improvements in the package of proposals which had emerged from independent adjudication in September 1996 as follows: in respect of staff nurses, a new ten point salary scale to a maximum of £20,350 in addition <Col N="16" /> to one long service increment of £650 for nurses who are on the maximum of the scale for three years &mdash; this is effectively a maximum scale of £21,000; the deletion of proposed lower entry points on the staff nurse scale; improvements in three areas in respect of early retirement &mdash; that up to 200 nurses per annum be allowed to retire at age 55, subject to 35 years service; the age for application for the previously proposed pre-retirement initiative be reduced from 57 to 55; the pensions commission give priority to the nurses' pensions claims; and that temporary nurses be allowed to progress to the seventh point of the incremental scale &mdash; incremental progression for temporary nurses and other health service grades has hitherto been capped at the fifth point of the scale.</P>
    <P>The court also recommended that 2,000 temporary nurses be offered permanent positions. This is an increase of 300 from the previously proposed number of 1,700.  It further recommended that a commission on nursing &ldquo;become a reality within one month from acceptance of the Court's recommendation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the unions decided to defer strike action, pending a ballot of their members, on the revised proposals incorporating the additional gains recommended by the Labour Court.  In the case of SIPTU this decision was taken on 8 February 1997.  In the case of the Irish Nurses Organisation, Psychiatric Nurses Association and IMPACT the decision was taken on 9 February 1997.  No recommendation on the revised proposals is being made by the unions.</P>
    <P>The Government has accepted, in full, the terms of the Labour Court recommendation, including the establishment of the commission on nursing for which chairmanship and terms of reference have been agreed.  It is my earnest hope that there will be a favourable outcome to the ballots currently taking place, enabling us to proceed with implementation of the pay increases due and to allow the next phase of the process of addressing grievances in the profession to commence through the work of the commission.  The contingency planning arrangements drawn up for the threatened strike on 10 February remain in place.  My Department continues to be in direct contact with all of the affected agencies in relation to contingency plans and regional centres have been established to provide an ongoing flow of information on a daily basis to the Department. These arrangements will remain in place until such time as agreement to the terms of the Labour Court recommendation is confirmed by the unions representing nurses.</P>
    <P>Regarding the concerns of retired nurses in relation to their pension entitlements under the deal, it is the Government's intention that retired nurses and other public servants will benefit from the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement.</P>
    <P>The pay proposals developed to date involve an element of restructuring, as provided for under <Col N="17" /> the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement. This applies to nurses and many other groups such as civil servants, clerical and administrative grades in the health boards and local authorities, teachers, gardaí etc. who have or are concluding agreements under the restructuring option of the PCW.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the agreements emerging do not provide for uniform increases across groups and, in many cases, even within grades. This complicates the position regarding adjustments to pensions, and this question will now have to be considered in respect of all affected groups across the public service.</P>
    <P>Detailed discussions on this issue have yet to take place.  When this general policy issue has been resolved, my Department will be in a position to clarify the adjustments to be made for retired health service staff, including nurses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically asked what the contingency plans in respect of retired nurses were, and how they would be affected by this deal.  I also asked about the Government's strategy for dealing with the dispute.  This week the Minister for Finance stated that he will be seeking contributions from other Departments, including the Department of Health, to pay for this deal of over £80 million, should it be accepted.  Can the Minister confirm that one of the proposals of the Department of Finance is that there should be an increase in hospital charges to help pay for the increases to workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy is right in concluding that there is no provision in the 1997 Estimates in respect of the additional moneys that would be required to meet the Labour Court's recommendations.  The position of the Minister for Finance, as a result of a Government decision, is that the Government will continue to live within the expenditure parameters as laid down in the post-budget Book of Estimates for 1997.  Consequently, the Minister for Finance will, in due course, identify savings across all Government Departments.  The savings will not be confined to the Department of Health which consumes about 19 per cent of Government current expenditure.  The Minister for Finance has no proposal in respect of savings in any particular area but, from conversation with him, I know he will not be bringing forward the proposal to which the Deputy alludes, and there will be no increase in hospital charges as a result of the Labour Court recommendation on which the nurses are voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, under the Industrial Relations Act &mdash; which brought about the last minute intervention of the Labour Court in the absence of a Government strategy to deal properly with this issue &mdash; there is a statutory requirement that no undue pressure should be placed on any group of workers who have to consider a Labour Court recommendation? <Col N="18" /> Would he agree that it would be unwise of him to mobilise any other groups to put pressure on nurses to accept this deal in view of the statutory provisions that exist under the Industrial Relations Act to allow people to come to their own decisions independently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is no question whatsoever of any pressure being put on the nursing profession as its members individually consider whether they will vote for or against this deal.  The nursing alliance, which consists of the four nursing unions, is arranging ballots around the country and is briefing members in respect of the Labour Court offer which is additional to the offer made by me in adjudication in 1996.  I would again express the wish that the nurses would accept the offer because it is fair and reasonable, taken in conjunction with the commission which will be chaired by Miss Justice Mella Carroll. That is not putting pressure on anybody, but the hospitals will be on strike on Monday if the offer is turned down.</P>
      <P>In respect of the Deputy's inquiry about the Government's strategy, there were direct negotiations in the first instance.  Subsequently the Labour Relations Commission was asked to intervene in a conciliatory role.  It came forward with proposals which were recommended by the unions.  Subsequently, we went to independent adjudication which was recommended, and the Labour Court intervened.  I cannot dictate the time at which the Labour Court will intervene, but the Deputy is well aware that Programme 2000 was being negotiated by the social partners and being voted on by the representative unions until just before the Labour Court intervention. A Member of Deputy Cowen's experience as a Minister with responsibility for labour relations would have been more than surprised had the Labour Court intervened at a time when the main industrial relations agenda for the next 39 months was being negotiated and voted on.  There was no suggestion of there not being a strategy.</P>
      <P>This is a very difficult, protracted industrial relations dispute which I hope will come to a satisfactory conclusion.  As the nursing unions have said, they are dealing with grievances which have grown up over a 15 year period.  The Labour Court said in its recommendations that the position of the nurses was unique and drew particular attention to the fact that promises about a review which were made to the nurses between 1990 and 1992 were not complied with and that this was a major contributory factor to the annoyance among the nursing profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Labour Court's remarks on the question of a commission, this Government has had responsibility for the Department for the past three years and did not provide a commission either.  On the question of retired nurses, can the Minister explain why SIPTU made its statement on Saturday rather than doing so with the nursing alliance on the <Col N="19" /> Sunday?  Is there any truth in the rumour that a deal has been done by the Minister with SIPTU in relation to retired nurses who were formerly members of SIPTU that allowed it to state earlier than the other unions its position on strike action?  Did the Minister give SIPTU to understand anything that resulted in its position becoming public on Saturday?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is the view of the vast majority of nurses who are now considering this deal that, notwithstanding the merits or demerits of the deal, were it not for the Labour Court intervention, what is on offer would never have been offered in direct negotiations by the Government, and that the strategy of making five different offers, beginning with an offer of £10 million and ending with the Labour Court recommendation of £80 million, is an indictment of the Minister's inability to grasp the legitimacy of the grievances which are now agreed by everybody, including the Minister, as having been justified in the first place?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are a number of questions and allegations.  I will try to deal with the questions.  There is no truth in the Deputy's allegation that a separate arrangement is being made with SIPTU.  All our relationships both at ministerial level and at official level in the Department of Health were with the nursing alliance which was formed specifically to process nursing claims.  That has been the situation all the way through.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the pension claim by retired nurses is as I outlined in my original reply. It is not unique to nurses, but it is the Government's policy that adjustments will be made in pensions of retired civil servants arising out of the various negotiations that have been conducted under phase III of the PCW.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Not only has it varied from profession to profession or from category to category of workers but also there have been differences within grades.  As the Deputy will also be aware, it is a matter for the Minister for Finance to decide on the appropriate level of pension and pension adjustments to be made in respect of any pay offer.  It is the Government's policy that adjustments will be made but the amount will be subject to future consultations and negotiations.</P>
      <P>With regard to members of SIPTU coming out on Saturday and the members of other nursing unions coming out on Sunday, the matter has been explained by SIPTU and I accept the explanation. The Deputy should not try to drive a wedge between the nursing unions.  They have had difficulties with this industrial relations situation and the nursing alliance is the body with which the Labour Court and I dealt.  There is no change in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> The total cost of the award is £80 million.  It has been a protracted and difficult industrial relations problem and it remains difficult.  The difficulties have arisen over a 15 year period and have been magnified by broken promises in 1991 and 1992, as referred to in the Labour Court recommendation. Those broken promises soured relationships to the point that when I became Minister for Health the nurses were not particularly interested in a commission because they did not believe that the promise of such a commission would be delivered upon.  This aspect of the claim was not actively pursued with me until quite recently.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I formally established the consultative council on hepatitis C on 26 November 1996.  The commitment to establishing the council was contained in the health care package which I agreed with the four representative groups &mdash; Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Kidney Association.  The four groups were consulted on the content of the establishment order and each is represented on the council which comprises 16 members in all.</P>
      <P>The statutory instrument establishing the council contains an article providing that an annual report shall be presented to the Minister for Health not later than 30 June in each year, in relation to the performance of its functions during the preceding year.  I see no reason this should not happen this year, although the report is likely to be brief as the council will not have been established during the whole of the preceding year. The first meeting of the council is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, 11 March 1997.</P>

      <P>This consultative council was a central demand of those affected by this tragedy and it has taken the Minister 18 months to organise a meeting of it.  The Minister has changed his public relations but he is still not willing to listen to the victims.  Does the Minister agree that 18 months is an outrageously long time in which to respond to this key demand of the victims of the hepatitis C disaster?  Does he accept that it shows no sense of urgency on the part of his Department? Will the Minister explain why since the first meeting will not take place until March, the research which is available from consultants will not be published as a result of the delay in setting up the council?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not agree with the Deputy.  The health package agreed with the four groups which represent the victims was a package of some magnitude.  We proceeded to implement it as quickly as possible and with full consultation.  The commitment to full consultation was important although it slowed the process. For example, after the initial consultations on the draft order and amendments had been taken into account the second draft order was sent to the four representative groups in August 1996.  The final reply from one of the representative groups was not received until November 1996.  Had we proceeded by diktat the process would have been completed sooner.  However, I wanted to ensure agreement across the board.  We have full agreement to the totality of the health package.</P>
      <P>When the final observations from the association were made available to me in November 1996 I acted immediately by way of statutory instrument to set up the council.  Just before Christmas I received the nominations from the representative groups and over Christmas and in early January I sought the agreement of others to serve, some of whom had to consult with their employers.</P>
      <P>The council is one item in the health package. The Deputy will recall that one of the major items of the package was the provision of free primary care to all victims.  The required legislation, the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, was passed by the Oireachtas in the first half of 1996. At the same time, the arrangements were put in place for the compensation tribunal and the programme of research through the Health Research Board was being organised.  The Health Research Board put it out to tender and the projects are now under way.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made an oblique reference to the publication of research and I do not know what he has in mind.  There is a separate research initiative attached to the Health Research Board. It has been allocated funds and is proceeding to conduct research into hepatitis C.  In general terms, the consultative council will have an overview of what is happening elsewhere.  If the Deputy wishes to raise a particular issue related to research I will have it investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As is the case with semi-State bodies generally, day to day matters relating to the recruitment and employment of staff by the Food Safety Authority will be an executive function of that body and not a matter in which I, as Minister, have a direct function.  I <Col N="22" /> assure the Deputy that the legislation being drafted by my Department provides that the authority will have a complement of staff &mdash; technical, professional and administrative &mdash; reflecting the range of disciplines relevant to the areas in which the authority will have competence. The authority will also have the capacity to engage consultants and or contract out work, if appropriate.</P>
      <P>As regards its progress on recruitment, I understand the interim board, which I appointed in November pending enactment of the legislation, has recruited two staff on a temporary, contract basis &mdash; a part-time acting chief executive and a secretary.  The post of full-time chief executive of the authority has been advertised by the interim board in the news media and interviews for the position have taken place.  The authority will undertake recruitment to other positions at a later date.  With regard to funding for the authority. I refer the Deputy to my speech to the House during the budget debate in which I indicated that provision of £1.5 million is being made for the board to enable it to carry out its work programme for 1997.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputies that the Government is fully committed to processing the legislation on this matter and it is at an advanced stage in my Department.  I have already announced the functions of the authority, which are broadly fourfold. First, the authority will be charged with identifying and, where necessary, having supplemented, the legally binding standards and criteria relevant to food safety and hygiene and to have these published and recognised as enforceable by the authority. Second, it will carry out audits and other related inspections to determine the effectiveness of the systems and the level of enforcement and compliance by the primary control agencies with the recognised, legally binding standards.  It will publish reports of such audits and inspections. Third, the authority, in subsuming the role and functions of the current Food Safety Advisory Board, will act as a major source of advice to me and to other Ministers on food safety and other matters relating to food.  Finally, it is envisaged that the authority will carry out a range of other functions relating to data collection, research and the co-ordination of services.</P>
      <P>The board of the authority will be, essentially, a management board which will be responsible for the performance of the functions of the authority. The board will appoint a scientific committee &mdash; a body of experts with qualifications and experience in the various fields relevant to matters of food safety and hygiene.  The primary function of the scientific committee will be to advise the board on the scientific and technical aspects of food related questions.  The existence of the scientific committee and the importance which will attach to it in the legislation will ensure that decisions of the board on matters of food safety and hygiene are underpinned by a sound scientific basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> To carry out its functions, in particular, its audits and inspections, the authority and its staff will be given extensive powers, including powers of entry, powers to take samples and seize documents and powers to close premises and to order the withdrawal of products.  The authority will also have extensive powers of prosecution both in relation to deficiencies which it identifies during its audits and for obstruction in carrying out its duties.</P>
    <P>These comprehensive proposals will meet the demand for a body sufficiently independent and powerful to verify the standards of good practice throughout the food industry in the area of food safety and hygiene.  As framed, the proposals allow for maximum flexibility and ensure that within the precepts of public accountability, the authority will be independent in the discharge of its functions.</P>

      <P>I note the absence of urgency from the Minister's reply.  Will he agree his announcement to establish a food safety board, almost four months ago, was in response to urgent public concerns as to the quality and safety of food?  The public is not being unreasonable in requiring action in this regard so that it has an authoritative independent voice to reassure it of the quality of Irish food.  Will the Minister agree, in the light of the continuing food scares, about which we read in the press daily &mdash; BSE and the latest involving chickens &mdash; some of which are unwarranted, the public needs an authoritative independent voice rather than to hear from the industry or the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  Will he agree he needs to inject a greater degree of urgency in his Department in respect of the establishment of this board because the public is waiting for it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I assure the Deputy there is no lack of urgency.  The reason the Government, on my recommendation, decided to set up the board on a non-statutory basis was to ensure no time would be lost while waiting for legislation, that the board would be <i>in situ</i> and making the necessary arrangements.  It is making the necessary arrangements.  The first step for any board in taking action, apart from doing its preparatory work, is to advertise for a chief executive.  It is now in a position to conduct interviews.  On the legislative side, it has been given top priority in the Department of Health and has been prioritised by the Government.  I hope within a week or two the heads of the Bill will be with the draftsman's office for drafting as a matter of priority.  I agree with the Deputy this is a matter of fundamental importance and of great urgency.  It should stop us all in our tracks that the two issues concentrating the minds of all of us in the past couple of weeks are the issues of food and water.</P>

I have been living in Ireland for the past few months and I am unaware of strong statements &mdash; or any statements &mdash; being issued by any independent source to reassure the public about a series of food scares.  The public is impatient about the matter of food scares and is waiting for reassurance.</P>
      <P>On a separate but related matter the Minister will be aware of a 14 month old dispute between his Department and environmental health officers.  All our modern legislation on the inspection of food outlets, food in nursing homes and fast food outlets is not being enforced because of this dispute.  Will the Minister give an assurance that dispute will be brought to an end so that some regulatory activity is brought to bear on the sale of food because of the diminishing confidence of the public in the quality of food?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Significant progress has been made in that dispute and I hope it can be resolved at an early date.  In respect of the general supplementary, I do not envisage the food authority making strong statements.  Talk is cheap, what we need is enforcement.  It will operate, under statute, as follows: the food authority will compile all the criteria and standards which are scattered over a multiplicity of Departments and agencies, some of which originated in the House and some in the EU, and examine, complement and amend any inadequacies; it will have power to audit the agencies which have responsibility for applying those standards.  If it finds discrepancies in the audits it will report back &mdash; it is almost analogous to the function carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; and publish the reports.  If in the course of an audit it discovers a lacuna it can move immediately to address it and take on to itself the enforcement powers of the agencies and prosecute a company or individual.  If a food issue arises, which is a matter of grave public concern, it can go in over the head of the relevant authority whether in the Department of the Marine, the local authority, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry or the health board and examine <i>in situ</i> beyond the farm gate to ensure fire brigade action can be taken.  While it will proceed on an agreed plan in the generality of its work, it will have also the power to investigate the difficult situation which may arise and would require immediate action.  I will bring legislation into the Dáil which, apart from the normal considerations of accountability, will provide for the independence of the authority in the exercise of its functions. This is urgent so far as I am concerned.  The work in my Department is complete.  I hope the heads of a Bill will be cleared by Government in a couple of weeks at the latest and it will receive priority for drafting purposes.  I will come back <Col N="25" /> into the House with it at the earliest possible date.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As I advised the House last week, on 17 January last I announced that, following discussions between my Department and BUPA Ireland, agreement had been reached with BUPA Ireland in relation to a dispute concerning the products it had launched here.  BUPA Ireland reaffirmed its commitment to community rating and announced that it intended to introduce a new suite of community rated health insurance products in the near future.</P>
      <P>In the context of the agreement reached, BUPA Ireland agreed to cease actively marketing and to replace, as a matter of urgency, its existing cash plans with a new range of cash plans which would be clearly designed to compete in the already established cash plan market.  I understand that BUPA is informing those making inquiries about its existing cash plans that they will be replaced within a few months.</P>
      <P>I have stated previously in the House that I cannot intervene in the dispute between the Independent Hospital Association of Ireland and the VHI as it would not be appropriate for me to do so in view of my role as the regulatory authority for the health insurance market.  It is a matter for the parties to the dispute to decide if they wish to avail of a third party or adopt other procedures which might help to resolve the dispute.</P>

      <P>In his press release on 17 January the Minister stated that community rating was a core value in the Irish health insurance system. He went on to say that he had agreed to allow the new competitor in the voluntary health insurance market to come forward as a matter of urgency with cash plans which would respect community rating.  Will the Minister agree that the cash plans advertised by BUPA then, and which it is still selling now, do not adhere to the principle of community rating which he has described as a <Col N="27" /> core value in the Irish health insurance system? When I telephoned BUPA today I was told that the cash plans were still on sale.  When I said that I thought these plans had been withdrawn I was told I was mistaken.</P>
      <P>There have been informal consultations between the Department and BUPA on new products.  When will we see these products and when will the Minister insist that companies will be allowed to compete in the voluntary health insurance system only if they adhere to the community rating principle?  Why is the Minister allowing the continued sale of cash plans which do not adhere to the statutory requirements for the granting of a licence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Government's policy in this respect is very clear.  On the one hand, we are committed to community rating, which, in effect, is the law of the land, and, on the other, we are committed to a competitive insurance market.  We want competition in the market and I will not start a witch hunt against BUPA or try to chase it out of the market.  BUPA was the first company to provide competition in the voluntary health insurance market and it is very welcome.  I hope it will be followed by other companies as we want a competitive health insurance market.</P>
      <P>I wish to state equally forcefully that I will not accept a situation where a company which comes into the market refuses to obey the law of the land.  While all health insurers are welcome they must compete on the basis of community rating. My officials had consultations with BUPA during the Christmas period and the new year.  We have arrived at a satisfactory agreement under which BUPA has agreed to withdraw its cash plans as presently presented and introduce a new suite of products.  If that includes cash plans they will not be biased in terms of age and will be community rated.  BUPA has committed itself, in a written agreement with me, to cease to actively market its cash plan products in the meantime.  This is a reasonable arrangement and it is only proper that BUPA should be given some time on its entry to the market to bring forward new products.  It told me on 16 January that it would bring forward the suite of new products in a matter of months.  I have offered BUPA the opportunity to have informal consultations with officials of my Department before it puts the new products on the market, and that offer stands.</P>
      <P>Previously BUPA launched its products without any consultation.  Under the relevant EU directive it was free to market its products without prior consultation with the regulator. However, in light of the difficulty it experienced with the regulator it would be prudent for BUPA to engage in consultations in advance of launching its new products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BUPA has employed people in Cork and I want it to continue in the market.  I am not going to adopt a heavy handed approach to the company <Col N="28" /> when it has complied with the law of the land and has assured me that it will introduce a new suite of products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>If BUPA is complying with the law of the land why is it being required to introduce a new suite of products?  If the Minister's long-winded reply means he is in favour of competition on the one hand and is insisting on adherence to the law on the other, then what is the requirement for a new suite of health products?  Surely BUPA is being required to introduce a new suite of health products precisely because it is not adhering to the community rating principle set out in the law as a prior requirement for competing in the Irish voluntary health insurance system. That is the position.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the requirement on BUPA was not to withdraw its cash plans, which are still on sale today, but rather to cease to advertise them pending the introduction of new ones following consultation and agreement by the Minister that they meet the community rating principle?  Is that the position or is the Minister seeking to mislead the House and have he and BUPA issued misleading public statements? One cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a witch hunt.  I am not interested in a witch hunt; rather I am interested in ensuring that a company licensed to operate in the voluntary health insurance system adheres to the requirements upon which the licence was granted.  If a company does not adhere to these requirements it should withdraw its cash plans until such time as it introduces new ones which adhere to them.  BUPA is continuing to offer cash plans which are not acceptable to the Minister and we are waiting for it to decide when it will comply with the law.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The VHI does not market cash plans, it markets indemnity plans in packages of A, B, C, D and E.  When BUPA entered the market it decided to offer not only indemnity plans but also cash plans.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The £10 million of additional funding announced in the budget will be used to provide new services in 1997, including 160 new residential/respite places; 350 new day care places; the introduction of a home support grant to offer immediate assistance to the carers of those on the waiting list for a residential place, details of which will be announced shortly; the continuation of the ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from inappropriate care settings and the further enhancement of services to persons with autism in line with the recommendations outlined in the Department's policy document on these services.</P>
      <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region will be agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for each region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority this year is to provide as many day and residential places as possible and to increase the support for those families caring for a son or daughter with a mental handicap at home.  I am confident the investment this year in the expansion <Col N="31" /> of services will benefit the majority of families caring for a family member who has been assessed as in need of a day or residential place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that £10 million is a very small amount in these times of economic boom?  Mental handicap has been a problem for many years and I have been maintaining for the past two years that we are not making any indent on this problem.  We have good times at present.  However, Deputy O'Han-lon was able to give £8 million in restrictive times.</P>
      <P>Over 1,500 people wait for residential places and there are still over 1,000 people in psychiatric hospitals who should not be there.  A database is in place, yet we are not making progress.  We are planning on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and are not moving forward on this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I profoundly disagree with the Deputy.  The additional money for this year amounted to £12 million &mdash; not £10 million &mdash; of which £2 million was put aside and allocated to meet identified needs in existing services.  It is a significant step forward to have 160 extra residential/respite places and 350 new day care places.  The Deputy will recall in regard to people in inappropriate settings that last year he asked me about St.  Ita's in Portrane.  Two million pounds was provided last year for premises so that people in inappropriate settings could be moved to more appropriate settings.  In some settings, such as Madonna House, places are ready for people to take up residence.  We have an ongoing programme and substantial progress has been made.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the home support grant because this recognises that there are people who require residential places who will not be facilitated this year but a grant will be made available to their families so that further supports can be provided in the home.  This is in addition to the home support scheme introduced in 1992 which has been very successful.  A great deal has been achieved and £12 million in revenue this year is a substantial amount of money in the context of meeting the needs of this group of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The experience on the ground is that health boards and other bodies will not receive the £12 million in 1997 and that much of this money will not be coming on stream until September.  Will this money be spent this year? What about the five year programme for the development of the mental handicap service?  It was supposed to be initiated last year but there is no word on that at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are boom times according to the Government and people with a mental handicap, their parents and carers expected to receive more. This is a section of society that needs urgent attention.  Less than 10 per cent of total health funding goes to this area and we are not dealing <Col N="32" /> with it.  How much of that money will be allocated to health boards this year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Allocations in respect of the £2 million designated to meet identified needs in existing services have been notified.  As I said in my reply, the regional co-ordinating committees will come back to the Department with their recommendations as to how the extra funding should be used.  I hope to be in a position shortly to notify health boards of their allocations. Consequent to that, the recommendations from the various groups will come back.  Time will not be lost unnecessarily and it is my firm commitment, and that of the Government, that the money allocated will achieve the optimum in terms of additional services for this client group.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will see from the table that there are variations between males and females in the incidence of various types of cancer.  These variations may be due to the use of tobacco and alcohol, differences in diet and other lifestyle factors. However, cancer is generally seen as a multifactorial disease and it is rarely possible to identify a single causative factor.  Overall variations in crude incidence rates will also result from differences in the population's age profile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 28 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The statement by the medical director of St. Luke's Hospital regarding the treatment provided to people diagnosed with cancer must be taken in its correct context.  My Department has confirmed with the medical director that he referred to differing practices in the treatment of cancer in Ireland and that he had not alleged patients were not receiving treatment.  I understand he suggested that one type of treatment for cancer &mdash; radiotherapy &mdash; was not being used as commonly in Ireland as in other countries when compared with alternative treatments for cancer such as surgery and chemotherapy.  As reported in one of the newspaper articles on the subject, the medical director stressed that there was no evidence of systematic denial of radiotherapy to patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Cancer Strategy, which I published on 5 November last, emphasises the importance of providing the most appropriate type of treatment to each new case presenting. The strategy notes this can be helped by a concentrated approach to identifying and implementing best practice so that all patients receive the most appropriate form of treatment. To this end the strategy promotes such steps as the development of protocols for diagnosis and treatment; agreement between clinicians as to which types of cancer can best be treated where; and agreement regarding the minimum and maximum case loads for clinicians.  My Department published a set of expert guidelines on the safe administration of chemotherapy in conjunction <Col N="34" /> with the publication of the National Cancer Strategy and I anticipate these guidelines will be the first of a number of such initiatives in the area of cancer treatment.</P>
    <P>There is considerable international debate among experts about what constitutes a valid measure of survival in cancer.  Comparison of cancer survival rates is subject to many qualifications which make it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions when comparing between sites or between countries.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Strategy reaffirms the target set by the health strategy <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> in relation to mortality from cancer.  This target is to reduce the death rate from cancer in the under 65 age group by 15 per cent in the ten year period between 1994 and 2004.  I do not consider it useful to set more detailed targets for survival rates in view of the difficulties of comparison and of interpretation to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Registry Board is developing its database on the incidence and prevalence of cancer in Ireland.  This will provide a useful picture of the major problem areas and it will help target resources towards the most successful areas of prevention and treatment.</P>
    <P>On breast screening, mammography services are currently used mainly as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or worried women on referral from their general practitioner.  Following the experience of a pilot programme of organised screening run by the Mater Foundation, I announced details of the first phase of a national programme of breast screening some time ago.  Expert clinical advice is that the target age group should be women aged between 50 and 64 years.  The pilot programme which ran from 1990 to 1994 had a target population of 35,000 women or 16 per cent of all women in this age group.  The first phase of the national programme, which will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas, will have a target population of 120,000 women or 50 per cent of all women in this age group.</P>
    <P>I will shortly announce an action plan indicating how I propose to implement the initiatives in the National Cancer Strategy.  This will include measures on the development of the national breast screening programme.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As I announced in the cancer strategy, services will be provided at central hospitals in each health board area, but in respect of some expensive treatments for which people are referred from acute hospitals, three centres will be available; one in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway.  It is in those areas that the possibility of radiotherapy and chemotherapy arises.</P>

      <P>The Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997 was circulated 12 or 13 days ago.  In normal circumstances it takes a few weeks for Second and Committee Stages of a Bill to pass through the House. Our spokesperson on the Marine agreed to take the Bill this week and, while we are happy to do that, we are not prepared to take all Stages in two hours tonight.  Will the Taoiseach agree to take only Second Stage between 8.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. tonight?  When our spokesperson returns from the conference he is attending, he can agree a time for Committee and remaining Stages.  We will not agree to take all Stages of a Bill circulated 12 or 13 days ago in two hours tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An agreement, once made, should be adhered to.  It is my understanding that it was agreed to take all Stages today.  I have no problem with a discussion taking place between the Whips but, as was explained to the Opposition during the consultations which resulted in the agreement to take all Stages today, this is an urgent matter.  It is not a case of simply wanting to pass legislation quickly.  There is a legal urgency about the matter and hence the need to <Col N="37" /> comply with the agreement reached with the Opposition to take all Stages today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is bad practice to take all Stages of a Bill together.  As the Bill was circulated only 12 or 13 days ago Second Stage should be taken tonight and amendments tabled later in the week.  We normally do not sit later than 8.30 p.m.  We recently sat late to rush through a Bill relating to the marine and this week we are doing likewise.  I am not proposing that the debate on the Bill should carry over to next week, but if it deals with an urgent matter why was it circulated only in recent days?  Will the Taoiseach agree to take Second Stage tonight, following which the Minister and our spokesperson can agree a time to take the remaining Stages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the urgency in this matter is that safety at sea depends on the legality of the navigational arrangements being made by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  As a result of a Supreme Court decision there is a question mark over the legal liability of the commissioners in this regard.  That is why the legislation must be passed urgently.  It should be recognised that navigational aids at sea provide for the protection of people at sea in life and death circumstances.  Hence the reason for the agreement to take all Stages of the Bill tonight and that agreement should be honoured by Members opposite.</P>

      <P>I expressed interest in this matter on a previous Order of Business.  Apart from indirect representations from the French Navy &mdash; which I am sure we are not here to serve &mdash; I am not aware of representations from maritime interests indicating that the Bill should be rushed through the House tonight.  Will the Taoiseach agree to a full Committee Stage debate during which Members can tease out matters properly? It would not be in the interests of navigation to rush through this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach persists in stating that an agreement was reached in this regard.  It was agreed to take the legislation this week and we are honouring that.  I am well aware of the navigational interests in this matter.  I am probably more familiar with Loran C, which will be included in the legislation, than many other Members of the House.  The argument is about a 735 foot pylon erected in the Irish Sea some time ago and I accept that science has moved matters forward since then.  I am not disagreeing with the arguments in that regard, we can do that during the Second Stage debate.  I am requesting adequate time for Members who have a genuine interest in this matter to discuss it.  We agreed the legislation should be passed by 5 p.m. on Thursday and we will honour that agreement.  I hope nobody on the board of the Commissioners of Irish Lights, of which I was a member when Lord Mayor of Dublin, will be jailed by an order <Col N="38" /> of the Supreme Court before then.  I am suspicious about why the Government wants to rush this matter through in a few hours.</P>

      <P>I remind the Taoiseach that the agreement I reached with him is that a Bill will be published, two weeks later Second Stage will be taken, two weeks later Committee Stage will be taken and a week later Report Stage will be taken.  Surely the agreement between the Taoiseach and myself overrides the agreement between spokespersons, which is to take the Bill this week.  I propose the following amendment to the Order of Business, to delete item No. 2 and substitute &ldquo;Second Stage of No. 4 shall be taken tonight&rdquo;.

I had the opportunity to take advice on them too and I am advised that not alone are they appropriate but they are necessary for the kinds of reasons I outlined on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems difficult that a Bill should pass through <Col N="48" /> these Houses and become law and refer in the past tense to an agreement between the Irish and British Governments even though that agreement is not yet in existence and might or might not come into existence at some time in the future. One of the things that the agreement would envisage, if and when it came into existence, is the establishment of a commission for the purpose of decommissioning weapons which would receive the weapons or make arrangements for their reception.  However, one cannot refer to these things, the agreement and the commission which might be part of the agreement, in a Bill which will become law here as if that agreement and, therefore, the commission, already existed. They do not exist.  The appropriate way of referring to them is as an intended agreement between the two Governments and a commission which is intended to be established by that agreement.  It will not change anything very radically, but at least it will get the tenses and the circumstances right.  It seems to me that these amendments should be accepted.</P>
    <P>The terms will be read as of the date on which the Bill is passed and becomes law.  If, on that date, it is a proposed or intended agreement and a commission which it is intended will be established, then that is correct.  The only answer to this point which the Minister seemed to have on Committee Stage was the fact that, if and when the agreement was entered into at some time in the future, there would then be an agreement in existence and, therefore, one could not have this Bill referring to an intended or proposed agreement, but it is perfectly proper and correct for this Bill to refer to a proposed agreement if the agreement has not been entered into.</P>
    <P>Think back over some previous agreements between the Irish and British Governments.  If legislation had been introduced in this House before the Anglo-Irish Agreement was entered into which envisaged agreement being entered into at some time in the future but it was not then actually entered into, one could not refer to it in the past tense as being something which is now in existence.  It might never have happened.</P>
    <P>In this instance it may never happen because, of course, the circumstances under which former Senator Mitchell and his two colleagues reported have changed.  Their report was made at a time when there was a ceasefire and when there was no formal violence, that is, no violence against the security violence and no indiscriminate violence. There was, unfortunately, permanent personal violence in the sense that punishment shootings and beatings were taking place on both sides of the divide, but the circumstances are now different. It may be impossible in the future to apply the Mitchell report in the particular context in which it was written and published.</P>
    <P>One cannot refer to an agreement in existence between the two Governments when that agreement is not in existence.  I hope there will be such an agreement at some time in the future but the Minister confirmed on Committee Stage that it is <Col N="49" /> not impossible to envisage circumstances in which it might not happen.  It might all have to be done in a different way.  If it does happen and, let us say, such an agreement is entered into by the two Governments in July and August and this Bill is passed in February or March, it is open to those who would wish to challenge such an arrangement &mdash; and we all know such people exist &mdash; to say that the Bill is defective.</P>
    <P>The example I gave the Minister was the Fisheries Bill, 1995.  She concurred that the same principle applied, even though I pointed out it is the converse of this.  That Bill was not passed when a delegation order was made and, therefore, was not covered by the delegation order.  We saw the result of that in this House in the past few weeks. The Minister for the Marine had to introduce a second Bill, which contained nine sections and was almost as long as the first one, to rectify the error made in the first one.  The same principle applies here and I am trying to avoid that.</P>
    <P>I have taken advice on this from a reputable source.  I will not name the people concerned here.  I asked them if there was a particular principle of jurisprudence on which I could hang this argument and they said it was a matter of common sense.  I was told the Bill would be wrong if it were enacted in its present form because it refers to something as a <i>fait accompli</i>, which is not a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    <P>There have been instances of legislation passed here and, I am sure, elsewhere envisaging an agreement in the future and specifying that is what is envisaged, but not of legislation purporting to underwrite an agreement that does not yet exist.  One cannot approve in statute in the past tense something that does not yet exist.  One can approve of something that does not yet exist if one says it is intended or proposed to have such an agreement and under it to set up a commission some time in the future.  These amendments will not involve any great change.  I tabled them to avoid an error.  An error of this kind was made during the past 18 months or less.  It had to be rectified and this involved some slight difficulty and embarrassment.  I do not want to see that repeated unnecessarily.</P>

      <P>I respectfully submit that we hear Deputy O'Donoghue and any other Member who wishes to intervene so that the Minister might take all the views into consideration, especially in the situation where one is allowed to speak only once.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley argued cogently on Committee Stage and today that one cannot legislate in the manner provided for in this legislation for something that is to happen in the future and that one should not provide for something in the present tense which shall be established in the future.  That makes sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition section of the legislation states the agreement means the agreement between the Government and the Government of the United <Col N="50" /> Kingdom establishing the commission, but if the agreement does not exist it is difficult to see how one could envisage a commission already existing. While I accept it is not the Minister's intention to convey that impression, nonetheless the fact that the agreement is referred to in the present tense indicates it is in existence, when it is not; in the same way the commission could not possibly be in existence.</P>
    <P>I accept this legislation is aspirational.  The Minister and her Department would have had considerable difficulty drafting this technical legislation on something to which we all aspire, the decommissioning of arms across the spectrum. I do not believe the Minister's objective will be interfered with much by inserting the words Deputy O'Malley suggests.  Inserting the words &ldquo;intended to be&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;intended&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; will not damage the legislation although the Minister argued strongly that one might need to amend it subsequently if those words are inserted indicating a future event.  I am not sure her argument stands up because once the intended commission is in place, it will have to be acknowledged as a matter of fact and as a matter of law that the agreement and the commission, which were intended to be in place, will then be in place rendering the word &ldquo;intended&rdquo; superfluous because the Bill would come into operation in effect on that date.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, this is not a matter of life and death although this legislation is about life and death.  The provisions he seeks to have inserted in the Bill were put forward by him in good faith with a view to improving and fire proofing it against a possible challenge.  Unless the Minister has a cogent alternative argument, I support Deputy O'Malley's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who have spoken.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, I undertook to reconsider this issue before this Stage.  Deputy O'Malley was concerned about this on Committee Stage and remains concerned despite my best efforts to explain why his amendments are not needed.  I indicated then that my advice was that the definitions did not require that the agreement be in existence at the time of the enactment of the Bill.  As I committed to do, I undertook to have serious discussions with my officials, the legal adviser to the Government and the drafts people to consider what Deputy O'Malley said.  I did that and the earlier advice I received on the matter has been confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of that advice is that the common law principle that legislation is &ldquo;always speaking&rdquo; meets the difficulties the Deputy anticipates.  I will go further and say that the advice given states that a statutory provision has to be considered first and foremost as a norm of the legal system as it is currently whence it takes its force rather than just a product of a particular parliament at a certain time.  A statutory provision has a legal existence independent of the historical contingencies <Col N="51" /> of its promulgation and, accordingly, should be interpreted in the light of its place within the system of legal norms currently in force.  Such an approach takes into account the viewpoint of the ordinary legal interpreter of today who expects to apply ordinary current meanings to legal texts.  Page 117 of the fourth edition of Thornton's <i>Legislative Drafting</i> illustrates that principle, which is equally applicable in Irish law by reference to the following provision of the New Zealand law, &ldquo;An Enactment applies to circumstances as they arise so far as its text, purpose and context permit.&rdquo;  This principle of statutory construction when applied to the relevant sections of the Bill ensures that if and when an agreement is made between the two Governments and a commission established, the Act will apply as required by circumstances that then exist.  Other rules of statutory interpretation would equally point to such a result.</P>
    <P>The effect of Deputy O'Malley's amendments would be that the Act would not be able to accommodate changing circumstances.  That was also a problem with the amendments he tabled on Committee Stage and, although he has slightly modified them here, that problem still exists.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendments would be that the agreement and the commission would, by definition, always be the &ldquo;intended&rdquo; agreement and the &ldquo;intended&rdquo; commission.  That, it seems, would be likely to give rise to greater confusion in law and in fact.</P>
    <P>In Deputies O'Malley and O'Donoghue, I am facing two lawyers but perhaps I can allay some of their remaining concerns by highlighting constitutional and statutory precedents for the approach adopted in the Bill.  I refer them to two such precedents.  Article 34 of the Constitution provides <i>inter alia</i> that &ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law...&rdquo;.  Kelly &mdash;<i>The Irish Constitution</i>, 3rd Edition, 1994 &mdash; relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in the State (Killian) <i>v</i> Minister for Justice [1954] I.R. 207, states that the words of Article 34 &ldquo;contemplated the <i>future</i> fresh establishment of courts to replace those exercising jurisdiction at the date of the Constitution's enactment&rdquo;.  Those courts were only established by the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act, 1961 &mdash; No. 38 of 1961 &mdash; which was itself expressed to be &ldquo;An Act to establish, in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution, a court...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A statutory precedent bearing on the approach adopted in the Decommissioning Bill can also be found in the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990 &mdash; No. 18 of 1990 &mdash; which I believe was enacted when Deputy O'Malley's party was in Government.  This Act defines &ldquo;the Agency&rdquo; as meaning the National Treasury Management Agency &ldquo;established&rdquo; by section 3 in circumstances where the agency was to be established after the passing of the Act.  The procedure in that Act involved an establishment day appointed by way of ministerial order.  The <Col N="52" /> Decommissioning Bill also envisages that, at some future time, the commission will be established by agreement.  Section 9 contains a starting date for the Bill to come into force.</P>
    <P>I do not know the source of Deputy O'Malley's advice and I can only provide him with the advice I received from the Attorney General.  I tried to discover whether the Deputy's concerns could be taken on board because I do not want the legislation to be flawed.  However, I am satisfied with the advice I received.  I am also satisfied that the Bill as it is now framed will not, as Deputy O'Malley fears, negate its intended purpose to establish, by agreement, a commission in the future.  Therefore, I believe the Bill does not require further amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I do not have access to the various documents to which the Minister referred.  However, the two examples she used to illustrate her point are very weak.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted Article 34 as stating &ldquo;courts established by law&rdquo;.  However, she was quoting from the Constitution which is in no way analogous to this Bill which is ordinary legislation. There is no way that the phrase in the Constitution which makes reference to &ldquo;courts established by law&rdquo; can mean anything other than &ldquo;courts to be established by law&rdquo;.  Courts could not be already established if they were to be established under the Constitution.  Clearly, the meaning is &ldquo;courts to be established by law&rdquo; and it is impossible that another meaning could be inferred.  To seek to prove a point relating to the construction of legislation by using something that is not legislation in the ordinary sense &mdash; the Constitution &mdash; is false.  The Constitution takes precedence over all legislation and the two cannot be interpreted in the same way.</P>
      <P>The other example to which the Minister referred involves the establishment, under an Act of 1990, of the National Treasury Management Agency.  What was the purpose of that Act?  Like other legislation, it was designed to establish a board or statutory body &mdash; these are sometimes referred to as &ldquo;quangos&rdquo;.  The Minister referred to &ldquo;the Agency&rdquo;, as it is described in the Act, established by section 3.  Of course it was established by section 3.  I could name approximately 100 such bodies which were established by an Act.  However, that which is referred to in the Decommissioning Bill will not be established by it.  The proposed commission will be established by an agreement which has not yet been entered into, which is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency was established by an Act and it came into legal existence on the day that Act was passed or, if it was different, on the day designated as its operative date.  The commission will not be established by this Bill.  The definition in section 1 states that it will be established by the agreement.  The term &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; refers to an agreement between the Government and the Government of the United Kingdom establishing the commission, which is <Col N="53" /> framed in the present tense.  Therefore, the two examples to which the Minister referred do not work and do not invalidate he point I made earlier.</P>
    <P>I considered the British Bill to see if I could obtain enlightenment.  I did not do so because, as I informed the Minister on Committee Stage, the British approach this subject in a different way. Their draft Bill is very different and, in a sense, one would be of the opinion that they are not dealing with the same matter because their way of drafting legislation is different.  It seems to be somewhat shorter and expeditious and does not refer to &ldquo;the agreement&rdquo; but to &ldquo;an agreement&rdquo;. There is a great deal of difference between a reference to &ldquo;the agreement&rdquo;, which can only mean a specific agreement already in existence, and &ldquo;an agreement&rdquo;.  Of its nature, the term &ldquo;an agreement &ldquo;is indefinite while the term &ldquo;the agreement&rdquo; is definite because of its use of the definite article.  However, there is no definite agreement. If the Minister will not accept the amendment, she should change the definition to mean &ldquo;an agreement&rdquo; between the Government and the Government of the United Kingdom.  The provision could then read &ldquo;The commission means a commission established by the agreement referred to above&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister's point is valid. The examples to which she referred are misplaced and ill-founded attempts to highlight that point.  The first invoked the Constitution, which clearly envisages the establishment of something after its adoption, but the Bill refers to an agreement in existence when there is no such agreement. I do not want to waste time arguing because this is not a matter of great significance. However, it is one of plain common sense.  That is my reaction and it was also the reaction of others I respect when I inquired about this issue.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that the Minister insists on standing over something that is indefensible.  Certainly the two examples she gave do not defend the point she makes.  The National Treasury Management Agency was not set up by any agreement, present, future or past; it was set up by an Act of the Oireachtas as were 50, 80, maybe 100 other such bodies.  Section 3 of that Act provides that there shall be an agency to be known as the National Treasury Management Agency and it shall have the following powers and functions. That has been repeated time and again in this House in legislation.  However, this is a different and quite distinct matter.  It is interesting that the British legislation does not refer to the agreement, to something as already having come into existence.  It refers to it in an indefinite way which, if one were to choose between the two, certainly seems the more logical way of doing it.</P>

      <P>The constitutional analogy can stand up.  The Constitution is entirely different to legislation in that the Constitution is passed by the people, who are supreme in matters of this kind, whereas legislation is passed by this House. Deputy O'Malley has adequately answered the argument on the National Treasury Management Agency.  I see no reason to change my mind.  I accept that the Minister is acting in good faith, but it would certainly appear most undesirable to refer to a matter as being in existence when it is not in existence.  It underlines the grave difficulty that always presents itself when one tries to legislate for an aspiration.</P>

      <P>I assure Deputy O'Malley I am not ignoring all he says or declining to take on board his amendments because of pigheadedness.  The advice to me is that the legislation as tabled is correct, that we do not need to include these words and that there is a greater likelihood that including them would do damage in the future rather than improving the Bill.  If Deputy O'Malley were in this seat he would take whatever advice he got.  I have been willing all along to take on board amendments to legislation, but I am satisfied in this instance with the advice I have got.  The reason I used the constitutional example was to show that the word &ldquo;established&rdquo;, standing as a word, can be taken to mean &ldquo;to be established&rdquo;. Deputy O'Malley has taken that meaning from the word &ldquo;established&rdquo; in the National Treasury Management Agency legislation.  If the Deputy reads &ldquo;to be established&rdquo; in other legislation when those words are not written, the same can apply to this legislation.  This legislation is an enabling measure containing two sections which will require proactive actions by the Minister and the Secretary of State to bring it into force. Deputy O'Malley and I will have to agree to differ. I am sure if the Deputy's legal adviser and my legal adviser got together they would have hours of useful debate on the matter.  However, neither are here, and I have a responsibility to take the legislation forward.  With the greatest of respect to the advice Deputy O'Malley has got, I am satisfied that we do not need this amendment, and I cannot take it on board because of the risk, however slight, that the legislation might be the poorer for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of the passage of this Bill to thank all Members who participated in the debate.  It was an important debate, albeit that the legislation was enabling legislation.  The Committee Stage debate gave us an opportunity to clarify exactly why we are bringing in the legislation in its present form.  The Government passionately believes a resolution of the Northern Ireland issue can only be achieved by exclusively <Col N="57" /> peaceful and democratic means.  Violence and the threat of violence is not only morally wrong but it will not help to bring about a solution.  Those who have engaged in violence for the past 27 years must realise it did not get them what they wanted.  It is a matter of great distress to everybody that the violence has continued over the past few months.  The use of violence continues to make it more difficult to find a solution.</P>
      <P>The Bill can play an important part in securing a future free of violence, or the threat of violence, as it represents a first important step in establishing the framework whereby the recommendations of the international body's report on decommissioning can be given effect.</P>
      <P>At the Northern Ireland talks during the past seven or eight months, we have been talking about the international body's report.  It took us many months to reach the stage where we got agreement on the rules and procedures for those talks.  We have not yet progressed to the more substantial issue of how we handle decommissioning but this legislation, like the legislation going through the House of Lords, will help set the framework in which the international body's report can be put into effect when we have reached agreement with the British Government to establish a commission on decommissioning. The House's endorsement of the Bill &mdash; and I hope its early passage into law after it goes to the Seanad &mdash; will serve to demonstrate not only our good faith on the issue of decommissioning but our willingness to bring it forward in keeping with the recommendations of the international body's report.  That report will be quoted for many years throughout the world in areas of conflict as a masterpiece of ingenuity and, perhaps, conciseness and lucidity in the way in which it put the case together on how its authors thought decommissioning could be handled.  I pay tribute to former Senator George Mitchell, Mr. Harri Holkeri and General John De Chastelain for the work they have done in preparing that report and the work they are continuing to do &mdash; at times frustrating &mdash; in the Northern Ireland talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is enabling in character in certain important respects.  It ensures we will be able to give effect to any agreement consistent with the report of the international body on how the decommissioning process is to be handled in practical terms.  There is a certain amount of frustration among Members that we did not have a more substantial Bill spelling everything out.  On Committee Stage Deputy O'Donoghue agreed that was not the way to set down an exact prescription of how decommissioning was to take place because it would be neither in keeping with the international body's report nor conducive to ensuring we get decommissioning.  That we say something has to be decommissioned and how it can be done does not mean we will get it.  We need those people who are continuing their campaign of violence &mdash; the people with the guns, weapons, semtex and all the other bomb-making equipment at their disposal &mdash; and those at a political <Col N="58" /> level who are unable to convince them to stop the violence at the talks.</P>
    <P>The work we have done in passing this legislation is a good day's work on our behalf as a Parliament.  I thank all Deputies who have contributed to the Bill.  I express my appreciation of the constructive and thoughtful way in which they have put forward amendments and made their contributions.  In this way we send a clear message to the men of violence that we do not in any way condone violence as a means of getting what they want.  I avail of this opportunity to call on the men of violence to lay down their arms and allow their political partners into the talks with a view to making progress towards a lasting peace on this island.</P>

      <P>My party is pleased to have co-operated in the passage of this legislation.  My fervent hope and prayer is that this legislation will be implemented <i>de facto</i> and that the day will come when all sides to the conflict in the North will hand over their arms.</P>
      <P>I join the Minister in thanking the international body, particularly its esteemed chairman, the former Senator George Mitchell.  The legislation represents a statement of magnanimity and generosity on the part of the people of the Republic. My sincere wish is that that generosity and magnanimity will be reciprocated by those involved in violence in the North.</P>
      <P>The legislation on decommissioning is of considerable importance.  I acknowledge the role of the Minister for Justice and her Department in relation to the publication of this legislation.  I acknowledge also the tremendous contribution of all those involved over the years in trying to bring about a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the North.  We can draft and pass all the legislation required but it is those who are actually involved in violence who must answer the hard question &mdash; which is the request and prayer of everybody on this island who believes in constitutional politics &mdash; and hand over their arms to a decommissioning body in order that we can have, at long last, a peaceful resolution of our problems in the interests of all the children of this country and future generations.</P>

      <P>I agree with the whole principle of the Bill.  I have had a few disagreements with the Minister about some of the detail and the drafting but they are not matters of fundamental importance.  Of fundamental importance are the objectives of the Bill, if and when they are ever reached.  I am less optimistic about their being reached than I would have been on the day I read the Mitchell report in January 1996.  Unhappily for us the situation has deteriorated greatly since then.  People have commented over the past week on the horrible and cowardly murder at Bessbrook last week as being a kind of turning point. The only sense in which it was a turning point was that a human being lost his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> Since Mitchell made his report in January 1996 there has been an upsurge in punishment killings and beatings to which he refers in his six basic democratic principles.  He said they should stop and that all parties or potential parties to the talks should take effective steps to prevent such actions, but that has not happened.  Between 1994 and 1996 there has been a quadrupling of these incidents amounting to several hundred per year. They are unspeakably horrible but because they do not normally constitute a murder and we seem to be so inured to excessive violence, we almost accept this type of activity as the norm.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm to remind ourselves what it constitutes.  It is a highly sophisticated way of trying to cripple young people, usually young men, by breaking their knees and elbows so that the best medical and surgical science cannot put them together again.  The fact that it goes on in any society is an indication of how extraordinarily abnormal the society is.  It is not confined to one side in that two thirds of it is reputed to be carried out by what is called the republic side and one third by what is called the loyalist side.  It is equally reprehensible from either side.  That it happens on an almost daily basis is disgusting. There should be a greater outcry against this activity and we should not just wring our hands in public when tragically there is a murder, although that is even more awful.</P>
    <P>The Mitchell report, the principles contained therein and the recommendations made were in effect repudiated by at least two groups, one of which, as has been pointed out, was the British Government.  The British Government chose to disregard the kernel of Mitchell and to pick out a passing reference to the possibility of an electoral process in a remote and obscure paragraph and suggest that it was the essence of the report.  It proceeded to hold an election on that basis which the majority in this House said would only have the effect of polarising an already polarised situation in Northern Ireland.  Unhappily, that is precisely what happened.  It was also rejected by those who only a few weeks after the report was published went back to their former ways, starting with Canary Wharf and continuing at frequent intervals to Bessbrook.  We have no idea when they might stop.</P>
    <P>Whatever about this country, the sooner there is an election in Britain so that meaningful talks may resume, the better.  It is incomprehensible to people outside these two islands that there is so little meaningful talk and that the vacuum which, therefore, must exist is allowed to be filled in such a way.  It is a great tragedy for all of us.  If this had started a few months ago, it would be awful and we would lament it.  However, the fact that it started 27 or 28 years ago and that we may be inured to it in certain senses does not remove its horror, the need to bring it to an end and to ask <Col N="60" /> those involved in these awful actions to think and act as human beings for a change.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>During my opening remarks on the last occasion, I reminded the House that the 1980 task force report on child care anticipated major children's legislation which would fill a legislative vacuum of 80 years in one enactment. However, there have been four pieces of legislation and this Children Bill is, in the context of issues raised in that report, the last piece of a jigsaw, which I welcome.  Last week I considered sections 1 to 7 briefly and I also made some remarks on child detention schools.  This section is welcome because we have finally clarified the areas of responsibility between the various Departments in terms of age groups, children who come before the courts in need of care and custodial care.  A reasonably broad and sophisticated range of options is provided for in the legislation to ensure a better response.  That response will only be possible if the Departments responsible are to the fore in providing sufficient places.  We have been appalled by the number of times responsible health boards have been forced by the courts to provide care.  It is important to be vigilant to ensure resources are provided and that Departments are proactive in using the legislation to ensure the youngsters coming into care through the legal or care process get opportunities and that we use this time to rehabilitate, develop and improve and not worsen their situation.</P>
      <P>A section of the Bill which received little attention but which is of great interest to me and to the Select Committee on Social Affairs is the one on the protection of children.  Important and welcome changes have been made in modernising and updating the 1908 Children Act.  The Minister of State will be aware that the Select Committee has been looking at this area for some time.  A number of Members of the committee are committed to the ISPCC campaign on banning the physical punishment of children as soon as is legislatively or socially possible.  One of the major and welcome changes in this Bill is the removal from the Children's Act, 1908 of the section dealing with the right of chastisement. The right of parents to chastise children is still covered by common law.  I hope we come back to that issue in the future.  However, this is a significant improvement.  There is also much to be welcomed in the improved definitions in the sections on cruelty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our committee looked at a number of matters which are not covered in the Bill.  We will correspond in some detail with the Minister and propose amendments.  The Minister has indicated he <Col N="61" /> will deal with some areas but he has not mentioned sexual assault.  He said there may be additional sections on sexual exploitation so perhaps our concerns will be met but the Bill as drafted does not include sexual assault in the list of actions which constitutes cruelty and this is a significant omission.</P>
    <P>Our committee received advice on the area of mental health, which is more difficult to define and deal with in law but if the Bill is to be comprehensive it should be included.  Children have a right under the UN Convention to be free from both emotional and mental abuse.</P>
    <P>We are also concerned that ill-treatment is not defined and we hope that it can include bullying, which is a frightening and damaging problem for many children and regularly hits the headlines. Almost no laws can be applied in such cases except the law of assault.  Our committee will correspond with the Minister and propose a definition which will include actions which are likely to cause suffering or injury &mdash; not trivial incidents but significant sustained campaigns which are all too common in school yards.  This legislation could be usefully amended to deal with this problem, which many young people face.  Those are the major areas covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>While it may be covered in other legislation, the committee believes that the Bill, in changing the right of chastisement, does not deal with the rights of teachers, child care workers, nannies and babysitters.  Many parents would be surprised to find that those groups have the right under law to physically punish children.  Most jurisdictions which have not limited parents' right of chastisement have restricted that right for teachers and others.  We have banned its practice by teachers under regulations made by the Department of Education but the defence would still exist in common law even after the changes proposed in this Bill.  Most people would be happy to see a change in this area and our committee will return to this point.  In the future, the quality of our society will be judged by the way we treat children.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the world summit in 1990 focused attention on the condition of children. The reality of life for children in the Third World is well-known; millions of them die or are caught in circumstances beyond their control.  The key to greater and faster action worldwide is to make children a high political priority, by dramatically improving their status as people.  The degree to which we respect their civil rights, including their physical integrity and their protection from all forms of interpersonal violence, is a testament to our view on the status of children and people in general.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important piece of the legislative jigsaw but the Minister has indicated in recent months that he plans to do something more. When a substantive Bill is passed, there is always a danger that we think the work is done for ten years.  However, we will always have to return to <Col N="62" /> the issue of physical violence against children, the quality, nature and extent of our child care and the constitutional position of children in our society.  The rights of families are much stronger than the rights of children, which poses difficulties in legislating adequately to protect them in families and other areas.</P>
    <P>I would be happy if, in the remaining months of this Dáil, the Minister was able to deliver on his other public commitment to establish an ombudsman for children.  There is a substantial body of legislation and the Minister can be proud of bringing this significant Bill before the House and finally putting it into law.  If an office of ombudsman for children was established, he would have set up not only a legal framework but a passionate champion of children's rights who would ensure it would not be another 80 years before we reconsidered the rights of children.  By virtue of the office, we would review these matters on an ongoing basis and individual and general issues relating to children would be properly and adequately advanced.  The Minister stated his intention to do this in the policy document, <i>Putting Children First</i>.  When replying to Second Stage, perhaps he would update the House on his plans.  If he establishes that office as well as introducing this legislation, he will have done remarkable work for our children during his period in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  It has taken a long time to bring forward this legislation, which was previously referred to as the Juvenile Justice Bill; its preparation was signalled over 20 years ago. Drafting the Bill became the subject of serious differences between three Departments as to which would take on the responsibility, because it was intended to address the main issues regarding child care, including juvenile justice and adoption.</P>
      <P>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, greater public awareness of child care and of the neglect of much needed support services which lacked resources and investment became apparent.  At that time the problem of deprived children and the great deficiencies in child care services was the subject of much public comment and media interest.  Health authorities had little involvement in child care and few social workers were employed.  Over 2,000 children were living in institutions, many of which were old and unsuitable buildings.</P>
      <P>The treatment of young offenders came in for particular public criticism.  They were still being sent to old, Victorian-style reformatories and industrial schools such as Artane, Daingean and Letterfrack.  The regime in those institutions was harsh and more concerned with punishment than rehabilitation.  Recent information from former residents indicates and confirms the view which was widely held in the 1960s and 1970s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the establishment of the health boards in 1970 the position began to change, however <Col N="63" /> slowly at first.  In response to the Kennedy report the Department of Education began to provide family-style children's group homes and new purpose-built facilities for young male offenders.</P>
    <P>In October 1974 the then Minister for Health, Mr. Brendan Corish, established a task force on child care services, which had the following terms of reference: first, to make recommendations on the extension and improvement of services for deprived children and children at risk; second, to prepare a new children Bill, updating and modernising the law in relation to children; third, to make recommendations on the administrative reform which would be necessary to give effect to the first two terms.  This is where the children Bill began to emerge as a proposal to deal with child care in general.</P>
    <P>The task force quickly reached broad agreement on the changes and improvements needed in the child care area.  However, there was a problem because the members were unable to agree on two key issues: the changes to be made in the way the law deals with young offenders and the important issue of the age of criminal responsibility.</P>
    <P>The matter did not progress until 1980 when the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, directed the task force to submit its final report without proceeding to prepare a children Bill, as it had been directed to do by its original terms of reference. By 1983 the idea of a comprehensive children Bill to deal with all matters relating to children was effectively dropped.  Instead, it was decided to introduce three Bills to tackle the three main areas, namely child care, adoption and juvenile justice.</P>
    <P>The then Government adopted this approach in its national plan, Building on Reality.  The plan announced the intention to introduce the three Bills.  However, there was once again a fatal flaw in the announcement, in that it did not name the Department which would introduce the third Bill, namely the juvenile justice Bill.  I understand the Department of Health was under the impression that the Bill would be produced by the Department of Justice, while &mdash; surprise, surprise &mdash; the Department of Justice believed that the Department of Health would draft the Bill.</P>
    <P>The matter of which Department would draft the Bill was resolved in 1990 when, as Minister for State with responsibility for child care, I made a recommendation to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, that the Bill should be prepared by the Department of Justice.  The then Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke, took on the task.  That is why this Bill has emerged from the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I felt at that time that the Department of Justice should prepare the juvenile justice Bill because the legislation would essentially be a matter of refining and modernising criminal law and procedure as it affected children, and bringing about change in the method and approach of <Col N="64" /> the Garda and courts in relation to young offenders.  The original concept devised by the task force of one comprehensive Bill to tackle all aspects of child care, including adoption and juvenile justice, was an enlightened one.  I regret that procedure was not followed but got derailed for the reasons which I indicated.</P>
    <P>A serious issue of concern at that time was the age of criminal responsibility.  Section 40 of this Bill deals with the age of criminal responsibility, which is a crucial issue.  There have been frequent calls in recent years for the raising of the age of criminal responsibility.  However, there has been little real discussion of the implications of such a move for the administration of justice and the treatment of young offenders.</P>
    <P>We need to first clarify what is meant by the expression &ldquo;the age of criminal responsibility&rdquo;. There are at least two possible meanings.  The first is the age below which a child is regarded in law as incapable of distinguishing right from wrong and is, therefore, regarded as incapable of committing a crime.  This is the basis for the age being set at seven years under current law because seven years has traditionally been accepted as the age of reason, that is, the age at which children first learn to distinguish between right and wrong.</P>
    <P>The second possible meaning of the expression is that it is the age below which a child will not be dealt with under the criminal law in respect of offences which he or she has committed.  This meaning applies in some European countries where the age of criminal responsibility is fixed at ten, 12, 14 or 15 years of age.  Children below the relevant age are not regarded as incapable of committing crimes, rather the law provides they are not dealt with under the criminal code in respect of such crimes.</P>
    <P>I believe that the public would be very concerned at the prospect of youngsters under the age of 12 years committing anti-social acts and other crimes without being subject to any form of sanction.  While most offences committed by children are petty in nature, the sad fact is that a minority of youngsters are increasingly getting involved in very serious offences.  Regrettably, in recent years boys aged between 12 and 15 years have been involved in cases of murder, rape, arson and armed robbery.  If we were not to deal with such youngsters under the criminal law, the alternative methods would have to be spelled out in detail.  It would also be important to clarify the respective roles of the Garda, courts and health boards in relation to such children.</P>
    <P>We have to plan carefully for the future treatment of young offenders because, as I think the Minister of State would agree, the whole area is operating at present on a fairly unplanned basis. Perhaps he is trying in this legislation to achieve a co-ordinated approach to dealing with the issue, which I would welcome.  We must accept, without any prevarication, that serious efforts must be made in regard to planning, prevention and the provision of therapy for young offenders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> The Departments of Health, Education and Justice have a thoroughly important role to play in this area.  Many of us are experienced enough to know that such a desirable scenario of co-operation between the three Departments concerned will not be easy to achieve.  Consequently, we must ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to dealing with young offenders, providing for them and doing all in our power to rehabilitate them. Of course, that will require funding and long-term planning.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the diversion programme, formerly the juvenile liaison scheme. This has been a very good scheme which has generally worked very well.  As part of my constituency work, I have seen the very positive effect this scheme has had on many youngsters, many of whom did not come to the attention of the Garda again.  It is good that the scheme is being put on a statutory basis; if it is provided with the additional resources which it requires it will make a considerable contribution to steering youngsters away from a life of crime.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the intent of the diversion scheme is to divert youngsters from contact with the judicial system.  Therefore, the expansion of the probation and welfare services is extremely important and that is where some of those extra resources will be required.  The establishment of the Garda schools programme was a positive decision and needs to be further developed.  Some 1,000 gardaí have been trained in this scheme and 2,800 are now involved in it.  It is a good contribution to this area.</P>
    <P>Education is crucial in diverting young people from becoming involved in offending against the law.  It is obvious there is a direct connection between youngsters who leave school early or attend school on an irregular basis and the development towards participating in crime.  Consequently, the home/school liaison scheme needs to be resourced, expanded and targeted.  It is already making a considerable contribution to these areas.</P>
    <P>Another area which needs to be investigated and helped is that of disruptive or disturbed children in school, particularly in primary schools. Many teachers and principals speak of the havoc which is caused in classrooms by individual children who, for whatever reason, seem unable to conform to the normal requirements of a classroom setting.  Efforts must be made, possibly with the assistance of the health boards, to deal with such children and to provide help and guidance for them so that they can conform or be dealt with in another way.</P>
    <P>I thought that the Minister of State might have tackled the truancy Bill, which he has promised the House, since it is his intention to tackle the problem of begging on our streets.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that included in this legislation. A relatively small number of children find themselves put on the streets to beg.  It is an industry in itself, generated by a small number of uncaring parents or guardians.  Had the Minister <Col N="66" /> of State incorporated all the relevant provisions of the proposed truancy legislation, the Bill would have made a great contribution to child care.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 to 35 deal with family conferences. Why are there no provisions for the inclusion of community leaders?  Such a measure would follow the lines of the Scottish juvenile system. Areas experiencing problems from small groups of out of control youngsters can be easily targeted. The youngsters involved are often known. It may be that they needed help in the past which they did not get, thus placing them in conflict with the law.  The Minister of State should look at this again to see if it would be practicable and reasonable to involve teachers, respected community leaders or some such people who may be able to help the individuals and families concerned.</P>
    <P>The power of the courts to impose fines on children and the corresponding onus on parents to pay compensation is an issue that has been frequently raised at public meetings.  The measures proposed in the Bill have been called for and will be popular.  They may be difficult to impose and must take account of the resources of the parent, guardian and child.</P>
    <P>Section 91 gives the courts power to order the parent or guardian of a child offender to enter a recognisance to exercise proper and adequate control over the child.  This is an important area of complaint.  Parents and guardians have a contribution to make in this area.  However, there is a problem regarding the make-up of families today.  In some cases parents may find it impossible to control an unruly youngster.  To suggest in such circumstances that the parent is failing in his or her duty will not always be the correct approach to take.  What provisions are made to ensure that parents or guardians are not unfairly blamed for failing to control children who may be 13, 14 or 15 years of age and are running wild? Children find themselves in that position in many areas I represent.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education will be responsible for the operation of child detention schools, while the Department of Justice will be responsible for 16 and 17 year olds and the health boards will be responsible for out of control children. This will be a major problem, and the legislation may fall down in this area.  The Minister of State will be aware that frequently the courts send children to specific institutions, only for the institutions concerned to refuse to accept them because of overcrowding.  The gardaí then have nowhere to put them and they are released.  Will sufficient facilities be provided in time to meet the needs that will arise?  The problem could become acute given that three Departments are involved.  It would be better to incorporate under one authority the services now divided between these Departments.  Otherwise, and despite the Minister of State's best efforts, responsibility will be passed from one Department to the other. This happened when I was Minister of State and when co-ordination between the three Departments <Col N="67" /> was at an early stage of development.  It will be a test of the legislation as to whether the proper resources will be made available in this area.</P>
    <P>According to the explanatory memorandum to the Bill on sections 166 and 175, a school cannot refuse to accept a child offender referred to it by a court.  What happens if the school is full?  This will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 205 tackles the issue of begging by children. It is a positive inclusion in the Bill.  Only a small number of people make children behave in this manner.  I am glad to see that action will finally be taken to address this problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to health boards and the question of special care orders for the small number of children who are out of control, some such children are probably in the Minister of State's constituency; they are certainly in mine.  No agency is prepared to take them on.  I am glad that the Bill makes provision for identifying the children involved.  We know that there is a specific responsibility on the relevant health boards to take action.  Will they have the services available, such as therapeutic facilities, to deal with such youngsters?  If so, they will make a considerable contribution to weaning them away from progressing into a life of crime.</P>
    <P>The Bill was a long time in preparation.  It could have been more radical in some areas.  It is very dependent on the commitment of the Government to planning for the provision of facilities, to co-ordination between the relevant Government Departments and to making available the necessary resources to meet the objectives of the legislation.  If resources are not made available to implement this legislation it will fail and result in youngsters running wild being turned away from institutions to which they have been sent by the courts.  I look forward to the enactment of the legislation and its implementation, especially in the areas of resources, co-ordination and future planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is important and complex and credit is due to the Minister and to his Department for the work that has gone into its preparation.  Last week Deputy O'Donnell correctly pointed out that work and discussion on this legislation has been taking place for some time and that many of the contributors to the debate are no longer Members of this House.  Her point is well made and I congratulate her for raising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will finally replace the remaining operable provisions of the 1908 legislation.  It is unacceptable that such an important area of law should be almost 90 years old.  One contributor to last week's debate referred to the reforming liberal Government of the first decade of this century.  That was a good Government which put in place the first building blocks of the welfare state.  However, it would be completely unacceptable to me and to many of <Col N="68" /> the most right wing Members of the House if the basic welfare and employment insurance systems that that Government put in place were still in operation.  What is it about children that has made it acceptable for us to continue to operate legislation designed for another era?</P>
    <P>Family and family life is a contributory factor to the delay in producing this legislation.  My own party is often accused by other political parties, but more often by self-appointed fundamentalist groups, of being anti-family.  It is an accusation which I totally reject.  For too long our perception of the family has been traditional, hierarchical and patriarchal.  Is it any wonder that the incidents of child abuse, both sexual and otherwise, which have emerged over the past decade were so easily swept under the carpet?</P>
    <P>These are difficult times for the family.  Marriage breakdown and single parenthood are increasing.  However, we should not regard this solely as a threat.  We had one family model in Ireland 30 years ago.  Now we have a multiplicity of models.  The real issue is not the nature of the family unit but the care and attention devoted to the needs of the children.  I accept that, by this criteria, two parents are better than one. However, that is more a rule of thumb than anything else.  There are many children better looked after by a single parent, male or female, than by a couple.  The ultimate advantage of a two parent family is that the quality of childcare can be better simply because the job is a shared one.  It is better to recognise changing trends in relation to the family and deal with them realistically than to pretend that they do not exist or reminisce over days when the problems were swept under the carpet.</P>
    <P>For that reason I welcome the modernisation of our law in relation to children.  This Bill can be seen as the second part of a two-stage process, the first of which is the childcare legislation of 1991.  The 1991 legislation deals primarily with issues relating to care and rights while the present legislation deals with juvenile justice issues.  While I realise that this demarcation is rough and ready, I cannot but wonder whether this Bill is appropriately titled.  What does the term &ldquo;Children Bill&rdquo; signify?  The Bill is effectively a juvenile justice Bill.  However, I recognise the difficulty in using the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; in any Bill dealing with minors, particularly one which raises the age of criminal responsibility from seven to ten years.</P>
    <P>The raising of the age of criminal responsibility is welcome and I look forward to seeing it developed further.  The existing provision can only be described as ludicrous.  How can a child of seven be deemed to be responsible for his or her actions?  Deputy O'Donoghue suggested that this provision was merely putting the existing common law provision on a statutory footing.  I do not understand his point.  This provision should be on a statutory basis, decided upon by the Parliament and not left to the whim of the courts.</P>
    <P>It is hardly surprising that Deputy O'Donoghue's <Col N="69" /> contribution to the debate should be laden with such cynicism.  He is storing up trouble for himself.  Both Opposition parties are engaging in auction politics on the crime issue, juvenile or otherwise.  They are deliberately exploiting the unease and concern which exists among the public. They refuse to spell out how they will tackle the problem.  It is not unfair to say that by omission if nothing else, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party will tackle crime by legislation in this House.  Very little crime takes place on the floor of this Chamber and I suggest to them that they will find the real world outside another kettle of fish.</P>
    <P>Funding will be the key issue in determining the speed with which this Bill in implemented once enacted.  I welcome the fact that the election contest is shaping up into one in which one side of the House is prepared to recognise that public spending has a role to play in developing a modern and dynamic society.  The people will not be able to say that they have no real choice in the election.  Deputy McDowell, finance spokes-person for his party, rebuts challenges about how his party will implement their policies by intimating that there is something mean spirited about the Government raising the issue of funding &mdash; although I notice it was not a problem at the weekend.  It is now a case of &ldquo;they would say that, wouldn't they&rdquo;.  However, if the best the Progressive Democrats Party can do on the issue of financing their economic plans is to suggest that there are millions of pounds to be saved in the real economy by playing with numbers on a balance sheet, then the public will be in for a rude awakening.</P>
    <P>Only in the last two years have we seen the necessary funding of the childcare legislation being made available, five years after the legislation was enacted.  A repetition with the provisions in this Bill would be completely unacceptable.  The Minister, Deputy Currie, has correctly pointed out that the real indication of a commitment to this Bill will be our speed in implementing it.  The Opposition's track record in this area is deplorable.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions in the Bill which I welcome.  The involvement of parents in caring for children in trouble is an important step forward. The Minister has struck a reasonable balance between imposing duties and obligations on parents and in recognising that in some cases parents are not accountable for their children's actions.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell expressed concern that the Bill may not be fully implemented before the end of this session.  I share her concern.  The complex nature of the Bill is evident in its 203 sections and it should be thoroughly discussed on Committee Stage.  Sufficient time should be allowed for that and I look forward to seeing the Bill enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A number of sections, particularly section 205, deal with children begging.  All Members have been approached about this issue.  It does not <Col N="70" /> affect many of us in the provinces but it affects Dublin.  Many people from the country visit Dublin regularly, witnessing young people begging. For too many years the question of what is being done about this has been asked of the Government. This legislation will end that exploitation.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to abolish reformatories and industrial schools and to replace them with children's detention schools.  That is an issue I have campaigned about for over 20 years.  I entered politics through youth politics as a member of the Connolly Youth Movement.  As a member of that organisation and the National Youth Council I worked with young people in numerous youth organisations which campaigned about this issue for over 20 years.  I am proud to be a member of a party in Government that is introducing this legislation.  In Sligo a 15 year old girl was once remanded in custody by the District Court to Mountjoy Prison.  It was an outrageous decision that would not be accepted by any civilised society.  I remember being assisted by Deputies at the time who told me of members of the legal profession who would assist that young girl.  A former Member took a leading role in ensuring the matter was raised in the High Court and the girl was speedily released.</P>
    <P>I commend Minister of State, Deputy Currie, and his officials for the tremendous work they have done in drafting this legislation and I look forward to its being enacted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> My previous post was in youth work and I had much experience in dealing with youngsters who were in trouble with the law and their families.  I address this issue from that perspective.</P>
      <P>One can analyse this Bill section by section in a legal framework.  It is important that that be done with the laws which govern how children are cared for and how those children in various difficulties are dealt with and supported.  Those laws should be clearly set down because, as Deputy Bree pointed out, if one does not pay attention to that detail, one will find a youngster before a court on the basis of an Act passed in 1908.  While that is post-Dickensian, it does us no credit that the only legislation to deal with children in these difficulties is such an antiquated Act.</P>
      <P>I too dealt with children remanded to jails.  If it was going on in Turkey or another developing country, Amnesty International would be beating down the door and it would be raised on the Adjournment.  From that viewpoint I am glad this legislation has been introduced.  It will take time to get through but it will make it to the Statute Book and update matters considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will approach this from the perspective of the parent or the youngster in difficulty or that of a youth worker or childcare worker trying to support them.  What difference will it make to them? A number of principles should underlie any effort to deal with youngsters in trouble with the law. All contributors have correctly pointed out that <Col N="71" /> nothing of use will be achieved by simply passing a law.  Resourcing is very important but what is even more important is the use of those resources.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced as a result of this legislation should be implemented on a community basis. All Members supported the childcare legislation and the protection of children now coming into effect as a result of the 1991 Act and the subsequent funding. Parents have approached me in dread, saying they have been called to the headquarters of the health board because an anonymous report about them or their children has been made.  The impression is given that they are being hauled before a bureaucratic body when all the social worker is trying to do is to find out if something should be dealt with and how to support the family in dealing with that.  In as far as is possible, the services to be provided as a result of the implementation of this Bill should be delivered on a community basis by people in whom communities have confidence and to whom parents and children can relate.  Then the parents and children can feel they are being supported in dealing with a problem rather than being hauled over the coals when so many of them are under social, economic and family pressures.</P>
    <P>Structures should be put in place in every community to support parents in dealing with their children: first, to prevent the children getting into trouble and second, to deal with children who get into trouble.  It is right that parents can be required to attend court and to pay fines arising out of a child's misdeed.  However, I would prefer to see the provision of family resource centres, local community support operations and individual support for children to prevent them from getting into trouble initially.  If resources are being allocated, that support should be given first call on the resources rather than the demands of the court and judicial system.</P>
    <P>In my area I am involved in helping problem children through supporting their parents in cooperation with a local voluntary organisation.  It is a low-cost scheme that operates through the local vocational education committee.  Parents and children are being supported in coping with very difficult problems and issues.  The reports coming from schools, youth clubs and other groups are that the approach is working and the children are getting the support they need.  They are less likely to drop out of school, end up on the streets or have trouble with the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this debate adjourned I expressed my cynicism about this Bill.  For the last <Col N="72" /> 15 years I have listened to similar motions from every party including my own.  What is the result? Opposition parties have all the answers until they go into Government, when they somehow become totally inept.  Accordingly, I look on this motion of the Progressive Democrats as being motivated by opportunism.  This is not to say there is no problem.  The biggest problem confronting citizens is the lack of law and order.  We have never had it so good economically but rural and urban populations are being gripped by a fear of the escalating crime problem.  My views on crime and law and order are well known.  They are not respected in the Dáil but I know from the volume of letters I receive that they are fairly well endorsed by the man in the street.  During the early days of my career as a Deputy I was given the title &ldquo;hang 'em flog 'em&rdquo;.  That might have been somewhat unkind but I still favour very strong measures to curtail crime.</P>
      <P>Many of the more intellectual Deputies have failed to recognise a criminal element in our society.  Our system of law and order needs to be radically overhauled, while the prison system needs to be radically reappraised.  One of the major problems is that the Department of Justice, which is responsible for prisons and many aspects of law and order, is run by civil servants all of whom could pass written examinations until the cows come home but many of whom know less than a boy scout or girl guide about the level of crime on the streets.  The Garda Síochána is a virtual bystander in terms of many of the key elements of dealing with law and order and crime.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue, a technical law man, makes very entertaining contributions.  In regard to the murder of Veronica Guerin he said there is not a democracy on earth which would not be abhorred that this could happen within its jurisdiction. While this is true, it also applies to the dreadful murder of the General, the biggest gangster this country has ever produced, during a time when Fianna Fáil was in power.  I do not know if anyone was ever questioned about that murder. The same horror and rejection of crime was evident in 1994 when Fianna Fáil was in power and the attempts by that party to somehow blame the Minister for the crime problem are ludicrous.</P>
      <P>The problem of crime will never be properly tackled in this Chamber because of its confrontational nature; one has all the answers in Opposition but one does not have the answers in Government.  In time to come Deputy O'Donoghue will probably be a future Minister for Justice and will be subjected to the same fault finding as he and Deputy O'Donnell have engaged in against the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone accepts the need for a prison building programme, which successive Governments have failed to introduce.  We are told that Mountjoy Prison is awash with drugs.  Deputy McDowell said that many prisoners in Mountjoy Prison run up overdrafts with crime bosses of between £5,000 and £7,000 and after their release <Col N="73" /> they must pay for the gear they consumed in prison. This is a sad statement and if it is true, which it probably is, it clearly indicates that the situation in Mountjoy Prison is out of control.</P>
    <P>During a previous debate Deputy O'Malley referred to a young man who had never taken drugs before he entered Mountjoy but who left prison a drug addict.  This is a shocking indictment of life in this prison.  The only way drugs can be brought into the prison is by the public or the wardens.  Mountjoy Prison should be closed to the public so that hardened criminals are not allowed to see their families.  It is very sad to think that a young man who never took drugs could leave prison a drug addict.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, has not solved the crime problem and neither will her successor, whoever he or she may be.  I say this because of our stereotype approach to dealing with crime and the bleeding hearts and others who believe in the concept of rehabilitation in the prison system.  We read in the newspapers every day about the hundreds, if not thousands, of hardened criminals who have been convicted 15, 20 and 25 times and for whom rehabilitation is absolutely pointless.  It is not on the agenda.  We must turn back the clock and reinstate a penitential system which will make prison life so difficult that, on their release, hardened criminals will make a conscious decision not to return.</P>
    <P>Many people believe that prison is a sort of holiday or leisure camp.  When I visited Loughan House some years ago during an autumn afternoon what I saw resembled life on a university campus with young men playing golf and listening to the radio.  If Departments and politicians do not adopt a tough attitude to criminals we will be engulfed by crime.  When society is so concerned about the welfare of prisoners that it establishes a prisoners' rights group then there is something seriously wrong.  When one considers that a nutritionist has been appointed to Mountjoy Prison and the menu is changed every two weeks it is little wonder that many people choose to remain hardened criminals and stay there.</P>

I listened with interest to the last Government backbencher who is outraged by what is happening within the prison system.  Will Deputy McGahon repeat what he said tonight at the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting tomorrow? Perhaps then he will avail of another opportunity in the House to indicate the type of approach his party has agreed on the prison system.  I am amazed that Deputy McGahon and other Government backbenchers expressed surprise as the prison system debate has developed.  The scandalous situation that has been allowed <Col N="74" /> develop over recent years was addressed only after the gruesome and horrible murders of Detective Garda Gerry McCabe and journalist Veronica Guerin, a very good and dear friend of mine.  I regret the escalation of crime and the abuse of our prison system.  However, it was only when these deaths occurred that the Minister addressed the issue.</P>

      <P>Sadly, the Government has failed to address a very serious matter.  Many Members have been concerned about the prison system for a long time.  It is well known that the Minister for Justice had much of her brief taken away because she is seen as a weak link in the Cabinet chain. She also received a major body blow some time ago when she missed a Cabinet meeting at which a proposal by the previous Government on Castlerea Prison was put on ice.  Now the Government boasts about prison proposals and how it will do this and that.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years it cancelled the prison programmes in place and failed to take action in other prisons.  When I raised this matter two years ago I was told the space was being utilised, etc. On 20 November 1996 I asked the Minister the progress, if any, made regarding the use of part of the Curragh Military Barracks, County Kildare, as a place of detention, the time schedule involved and whether she would make a statement on the matter.  I was aware that the Minister could take possession but could not occupy what were seen to be appropriate places for detention. The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>Construction works for the new Curragh Prison have just been completed.  Fit-out is under way and I will be taking possession of the new prison on Monday next, 25 November.</P>
      <P>She went on to indicate the prisoners would be <i>in situ</i>, etc.  November and December passed by and there were no prisoners in the new Curragh Prison. Since then, the Minister has presided over and granted temporary releases to known hardened criminals.</P>

      <P>The Minister has failed to address what has been going on in the D wing of Mountjoy Prison.  Eighteen places have been vacant for the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> I would welcome the opportunity to put on record all the Minister's replies to my questions on prison matters but, unfortunately, I do not have time.  Regarding the Curragh Prison, the Minister replied that 35 prisoners were accommodated there on 28 January 1997, but it has capacity to accommodate 68.  If anybody is satisfied that 35 places out of 68 have been utilised, they are not on my side of the fence.</P>
    <P>On 28 January 1997 I asked the Minister for Justice the total number of prisoners who availed of early releases.  I refer to Deputy O'Donnell's comment that it was 50 per day.  The Minister's response was:</P>
    <P>Approximately 4,500 short-term temporary releases were granted in 1996 with approximately 4,000 receiving full temporary releases.</P>
    <P>What a disgrace.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to special arrangements for prisoners.  I have asked questions on this matter in the past and was shocked by the responses I received.  I asked the Minister questions on the cost and type of clothing available to prisoners and whether she had any views on the use of prison uniforms.  The total cost of issuing standard clothing in 1995 was £540,000. The Minister indicated she had no plans to introduce a standard prison uniform.  I do not see any problem with a standard prison uniform.</P>
    <P>Recreational facilities are available to prisoners but not to law abiding citizens.  I asked the Minister the type of facilities available to them.  She was happy to indicate that physical education teachers, showers and changing rooms and all types of indoor and outdoor facilities on either an individual or group basis are available to criminals. Other facilities include a supervised gymnasium, television and video, indoor activities such as pool, table tennis and board games and limited library facilities.  Inmates are also encouraged to avail of educational programmes.  Recent initiatives include swimming lessons on a weekly basis and an outdoor pursuits programme involving canoeing, hillwalking, orienteering, rock climbing and sailing.</P>
    <P>Recently it was brought to my attention that prisoners can avail of telephone facilities and the destination or duration of the call does not matter. I asked the Minister about this.  The Minister of State and the Government backbencher may laugh, but it is wrong that these facilities are made available to convicted criminals but not to ordinary, law-abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>It was brought to my attention recently that telephone facilities are available to prisoners. They can make a local or trunk call, or call a mobile phone, without time restrictions.  In reply to a question tabled by me on this matter, the Minister for Justice stated:</P>
    <P>Subject to the maintenance of safe custody, good order and security, and where practicable, a Governor may make arrangements by which a prisoner may communicate by telephone with <Col N="76" /> members of his or her family or with legal advisers.  The provision of free telephone calls is at the discretion of local management.</P>
    <P>I asked about the cost of these facilities to the taxpayer but the reply stated: &ldquo;Due to the nature of telephone billing in the prisons it is not feasible to accurately state the cost of telephone calls by prisoners&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I tabled another question to the Minister recently on library facilities available to prisoners. In her reply, she listed a number of journals that are available to prisoners.  The reply stated:</P>
    <P>The following is a list of the newspapers and magazines which were provided during 1995:</P>
    <P>Irish Times, Irish Independent, Irish Press, Daily Mirror, The Star, English Independent, The Guardian, Cork Examiner, Evening Herald, Anois, Sunday Independent, Sunday Press, Sunday Tribune, Sunday World, RTE Guide, Radio Times, TV Times, Computer Magazine, Computer Scope, Technology Ireland, Woodworker Monthly, Health and Fitness, Ultra Fit, Smash Hits, Woman's Way, '19', Ireland's Eye, Ireland's Own, Amateur Photography, Hogan Stand, Farmer's Journal, Practical Photography, Treasure of the Earth, Garden and Answers, Dandy and the Beano.</P>

      <P>That is an indication that there is something seriously wrong with our prison system, and I will not stand over the provision of such facilities to convicted criminals.  We must have an independent prison authority with appropriate terms of reference to meet the needs in this area.</P>
      <P>I circulated a newsletter to my constituents recently which made reference to a survey I conducted on crime in Dublin North Central, the response to which echoed my views.  In the newsletter I stated:</P>
      <P>It is time to take the gloves off and put the boot in &mdash; radical measures are necessary&mdash;</P>
      <P>Resources must be provided to combat the problem of drugs and drug related crimes.</P>
      <P>The whole area of sentencing, early release, required number of prison places and bail must be toughened.</P>
      <P>An increase in the Garda presence on city streets, in our residential areas and support services must be visible.</P>
      <P>Development of the community policing approach, communities working with the gardaí, neighbourhood watch programme and liaison committees to assist in the prevention of crime.</P>
      <P>Introduce legislation to adequately update and improve our laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> Introduce whatever special measures are necessary to deal with the escalation of crime.</P>
    <P>The most important right of men and women in a free society is to be able to live in peace and security, protected by the law from personal harm in public places and in their homes.  That right is under serious threat not only in Dublin but throughout the country.  People no longer feel safe in their own homes.  They cannot go freely about their normal business.  They live in a constant state of anxiety and security consciousness. We face a crisis that must be confronted.  Hardened criminals are walking the streets.  We need additional places of detention for prisoners, from juveniles to hardened criminals.  They are not available and I plead with the Minister to do something about the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats brought this Bill before the House because we believe the prison system is in chaos.  In a democratic society the prison service has a vital role to play in combating crime and in protecting the citizen.  Along with the courts and the police, it is one of the three legs on which our system of law and order stands.  Failure in any one of these areas threatens the whole structure.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, the failings of our prison system are obvious.  Every year, 4,000 orders are made for the early release of prisoners who have not completed their sentences and a further 4,500 orders are made for temporary release.  Illegal drugs are widely available within the system and this serves to undermine the whole prison regime.  The commitment to the education and rehabilitation of offenders is inadequate and the overall effort is weakened by the ready availability of drugs.  The prison system cannot be expected to solve all our crime problems.  Without a properly functioning prison system, however, any effort to tackle crime will be doomed to failure.</P>
      <P>There are also major problems with regard to the public accountability of our prison system. Nobody knows the people who run the prison system. There has not been any analysis of the efficiency and effectiveness of the service.  There are no set indicators against which management performance can be assessed.  Annual reports are published so late as to be meaningless.</P>
      <P>Serious questions arise about the strategic management of the service.  The service has clearly failed to respond to the sharp increase in serious crime that has taken place in recent years and has been slow to respond to the changing nature of crime, particularly the impact of drugs abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A complete reform of the present structure of the prison service must be an essential part of any new crime control policy.  Remedial action is urgently required if we are to get the prison service working smoothly again.  A major programme of reforms is needed, the key objectives of which should be to deliver improved management, efficiency, accountability and standards of prisoner welfare and rehabilitation.  It is unlikely, <Col N="78" /> however, that these objectives will be achieved while the prison service remains as an administrative branch of the Civil Service within the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes the establishment of a separate executive to manage the prison service.  We are proposing two policy initiatives in this area. The prison service should be converted into an autonomous executive agency independent of the Department of Justice.  The head of the service would be directly accountable to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Legislation and Security. The Minister for Justice would continue to hold responsibility for overall prisons policy.  There should be a much greater role for the private sector in the construction and maintenance of prison buildings and in the provision of ancillary services to prisons.  Both these measures would be radical in the Irish context.  Each has been recommended in reports published by the Government but we await legislation.</P>
    <P>The document on public service reform <i>Delivering Better Government</i> advocated the delegation of certain tasks to executive agencies.  The prison service would be an ideal candidate for agency status and this administrative model is widely used by prison services in other countries. Equally, the recent Forfás report <i>Shaping our Future</i> recommended that private sector provision of public infrastructure be considered in the area of transport.  There is no reason this logic should not be extended to security infrastructure.</P>
    <P>It is valid to pose the question: is the prison service providing value for money?  The answer is almost certainly not.  While the Government did not carry out a management review of the service or conduct any study of its efficiency and effectiveness, an examination of the facts would lead one to the conclusion that taxpayers are getting a poor return on their considerable investment.</P>
    <P>Several factors should lead us to question the performance of the prison service.  The average cost of keeping a person in prison is very high by international standards.  While spending on prisons has risen by 46 per cent over the past five years, the number of prisoners has risen by only 8 per cent over the same period.  The service has managed to spend £40 million in capital investment over the past five years without delivering any increase in capacity.  In other words, the Department of Justice has spent the equivalent of the cost of a new prison but has nothing to show for it in terms of increased accommodation.  In addition, £53 million was spent in overtime over the past three years.  That is not the kind of record that inspires confidence and it highlights the need for major changes in the management of the system.</P>
    <P>Imprisonment is an expensive option, but we must also recognise that there can be major costs attached to not imprisoning people who pose a danger to society.  Despite reported instances of serious crime committed by people on unsupervised early release, there are no official statistics available on the number of such crimes.  Apart <Col N="79" /> from the personal suffering involved, these crimes impose huge costs on society in terms of legal and medical expenses, damage to property and cash loss.  This highlights that our failure to provide an adequate level of prison accommodation has been an expensive mistake.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice is responsible for the provision of new prison accommodation.  In association with the Office of Public Works, it has direct management control over all capital projects in the prisons service.  All the evidence suggests the Department is not equipped to fill the role of project manager for large-scale capital investments.  There is reason to believe that several million pounds have been wasted on badly planned prison projects in recent years.  Press reports on the prisons system have listed a long catalogue of disasters.  Some £1.5 million was spent on a new kitchen for Mountjoy, but as serving facilities were not provided it remained idle for many years.  A sum of £4 million was spent on a medical centre for Mountjoy, but this was damaged by fire and prisoners are still escorted to outside hospitals at great expense.  A total of £2.5 million was spent on a new women's unit at Mountjoy which was subsequently found to be unsuitable for housing female prisoners.  Maintenance costs at Wheatfield &mdash; the most modern prison in Ireland &mdash; are reputedly higher than for the 11 other prisons combined.  There have also been major problems with the installation of computerised payroll systems and modern electronic technology.  In the circumstances it is not surprising that providing new prison accommodation is very expensive.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice recently indicated that the cost of building the planned new prison at Wheatfield will be approximately £40 million.  As the facility is to cater for 400 inmates this implies a cost of £100,000 per space.  Surely it is unacceptable that the cost of providing basic accommodation for one individual in a medium security institution is equivalent to the cost of two family homes.  The unnecessarily high cost of providing new spaces is hampering the essential development and expansion of the prisons system. Prison accommodation could be provided much more cheaply if we approached it correctly. We should adopt a cost-effective approach to the construction of new prisons.</P>
    <P>The rehabilitation of offenders must be a key objective of a prisons system.  Prison serves a number of important purposes.  It punishes offenders for their crimes by depriving them of their liberty.  It keeps them off the streets for lengthy periods, thereby preventing them from committing further crimes, and the unpleasant experience of prison can serve to deter inmates from reoffending.  It is important also, however, that prisoners are treated with dignity and afforded an opportunity to rehabilitate into normal society.  This is desirable in utilitarian as well as humanitarian terms.  If the prisons system <Col N="80" /> helped turn people away from a life of crime or drugs, the benefits to society would be enormous.</P>
    <P>As a first step the Government should implement a proper system of committal assessment for incoming prisoners.  This would enable prisoners with particular problems, whether violence, drug dependency or mental instability, to be identified at an early stage and minimise the disruption such individuals can cause to the system. Our prisons service should embark on a systematic programme to improve facilities for prisoners in several key areas.  We must aim for single cell occupancy and an end to the practice of doubling up two prisoners to a cell.  In Mountjoy up to five inmates can share a cell.  The practice of slopping out must be phased out completely. The target must be to achieve a 100 per cent in-cell sanitation system.  There should be strong emphasis on the provision of educational services to prisoners as a means of self-improvement in social and economic terms.  Prisoners without employment skills should be given appropriate training to give them some chance of finding employment on their release.  They should have an opportunity to work if they wish.  We cannot allow people to exchange a life of idleness outside prison gates for a life of idleness inside them. Prisoners should be entitled to the same basic level of health services as the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>Several investigations and reviews have revealed major shortcomings in the financial management of the prisons service.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, the Garda Fraud Squad and internal studies carried out by the Department of Justice have identified serious problems in the system, such as obsolete financial regulations, inadequate internal controls and failure to maintain proper records and accounts.  The current arrangements are inadequate.  Major improvements are required in the financial management of the prisons service.  The best way to achieve such improvements is to establish the service as an autonomous executive agency, as proposed by the Progressive Democrats' Bill which I commend to the House.</P>

      <P>For the past week or two the yin of the Progressive Democrats Party has been in the ascendant.  The caring and concerned profile is being presented to the electorate.  It is falling over with concern for young people, drug addicts, rural dwellers and probably for anyone else who wants to put in an appearance.  The Yang has been muzzled for the time being, but let no one be under an illusion &mdash; this is just a temporary phenomenon.  The Yang will be let loose again and we will hear the clarion call for reductions in <Col N="81" /> public expenditure, etc.  It will be accompanied by the muffled sounds of more money for rural water supplies and for disadvantaged youth.  It will operate on the assumption that &ldquo;ne'er the twain shall meet&rdquo; and, more importantly, that nobody will notice the inconsistency.</P>

      <P>Speaking on the Children Bill last week, Deputy O'Donnell said that an &ldquo;effective juvenile justice system integrates crime prevention strategies, early intervention with young offenders and diversion away from crime.  The importance of recreation and leisure activities especially sport must be recognised&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This weekend Deputy Quill called for greater facilities to be made available for young people to keep them away from crime.</P>
      <P>I am in the rather unusual position of agreeing with Deputy O'Donnell to some extent.  What she said is correct, but it is not enough.  An effective justice system requires even earlier intervention &mdash; educational intervention at the pre-school stage for children at greatest risk.  It also requires numerous subsequent interventions, including those outlined by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Where I part company with Deputy O'Donnell is that I do not suggest all this can be done without public expenditure.  The Progressive Democrats' ability to be utterly inconsistent is staggering. Measures which will seriously affect the lives of young people at risk cost money, public money.  While it may be possible to find private financiers to build and even run a prison, it is not possible to find private financiers who will invest in the risky and difficult lives about which we are talking.  Is Deputy O'Donnell suggesting there is private finance available to invest in educational and social interventions?  If not, she should admit the improved services we all want require increased resources.</P>
      <P>Is this the same Deputy O'Donnell who recently accused the Labour Party of having a &ldquo;plot&rdquo; to favour the disadvantaged?  We are not plotting to favour the disadvantaged.  We are seriously addressing disadvantage and will continue to do so.  We will not indulge in the brazen inconsistency of recognising that disadvantage is a factor in crime and not doing something about it.</P>
      <P>Addressing disadvantage requires public expenditure.  This is where one has to seriously analyse the Progressive Democrats' position. They promise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to ensuring that public money is well spent.  Nothing in this Bill will progress these aims.  The Progressive Democrats in Government did nothing to bring about institutional reform.  The Labour Party in Government has been responsible for the most wide ranging law reform ever.  We have established the Criminal Assets Bureau which is successfully spearheading the drive against organised crime. We are bringing about reform of the courts and improving the management and organisation of the Garda.  None of this activity is cheap and we will not delude the electorate into believing it can be done without public resources.</P>
      <P>Where will the Progressive Democrats find the public expenditure cutbacks?  What will they reduce?  Will they eliminate the improvements in education this Government introduced?  Will they cut back the health services allocation?  They are specific about what they intend to do with welfare &mdash; they claim they will increase pensions but do not say how that will be funded.  What about education and health?  If they are going to reduce public expenditure they must have their eyes on those areas.</P>
      <P>I unequivocally support the principle of public expenditure.  Conventional private investment rarely takes account of the social costs and returns on a proposal.  Public expenditure on education is social investment.  The return on that expenditure is not immediately obvious nor is it realisable for a very long time.  The money this Government is putting into alleviating educational disadvantage will not show a clear return for at least ten years.  Similarly, the resources we are putting into local development will not show a major return for a long time.  Will these resources be targeted in the PD attempt to cut back public expenditure?  The local development partnerships have a long way to go before achieving their potential, but they have brought hope and a chance for the future.  Can Deputy O'Donnell honestly say how her party intends to resource them in the future and at the same time cut public expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prisons are a monument to social failure.  There are and always will be some failures and we will always need prisons.  However, we should see prisons as a last, not a first, resort.  We want a justice system which, among other things, ensures that people who are guilty of offences involving violence, particularly with guns, serve their sentences fully.  We also want a justice system which does everything possible to keep some young offenders out of jail and divert them to other activities.  Certain people, particularly those who <Col N="83" /> commit offences involving weapons, should be kept in jail for a very long time, but others should be kept out of jail.  The debate on prisons tends to concentrate on those who should be in prison and ignores those who should not be there.</P>
    <P>There are three main aspects to the fight against crime: tackling the causes of crime, having adequate legislation and good organisational structures to deal with crime.  Crime is committed by our fellow humans who are products of the society in which we live.  That society is not as fair and equal as it should be.  While unfairness and inequality are not and should not be regarded as excuses for crime, they are among the causes of crime.  The Government has been trying to address the causes of crime through local development and targeting of disadvantaged areas, through improvements in the education services and improved services for drug addicts. These efforts must be extended and enhanced. They do not yield immediate benefits, but they are at least as important as the other elements in the battle against crime.</P>
    <P>The Government has seriously tackled educational disadvantage at the early stages through the Breaking the Cycle Programme and other schemes.  We now need to follow up on this with a programme which will identify young people at risk of becoming involved in crime and tracking them through the education system.  More particularly, we need a system of tracking them if they leave the system.  A reorganised and resourced school attendance service could provide the basis for a much more comprehensive service which would not simply police attendance at school but would provide a range of options for those who do not continue at school.  These options could include providing sports facilities, training and education in less academic subjects and, in general, providing interesting activities which would divert young people away from crime and drugs. In my constituency, the principals of many primary schools could point out children in senior infants who are most at risk of subsequently becoming involved in crime.  We need a strategy to keep those children from getting into the prison system just as much as we need one to imprison for long periods those who commit serious crime.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are not serious about tackling the causes of crime unless they admit that it will cost public money and are prepared to devote that to it.  Neither are they serious about having adequate legislation to deal with crime &mdash; if this Bill is their idea of good legislation, they have a major problem.  Good legislation requires quality not quantity and it requires resources to implement.  We can introduce any amount of legislation.  Without the resources to back it up this legislation is a waste of time.  The Child Care Act, fine and necessary legislation, was passed during the Progressive Democrats time in Government.  However, it lay unimplemented <Col N="84" /> because of lack of resources until after they went out of office.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us today is neither fine nor necessary legislation, it is a shabby piece of work. It includes unnecessary provisions which purport to give powers to the Minister for Justice which already exist.  We do not need new legislation to build prisons, the power is already there.  We need legislation to set up a prisons board, but this Bill does not include the basic requirements for the establishment of such a board.  It includes a number of provisions which are already in the Children Bill and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  It is an attempt to give the impression that the Progressive Democrats have solutions to problems when what they are proposing is superficial in the extreme.  It is an example of the Progressive Democrats doing what they do best, getting publicity for prescribing solutions but not recognising that resources are needed to implement them.</P>
    <P>Earlier, Deputy Callely proposed an amendment to this Bill to ban the <i>Beano</i> and <i>Dandy.</i> Many prisoners in our prison system are illiterate and I would have thought the Deputy, as a member of Fianna Fáil, would recognise and acknowledge the need to encourage prisoners during their time in prison to learn to read and write.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is taking place at a good time in the history of this country when there is widespread media coverage of crime and the lack of solutions to the problem.  I commend television programmes on crime and prisons.  I watched a very good programme last night on Mountjoy Prison.  I support the openness with which those programmes are presented on RTÉ. As I watched last night's programme I understood how convoluted and complicated is the whole question of crime and drugs in society.  One thing I learned from the programme is that this is a bad Bill.  It is a &ldquo;flash Harry&rdquo; solution to the problem of crime in society.  There is no quick fix, no magic panacea, no simple solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>In recent months the Progressive Democrats have tested the intelligence of the people, which is foolish.  The people are very intelligent and resourceful and the introduction of a Bill such as this will fool nobody.  It is not an answer to the crime problem.  If draconian measures helped to solve crime, it would have been solved long ago in America and Australia by means of slavery.  I cannot understand how the Progressive Democrats support draconian measures to double the prison population on the one hand while, on the other, they propose to cut expenditure by half. The problem of crime will not be solved in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe they are sending a message to the electorate, but the public will see through it.  For the past few months the Progressive Democrats have highlighted the shortcomings and flaws in our penal system.  They drew attention to the earnings of prison officers, <Col N="85" /> some of whom, they claim, receive as much as £700 per week, and to large overtime claims by prison officers.  They also criticised the high rate of absenteeism.  I do not know how valid are the Progressive Democrats' claims, which should be viewed in a dispassionate way.</P>
    <P>I am not a spokesperson or apologist for prison officers.  I have been a trade unionist all my life and I am here, first and foremost, as a public representative. If there are faults in the prison system they should be addressed by the Minister.  If the amount of overtime worked in prisons is excessive, it should be adjusted fairly, and I would be the first to support the Minister in that regard. Similarly, if there is a high rate of absenteeism among prison officers that should be reviewed, but if the claim is false or spurious, it should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>People often say that because a prison officer's job is dangerous, difficult and stressful one expects a certain level of absenteeism.  I understand their conditions may be such that prison officers find it difficult to survive and want time off.  However, how does one reconcile that with the high level of overtime worked?  I presume that if the conditions are stressful for one group of prison officers, they will be stressful for another.  Yet some prison officers seem to work a lot of overtime to increase their earnings.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us if the high level of overtime in our prisons is related to the high rate of absenteeism.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats also hinted at privatising our prisons.  However, the British experience was unsuccessful; it had many faults and it was uneconomical.  It is naive and simplistic to say we should privatise the prison system because it would solve all our problems.  That is like putting the cart before the horse.  Who would operate the system?  There are many private security firms and some of them are less than adequate.  People without any qualifications or a professional background in security procedures, or regulations to govern their operation, could set themselves up as a security company.  We have seen former criminals set up companies, some of which are still in operation.  I would be less than happy to see such people running our prison system.</P>
    <P>If we want to tackle the problem of crime in our society, we must look at its root causes.  I could name 20 different areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford where 90 per cent of our criminals come from.  I could name two communities in Limerick city where most of the people who are involved in crime come from.  These people come from deprived backgrounds.  We should put money into these communities to rehabilitate them and to give them employment opportunities.  We should not praise these people once a year for being law abiding citizens and then ignore them for the rest of the year.  We should help them to become involved in the community, in work and in training.  We can do that if we have the will.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> Evil men must be locked up in any society. People who use violence and who kill people cannot be left in society unless they reform.  Drugs are contributing to the increase in crime because people are stealing to feed drug habits.  I am not against the idea of building drug units in our prisons. I know some prison governors are against this idea because they claim they run prisons, not hospitals.  However, one is related to the other.  I urge the Minister to consider this because there should be drug treatment units in prisons, even against the wishes of the governors.  Drugs are easily available in prisons.  If we want to rehabilitate drug users and criminals, drug treatment units must be set up.  Old and new prisons should have such units.  We must deal with the root causes of crime and stop the escalating crime levels.</P>

      <P>A couple of nights ago Deputy O'Donoghue outlined on television the number of Bills he has introduced since his party went into Opposition.  Why were all those Bills necessary since Fianna Fáil was the main party in Government for seven and a half years?  I appreciate that Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy O'Donnell were not in the Cabinet, but by introducing those Bills Deputy O'Donoghue is admitting that our prison system was in crisis when his party left office.  One would think the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, or the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Burton, had created crime.  This debate will help to clarify the situation.</P>
      <P>The situation in our prison system is serious. We have introduced new laws which mean that people must stay longer in prison whether they are convicted of agricultural offences, drug offences, etc.  It is important that people who are brought to justice serve a reasonable amount of time.  There are four problems in our prison system with which this Government and the Minister are dealing &mdash; the need for extra places, the cost of funding those places, the revolving door syndrome and the need for proper rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats have introduced this Bill at a sensitive time.  A few days ago £23 million was pulled out of the hat to solve the problems associated with the rural group water schemes.  Those who do such things should be sure of the facts.  We should have learned our lesson after 1977 when this country was thrown into disarray as a result of give-away budgets.  We must have the money first before we provide it for group water schemes, prisons, etc..  The Government and the Minister have prepared plans to create more prison places and socially acceptable accommodation which will not cost the country an arm and a leg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> If we want to improve our prison system, we must ensure that only real criminals are locked up.  I welcome the decision by the parents and relatives of a young boy who was killed in an accident in the south recently not to pursue their case to put the young man responsible in prison.  This is to be highly commended because there is no doubt the young man deserved to be punished for the crime.  However, locking him up in prison was not necessarily the best solution.</P>
    <P>We must look at the background of the majority of criminals and we must avoid putting people into prison if possible.  I understand that 75 per cent of crime is committed in areas where 75 per cent of the population is unemployed.  That means we must tackle the problem of long-term unemployment, as this Government is doing. There is a need for more prison places and the Government will, in time, provide all the places needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is timely in that it allows us to focus on the important issue of prison reform.  We should pay tribute to RTÉ for producing an enlightening series of programmes about our largest prison, Mountjoy, which I visited with Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donoghue and others.  We learned much about the many aspects of prison life.  We were brought to the basement to look at the padded cell which was occupied by a young man who was about 19 years old and covered in a blanket.  He was huddled in a corner.  I could see nothing in his eyes, neither personality nor any aspirations for the future.  I am sure when he was born everybody had high hopes for him and that when he was in school somebody said at some stage that, despite the circumstances in which he may find himself, he had a future but somewhere along the way, at which point intervention by the State was required, something went wrong.  We should target resources to prevent young vulnerable people falling victims to crime and finding themselves in such tragic circumstances.</P>
      <P>This is not the time to introduce a Bill such as is before us.  We need the maximum number of secure places to keep people off the street in a society where drugs and unemployment are causing severe problems leading to crime.  Cost reductions should not be the criterion to use in such a crisis. I am sure Deputy O'Donoghue would agree that we need to maximise the number of secure places available until such time as we get to grips with the drugs problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it be possible to hold court hearings in secure areas within the boundaries of Mountjoy Prison?  This would obviate the need to bring prisoners to courts in the centre of the city and help to reduce costs.  Court hearings should also be held in Portlaoise Prison, the cavalcades from which race through my constituency bringing prisoners to courts in Dublin.  The Minister should consider those two practical suggestions <Col N="88" /> from the point of view of cost effectiveness.  At a later date when we have got to grips with the crime problem we should consider in an objective way the way our prisons are run.  It would be dangerous in the meantime to start tampering with what is already in place.  We need the maximum number of secure places for those who offend against the community.</P>

In normal circumstances, with right-minded Members, it is the kind of Bill that would command support across the floor and would not be the subject of a vote, as I suspect it will be tomorrow evening.  We should not divide on an issue as important as this.  The Bill aims to put in place, as we approach the turn of the century, a modern, efficient and cost effective prison system.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, mentioned that over the weekend I called for facilities for young people to keep them away from crime. There are few Members who would have a greater right to make such a call than I.  When the Progressive Democrats were in Government with Fianna Fáil from 1989-92 I was chairperson of the Select Committee on Crime.  It produced a report on juvenile crime and justice which laid the foundation for the Children Bill currently before the House.  It identified the provision of facilities for young people to divert them away from crime as its priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State had her opportunity and I would appreciate if she would allow me to proceed.  The art of politics is to identify where money ought to be spent, where money can be saved, and which items should be given priority so that we get value for money. That is good government.  If the Minister of State, or any member of her party, thinks that the taxpayer and the victims of crime are getting good value for the money spent on our prisons, their arithmetic is faulty.  We spend £120 million per year or £2 million per week on the prison service. One would imagine, therefore, that we have the most efficient prison service in Europe, if not the world, but by any standard we have the least efficient.  This is of grave concern to the taxpayer who is putting up the money.  There is an obligation on all of us to ensure taxpayers get a fair return and they, and the community in general, <Col N="89" /> get good value for the money they invest.  If there is one public institution more than any other from which good value is not forthcoming it is the prison service.  We get good value for the most part for the money we spend on education and we get a fair return for the money spent on health although it could be better, but we get the worst possible return for the money spent on prisons, and that is really the nucleus of this Bill by the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy O'Donnell for drafting it and for all the time, energy and conscientious work she has put into putting it before the House. Right thinking people of all parties ought to support this Bill because it is the only way forward. We cannot go into the next century keeping in place the institutions which have failed us so lamentably, and no institutions have failed us more than the prisons.</P>
      <P>The comparative estimated annual cost of keeping one prisoner is £13,000 in New Zealand, £13,500 in France, £19,000 in Luxembourg, £26,000 in Finland, £28,000 in Italy, £22,000 in Britain, £36,000 in Norway and £45,000 in Ireland so who can defend the argument that there is a cost effective prison system in Ireland?  For that amount of money one would truly think we had a deluxe prison system in which every prisoner served his or her full sentence and from which every prisoner emerged fully rehabilitated and returned to the community as a law abiding citizen. Is that the case?  Certainly not, so it is about time we subjected the whole system to the kind of evaluation to which the Progressive Democrats have subjected it in the context of this Bill and a number of contributions to this House on the prison service in recent years because we cannot even begin to attempt to address the crime problem unless we begin to address the prison system and the courts and establish proper crime prevention measures in the community.</P>
      <P>There has been an explosion of crime.  In the past five years serious crime has increased by 52 per cent.  There were 11,023 indictable offences in Cork city in 1995, the last year for which figures are available.  That tells another story.  We are well into the middle of the second month of 1997 and the figures for 1996 are not yet available. That is most inefficient.</P>
      <P>Twelve murders were committed in Munster in 1996.  Another grim fact is that crime and the fear of crime has paralysed members of the community, particularly the very young and the elderly. Elderly people living alone live in fear of crime and that is almost as bad as crime itself in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real question is that the criminal justice system has not kept pace with that rapid increase in criminal activity.  The system is creaking and is almost at the point of breaking down.  We, in the Progressive Democrats, say it is high time for a radical root and branch reform of the criminal justice system because the current position is unsustainable.  It has reached the point where in the majority of cases the criminal goes unpunished <Col N="90" /> and the victim goes uncompensated. Indeed, if one feature of Irish life stands out today more than any other, it is that crime pays and pays handsomely.  I speak not just about the crime which gets headlines but also of white collar crime.  As long as crime continues to pay, it will flourish.</P>
    <P>A sad feature of crime is the number of people who get caught up in it at a very early age and who run the risk of spending their lives in a jungle of crime.  The number of very young inmates in the prison system saddens me more than anything else.  I am deeply disappointed that the so-called Children Bill, which I would call the juvenile justice Bill, is only now being brought before the House in the dying days of this Government. Clearly, it will be left to the next Government to resource that Bill and implement its provisions. That is a sad indictment of the priorities of this Government, particularly when one considers that the work was done by the all-party committee of the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Government of 1992 which was quite prepared to proceed with that Bill.  Unfortunately, the Government fell and it was left to the succeeding Government to take it over.  It is only now, when this Government is on its deathbed, that it is beginning to see the need for that Bill.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats intend to tackle the criminal justice system and reform all its elements but a start must be made with prison reform.  The current position in the operation of the prison service has undermined the integrity of the criminal justice system.  The revolving door system has had a catastrophic impact on the authority of the courts, the morale of the Garda and the confidence of the general public in the criminal justice system.  Gardaí go to great trouble, often almost to the point of putting their lives at risk, to bring suspects before the courts to secure a conviction.  In addition, judges hand down sentences in accordance with the laws we make in this House.  What happens after that?  The sentences are seldom, if ever, served fully.  In most cases, only a minimal effort is made to have those sentences served.  This revolving door, which is a prominent feature of the prison system, makes a mockery of the judgments of the courts and the efforts of the Garda.</P>
    <P>We, as legislators, cannot go to the courts with any justification and say we want a modern sentencing policy unless and until we are prepared to establish a prison system which delivers the sentences handed down by the courts.  That is why we, in the Progressive Democrats, put prison reform on top of our agenda to reform the justice system.  We must work from there.  When we put in place this reformed prison system, provide additional prison places as we indicated in the context of this Bill and ensure prisoners serve their sentences as handed down by the courts, we can legitimately go to the courts and say we think it is about time we had a different, modern and more responsive sentencing policy.  We are poorly placed to ask the courts to do that unless and <Col N="91" /> until we have a reformed prison system in place and provide additional places.</P>
    <P>For most prisoners prison, with its revolving door, has become a place of respite between crime sprees.  Offenders go on a crime spree and are brought before the courts.  They know from their pals and from what they see around them that they will only serve a fraction of their sentence, but they are prepared to serve it in the knowledge that they will be released in a short time and will be able to go on another crime spree.  That is a salient feature of our courts system.</P>
    <P>Some people think our prison system does not need to be radically overhauled or that there should be a root and branch reform.  We cannot consider reform while there is a lack of prison spaces.  Nobody could be asked to put in place better procedures in our prisons where chronic overcrowding is a feature.</P>
    <P>A teacher would say that she could not possibly teach a class of 78 pupils, but she might be able to make some headway with a class of 30 pupils. The same principle applies to prison wardens. They are the subject of a good deal of criticism at times, not without some justification.  No prison warden could enjoy working in the cramped and crowded conditions that are a feature of all our prisons.</P>
    <P>Cork Prison, in my constituency, is sizeable and was built to house 172 prisoners.  I spoke to its governor this morning and asked him how many prisoners were in the prison today. He said it was not so bad today, that often it had been much worse.  There are 272 prisoners in the prison.  Before we begin to put a proper package of prison reform in place, the number of prison places must be doubled.  The Progressive Democrats argued for that in this Bill. Moreover, it pointed out that the business of building prisons must be given to the private sector because it is capable of providing a proper, purpose built prison in a fraction of the time it would take the State to build one.  We cannot afford to wait any longer.  The current process is too slow and costly.</P>
    <P>Every week when I travel from Cork to this House I pass Bewley's Hotel at Newland's Cross.  Two years ago the site on which it is built was a green field.  That hotel was built in six months.  It is possible to build a fine hotel in that time, but it takes three years to build a prison.  There is something wrong with that system.  Surely after five years in Government certain people, if they have a conscience about this, must be saying they wasted time and they should have done something significant about the prison system.</P>
    <P>Why do we have temporary releases?  It is because we do not have enough prison places.  We must first provide the requisite number of places and then introduce some type of programme that will cater for prisoners' health and welfare and will aim to return prisoners to the community, <Col N="92" /> having served their sentences, as useful and constructive members of society.</P>
    <P>The majority of prisoners are under 25 years of age.  They have their lives to live.  Surely we should consider their prospects.  If we have any shred of humanity, we should try to use their prison term to break them away and wean them off a life of crime and point them in the direction of being useful and constructive members of society. Would that cost much more than is being spent at present?  I argue it would cost less.  We have more than one prison officer for every prisoner. What are they doing?  If there was one teacher for every student, we would have a generation of geniuses.  If a staff member of a hotel was available to deal with only one guest, one can imagine the rating of that hotel and the number of stars it would be given.  There is more than one prison warden for every prisoner but do we have reformed prisoners?  Are their health, education and psychological needs met for the duration of their stay in prison?  The contrary is the case.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are saying it is possible to put in place a modern, effective prison system that has a sufficient number of places which will enable prisoners to serve their full sentence and benefit, in every sense, from their time there.  We also point out that can be done for at least the same amount of money that is being spent on our prison system which is in chaos and is a disgrace and an indictment of all of us.</P>
    <P>As well as providing additional places, we must change the management system.  We should not continue to put new wine in old bottles.  We must put in place an independent management system that will ensure our prisons are run professionally as they need and deserve to be run.</P>
    <P>If I had one wish, it would be that in three years' time we would be able to take Mountjoy Prison out of the prison system and put the building to an alternative use.  A culture of bad practice, malpractice and drug abuse has grown up around that institution over the years.  There comes a time when a society is intelligent and compassionate enough to recognise that a given institution has served its purpose, has no place in a modern democratic society and must be taken out of the system.</P>
    <P>Today, I am a TD for ten years.  If there is one matter more than any other of which I am proud it is that I was part of a Government that laid the foundations for the juvenile justice Bill.  I would like to be able to boast of one other thing when I leave politics &mdash; that Mountjoy Prison, with all its associations and sad history, would no longer be used as a prison building but, would be put to another use and that prisoners would be housed in a purpose built modern prison that would serve the needs of this country in a manner in which Mountjoy Prison has not done and will never do. In saying that I am not criticising the staff of Mountjoy Prison or politicians as the problem has developed incrementally.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Members to support this Bill and my party's aspiration that Mountjoy Prison <Col N="93" /> should be removed from the control of the Prison Service.  That should be done as our gesture towards the new millennium.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business - Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The need to bring this Bill before the House arose from a Supreme Court judgment of July last, which upheld a High Court decision of October 1995, to the effect that the powers given to the Commissioners of Irish Lights under the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act could not be interpreted to include the provision of radio-based aids to marine navigation which were unknown when the Act was introduced.</P>
      <P>The commissioners currently provide a range of radio aids to navigation.  All modern aids to navigation are based on the transmission and reception of radio waves.  The primary purpose of the Bill is, therefore, to give the necessary powers to the commissioners to enable them to continue to provide such modern technological aids in the interests of maritime safety.  The Bill also makes further necessary provisions in relation to the functions of the commissioners.  I propose to deal with the main provisions in the Bill later, but it would first be useful to place the Bill in context by outlining the statutory background and powers of the commissioners.</P>
      <P>The legal basis for the operations of the Commissioners of Irish Lights dates an Act passed by the Irish Parliament in 1786.  That Act created a &ldquo;Corporation for preserving and improving the Port of Dublin&rdquo; whose functions were, as its title suggests, the maintenance and development of Dublin port.  In 1810, subsequent to the abolition of the Irish Parliament, the British Parliament passed the Lighthouses (Ireland) Act which gave the corporation all powers, duties and functions relating to the control of lighthouses around the coast of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, established a &ldquo;Port of Dublin Corporation&rdquo; to superintend and manage the lighthouses in Ireland and the adjacent seas and islands and from then on the corporation, when exercising these powers, acted as separate and distinct from the &ldquo;Corporation for preserving and improving the Port of Dublin&rdquo;. The Dublin Port Act, 1867, gave formal legal recognition to this state of affairs by severing the two bodies.  The Port of Dublin Corporation was given the new name of the &ldquo;Commissioners of Irish Lights&rdquo; but retained its constitution as laid down in the original Irish Act of Parliament of 1786, while the other corporation became the &ldquo;Dublin Port and Docks Board&rdquo;, with its own constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> The constitution of the commissioners, which is effectively still the same today as laid down in the 1786 Act, provides for the election of 17 members who are nominated by the body itself as vacancies arise.  It also provides that the board of the commissioners shall comprise three representatives of Dublin Corporation, whose successors are nominated by the corporation, and the Lord Mayor of Dublin <i>ex-officio</i>.  Under the Irish Lights Commissioners (Adaptation) Order, 1935, which legitimised the functions of the commissioners in the Irish State, the election of a new commissioner by the body itself can be disapproved by the Government. However, this power has never been exercised.</P>
    <P>The current powers of the commissioners derive from the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. Under this Act, the superintendence and management of all lighthouses, buoys and beacons in Britain and Ireland are vested in three bodies known as General Lighthouse Authorities.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights is the General Lighthouse Authority responsible for providing and maintaining aids to navigation throughout the 32 counties of Ireland and its adjacent seas and islands.  Likewise, Trinity House serves England, Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar, and the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses are responsible for Scotland and the Isle of Man.</P>
    <P>The Act gives the Commissioners of Irish Lights powers to provide lighthouses, buoys and beacons and enables them to purchase any land which may be necessary for the exercise of their powers.  The overall control of local lighthouses, buoys or beacons provided by individual harbour authorities is also vested in the commissioners.  In addition, the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, gives the commissioners powers in relation to the marking and removal of wrecks which are a danger to navigation, where no harbour authority or local authority has the power to do so.  This Act repealed the relevant section in the 1894 Act which dealt with wreck and salvage matters.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights are somewhat unique in so far as their remit covers the entire island of Ireland.  The services provided by the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the other two lighthouse authorities are financed from one source &mdash; the general lighthouse fund.  This fund derives its income principally from light dues levied on commercial shipping at ports in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Light dues collected from shipping traffic at Irish ports are, however, insufficient to meet the cost of the elaborate system of lights required by Ireland's geographical position.  Under an agreement reached between Ireland and Britain in 1985, the Irish Exchequer pays to the general lighthouse fund an annual supplement towards the cost of the service provided by the commissioners in the State.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the onerous task with which the Commissioners of Irish Lights are charged.  They are statutorily responsible for aiding <Col N="95" /> the safe passage of mariners in and around the entire inhospitable coastline of Ireland which covers over 2,000 miles.  More than 75 per cent of Irish imports and exports rely on our sea routes and the commissioners are responsible for the protection of this vital lifeline to and from the outside world.  It should also be remembered that, in addition to inshore sea traffic trading to and from Irish ports, aids to navigation provided in Irish waters are used by a high percentage of vessels plying some of the world's busiest shipping lanes from North America to Britain and mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>In this era of rapid technological change the role of coastal aids to navigation is changing. Traditional visual aids such as lighthouses and buoys are, however, still an essential part of marine safety as the location of hidden or underwater dangers must always be clearly identified.  Lighthouses and buoys have been modernised in line with technological advances.  The automation of all lights under the control of the commissioners will be complete when the Bailey Lighthouse is demanned in April and all buoys are now solar powered.  As technology advances, the lighthouse will come to be thought of more as a hazard warning rather than a point-to-point aid to navigation around the coast.  Radio navigation systems provide the enhanced position fixing accuracy required by modern shipping.  The speed of vessels is increasing and there is a greater risk of marine pollution.</P>
    <P>The varied nature and topography of the Irish coast requires a mix of traditional and modern aids to navigation to guide seafarers.  The commissioners carefully select each aid to navigation to mark a particular local danger or hazard while ensuring that these aids link up with adjacent aids in order to form a comprehensive chain of navigational aids all around the coast.</P>
    <P>The commissioners provide not only traditional visual aids such as lighthouses and beacons but also a variety of modern electronic aids which allow vessels to determine their position by interpreting radio signals from transmitters on shore. The four types of electronic aids provided by the commissioners are radio beacons; radar beacons &mdash; known as racons; radar target enhancers and the differential global positioning system &mdash; DGPS.</P>
    <P>I would like to briefly outline the manner in which these radio systems operate.  Radio beacons are radio transmitting stations which operate in the low and medium frequency bands and provide ground wave signals from which ships can obtain their bearings by means of direction finding receivers.  Racons are radio navigation devices which allow ships' radar to identify the geographic location of the device. Radar target enhancers are devices which automatically transmit a signal in response to an interrogating signal received from ships' radar.  The purpose of these devices is to improve the radar return signal from navigation <Col N="96" /> marks and to improve radar detection of small craft so as to reduce the risk of collision. DGPS improves the accuracy of the satellite global positioning system-GPS which is a navigation service operated by the United States. The DGPS involves having, at precisely known locations, reference stations which provide real-time corrections to the signals of GPS. Differential corrections are transmitted by radio beacons to any user of the GPS who is near a reference station.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have provided radio aids to navigation since 1931.  They currently operate 25 such aids around the coast of the Republic of Ireland.  However, as I indicated earlier, the courts have ruled that these systems are <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of the commissioners under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  In 1979 the UK amended that Act to provide for the inclusion of radio aids to navigation in the powers of General Lighthouse Authorities in their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The role of the commissioners is clearly of the utmost importance, involving as it does accident prevention, pollution avoidance and, above all, safety of life at sea.  It is vital, therefore, that the commissioners be given the necessary statutory powers to continue to provide modern aids to navigation in the interests of maritime safety.  It is against this background that I now wish to outline the main provisions of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill rectifies the legal deficiencies identified by the courts by giving the commissioners, in relation to maritime navigation, powers to construct, operate and maintain radio navigation systems. It also allows the commissioners to purchase land for this purpose.  The Bill validates the provision of radio navigation systems in the past. The commissioners provided these systems in the interests of maritime safety.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the commissioners shall be responsible for superintending and management of all maritime radio navigation systems. As indicated earlier, the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, vested the superintending and management of all lighthouses, buoys and beacons, including those provided by harbour authorities, in the commissioners.  It is, therefore, considered appropriate that this Bill should extend the commissioners' management function to cover radio aids to navigation in this jurisdiction in the same way that they are responsible for such aids in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the commissioners may, with the consent of the Minister for the Marine, co-operate with other agencies, including a competent authority of another jurisdiction, in relation to the provision or operation of radio navigation systems and any services relating to maritime navigation, safety, distress, wreck location, pollution or related matters.</P>
    <P>This provision recognises the fact that international co-operation is of vital importance in the provision of aids to navigation and in relation to <Col N="97" /> maritime navigation in general.  There is, in this regard, ongoing co-operation between the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the two General Lighthouse Authorities serving England, Scotland and Wales.  The three General Lighthouse Authorities are at present developing closer planning and operational functions.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights are represented on the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities.  This association promotes co-operation between lighthouse authorities and the co-ordination of worldwide standards in relation to aids to navigation matters.</P>
    <P>It was considered prudent to also allow the commissioners to co-operate with other agencies in relation to the provision of services relating to wreck location, pollution or related matters.  This could be of particular benefit in an emergency where the commissioners' light tender ship may be able to provide assistance to the Department of the Marine or other competent authorities.  I should mention in this regard that the Irish Lights tender <i>Granuaile</i> played a prominent role in the search for the <i>FV Carrickatine</i> which was tragically lost off the Donegal coast in November 1995.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a provision which gives the commissioners power to make financial contributions towards the funding of bodies concerned with maritime navigational assistance. This power may, however, only be exercised with the consent of both the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Finance.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights currently make financial contributions to the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities in respect of their membership of that body.</P>
    <P>A further provision in the Bill allows the commissioners, for gain or otherwise, to enter into agreements, with the consent of the Minister, for the provision of maritime navigation systems on behalf of harbour authorities and for the performance of services relating to maritime navigation, safety, distress, wreck location, pollution and related matters.</P>
    <P>The need to include this provision arose following legal advice received by the UK Department of Transport which indicated that the maintenance of a third party's buoys is <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of Trinity House, the general lighthouse authority throughout England and Wales.  This advice also applies to the Commissioners of Irish Lights with regard to the provision of such services to third parties such as harbour authorities.  The commissioners currently maintain in excess of 50 lights and buoys within harbour limits.  The Bill validates services provided by the commissioners to harbour authorities to date.</P>
    <P>Legislative action is also being taken in the United Kingdom in this regard.  A Merchant Shipping and Maritime Security Bill, currently before the British Houses of Parliament, contains a similar provision which will allow General <Col N="98" /> Lighthouse Authorities to enter into agreements with third parties.</P>
    <P>In order to cater for possible future developments in technology I have taken this opportunity to include in the Bill a provision enabling the Minister for the Marine to confer on the commissioners appropriate additional functions in relation to maritime navigational matters.  The Bill stipulates that orders made in this regard shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by a resolution of either House.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very necessary legislation.  It will, if enacted, update the powers given to the commissioners under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and allow them to continue to provide modern technological aids to navigation to enable ships, fishing vessels and pleasure craft to sail our waters in safety.</P>
    <P>Before I recommend this Bill to the House, I would like to refer to the Loran C long range radio navigation project.  As Members will be aware, the Supreme Court ruling of 18 July last arose, in effect, out of a legal challenge to the commissioners' powers to proceed with the erection and operation of the Loran C long range radio navigation system.  Ireland's participation in Loran C was provided for in an international agreement between this country, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and France which was duly approved by this House on 8 October 1992.  The terms of this agreement, as approved by the Dáil, included an undertaking by Ireland that a Loran C radio mast would be erected in the south-west of Ireland as an essential link in a system of nine masts stretching from the north of Norway to the south of France.</P>
    <P>Prior to the approval by the Dáil of this agreement, an extensive radio mast site selection study had been undertaken by the Commissioners of Irish Lights with the assistance of a firm of consulting engineers, the University of Wales and the head of the north-west European Loran C programme management office.  System coverage predictions and a detailed set of guidelines informed and guided a detailed geographic and geophysical study of 40 possible sites.  This study led the team to select the site currently envisaged for erection of this mast at Loop Head.  The detailed guidelines required, <i>inter alia</i>, that the site be both extensive and flat with no adjacent mountains or hills; also, that it should be in an area of low population density and be removed from other major public infrastructures and power lines.  The Loop Head site was regarded by the team as that which best met the detailed selection criteria developed in advanced of the study.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights, acting as agents of the Minister for the Marine and on foot of the above mentioned site selection study and the approval of the Dáil of the international agreement, subsequently applied for and obtained on 4 November 1994, on appeal to An Bord Pleanála, planning permission to proceed <Col N="99" /> with the erection of the mast at Loop Head, County Clare.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the commissioners have been unable to proceed with the project because of litigation connected with both relevant marine and planning legislation.  The House will also be aware that, since the approval by the Dáil in 1992 of the Loran C agreement and the completion of the planning process in 1994, considerable disquiet has been expressed about visual and health aspects of the mast at the chosen site and, more fundamentally, whether we should be party to the agreement in the first place.  Claims that the system was a threat to health, infringed our neutrality, constituted a damaging environmental intrusion and was already obsolete were levelled against the proposal.  The intensity with which these claims were pursued contrasted with the lack of substantive public or political debate in 1992 when our national policy in relation to Loran C was being decided.  Thus the current debate, being dissociated in time from the original decision, suffers from having no public channel or forum through which these issues, which are of real and legitimate concern to many people, can be aired and informed.</P>
    <P>I regard this state of affairs as unsatisfactory, potentially damaging and inconsistent with the need to ensure the maximum practicable level of public information and consultation.  I wish to inform the House, therefore, that I am not satisfied that the Commissioners of Irish Lights should proceed with the project without first allowing an informed and structured public debate on the issue.  I am also conscious that, notwithstanding the legislation before the House, there remains the possibility of further litigation in relation to the validity of the commissioners' powers at the time to have applied for the relevant planning permission.  Furthermore, I am conscious of the need to ensure that the retrospective legislation currently before the House does not interfere with the constitutional rights of any individuals or groups.</P>
    <P>Having regard, therefore, to the need to allay public concerns about the project and in view of inevitable further legal uncertainties and the need to protect constitutional rights, I have decided on two important courses of action.  First, a public forum, consisting of three individuals, including persons with knowledge and expertise in maritime matters generally, will be set up shortly to allow individuals and groups to articulate publicly concerns they might have about the appropriateness of our involvement in the Loran C project in general, about the impact or effect of a Loran C mast on public health and the environment and about the selection of an appropriate site for such a mast.  Second, the Commissioners of Irish Lights will be directed, following the outcome of the current Supreme Court case and the public forum mentioned above, not to proceed with the erection of a Loran C mast at any location without <Col N="100" /> undertaking a renewed and appropriate planning application procedure.</P>
    <P>I intend that the public forum will consult extensively on the general merits and demerits of the project as articulated in the debate to date, on the impacts and effects of a Loran C mast, whether in County Clare or elsewhere, and on the site selection procedure used by the commissioners. The forum will draw on expert advice and will adopt an informed view on the legitimacy or otherwise of concerns and opinions on all these and any other issues put to it.  The proceedings of the forum will be public, open and comprehensive and its report will be published following the completion of its work.  I would envisage that its work will take three to four months from its commencement.</P>
    <P>On this basis and having regard to my statements earlier that this legislation is essential to allow the Commissioners of Irish Lights to continue its current work of assisting all vessels on the high seas and close to our coasts to sail our waters in safety, I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an argument on the Order of Business about the time afforded to debate this Bill.  I had a discussion with the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, almost two weeks ago and he indicated that it was necessary for him to introduce urgent legislation to deal with a problem which had arisen for the Commissioners of Irish Lights following a High Court decision.  I was happy to co-operate.  Normally we expect notice of about two weeks before a Bill is debated in the House and I waived that.  I was approached last week and it was requested that all Stages of the Bill would be taken this week and I agreed.  It was not until this morning that I realised that the Government had decided to take all Stages of the Bill today.  I drafted an amendment to ensure that the provisions of section 3 do not facilitate the development of installations not already constructed, including a Loran C mast.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we must deal with the legislation in different circumstances to those which I had understood from the Minister.  If there were problems for the Commissioners of Irish Lights as a result of a High Court decision, which left them liable for decisions taken in the past and which were not properly covered by legislation, the House would be willing to facilitate but I have doubts whether this is the case because I am not aware of any public disquiet about existing installations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are prepared to facilitate the updating of the law with regard to navigational safety.  Ireland exports significant amounts of goods by sea and has an important fisheries sector.  The maintenance of safety standards for navigation by sea and air is very important.  This Bill is draconian; it is a panic measure which does not conform to the planning laws and it loses sight of the many advances that have taken place, and will take place, in marine navigation.  The Bill, as drafted, <Col N="101" /> gives the lie to the solemn commitment given by Fine Gael at the last election not to proceed with Loran C.  That commitment was given in the face of genuine concern and outright opposition by the local community at Loop Head.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, more enlightened legislation is brought before the House each year. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the planning laws.  We have introduced tighter controls. We have ensured more transparency.  We have allowed for greater public consultation and new environmental impact statements and assessments to continue to protect our environment.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not refer to obligations under the planning Acts.  The Minister may argue that provisions in other legislation amply cover this area but the harsh reality is that it should be spelled out here in such important legislation.  The scope for conflict in this crucial area of marine navigational safety is enormous.  In light of the experience in the Clare area, the Minister and the Government should have been careful to ensure that full and open compliance with all planning requirements was enshrined in any legislation coming before the House.</P>
    <P>I regard this as a panic measure.  There should be no rush, no need to speed up the introduction of legislation to rectify the problem which arose for the Commissioners of Irish Lights arising from the High Court decision.  The presumption that the Commissioners of Irish Lights always had the right to provide navigational systems without planning permission was wrong.  No one is pressing to remove any installation placed by the commissioners.  There were no immediate problems on that front.  It is difficult to realise why there should be so much panic and why it is necessary to proceed to deal with all sections of the Bill in a little over an hour and a half.</P>
    <P>The history of Loran C has been well documented. It goes back to an international agreement signed by the Irish Government in Oslo in mid-1992.  A navigational aid was to consist of a 720 feet mast, with guy wires, extending over a site of 140 acres in Fierd near Cross, County Clare.  It was then being promoted by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  Except for a newspaper article in <i>The Clare Champion</i> the local community knew nothing whatsoever about the proposed project.</P>

      <P>Please wait until I finish.  I am not interested in the politics of this project, I merely want to relate some of the history to help the House understand the reason we should not make the decision we are about to make tonight. Anxious people wanted answers but they did not get them.  Since that time a wider debate has taken place on the international front and even more questions are being asked by the scientific community in respect of Loran C.</P>
      <P>Planning permission was sought and refused by Clare County Council and subsequently granted by An Bord Pleanála.  Apart from planning, environmental and health grounds, there are concerns about the extent to which these projects can be affected by outside powers.  The signal is controlled from a naval base at Brest in France and used by the French nuclear submarine fleet.  It is acknowledged that Loran C is a preferred communication system for submarines since they do not have to surface to get a position fix.</P>
      <P>To change from the Decca to the Loran C system, according to all the advice available to me, is unjustified and unacceptable to professional operators in the marine and fisheries sector whose needs from a navigational system are separate and distinct from those of others in the maritime community.  All the Community fishing zones are situated inside regions covered by the Decca system which, as a result, is used by a large number of Community fishing vessel owners both for radio navigation and scanning the seabed for fish.  Nobody has been able to show that the Loran C system is more precise than the Decca system.</P>
      <P>To change systems would require heavy investment which is too expensive for small boats, substantial time for training new users and massive technical inconvenience.  Data banks of readings built up over years of experience could be lost.  I have been informed it is not possible to transfer information electronically from Decca to Loran C &mdash; it would have to be done manually, a nightmare we do not want.  It appears the UK finds this system unsatisfactory and is continuing with the Decca system.  Why then are we debating legislation which is designed for, perhaps, no reason other than to put the Loran C project back on the rails?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has proposed a public forum comprising three individuals.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights will be directed, following the outcome of the Supreme Court case and the public forum, not to proceed with the erection of Loran C masts at any location without undertaking a renewed and appropriate planning application procedure.  It should be taken for granted in any project, wherever it would be, that the necessity <Col N="103" /> for proper planning permission would be enshrined in the legislation.  Why is it necessary to emphasise something which we all consider essential for a project anywhere in the country? When we take away the blind from everything that has been presented the legislation provides for the fundamentals with a view to ensuring the Loran C project goes ahead.</P>
    <P>The public forum, the whitewash and the other matters will lead to ultimate confrontation with the public in Loop Head who are concerned.  We would be better off making a decision here and now because we can anticipate the difficulties. We know the public concerns.  Given that it will not be possible to proceed with any degree of unanimity, that the project will not have local support, the Government should accept the Fianna Fáil amendment, otherwise Fianna Fáil will be voting against the Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;while conscious of the need to modernise the law relating to navigational and safety installations, Dáil Éireann declines to have the Bill read a Second Time in order to facilitate the disposal of pending litigation in relation to the Loran C situation in County Clare.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill arises from the decision by the Commissioners of Irish Lights to construct a Loran C navigation mast at Loop Head in County Clare. The residents in the Loop Head area fought that decision through the courts.  They were successful in the High Court in October 1995 and in the Supreme Court in July 1996.  The objections and concerns of the people of Loop Head are understandable and they have been made very clear to me by the Progressive Democrats councillor, Mary Mannion.</P>

      <P>The residents of the Loop Head peninsula were shocked to discover that an outside agency, the Commissioners of Irish Lights, was about to build a 720 feet mast in the middle of a peaceful and scenic rural area and that it was proposed to do so with the minimum of consultation with the local community.  The mast would have been the tallest structure in the region and would even have dwarfed the stacks at the Moneypoint power station.  The mast would have been visible from as far away as the Dingle Peninsula, the Aran Islands and Slyne Head in west Connemara.</P>
      <P>West Clare depends heavily on tourism.  The Loop Head peninsula is a spectacular scenic location, with the Shannon on one side and steep cliffs falling down to the Atlantic on the other. It is the kind of place tourists from Britain and continental Europe come to Ireland to see.  This area has considerable untapped tourist potential. Kilkee is one of the towns selected by the Government for inclusion in the scheme of tax breaks to encourage investment in traditional seaside resorts.  However, what is the point of encouraging tourism related investment in Kilkee if 15 miles down the road there is an enormous grotesque mast, a huge blot on the landscape, which is visible from a considerable distance? Tourism is the main hope for this region of County Clare.  It has proven difficult to attract industry to south west Clare because of its peripheral location and poor transport links with the rest of the country.  It stands to reason that we should be doing as much as possible to encourage tourism in the area and as little as possible to hinder it.</P>
      <P>I fail to see how the Loran C project fits in with any plan to develop the tourism potential of the Loop Head peninsula and I would appreciate if the Minister would answer some basic questions. I could start by asking the Minister how he would like to see this mast erected in the middle of Dún Laoghaire in his constituency.</P>

      <P>Has this type of equipment not been rendered obsolete by the availability of more modern technology?  Did the Commissioners of Irish Lights consult with the Department of the Marine before undertaking this project?  If this mast has to be built, were alternative sites considered for it?  Have the health risks associated with the mast been fully explored and has all the relevant documentation been made public?  Is this equipment needed solely for merchant shipping or is there a military rationale for it?  These are reasonable questions and this House, and the people of the Loop Head peninsula, are entitled to clear and straightforward answers, which I hope the Minister will give in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody objects to the basic purpose of the Bill, namely to update the legislation governing marine navigation and to allow the Commissioners of Irish Lights to modernise their operations.  The <Col N="106" /> Commissioners of Irish Lights have served the country extremely well over many years.  Many fishermen, sportsmen and sailors owe their lives to the services provided by the commissioners. However, it is important that we allow for full deliberation and consideration of all the facts in relation to the Loop Head development.  The Minister confirmed that the matters are still the subject of litigation and certain aspects of the development have still to be decided by the courts.  Accordingly, my party has tabled an amendment which proposes to ensure that no further action is taken on the Loran C development until the matter has been resolved by the courts.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Molloy and Hugh Byrne for sharing their time with me.  This issue is of importance to County Clare and, in particular, west Clare.  Unfortunately, it is proposed to take this Bill in a very hurried fashion. As I said on the Order of Business, we all welcome the updating of legislation but rushing it through in this way gives rise to suspicion.  On the Order of Business the Minister for the Marine tried to say that the legislation did not refer to the Loran C mast project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I would deal with that matter separately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reference to this mast in the legislation but one does not have to read between the lines to know that it relates to it.  Indeed the Minister alluded to it in his speech.</P>
      <P>Last night at a well attended emergency meeting in west Clare a number of points were put forward, one of which was the need for an all-party approach to this matter.  I am, therefore, disappointed at the bully-boy tactics being engaged in by Members on the benches opposite. Like the people who attended the meeting last night, I had hoped that all political parties would share the same view on this issue.  Given that there is a guillotine on the debate, the interruptions by the Deputies opposite are unsavoury and unhelpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill is necessary following the Supreme Court judgment of last July which upheld a High Court decision of October 1995.  As in the case of other legislation, there should be an interval between the Second and remaining Stages of this Bill.  Unfortunately, this will not happen on this occasion, and one wonders why.  I say this given the pending judgment in the current Supreme Court case.  As I said on the Order of Business, it is inappropriate to bring the legislation before the House this evening. However, I am glad the Minister will deal separately with the Loran C project.  The people of west Clare feel particularly aggrieved, fearful and anxious about this because there have been so many logical and lucid questions asked about the <Col N="107" /> environmental and health impact, neutrality and the fact that the Loran C system is obsolete. These questions have been asked in numerous fora and have not been answered to the satisfaction of local people.  It has already been pointed out that the county council looked at this matter and its decision was overruled by An Bord Pleanála.  When the An Bord Pleanála hearing took place, public representatives from all parties in County Clare expressed the difficulties facing the local people.  The people of Clare were able to come to Dublin today with 16,000 signatures. This represents the views not only of people in County Clare but also of people in the surrounding constituencies and counties.  It shows that this issue is of tremendous importance and needs greater consideration.</P>
    <P>The Loran C mechanism is obsolete.  The British had this system and got rid of it in 1990 because they felt it was not the way to go.  The Irish Fishermen's Organisation has also been very much against this system and has given its reasons.  The Minister for the Marine should take account of such a respected organisation and its views.  The people it represents would be most dependent on such a navigation system for their safety and if they feel it is inadequate the Minister should reconsider his position.</P>
    <P>The question of Loran C has come to public attention because, as Deputy Molloy said, it has been worked on by the local community.  I do not profess to be an expert on these issues but the people who have taken up the cudgels in west Clare, John McInerney and others, have become experts in this field and the questions they pose have not been answered sufficiently.  Perhaps we will get a satisfactory answer from the Minister tonight with regard to the health hazards and the threat to our neutrality.  These were two issues among others raised specifically last night and we were asked as public representatives for that constituency to raise them in this debate.</P>
    <P>It was thanks to citizens taking their rights to the courts that we learned of these difficulties and legal procedures.  The Supreme Court decision has, according to the Minister, necessitated this legislation.  If that is so, it would not be too cynical to believe that this legislation is an attempt to change the goalposts simply because the people of west Clare have already proved their point in law and legislation has been introduced to deal with that decision.  That is an unsatisfactory way to deal with citizens' rights.  That decision should be expressed in law rather than trying to thwart the views and decisions taken and followed through in our legal system.</P>
    <P>I refer to the fact that the Minister said he wants to have another look at Loran C and I welcome that.  Any situation where we have further debate can be welcomed.  It would not be logical or fair to deny that process.  The Minister has given an opportunity for a forum.  He has said he is doing this on foot of a pending Supreme Court case which I accept.  Why then are we discussing <Col N="108" /> this legislation before the decision has been finally taken by that forum and people have full information?  You cannot have your cake and eat it.  That is a cynical attempt by the Government to placate local people.</P>

I reiterate that it is most unwise to speak on legislation that should be set aside until we have heard the outcome of the forum proposed by the Minister.  The Minister and the Government cannot have it both ways. They cannot say to the people of Clare &ldquo;yes, you will have your forum, you will be consulted&rdquo;, another example of retrospective consultation from this Government, yet the Minister is prepared to go ahead with this legislation.</P>

      <P>I agree with the amendment put down by Deputy Michael Smith.  It is important to look at section 3 which gives the commissioners power in regard to maritime navigation to construct, operate and maintain radio navigation systems and allows them to buy land for this purpose.  This section also gives the commissioners all necessary ancillary powers and ensures that the constitutional rights of any person are not affected by powers given under this section.  This is where we wish to insert the following provision: &ldquo;The provisions of this section shall not facilitate the development of installations not already constructed, including the Loran C&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope support will not only be given from all Opposition parties but in the interest of democracy, fair play and true consultation the views of the people of west Clare will be followed through. They have an all party approach to this and at the very least this amendment should be included. When talking about the need to improve and update legislation, such issues as updating buoys and other navigational systems are not on par with the Loran C mast which will have a great effect on the community in west Clare.  Fianna Fáil regard this legislation with a jaundiced eye for the simple reason that the Minister has admitted further consultation should take place and a forum should be established.  I agree with that principle but the Bill should not go any further than Second Stage.  We must first know the outcome of the deliberations of that forum before we can determine the legislation that is necessary.</P>

      <P>Outsiders would agree this debate has become localised.  I have a particular interest in this issue because I have had many dealings with the Commissioners of Irish Lights. I agree with the Minister and Deputy Molloy that the commissioners have a proud record on safety at sea.  Many of my friends' families have at least <Col N="110" /> one member involved with the Commissioners of Irish Lights.</P>
      <P>In my many dealings with the commissioners I have always found them to be very professional. I live close to the Hook Lighthouse, which is being given to the local community as a heritage centre, and on that we have had consultations with the commissioners.  Those consultations were always a high priority with them, and I fail to understand the reason consultation appears to be minimal at this stage.</P>
      <P>Despite the Minister's sniggering I believe this decision is being forced upon the commissioners and the building of the Loran C project is part of an international agreement.  Is it part of an international agreement and, if so, who proposed it? Who is paying for this?  Are the French paying 50 per cent of it?</P>

      <P>I will refer to an accident involving Irish and French vessels which occurred four and a half years ago and on which we are still awaiting a result.  In reply to a question tabled by me on the matter, the Minister stated that his Department awaited a report from the French authorities on the proceedings of a maritime tribunal on a case which concluded on 27 September 1966.  The Minister informed me also that one of his officials attended the tribunal.  Why did that person not report back to the Minister?  Why is the conclusion of this matter taking so long?  Has anybody been appointed in the Department to deal with this investigation?  Is it not true that Captain McGrath, who was appointed, has retired and that nobody has been appointed to take his place?  I had to smile when the Minister of State referred to safety at sea and that the Loran C installation will see an end to all problems.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister get his priorities right and deal with the people who are bereaved as a result of this accident?  That would be proof of his interest in safety at sea.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights have led the way in rescues around our coastline.  They should not now be painted as the bad boys but given credit for the tremendous work they have done and will do in the future.  It was the Minister's decision to introduce this legislation which is being rushed through the House.  I am very suspicious about the speed with which it is being progressed.</P>

      <P>We are not satisfied with this debate and the manner in which the Government has attempted to ensure we do not have an <Col N="111" /> opportunity to tease out the issues.  I do not have any difficulty in giving the Commissioners of Irish Lights whatever powers they are deemed to be deficient in, but I have a number of difficulties generally with the Bill, the first of which has already been articulated in relation to the Loran C.  The Bill warrants deeper examination than is possible tonight.  I am extremely suspicious of the manner in which it is being presented whereby Committee and Report Stages cannot be taken and the Bill is being pushed through the House with unseemly haste.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith tabled a Committee Stage amendment on behalf of Fianna Fáil which relates specifically to the Loran C project.  If the Minister accepted the amendment, that problem, which is a major one for the people in the area, would be addressed.  The Minister is in a position to accept the amendment and I strongly urge him to do so.</P>
      <P>The Loran C project is clearly facilitated by the Bill, despite the caveats the Minister has entered. If the public disquiet in west Clare which has been articulated by other speakers were addressed by the Government, it would have ensured there was an opportunity to consider the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder Members of this House, who may have been here when the initial proposal was made in 1992 but were unaware of the difficulties which have now come to the fore, are suspicious about the speed with which this Bill is being passed through the House.  We are now aware of the health difficulties, the question of neutrality and French submarines, the visual intrusion, the adverse effects on tourism and the fact that this system is obsolete, yet the Government is forcing through the legislation without due consideration of the issues.</P>
      <P>I am greatly surprised that the Taoiseach, who is a proponent of the committee system, is party to this approach.  The Minister, in his caveats, clearly accepts that the planning procedure adopted heretofore is faulty.  It was not mentioned directly by him but it is a fact that the local planning authority, Clare County Council, of which I am a member, refused planning permission and it was subsequently turned down by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>Questions have arisen about the procedures of An Bord Pleanála.  It has been said there is no demand from the IFO, the people who might be seen to benefit from this, that it is under French military control and appears to facilitate French nuclear submarines.  Internal memos exist in the Department of the Marine which are clearly against the Loran C project.</P>
      <P>Section 3 needs amendment along the lines we have mentioned.  If the Minister is serious about these procedures, which seem to be a time wasting exercise and an acknowledgement of the planning procedure heretofore, he must accept Fianna Fáil's amendment in relation to Loran C and deal with that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> Section 7 confers extraordinary powers on the Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Finance. I am not satisfied, quite apart from Loran C, that it is appropriate for this House to pass legislation on a public body such as the commissioners, which is independent from the State in many respects.  I am gravely concerned about that.  The Government is skirting around the main issue, the Loran C system.  The manner in which the Bill is being rushed through is a cause of great concern.</P>

      <P>Members opposite are trying to impede progress. They are endangering the safety of our fishermen, who travel at least 200 miles south to the Azores, and are making a political football of this issue in west Clare.  Who objected when the then Government made a deal overnight with the European Union to erect, without planning permission, two towers on Mount Gabriel in Schull?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the contribution made by the Commissioners of Irish Lights to the safety of seafaring fishermen in my constituency.  The commissioners will not inflict harm on the people of County Clare and the sooner the better they realise they are being codded by Members of the Opposition on this sensitive matter.  Everyone knows it is important to install navigational aids along the coastline and that is not possible without modern technology.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Molloy was a Minister he did not encourage the public to object to his Government's efforts to provide navigational aids along the coastline.  We were fortunate that a good rescue service was in operation in south-west Cork on the night his former leader was shipwrecked off Mizen Head and retrieved by the Baltimore lifeboat service.  Were it not for the alertness of the Mizen Head signal station on the night in question the then Taoiseach would have foundered under Mizen Head.  That would have been a terrible tragedy for such a colourful character.</P>
      <P>How dare Deputy Molloy encourage opposition to the erection of a mast in County Clare? When the Commissioners of Irish Lights modernised the fog signalling station at Mizen Head they handed the station back to the local community as a gift and it is currently used as a maritime institution that attracts approximately 45,000 people per annum.  That is progress in the right direction.  If we do not progress we are merely banging our heads off the wall.</P>
      <P>I was not amazed at Deputy Smith's comments because, coming from a landlocked constituency, he does not have a great deal of experience in maritime matters.  However, he should think twice before trying to impede progress on maritime safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> I fail to understand why Members opposite object to this legislation.  We are surrounded by masts in west Cork and we are surviving.  The sooner the better the Opposition realises that we must keep in line with the European Union on maritime safety issues.  The people of west Clare have nothing to fear from the erection of this mast.  There are two spiralling towers on Mount Gabriel and a tall mast on Mizen Head, none of which has had serious consequences for people living near them.</P>
    <P>We must upgrade our maritime safety institutions. Do Members opposite want our fishing trawlers which operate up to 300 lines off our coastline cut off from communications on the mainland?  Common sense must prevail on this matter.  The attitude of Members opposite is similar to Rome burning while Nero fiddled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is intended to allow the Commissioners of Irish Lights to continue to provide the navigational assistance they currently provide to mariners around our coast.  The legislation is necessary because the 19th century legislation under which the commissioners had been operating did not anticipate the changes in navigational technology which are now common place.  It is difficult to understand why Members opposite want to oppose legislation which attempts to rectify that anomaly and which would allow the Commissioners of Irish Lights to continue to provide, on a legal basis, navigational aids that are necessary for the safety of life and maritime activity around our coast.</P>
      <P>The Opposition's collective amnesia about Loran C is difficult to take.  The proposal in regard to Loran C was introduced by a Fianna Fáil-PD Government.  When the matter was debated here I did not hear comments from Members opposite about the right of the public to be informed.  It was the Government's responsibility at that time to inform people of its intentions.  The motion committed this country to an international agreement in regard to Loran C and we must live with its obvious implications.</P>
      <P>This Government inherited the Loran C project at a time when the matter was already before the courts.</P>
      <P>As it was before the courts, the Government did not proceed with that project.  In introducing this legislation, we have not avoided the issue of Loran C, which is of concern to the public, particularly those in the County Clare area.  The Minister announced that the Loran C project will be the subject of review by a public forum.  The issues raised publicly about Loran C, whether they relate to the necessity for the system, its comparison with other terrestrial-navigational systems, its uses, the modernity of the technology or any other aspect of it including the location of the site and the implications of that for the local people, will be the subject of public discussion, debate and consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> The matter will be the subject of an independent report which will be published and will be in the public domain.  People who have concerns about the system will have a forum where they can express those concerns and where they will be tested.  When putting forward a proposition for a system, the technological aspects of which the public are not familiar with, it is important that the claims made for and against such a system are tested in public debate.</P>
    <P>The Government is providing for a process of consultation, information and public debate, which should have taken place five years ago before the motion was introduced in the House by a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government to commit the country to the Loran C project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that Loran C is a matter of concern.  I thought the Government was trying to avoid the topic, but the Minister referred to it in some detail, although it was not sufficient to benefit those who are interested in the wider context of the debate.  Deputy Hugh Byrne believes that this is a local matter for the people of County Clare, while Deputy Sheehan believes it is a matter for Irish navigation, but it is much more than that.  It is not only a local matter, it is an international matter relating to agreements between this country and particularly the French and Dutch &mdash; perhaps other countries are involved and we must await that information because we have not got the full story in this debate.  The Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, who were in Government at the time the motion was introduced, probably know more than they are saying and that is regrettable.  It is also perhaps a source of embarrassment since the shoe is on the other foot now.</P>
      <P>Improvements in safety measures are welcome, but it is important to realise that navigation and marine safety measures already exist.  Without Loran C boats did not founder around the coast. Loran C, however, will be an enormous boost to military, particularly NATO, interests in Europe. It is in that regard that the interests of Irish people, who wish Ireland to remain a neutral country, must be taken into account.  That is the issue that must be focused on because nobody disagrees about safety at sea.  Control of this mast will not be in County Clare, or indeed in Ireland; it will be in Brest, the centre of the French navy. It will be paid for not alone by Irish taxpayers but by international agreement, in proportionate amounts, between the French and Dutch as well as the Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder why we are introducing technology which, as has been stated by many experts, is not state of the art, but which is required by the other participants in this deal.  Not only will it be of little interest to navigational concerns in Ireland but, compared to the GPS system, those using Irish waters will not be able to afford the receivers.  The GPS system has been well tried <Col N="115" /> and tested around our shores and has served fishermen and leisure boat users well in the past.  If we are looking for an alternative to the American GPS satellite system, why not consider a Europe-wide non-military GPS system which is affordable &mdash; I understand that a hand held receiver costs about £200.  Such a system would serve the Irish people and would meet safety and navigational needs.</P>
    <P>There is little point in introducing a system that is very costly and would not be used except by submarines and military naval vessels.  That would be not only foolish but would end our neutrality, which has been watered down in the past. It would not be possible to argue that Ireland is a neutral country if we agree deals with military powers.  From time to time members of the Government wear CND badges, but how can they reconcile membership of the Government with membership of CND, which is mutually exclusive?</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to reconsider the Loran C arrangement, that is assuming that we have not already made a deal.  That matter has not been clarified.  To guillotine this important Bill, which deals with much more than navigational aid, is inexplicable and downright irresponsible.  It should receive the full attention it deserves and should be dealt with properly on Committee Stage.  I urge the Government to consider a GPS system that would be controlled by Europe and one that Irish navigational interests could afford.</P>
    <P>There should be greater focus in this debate on the Commissioners of Irish Lights as an organisation. While the Loran C issue is of some urgency, given its tortuous and controversial passage through the planning process and the courts, it is important that we do not overlook the fact that control of Irish Lights lies outside this country.  As a people, we should take control of Irish Lights, perhaps in a shared capacity, but we should not give away sovereignty of our coastline, as is indicated by the structure of Irish Lights.  I would like to know how the Commissioners of Irish Lights can be made more accountable to the people.  They are not representing the interests of the people if they propose Loran C as a system of navigation for Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the wonderful work being done by the Commissioners of Irish Lights. It is nice to see international co-operation in all aspects of navigational aid.  We should bear in mind that this is a service to mankind.  In 1968, as a result of a lack of navigational aids, an Aer Lingus Viscount airplane disappeared off the south-east coast of Ireland and was never seen again.  We should be delighted that we have an advanced navigational system, such as the proposed Loran C.</P>
      <P>Members have said that the headquarters of this navigational system is based in Brest in France.  We should bear in mind that France is not a member of NATO.  I would not object if it was because we depend on countries such as France, Britain and America to defend civilisation. If Loran C helps these countries, then we should agree to it.  We should stop being hypocrites and hiding behind other countries when it comes to defending the people because that is what we have been doing for too long.  It is about time we showed some manliness and stuck our necks out to help others by providing the necessary infrastructure and logistics.</P>
      <P>I remember a time not too many years ago when the Americans defended the Middle East against Saddam Hussein, who is still on the rampage, and many people in this House objected to Shannon Airport being used as a transit point for American forces going to the Gulf War.  Instead of thanking these people for saving mankind from tyrants such as Saddam Hussein and Hitler, we are trying to encourage people to carry out such acts by sticking our heads in the sand.</P>
      <P>The Government is doing a good job.  We should give every assistance for the benefit of mankind.  If this portion of the network fits in with the plans for proper navigation by ships or aircraft, then so be it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been accused of many things tonight, including being sly, misleading and dishonest.  The only people who are dishonest are those to whom I spoke last week when I explained the difficulties that existed.  I explained to the two spokespersons from the Opposition parties that I had received a letter from the chairman of the Commissioners of Irish Lights telling me they were withdrawing all services as and from 14 February unless legislation was passed or an indemnity was given by <Col N="117" /> the Government.  I explained that we were not in a position to grant an indemnity because there is no legislative base for granting one as moneys have to be voted by the Houses of the Oireachtas. I will now read extracts from the letter from the chairman of the Commissioners of Irish Lights, Mr. Michael O'Neill.  It states:</P>
      <P>On Friday last, the 24th inst., [that is, the 24 January] the CIL Board met to consider legal opinion obtained from Solicitors and Senior Counsel which advised that each Commissioner is potentially liable for any claims or expenses arising out of the non-statutory illegal operation of radio aids.  Legislation to retrospectively legitimise radio aids could not validate any action which a Court might find to be illegal.  There is the added difficulty that the monies necessary to operate such unauthorised aids may not be paid out of the General Lighthouse Fund.</P>
      <P>If immediate remedial legislative action is not taken, or an acceptable indemnity is not given to the Commissioners, the Board will have no option but to give Mariners on the 14th February next a formal notice of the termination of radio aids to navigation.</P>
      <P>I attach, for your information, a list, together with diagrams of services affected, and a draft of the proposed Notice to Mariners.</P>
      <P>The proposed notice to mariners states:</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights hereby give notice that from mid-day on Friday 28th February 1997, or as soon thereafter as possible, all electronic aids fitted at Lighthouses and Buoys and operated from locations in the Republic of Ireland will be switched off.</P>
      <P>People are trying to tell me that I am using a back door method to introduce Loran C and that I am panicking by bringing in this legislation and trying to ram it through the Dáil without any consultation or debate.  What would other Members do if they were the Minister for the Marine and they received a letter to say that the Commissioners of Irish Lights were switching off all radio navigational aids to shipping, fishing vessels, yachts and everything that floats on the seas around Ireland?  Would they introduce legislation?</P>
      <P>I was also accused of misleading the House this morning.  I was told by Deputy de Valera that I pretended this legislation did not apply to Loran C.I made no such suggestion.  I said this morning on the Order of Business that the primary function of this legislation was to ensure that radio navigational aids to shipping could continue and that the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be given the power to maintain and service such aids.  I also said I would announce this evening how we could deal with the Loran C issue separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those who were not here, or who did not listen or wanted to use the opportunity to drum up political hysteria in County Clare so that public <Col N="118" /> meetings could be held and people could make wild allegations and say I was a quisling who was running to introduce legislation, I have no intention of abrogating my responsibility to the shipping and fishing industries and to people who use leisure craft who would see radio navigational aids switched off because we did not have the bottle to bring in legislation.  I knew people would make a political football out of it and I knew the game that would be played by the Opposition.  I knew it would drum up opposition and say that I was trying to establish the Loran C system through the back door.  I am around long enough to realise what it is up to and know exactly the game it is playing but I have stymied its attempt to castigate my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Donal Carey, and Senators Madeleine Taylor-Quinn and Howard, as if they were aliens trying to destroy west Clare.  The public forum, which will consist of three independent individuals, will present every man, woman and child in County Clare and every group in the country with an opportunity to make their case as to why the Loran C system should not be operated from County Clare and to identify the associated health dangers, if any.</P>
    <P>We should contrast this open and transparent attempt to explain what is involved with the attempt made in 1992 by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government to ram through the Dáil a motion which committed Ireland to ratifying an international agreement.  Did Deputies Molloy and Smith open their mouths and voice their concerns about the Loran C system or mention the people of west Clare when the matter was being discussed at the Cabinet table?  They are now using it as a political football and trying to pretend Ireland is sneaking into NATO and we are trying to put the Loran C system in place through the back door.</P>
    <P>I have directed the Commissioners of Irish Lights not to proceed with the erection of a mast in any location, in Clare or elsewhere, without first seeking planning permission in the proper fashion.  How more open or transparent can one be?  In addition, the entire issue must be examined in a public forum which will consist of three independent individuals whose report will be published and debated.  We should contrast this with the attempt made in 1992 to ram through the House a motion which committed Ireland to ratifying an international agreement.  Nobody knew exactly what was involved but the papers were in the Cabinet room.</P>

I asked them to bear with me and said I would seek assistance from the Opposition.  I also told them it normally takes two weeks before an Opposition party would be expected to take a piece of legislation.  I explained to them that I would meet the Opposition spokespersons and ask them to co-operate with me in processing as quickly as possible this legislation to restore power to the Commissioners of Irish Lights so that they would not be found personally liable.

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply to this matter which requires urgent action.  The recent study carried out by Barnardo's child care workers contains disturbing information on child prostitution in this city which requires an urgent Government response.  The study revealed there are a growing number of young people and children, male and female, involved in selling sex on the streets of Dublin at night.  Some of these individuals are as young as 12 years of age.</P>
      <P>These young people come from a range of backgrounds, often from abusive and violent homes.  They have been observed by Barnardo's child care workers, either alone or in groups of two or three, working the streets &mdash; in particular areas such as Westmoreland Street, Benburb Street, the Phoenix Park and Pearse Street &mdash; being picked up in cars and returned to the same locations.  For example, on Friday, 15 November 1996 ten young people, all male, were observed soliciting in Westmoreland Street.  Drug abuse and addiction among these young people is all too common and many of them are obliged to sleep rough and have no homes to which they can return.</P>
      <P>I call for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a pilot project, involving all relevant Departments, statutory bodies &mdash; including the Garda Síochána &mdash; and voluntary organisations, to reach out to children and young people involved in prostitution in our capital's city centre. This project must be established quickly to prevent an escalation of the problem.  What is not required is another committee or report.  Only by effective action &ldquo;on the street&rdquo; can we hope to come to grips with the real issues, identify the extent of the problem and understand the factors that led these young people to become involved in prostitution.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Minister of State are in a position to take effective action which does not involve the introduction of legislation or the establishment of further committees or advisory groups.  As a result of the findings of the Barnardo's report, we have an opportunity to discover the real facts.</P>
      <P>The young people involved must be contacted by experienced workers and have access to a safe house or drop-in centre.  They will need to experience an informal, supportive environment where they can receive counselling, advice and education in matters of personal hygiene and health. They will also need assistance in developing skills to enable them to replace their current income through more socially acceptable activities.  In some instances, they will need help to rebuild relationships with their families or develop more positive social networks.  Some will need to be linked to more specialist services to adequately deal with the psychological trauma they suffered and the complexities of their experiences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential to understand the factors that led these young people into homelessness and prostitution if other people are to be saved from this experience.  Primarily, young people beginning to drift away from their families, schools and communities must be identified and given support to keep them in their local environment.  There is a need for further support structures to resolve family difficulties locally, particularly where adolescents and pre-adolescents are involved.  There is also a need to keep them within the school system because, once they drop out, there is usually <Col N="125" /> no other safety net for them.  There is a need to help them access social networks within their communities &mdash; sports organisations, football clubs and recreational centres &mdash; and build positive relationships with adults.</P>
    <P>At a time when the economy is booming, it is totally unacceptable that so many of our children are involved in prostitution on the streets of Dublin. This study demonstrates clearly that action by the Government is immediately required.  I urge the Minister of State to respond to the realistic proposals I have put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>While this report has received wide publicity, I understand it was prepared by Barnardo's for internal use.  Such important and controversial matters, which arouse public concern, deserve to be handled with greater discretion. Although the report referred to by the Deputy has not been formally published, I received a copy of it this afternoon.  It is being studied by officials in my Department.  I will also ask the Eastern Health Board for its comments on the serious issues raised in the report.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, my Department was made aware by the Eastern Health Board of its concerns about the involvement of young people in prostitution.  The board's staff are aware of the risk to young people and encourage them to talk about their involvement in prostitution.  Any relevant information is relayed to the Garda Síochána and both agencies have worked together successfully on specific cases in the past.</P>
      <P>The health board is concerned with providing care and support to young people and their families and in taking steps to prevent other vulnerable young people at risk of becoming involved in this dangerous behaviour.  It is acknowledged there is often a link between drug misuse and involvement in prostitution, particularly among young males.  The services being developed for young drug misusers in the Dublin area will help to address this problem.  The range of intervention projects currently available in the Eastern Health Board area &mdash; such as neighbourhood youth projects, the day project for out of home young people, after schools projects, after care services and child care and family support services generally &mdash; serve to reduce the risk of involvement in prostitution by young people.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that since 1993 more than £40 million has been provided to develop services under the Child Care Act &mdash; including family support and community services.  This package included the provision of more than 900 new posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and the Chair for permitting me to raise this issue.  I call on the Government to take steps to provide for the reception of RTÉ 1, Network Two and <Col N="126" /> Téilifis na Gaeilge in Great Britain.  I have been contacted by many Irish emigrants in Britain who have sought the provision of such a service for many years.</P>
      <P>I understand efforts are being made to increase the power northwards from the RTÉ and Téilifis na Gaeilge transmitter at Clarmount Carn, County Louth, to improve reception in Northern Ireland.  It must be possible to establish a phased increase in the power of this transmitter eastwards to provide reception in Great Britain.  At present, emigrants can only receive a patchy RTÉ off air signal on the west coast of Britain.  The quality of reception varies, depending on location, and is subject to interference from other television channels.  However, I understand RTÉ estimates that coverage will increase from the current level of 30 per cent of the population of Northern Ireland to approximately 60 to 70 per cent if a phased increase in power is approved from the Clarmount Carn transmitter.  Why not seek approval for terrestrial coverage of Britain? I call on the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to do so because emigrants are seeking coverage of RTÉ television programmes.  This is a practical way to continue the link with home for emigrants.</P>
      <P>The matter of RTÉ reception in Northern Ireland is being dealt with under the aegis of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  Would it not be possible to discuss the issue I raised with the British Government and find practical and reasonable solutions to any problems which may arise? Increasing power northwards at the Clarmount Carn transmitter will probably mean that, in addition to people in Northern Ireland, those living in Scotland will also benefit.  Why can people in England not benefit, particularly the large numbers of Irish emigrants who reside there?</P>
      <P>Viewers in the extended coverage area who wish to receive these services may be obliged to install appropriate aerials but this is not a major problem.  In Ireland, many people who wish to view programmes on Téilifis na Gaeilge must install a special aerial.  We are informed that parts of the east coast of Ireland receive multi-channel television because of a geographical accident but this does not work in the opposite direction. However, it is one of the reasons people in the west have availed of the deflector system.  Such a system was recently shut down in County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deflector system or its MMDS counterpart cannot be used to transmit RTÉ television programmes to Irish emigrants in Britain.  The Minister should indicate to the Secretary of State for National Heritage that this Government and RTÉ would be prepared to pay some of the engineering costs arising from the provision of RTÉ programmes to Great Britain.  If other issues of a practical nature arise, they should be addressed by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I hope the Minister will show commitment to the proposal I am making. He knows there are millions of Irish emigrants throughout Great Britain.  I know of one Irish <Col N="127" /> person in London who had a trial broadcast of a radio service devoted to Irish programmes which attracted an audience of 1.2 million people.  The same audience is available for RTÉ I, Network Two and Teilifís na Gaeilge.  I hope the Minister will look for the political agreement that is necessary to have these proposals implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>As the Minister indicated to the Dáil as recently as 5 February 1997 in answer to a similar question from the same Deputy:</P>
      <P>RTÉ informs me that fringe off-air reception is available on the west coast of Britain.  The quality of reception varies depending on the location and is subject to interference from other television channels.  Having regard to international agreements to which Ireland is a party and which are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, it is not practical to effect any further improvement in terrestrial coverage of Britain.</P>
      <P>The UHF spectrum is now intensively used in Great Britain for television broadcasting.  A change in the characteristics of an Irish high powered transmitter &mdash; such as an increase in power sufficient to significantly benefit viewers in Wales &mdash; would almost certainly cause an increase in interference in the service areas of some UK stations.  It would thus be difficult, if not impossible, to reach agreement with the UK regulatory authorities on any increase in power at the Irish transmitters.</P>
      <P>Radio Teilifís Éireann informs me that the distance between Ireland and Great Britain is such that Irish television transmitters can provide quality service only to those residents of Great Britain who are about 120 kilometres off Ireland and who also have a clear line of sight to the West.  This restricts coverage of RTÉ, Network 2 and Teilifís na Gaeilge to a relatively small number in Wales.</P>
      <P>The closest city with a large Irish population, Liverpool, is over 200 kilometres from the nearest high-powered transmitter, Kippure, and is thus well outside the fringe coverage area of Kippure. Because of the distances involved, it is impractical to attempt to improve coverage along the west coast of Great Britain by increasing the power of those television transmitters which are close to the east coast of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I should also like to point out, however, that Tara Television, which is a compilation of news, RTÉ 1, Network 2 and programmes from the RTÉ archives, is available throughout most of Great Britain.  Several of the cable television companies have taken Tara Television and it is thus available to subscribers to these cable systems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to discuss the extremely important issue of the appalling conditions the children and staff of the Cork National School Project have to endure, and the need for the immediate construction of an extension to dramatically improve the school.</P>
      <P>The present condition of the school constitutes an emergency and justifies the immediate provision of funding to facilitate the requested extension by reference to criteria announced by the Minister recently in the Dáil when she stated that there were three categories which allowed for immediate provision of funding and on which she based her allocation of funding for particular school projects.  She said that those on an emergency basis got priority.  By any analysis, this school is such an emergency.</P>
      <P>The lack of proper sanitation facilities is a scandal and the Minister stands condemned for her failure to act.  The school medical officer, who is the medical officer for the Southern Health Board area, has written a report on the health implications for children attending the school.  He pointed out that the number of toilet cubicles available to the school is seven when the minimum requirement of a school of its size is 16. There are only two cubicles which are suitable for use by infants.  At present the number of infant children using these facilities is 69.  The medical officer believes that the children are exposed to several health risks.  He stated that there is a definite possibility of an infectious disease, such as salmonella or hepatitis A occurring, and that the overcrowding increases the risk of injury to children. This report by the medical officer was written on 6 April 1996.  It baffles me that the Minister could be in possession of such a letter for so long without taking action.  Such negligence and indifference are nothing short of disgraceful.</P>
      <P>Overall there are 270 children attending the school.  In addition to the lack of proper sanitation facilities there is an acute and chronic lack of space.  There is no staff room.  The principal's office, which is 12 feet by nine feet, serves as a staff and meeting room.  There is no room for the resource teacher.  There is a need for a multi-purpose hall and additional classrooms, appropriate secretarial space and an appropriate office for the principal.  The estimated cost of the extension, which would provide adequate sanitary facilities, a staff room and principal's office, is £80,000, a relatively insignificant amount compared with other projects that have already been sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Education is rich in rhetoric on multi-denominational education, but the record of this Minister in supporting multi-denominational schools has been mean-spirited. We were all shocked by the ongoing neglect of Crumlin multi-denominational national school and the failure of the Department to provide suitable accommodation for it.  The Cork National School Project was the first multi-denominational national school in Munster when it opened in <Col N="129" /> 1987, having received sanction from the Minister for Education at the time, Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  Since then it has occupied six temporary premises before moving to its present location in 1994.  From October 1994 onwards the school has sought this modest extension and has been in ongoing correspondence with the Department but to no avail.  Maybe the imminence of a general election will bring a change of heart and some compassion on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by the Minister for Education to reply to this question.  I am pleased the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position of the Department of Education in relation to the remedial works sought at the Cork National School Project.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education is aware that the school has a current staffing of a principal, nine assistants and a current enrolment of 267 and the existing accommodation consists of eight classrooms.  The Minister understands that the school employs one of these assistants as a resource teacher.  The Department sanctioned the rental of a prefab in September 1996 but the school management decided not to pursue this option.</P>
      <P>The Minister met a delegation from the school recently.  At this meeting, the delegation voiced their concerns about the condition of the sanitary facilities and the need for a library and medical room, principal's office and staff room.  The school management has furnished a report prepared by the Southern Health Board which describes the condition of the sanitary facilities. The Minister knows these facilities are unsatisfactory. An outline sketch scheme for the works requested has also been submitted to the Department by the school.  The current position relating to the proposal is that this scheme is one of a number of urgent projects the Minister is considering in the 1997 building programme.  The Minister will make a decision in the matter shortly which will be conveyed to the school management.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured of the Minister's desire to see an immediate improvement in the facilities at this school and I thank him again for the opportunity to outline the current position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this particularly important topic.  I question the implementation of the calf slaughtering policy by Ireland and suggest that culling of older cows would be a better option.  This is a voluntary scheme to control the supply of cattle in the European Union because of over-supply.  Slaughtering calves may suit other members states but it does not suit Ireland.  Our cattle and beef industry is ten times more important to our economy relative to other EU states.  Culling older cows, putting them into intervention or disposing of them <Col N="130" /> to Third World countries, as is done now and was done in the 1970s, would have a beneficial effect in reducing the over-supply and would be cheaper for the EU taxpayers.</P>
      <P>Slaughtering calves is a bizarre doctrine of despair which is immoral.  It cuts off the supply of raw material for the beef industry.  Slaughtering a calf attracts a subsidy of £88 but the added value to the economy is lost as are all the future premia and subsidies.  There is also a substantial loss of jobs down the line in the beef processing factories. For every calf slaughtered up to £300 in various subsidies and premia are lost, all of which are EU financed.  However, the biggest loss is to the industry because slaughtering calves makes the remainder more expensive for the beef finishers.</P>
      <P>This scheme will create a bigger problem than it will solve and I ask the Minister to terminate it.  The scheme is economically and socially unacceptable.  I urge him to consider the option of disposing of older culled cows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity of setting out the background to the EU calf processing scheme and other measures geared towards restoring balance to the Community beef market.  Since the eruption of the BSE crisis last March the beef industry in the EU has undergone a very difficult period.  Apart from its effect on cattle prices and producers' incomes, the crisis has substantial long-term implications for the beef sector.  Unfortunately, consumer confidence in beef has been seriously undermined and while there has been a significant recovery in the consumption of beef in recent months, beef consumption is unlikely ever to return to pre-BSE levels.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission and the Council of Ministers for Agriculture recognised at an early stage that the BSE crisis had created a new permanent surplus in the EU and that the surplus had to be removed in order to restore the beef market to balance.  The reality facing the beef market was that the GATT limits on subsidised exports prevented the EU from exporting the new beef surplus to third countries.  These limits are set to fall from 1.19 million tonnes this year to 820,000 tonnes by 2000.  The EU simply had no choice but to reduce beef production to the new lower level of beef consumption and, with this in mind, the Commission submitted proposals to the Council in August for a reform of the beef regime and the Council adopted these proposals in amended form at the end of October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main elements of the reform package were as follows: first, the introduction of a single premium for bulls, the objective of which is to curtail the growth of beef production.  As bull production in Ireland represents only about 1 per cent of production, the impact of this measure here will be negligible; second, measures to encourage extensive production systems.  The increased payments for producers whose stocking <Col N="131" /> densities are under one livestock unit per hectare will benefit some 66,000 producers to the tune of an extra £15 million; third, the temporary reduction in member states' quotas for the beef premium and the freezing of unused suckler cow quota rights over the next two years.  These measures will have little or no impact on producers as our production base is fully protected; fourth, an increase in the intervention ceilings above those agreed under the CAP reform agreement of 1992 in order to cope with surplus production pending the impact of the measures aimed at reducing beef production and fifth, member states would be obliged to introduce either an early marketing premium for veal calves or to implement the calf processing premium for the period 1 December 1997 to 30 November 1998.  The intention is that the combination of these measures will reduce by one million the number of calves available for beef production, thereby reducing beef production by 350,000 tonnes per annum.</P>
    <P>With regard to the calf processing scheme, I wish to point out that the scheme is not voluntary. A voluntary calf processing scheme was agreed as part of the 1992 CAP reform measures.  No member state exercised this option until the BSE crisis of 1996 when the UK, France and Portugal introduced the scheme, under which 425,000 male dairy calves were slaughtered.</P>
    <P>Under the reform measures which were agreed last October, member states are now obliged to introduce either the early marketing premium scheme for veal calves or the calf processing scheme.  The UK, Ireland, Portugal and France have introduced the calf processing scheme, with France introducing both schemes.  The other member states will operate the early marketing premium scheme.</P>
    <P>Given that we do not have a veal production system in Ireland, we have no option but to introduce the calf processing scheme.  A total of nine EU export licensed meat premises have been selected here as processing centres.  These were <Col N="132" /> selected on geographical criteria to minimise haulage distances for calves and ensure that the highest welfare and hygiene conditions apply to its operation.  A processing premium of ECU 120 is payable on male dairy breed calves and ECU 150 on beef breed calves which are less than 20 days old.  The premium will be paid only on animals which are in a fit and healthy condition on presentation and are processed in conformity with the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The number of calves processed under the scheme in Ireland to date is 770 out of an EU total of 300,000.  The number of calves entering the scheme will be determined by the price of calves relative to the value of the premium.  As calf prices in Ireland are traditionally higher than in the EU, it follows that only the poorer quality calves from the dairy herd are likely to be attracted.  This is borne out by the fact that virtually all the calves slaughtered to date were dairy breeds.</P>
    <P>The calf processing scheme and the early marketing premium scheme are monitored closely by the EU Commission.  In the Presidency compromise under which these measure were agreed last October, the Commission was asked to come forward with a report by June on the effectiveness of the schemes.  Based on this report the Council has committed itself to reviewing the schemes. This review will also examine the contribution made by each member state in order to ensure a fair balance of supply control across the Community and to avoid any possible trade distortion.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the removal of young bull calves represents a loss in future premium income and in output to the national economy.  However, these losses must be measured against the losses that would arise if no action was taken to restore market balance.  It is in the long-term interest of beef producers in Ireland that balance is restored to the EU market and Ireland must be seen to make a reasonable contribution to this effort.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 February 1997.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 58 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>Since the waiting list initiative commenced in 1993, it has focused upon those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times were causing the greatest hardship.  These areas included ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, plastic surgery, vascular surgery, general surgery, gynaecology and urology.  Attention has been focused most specifically upon the position of adults waiting over 12 months and children waiting over six months in these target specialties.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting lists for surgery in the target specialties over the last three years.  When the waiting list initiative commenced in June 1993, there was 40,130 people on waiting lists for hospital treatment. Waiting list figures for the end of 1996 show that the number of persons waiting for treatment at the end of 1996 had fallen to 25,959. This represents significant progress in the reduction of waiting lists and demonstrates the Government's concern to ensure that the necessary resources are provided to improve waiting times for treatment.</P>
      <P>I am happy to assure the House that special measures to reduce waiting lists will continue in 1997.  The provision of special funding to reduce waiting times continues to be a priority for the Government and £4 million has been provided in the budget to continue progress in this area.  This provision will bring to £8 million the total funding available in 1997 to address the problem of long waiting times for elective surgery.  The funding provided in 1997 brings to £58 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiative commenced in 1993.  My Department will be holding detailed discussions with health agencies in the coming weeks on the allocation of this funding.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>In December of last year I announced to the House the establishment of an expert group to examine the full range of issues surrounding the transmission of infectious diseases in healthcare settings.  An earlier group had looked at the problem of hepatitis B and a circular was issued by my Department to all health agencies in December 1996 instructing them to put in place arrangements to establish the immune status of all new health service personnel who were likely to undertake exposure-prone procedures.</P>
      <P>In the period which had elapsed since the establishment of the earlier group other issues in this whole area had come to the fore.  The policy of not screening existing employees who might be at risk of transmitting infectious diseases had also been raised.  I, therefore, decided to establish a new group with comprehensive terms of reference to examine all of the many complex issues which surround the transmission of infectious diseases in health agencies.  The group is chaired by a deputy chief medical officer in my Department and I have asked them to report to me by the end of March.  The group has already had two meetings and I am confident that they will complete the task assigned to them by the date specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical profession is fully involved in the group and doctors constitute a majority of the <Col N="135" /> membership.  The members of the group were selected for their expertise in the area of infectious diseases.  I intend to have full consultation with the medical, nursing and other professions concerned before any of the group's recommendations are implemented.  In relation to the circular on screening for hepatitis B I have pointed out previously that the recommendation to introduce this measure came from a group on which the two major medical organisations were well represented.</P>
    <P>The issue of compensation for health care workers who test positive for any infectious condition is a complex one.  This is being addressed by the expert group and it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment on it in advance of receiving the group's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 144 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>Information available to me on smoking trends in the population indicates that the percentage of people overall who smoke continues to fall year on year.  However, I have identified a need for more detailed information in this regard.  Therefore I propose to commission a detailed lifestyle survey, incorporating more comprehensive information on smoking.  This would include the reasons people smoke, with a view to informing decisions on further anti-smoking initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health promotion initiatives under way to mark Ash Wednesday include refocusing on the Health Promotion Unit's major multi-media campaign, &ldquo;Say what you like, smoking kills&rdquo; which uses black humour to highlight the harmful effects of smoking.  I have also recently launched the Smoking Target Action Group's new campaign which looks at the effects of passive smoking on children.  This campaign uses print materials and radio to heighten awareness of this issue and has already received favourable attention from the media.  In addition, anti-smoking <Col N="136" /> schools based programmes are ongoing and public information materials are available from the Health Promotion Unit.  Action against smoking also continues at health board level and in the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>A range of other measures are also in place to help curtail tobacco consumption.  Environmental controls on smoking were strengthened and extended in 1996.  Smoking is prohibited in many areas frequented by children.  These include primary schools, secondary schools, child care centres, pre-schools, crèches, play groups, day nurseries or other services which cater for children. Smoking is also prohibited in public areas in banks, building societies, barber shops, hairdressing salons, bowling alleys, bingo halls, bridge centres, hospitals, doctors' and dentists' waiting rooms, taxis and hackney cabs.  I have also introduced new restrictions on smoking in cafes, canteens, restaurants and snack bars providing for specified non-smoking areas.  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that taxation on tobacco was increased in the recent budget.  He will also be interested to learn that a further cut of 5 per cent will be made in the maximum allowable expenditure by tobacco companies on advertising and sponsorship for 1997.  Tobacco company budgets were also cut by 5 per cent in 1996.</P>
    <P>The Deputy refers in his question to a committee and I presume he is referring to a committee which sat some years ago to look at the question of extending existing smoking controls to the workplace.  Arising out of this committee's work, an information resource, &ldquo;Working together for cleaner air,&rdquo; containing a Voluntary Code on Smoking in the Workplace, was developed by the Health Promotion Unit of my Department with the support of the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation and the Health and Safety Authority, and endorsed by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The booklet is aimed at gaining consensus on smoking control policies in the workplace and has been widely disseminated. An evaluation of this initiative is almost complete and I am pleased to say that, based on the preliminary feedback available to me, there appears to be a consensus in industry that the voluntary approach is effective in the workplace.</P>

        <b>):</b> I am aware of the problems experienced in the accident and emergency department at Cork University Hospital.  For this reason I welcomed the Southern Health Board's decision in May <Col N="137" /> 1995 to establish a working group to review the organisation and delivery of accident and emergency services in Cork.  The group met on a number of occasions under the chairmanship of Mr. Stephen Cusack, accident and emergency consultant at Cork University Hospital.

      <P>I am fully supportive of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption and its objectives.  It represents an important instrument for improved international co-operation in the area of child protection.  In order to demonstrate the Government's commitment towards the Convention and our intention of ratifying it, Ireland signed the Convention on 19 June 1996.</P>
      <P>Before the Convention can be ratified by Ireland, it will be necessary to give the Convention the force of law in the State.  This will involve making major changes to our domestic adoption legislation including the Adoption Act, 1991 which contains the current statutory procedures for the regulation and recognition of foreign adoptions.</P>
      <P>I have not been in a position to bring forward the necessary legislation thus far as the immediate priority in the area of adoption has been the Adoption (No. 2) Bill 1996.  This Bill addresses the issues arising from the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v</i> Ireland and also provides for the recognition of adoptions in countries whose law provides for the termination of adoption in certain circumstances. I would point out that both these issues arose subsequent to the completion of the Hague Convention.</P>

In general, hospitals unable to provide a 24 hour service are providing an epidural service, for specified periods, by prior arrangement.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there have been difficulties in providing an epidural service at Sligo General Hospital in the past.  The desirability of continuing the service had to be reviewed by the North Western Health Board against a background of increasing demand and concerns about patient safety.  The full service implication is being reappraised by the health board with a view to putting in place a significantly enhanced service.  I would anticipate the health boards will continue to make provision for further improvements in the general delivery of epidural services in their 1997 service plans.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind perhaps he might furnish me with the details and I will be pleased to have the matter examined.</P>

        <b>):</b> The Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital operates a 24 hour ophthalmic accident and emergency service seven days each week.  It also operates a five day accident and emergency service <Col N="139" /> for the treatment of ear nose and throat conditions. This service is available from 8.00 a.m.- 5.00 p.m., Monday - Friday.</P>
      <P>The accident and emergency department at the Eye and Ear Hospital receives approximately 42,000 attendances per annum.  I am not aware that the hospital has received any significant volume of complaints regarding the operation of its accident and emergency department.  It must be appreciated that because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict, with certainty, the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments at any particular time.  On occasions, pressures may arise outside of normal working hours.</P>
      <P>In general, hospitals operate a policy which accords priority to those most in need.  In the normal course, this means that persons with less serious complaints may have to wait while higher priority cases are being treated.</P>
      <P>Experience in the provision of accident and emergency services has shown that a significant number of those who attend could be treated as effectively and far quicker by their family doctor. This is why the current public education campaign on the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments was launched.  The thrust behind the campaign is to keep accident and emergency departments clear for recognised urgent emergencies.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a specific case in mind, perhaps he would furnish the details to me and I will arrange for the hospital to investigate the circumstances.</P>

The birth notification system provides the basis for the annual &ldquo;Perinatal Statistics&rdquo; report which is published by my Department.  This report includes information relating to stillbirths and early neonatal deaths caused by congenital abnormalities and other conditions.</P>
      <P>However, the birth notification system is designed to provide early notification of births and many birth defects may not be diagnosed until a later stage in the development of the child.

        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> A junior doctor, who worked in the Surgical Department of Letterkenny General Hospital, was confirmed HIV-positive on 3 December 1996.  The doctor had been employed at the hospital for four months, from 1 July 1996 to 4 November 1996, during which time he assisted in a number of invasive surgical procedures.  The doctor had previously worked on a surgical team at Limerick Regional Hospital from 25 March 1996 to 13 June 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the doctor's HIV status was confirmed, a decision to undertake a look-back programme and to inform the public of the situation was made by the North-Western and Mid-Western Health Boards.  To date all patients who opted for testing have tested negative for the HIV virus, although because of the window period for infection a number of repeat tests have still to be carried <Col N="141" /> out.  The doctor is no longer employed in the Irish health service.</P>
    <P>The source of the HIV infection of a healthcare worker in the South Eastern Health Board was confirmed to have been a contaminated blood transfusion which she received in the summer of 1985, prior to the introduction of routine HIV screening of blood donations.</P>
    <P>The person has not been at work since the diagnosis was confirmed.</P>
    <P>The person concerned had never worked in the operating theatre area of the hospital and was only involved in a small number of exposure prone procedures, all of which are in the low risk category.  Thirteen patients were identified as having possibly been exposed to low medical risk as a result of contact with the healthcare worker. These patients were contacted by their general practitioners and advised of the situation.  Eleven of these patients opted for HIV testing and all tested negative.</P>
    <P>Statistics in relation to the number of persons tested in this country for HIV and confirmed to be positive, as supplied to the Department of Health by the virus reference laboratory, are as follows: To date 119,634 HIV tests have been carried out, of which 1,731 were positive.</P>
    <P>The statistics in relation to AIDS are as follows: As at 31 December 1996, the number of persons positive for AIDS is 577.  Up to 31 December 1996, 304 people have died from AIDS.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The number of cases of bacterial meningitis, including meningococcal septicaemia, notified to my Department in the period 1 August 1996 to 31 January 1997 was 213.  The number of cases of viral meningitis notified during the same period was 45.</P>
      <P>The steps which have been taken to raise awareness of meningitis include an interview given by me to the national media to alert parents, the public at large and doctors of the importance of being extra vigilant for meningitis. Press Facts on Meningitis were issued to the national media.  My Department's Health Promotion Unit distributed a revised meningitis leaflet to the health boards and a new leaflet for general practitioners has also been distributed to the health boards.  The Health Promotion Unit is also providing financial assistance for the production of a meningitis leaflet by the Union of Students in Ireland and the Meningitis Research Foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of this winter the chief medical officer of my Department wrote to the directors <Col N="142" /> of public health, on my behalf, requesting them to take all necessary measures to ensure that the highest possible level of awareness among professionals, parents and the wider public was maintained especially during the winter months.  The directors were also asked to circulate the Press Facts on Meningitis to the provincial media and to consider what additional public information initiatives were required and decide what specific measures need to be taken in their areas.  In addition health boards were requested to liaise with parental groups working to raise awareness of meningitis to facilitate a co-ordinated approach.  Health professionals have also given interviews both on national and local radio.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is a need for a national communicable disease surveillance unit to provide a comprehensive broad based approach to the prevention of disease.  The Department of Health is currently considering the organisational and structural issues involved in conjunction with the relevant agencies and professional interests.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I announced in the Dáil last December that, following the introduction of the HIV donor screening test by the Blood Transfusion Service Board in October 1985, no lookback was undertaken between 1985 and 1989 in respect of earlier donations made by donors who were now screening positive for HIV.  A lookback procedure was in place from 1989 onwards for newly-presenting donors.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the progress in tracing potentially HIV-infected blood issues is that there are still ten potentially HIV-infected issues which have not yet been traced by the BTSB and there can be no guarantee that all or indeed any of these issues will ever be traced.  There is also the possibility that some donors who were HIV positive prior to the introduction of HIV screening of donations in October 1985 did not donate after October 1985 and cannot, therefore, be identified.</P>
      <P>I decided, therefore, to introduce an optional HIV testing programme.  Details of the programme have been referred to the Chief State Solicitor, and thence to the Attorney-General's office for certain legal advices.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I would refer the Deputy to replies given on 26 September, 17 October and 11 February on this issue.  I have already outlined that the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service was published in November 1993.  The group, in its report, stated that the ambulance service is an emergency service similar to the Garda and fire service.  The report of the review group has been accepted by Government and forms the basis of Government policy in relation to the ambulance service.</P>
      <P>While the ambulance service acts as an emergency service in respect of its accident and emergency work, approximately half of all ambulance calls are not of an emergency nature but are related to the routine transport of patients.  In addition, classification as an emergency service does not suggest that ambulance personnel are being asked to carry out the same duties as either the fire service personnel or indeed the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the pay and conditions of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations, I have clarified the nature of the claim made by SIPTU on behalf of ambulance personnel in previous responses.  Briefly, this claim, lodged in 1993, sought parity of pay between the <Col N="144" /> provincial ambulance personnel and their counterparts in Dublin.  Final agreement, including concession of this claim for parity, was reached on a package of proposals in December 1996.  A ballot on this package was started at the end of last year.  For technical reasons on the Union side the ballot had to be rearranged for the coming weeks.  It is my hope that this offer will be accepted and that this group's parity with their Dublin counterparts will be restored.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The ingredient cost in 1995 in respect of anti-asthmatic medication on the General Medical Services, drugs cost subsidisation and long-term illness schemes is as follows: GMS &mdash; £13.79 million; DCSS &mdash; £3.6 million; and LTI &mdash; £0.1 million.</P>
      <P>This category of drugs, however may be used to treat a range of other respiratory conditions, as well as asthma.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses (general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc.) due to a long-term medical condition these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In the case of a particular child or family member incurring heavy expenditure due to their asthma condition, the chief executive officer of the health board may grant a medical card to cover that child or individual.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition, such as asthma, can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme, which caters for people who, do not have a medical card and are certified as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.</P>
      <P>Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication at the pharmacy counter.  The General Medical Services (Payments) Board will arrange for the payment of the balance of the cost to the community (retail) pharmacist, thus eliminating the question of a waiting period by patients for refunds.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive treatment service is available <Col N="145" /> for people with asthma.  With developments in drug therapy, the condition is now managed in the main within the primary care services, namely general practitioners with assistance and support provided by hospital consultants as necessary.</P>
    <P>A pilot project is currently under way involving general practitioners in a regular review of patients with asthma for the purposes of devising more effective treatment, including education in the regular use of preventative medications.  It is hoped that this project will lead to an improvement in treatment outcomes and avoid the necessity for hospital referrals.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit of the Department has developed, in association with other interested groups, a smoking policy in the workplace, which recommends that special consideration be given to vulnerable groups, including people with asthma, when developing smoking control guidelines in the workplace.  The effectiveness of this programme is currently being reviewed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive treatment and financial assistance is being provided to asthma patients through the existing range of services and support schemes available.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The cost of prescription drugs reimbursed under the General Medical Services scheme, the drug cost subsidisation scheme, the long-term illness scheme and the drugs refund scheme is: 1994, £194.22 million; 1995, £215.89 million; and 1996 £235.06 million.  These costs are inclusive of the ingredient cost, fees paid to pharmacists and value added tax.</P>
      <P>The legislative basis for all these schemes is section 59 of the Health Act, 1970 which provides for reimbursement, either in whole or in part, towards the cost of drugs, medicines or surgical appliances which are prescribed by a registered medical pracitioner.  Accordingly, the cost of medicines including those available over-the-counter (OTC), are reimbursable when prescribed by a doctor.  The question of the prescribing of OTC medicines is essentially a matter for the individual doctor who has the duty and obligation to provide the most appropriate management for each patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of drugs and medicines (ex manufacturer) in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through the mechanism of formal <Col N="147" /> multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association &mdash; IPHA (formerly the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries &mdash; FICI).  The current agreement is now due for re-negotiation and my Department hopes to commence discussions shortly with the industry in this regard.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I understand that the Deputy is inquiring about the age profile of general practitioners in the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme.</P>
      <P>Statistical information about the GMS scheme is gathered by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.  The latest figures which are available from the board show that there are 1,652 general practitioners contracted with the health boards under the GMS scheme and the breakdown of their ages is given in the table below.  I should point out that GPs who had signed contracts with the health boards, prior to March 1989 and who are still contracted under the scheme, must retire at 70 years of age. Doctors who entered contracts with the health boards since March 1989, must retire at 65 years of age.  In certain circumstances, for example while a post is in the process of being filled, a doctor who is over 70 years of age may do his/her own locum by agreement with the health board.</P>

    <P>I understand that the Deputy may have raised this question arising from comments made in the medical press about the alleged lack of adequate provision by the State which would allow early retirement by doctors participating in the GMS scheme.  It should be borne in mind that general practitioners provide services under the GMS scheme, which covers 36 per cent of the population, on a contractual basis and the question of making adequate provision for retirement is a matter for the individual doctor, as a private contract holder.  In this connection, the GMS capitation contract, which was introduced in 1989, provides for a contribution by the State to a <Col N="148" /> superannuation fund for contracting general practitioners which is administered by the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
    <P>These arrangements have been the subject of national agreements with the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The increase in the numbers of reported suicides and parasuicides in Ireland over the past two decades is an issue of growing national concern. Investigation and detailed research into the causes of suicide has not been easy at national and international level.  In the past there has been an understandable reluctance to even discuss the issue and this made the compilation of accurate data on the frequency and pattern of suicide more difficult.</P>
      <P>The Government's <i>Health Strategy &mdash; Shaping a Healthier Future</i>&mdash; expressed concern about the increase in the rate of suicide in Ireland.  If help is to be made available to those at risk, it is essential that reliable information should be available on the occurence of, and factors associated with, suicidal behaviour.  In order to address this issue, I established a National Task Force on Suicide in November 1995.  The ultimate aim of this task force is to formulate a national suicide prevention/reduction strategy.</P>
      <P>The interim report of the task force which I launched in September 1996 contains a detailed analysis of statistics relating to suicide, and attempted suicide in Ireland and includes a preliminary analysis of the factors which might possibly contribute to changes in the incidence of suicide. Since the publication of this report, the task force has been involved in a major consultative process which is required to formulate the national prevention/reduction strategy.  The task force is now in the process of preparing this strategy which will be published in the coming months.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Any danger to health from microwave emissions would depend on the levels being emitted. I am aware that there has been some public concern about whether adverse health effects might occur from the microwave emissions <Col N="149" /> associated with telecommunications systems and transmitting masts.</P>
      <P>The International Radiation Protection Association has specified the levels of exposure at or below which there is no substantive evidence that adverse health effects can occur.  Telecommunications companies in Ireland are licensed by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and must operate within the limits specified by the IRPA.  Measurements show that the exposure levels here are about 1,000 times lower than the IRPA safety levels.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The proposals from the Galway Branch of the Irish autistic association relate to the development of residential and day services at a property purchased by them and the re-commissioning of an existing facility in the Galway area.</P>
      <P>The question of the development of services for persons with autism in the western region is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board.  Issues relating to the planning and co-ordination of services to persons with a mental handicap or autism in the Western Health Board area are dealt with by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee.  The co-ordinating committee is representative of the health board, voluntary service providers and parents and families of persons with a mental handicap.  It would be a matter for this committee to consider proposals for new services to be funded from any additional funding which may come on stream in 1997, including the proposals in question.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, additional funding of £12 million has been provided in 1997 for services to persons with a mental handicap.  The sum of £2 million will be used to meet identified needs in existing services.  The remaining £10 million will be used to put in place new services.  In addition to those persons with autism who will benefit from the overall provision of new residential and day care places for persons with a mental handicap in 1997, specific funding is also being allocated from the £10 million for the development of services to persons with autism in line with the recommendations outlined in my Department's policy document on services to persons with autism.  The request for development funding for the Irish Autistic Association's proposals will be considered by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee in the Western Health Board in the light of the additional funds which will be made available to the board in the near future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): All Irish residents qualify for a comprehensive range of health services.  Persons in category 1 (medical card holders) are entitled to the full range of public health services free of charge.  No illness or disease is precluded under the medical card scheme and in this regard all medical card holders are entitled to the appropriate treatment.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>The entitlement of persons in category 2 (non-medical card holders) includes the full range of public hospital and public consultant services for the treatment of illnesses and diseases, subject only to modest statutory charges.  They are also entitled to avail of the community drug schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified by their <Col N="151" /> general practitioner as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines may avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calender quarter is refunded by the health board.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State to those in the community with long-term medical conditions.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The VHI has advised my Department that it has no information to support a claim that its members are charged up to five times more for routine consultations.  The level of fees charged by a consultant to a private patient is a matter between these two parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VHI operates a full cover scheme whereby consultants agree to accept enhanced benefits as full payment of their fees.  Approximately 94 per cent of consultants are currently participating in the full cover scheme.  Consultants who do not participate in the scheme are paid a standard rate <Col N="153" /> of benefit and VHI members may be subject to a balance bill.  Under its primary out-patient healthcare scheme VHI members receive benefit of up to £30 for a consultant specialist consultantion subject to an annual excess which is not covered.  VHI members are free to attend consultants of their choice.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the VHI board to decide appropriate arrangements for the payment of benefits in respect of members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, improving health services for the elderly was addressed by the Working Party on Services for the Elderly, culminating in the publication of The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly in 1988.  The principal recommendations of The Years Ahead were to maintain the elderly in dignity and independence at home with the support of the community care services where necessary, and when this was no longer possible, to ensure that they had access to the best possible medical and long-term care.  The Health Strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, builds on these recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Years Ahead stated that the development of departments of medicine of the elderly and the appointment of consultant geriatricians in general hospitals has been one of the most significant advances in the care of the elderly.  Such departments ensure prompt admission of elderly patients to hospital, specialist diagnosis and treatment, skilled nursing and rehabilitation and, in many cases, continuing support in a day hospital on discharge.  Geriatric departments tend to encourage close liaison between domiciliary, community and extended care facilities in the interest of a comprehensive response to the problems of vulnerable elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of publication of The Years Ahead, there were ten general hospitals with departments of medicine of the elderly attached under the direction of twelve physicians in geriatric medicine. The Years Ahead recommended that every general hospital should either have such a department or have access to one.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that today, 26 consultant geriatricians are employed working in specialist departments of medicine of the elderly attached to 22 general hospitals around the country.  Taking the population of people aged 65 years and over, this gives a ratio of one geriatrician to <Col N="154" /> approximately 15,000 elderly people.  It is not possible to give comparative figures for other EU countries as this information is not available to my Department.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I intend to continue the development of these units and funding has been allocated in 1997 for the development of a further three specialist departments of medicine of the elderly.  Priority will also be given to strengthening the role of the general practitioner, the public health nurse, the home help and other primary care professionals in supporting older people and their carers who live at home and to developing services for elderly people with psychiatric illness and dementia.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The issue of payment for part-time home helps has been raised on a number of occasions in the recent past.  As the Deputy will be aware, the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  In particular, in the Eastern Health Board area the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups which accounts for the wide variation within the area.  In all boards the rates are determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It is matter for each health board to decide on the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services. The chief executive officer of each board is in the best position to decide on these issues as my Department has no involvement in the day to day management of the service.  However, I would like to point out to the Deputy that my Department has allocated additional funding this year to three of the health boards this year, including the North-Eastern Health Board, for the purpose of increasing the rates of payment to home helps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to previous questions in this House I stated that the Department in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards has under active consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity <Col N="155" /> of arrangements which exist within the health boards for the provision of this service.</P>
    <P>A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officers group formed the basis for this examination of the home help services.  Following on from these discussions, the Department decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help services carried out by an independent body which will advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services. Following receipt of tenders for this review, the contract has been awarded and the work will commence shortly.  It is expected that the review will be completed before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): First, I would like to point out that the administration of the carer's allowance scheme is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, from the information available to me it appears that extending the carer's allowance scheme would not reduce the pressure on the acute hospital sector.  Such pressure can best be eased by the provision of sub-acute accommodation. Accordingly, this winter I have provided £2.75 million to ease the pressure on the acute hospital sector in the following way: an additional 30 beds in nursing homes; a new 25 bed community nursing unit in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital; 17 extra beds in Leopardstown Park Hospital; 25 <Col N="156" /> extra beds for the elderly in Peamount Hospital; 25 beds for the young chronically disabled in Peamount Hospital; 6 new community ward teams for the elderly; additional beds in acute hospitals; and a public education campaign on the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that arrangements are well under way to put these initiatives in place and indeed, some of the facilities are already in operation.  I would also like to point out that this is the largest package of measures put in place by any Minister for Health to deal with the relief of the winter problems of the acute hospitals and I am confident that it will provide much needed relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): When the waiting list initiative commenced in June 1993, there were a total of 40,130 people on waiting lists for hospital treatment.  By the end of June 1996 this figure had been reduced by 9,683 or 24 per cent over a period of three years. However, when I reviewed progress in reducing waiting lists for hospital treatment in the middle of last year, I was concerned that the overall waiting list for in-patient treatment had risen over the preceding 12 months and I recognised that swift action was required to tackle this increase. Additional funding was provided for this area to ensure that waiting lists did not continue to rise for the remainder of 1996.  Waiting list figures for the end of 1996 show that the total number of persons waiting for treatment at the end of 1996 has fallen to 25,959.  This represents a fall of over 17 per cent from a total of 31,519 at the end of last September.  This represents significant progress in the reduction of waiting lists and demonstrates the Government's concern to ensure that the necessary resources are provided to improve waiting times for treatment.</P>
      <P>I am happy to assure the House that special measures to reduce waiting lists will continue in 1997.  The provision of special funding to reduce waiting times continues to be a priority for the Government and £4 million has been provided in the budget to continue progress in this area.  This provision will bring to £8 million the total funding available in 1997 to address the problem of long waiting times for elective surgery.  The funding provided in 1997 brings to £58 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiative commenced in 1993.  My Department will be holding detailed discussions with health agencies in the coming weeks on the allocation of this funding.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>As is the case with semi-State bodies generally, day-to-day matters relating to the recruitment and employment of staff by the Food Safety Authority will be an executive function of that body and not a matter in which I, as Minister, have a direct function.  I can assure Deputies, however, that the legislation being drafted by my Department provides that the Authority will have a complement of staff &mdash; technical, professional and administrative &mdash; reflecting the range of disciplines relevant to the areas in which the Authority has competence.  The Authority will also have the capacity to engage consultants and-or contract out work, if appropriate.</P>
      <P>As regards its progress on recruitment, I understand that the interim board, which I appointed in November pending enactment of the legislation, has recruited two staff on a temporary contract basis; a part-time acting chief executive and a secretary.  The post of full time chief executive of the Authority has been advertised by the interim board in the news media and interviews for the position have taken place.  The Authority will undertake recruitment to other positions at a later date.</P>
      <P>As regards funding for the Authority, I indicated during my speech to the House during the budget debate that provision of £1.5 million is being made for the board to enable it to carry out its work programme for 1997.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Information from the major maternity hospitals in Dublin indicates that during 1996 there were 60 babies born to drug misusers in the Rotunda Hospital, 50 at the Coombe Hospital and 30 at the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street, a total of 140 babies.  Information in respect of earlier years is not readily available.</P>
      <P>While the Dublin maternity hospitals catered for approximately 38 per cent of total births in 1996 it would be expected that they would in fact cater for the vast majority of the babies born with a drug addiction, because of the concentration of heroin addiction in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The maternity hospitals in Dublin are aware of the need to make special arrangements for such babies and, in general, they manage to deal with the demands placed on them.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board, is conscious of the need for the collection of better information on this issue.  It has been in contact with the three main Dublin maternity hospitals and is working on the development, during 1997, of routine data collection from these sources as part of a broader database on drug misuse.  This will enable the health board to target its services more effectively at areas of greatest need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Following Government decisions of 20 February 1996, all health boards were asked to establish a contact service which would provide information, advice and assistance on drugs to the public.  In the larger boards, that is the Eastern and Southern Health Boards, a dedicated line is required for this service, while in the smaller boards the service is incorporated in a more general information line.  Appropriate arrangements with a responsible voluntary group is also an effective way of doing this.</P>
      <P>A national information line was operated in 1996 in conjunction with a multi-media drugs awareness campaign.  Feedback from this campaign would indicate that the take-up on the phone line was low and that the better option would be for each region to put in place easily accessible information lines, which could be contacted by people at a regional level.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board the necessary refurbishment and infrastructure has been put in place during 1996 in order to establish a regional helpline.  A co-ordinator has been recruited who is preparing a plan for the operational aspects of the service.  Training of staff who will be involved in answering calls is being provided by the board. It is hoped to have the line operational in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>A helpline has been operated in Cork by the Southern Health Board since 1995 and its operation is currently being evaluated.  The SouthEastern Health Board provides funding to a voluntary agency which provides an ongoing help-line service particularly to parents in the region. This arrangement works well and the service provided by the voluntary group complements the services provided by statutory agencies in the board.  Other health boards are developing better means of providing information and advice to the general public.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The health strategy document, Shaping a Healthier Future, sets out the approach to the development of acute hospital infrastructure over the coming years.  The key elements in this approach are: networking of local and general hospitals through the establishment of hospital <Col N="168" /> groups and clarifying of local service roles, a small number of highly specialised tertiary or super-regional units serving wider catchment areas and concentrating resources to best effect on a national level, developing and improving links with general practitioner services.</P>
      <P>This approach forms the basis for current capital planning and I would expect health boards to include demographic analysis in their assessment of service needs and capital development proposals.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Haemovigilance is an information system which can be defined as a set of surveillance procedures in relation to blood and blood products. These procedures cover the collection of blood and its components, the follow up of recipients, the collection and assessment of information on unexpected or undesirable results from the therapeutic use of labile blood products, and the prevention of such results.  Haemovigilance is thus a system of surveillance that is continuous and standardised including data collection analysis and the dissemination of results.</P>
      <P>In November 1995, the National Blood Authority in the UK set up a serious hazards of transfusion initiative.  In November 1996, the Blood Transfusion Service Board joined in this UK initiative.  The initiative is a voluntary and confidential reporting system which aims to further improve transfusion safety, by analysing reported information on transfusion hazards and translating the finding into transfusion service policy, clinical guidelines and training.  The joining of the UK initiative by the BTSB is a significant step towards the establishment of a national haemovigilance network.  Part of the role of the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is to administer a pharmacovigilance service in respect of medicinal products which, under European legislation, include blood products.  As part of its pharmacovigilance activities the board receives information on any suspected adverse reactions to blood products. Through its European activities, the board maintains awareness of any relevant information and developments which have implications for the use of blood products and for any other medicinal products in Ireland.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Throughout 1996 I hosted a consultative process on mandatory reporting.  The consultative process examined, not only the issue of mandatory reporting, but also other aspects of our child protection services.  The majority of those who participated in the process expressed reservations or opposition to mandatory reporting.  There was widespread agreement that further development of our child care services was required to ensure that children and professionals can report abuse in the knowledge that appropriate investigation, treatment and support services are available to victims.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware of the report which was drawn up by Dr. Harrington concerning accident and emergency services at Cork University Hospital. However, the Deputy will wish to know that the Southern Health Board has issued a statement which confirms that Dr. Harrington had not consulted with the hospital management in compiling this report.  I have been advised by the board that this report contains many inaccuracies.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for the provision of ambulance services is a matter for each individual health board in the first instance.  Health boards operate ambulance services, which provide both scheduled transport for non-ambulant patients and emergency pre-hospital care services. However, priority is always afforded by the ambulance service to emergency calls and on occasions this may result in some delay being encountered by patients awaiting routine transport to hospital.</P>
      <P>On the specific question of the need to develop ambulance services, the Deputy will wish to know that, over the past few years, there have been some positive developments in this regard, both at national and regional level.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the Report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service in 1993, the total extra resources committed to the ambulance service now amounts to £10.9 million. These funds have enabled health boards to make very significant progress towards the implementation of the review group's recommendations.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy may be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, assigns responsibility for the inspection of nursing homes to health boards.  Articles 23.1 to 25.3 of the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993, give health boards power to inspect nursing homes and premises believed to be nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Under the Act all nursing homes are obliged to register with a health board.  Before placing a nursing home on the register the health board must inspect the home to ensure that it conforms with the required standard of staffing, accommodation and design.  The regulations require the health boards to inspect all homes at least once every six months.  In the course of inspections, particular regard is paid to the general welfare and well-being of residents, staffing levels, accommodation and facilities, kitchen facilities, hygiene, sanitary facilities, nutrition, patient records, safety and the prescribing and administration of drugs and medicines.  Any identified shortcomings are brought to the attention of the proprietor and the person in charge and homes are duly monitored to ensure compliance with the regulations.</P>

    <P>I am advised by An tArd Chláraitheoir that a birth may be recorded in either English or Irish, provided that the details are accurate.

These are incorporated into the bilingual headings in the register of births and <Col N="175" /> include (fore) name given (to child) if any; name, surname and dwelling place of father; name, surname and maiden surname of mother.</P>
    <P>The purpose of registration is to record the particulars of a birth which occured on a particular date, and if any of the parties subsequently adopts a different name in later life it does not effect the particulars recorded at birth.  However, if it can be shown that a mistake was made in the registration of a birth, there are procedures set out in the Registration Acts and the regulations made under those Acts which allow for amendments to be made to entries in the register of births, subject to some confirmation being available that an error had occurred.</P>
    <P>A person gains his/her name by use and repute and entry of a name in English in the register of births will not prevent a person using the Irish form of their name nor will it prevent them from obtaining a passport showing the Irish format of their name.</P>
    <P>A new format of birth entries under the Registration of Births Act, 1996, comes into effect from October next which will provide for, <i>inter alia,</i> the registration of the surname of a child for births registered after the commencement date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware of the difficulties experienced by people with disabilities seeking employment in the private sector.  The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which was published last year makes a number of recommendations with regard to employment opportunities for people with disabilities, including opportunities in the private sector.  The Government decided, on publication of the report, to establish a monitoring committee comprising representatives of Government Departments, social partners, organisations representing people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers to monitor the implementation of the commission's recommendations, including the recommendations concerning employment which are the responsibility of my Department. This is subject to the submission to Government, in the first instance, of a programme of measures to be implemented, which will be drawn up by an Interdepartmental task force on which my Department will be represented.  This task force <Col N="176" /> is due to submit its detailed action plan by 30 June 1997.</P>
      <P>In addition to this report, Partnership 2000 details a number of private sector employment initiatives for people with disabilities.  These include additional funding for the NRB employment support scheme, a review of the Pilot Programme for the Employment of People with Disabilities (PEP), an increase in the provision of grant aid towards the workplace/equipment adaptation grant, a promotional campaign in respect of the positive to disability symbol and a promotional campaign aimed at people with disabilities to inform them of their rights and entitlements. Considerable progress has been made with regard to a number of these measures.  For example I have allocated an additional £100,000 to the employment support scheme in 1997.  This scheme which is administered by the NRB offers financial assistance to employers to encourage them to employ people with disabilities whose work productivity levels are less than average.</P>
      <P>My Department is also carrying out a review of training for people with disabilities with a view to preparing a policy framework.  Invitations for submissions have been invited from all interested parties including the private sector.  One of the purposes of the review is to ensure that training provided for people with disabilities meets the employment demands of employers in both the private and public sectors.</P>
      <P>Private employer interests are also represented on the National Advisory Committee on Training and Employment (NACTE) which was set up by the NRB to provide ongoing advice on training and employment issues.  In December 1995, the NRB, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC) through its Consultative Committee on Disability, and the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) initiated a survey of employer experience regarding the recruitment and employment of people with disabilities and the results of this survey are currently being considered.  Among the findings are the need for support services, in particular a people/skills register whereby employers could specify their job requirements and these could be matched to suitable people with disabilities on the register.  The NRB is currently working towards the establishment of such a register.</P>

Contacts with members of the various Northern parties in the framework of the multi-party talks and elsewhere do, of course, provide some opportunity for informal discussion of many issues relating to Northern Ireland, including our concerns at the situation in Harryville. I certainly welcome the leadership shown by a number of Unionist and loyalist political leaders, including the Ulster Unionist Mayor of Ballymena, James Currie, in defending the right of the parishioners in Harryville to worship freely and in seeking to defuse tensions there.  We are glad at any time to listen to the views of the Ulster Unionists parties on this and other issues.</P>

      <P>The Government has made clear at all times that we unreservedly condemn all acts of, and attempts at, paramilitary violence, from whatever source, including the bomb found at Strabane.  The murder at Bessbrook on 12 February of Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick is a further grim confirmation of the IRA's reckless willingness to escalate violence.  Its continuing resort to violence gravely damages trust and delays reconciliation still further; it is morally reprehensible, politically misguided and utterly counterproductive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our position in regard to the full participation of Sinn Féin in political negotiations has also been made clear on many occasions.  It is dependent on the credible and unequivocal restoration by the IRA of its ceasefire, and the subsequent formal acceptance by Sinn Féin of the Mitchell Principles.  As we have repeatedly said, the restoration of the ceasefire would be welcome from every point of view and is the only means by which the republican movement's stated objectives of a fully inclusive talks process leading to a <Col N="181" /> negotiated accommodation can possibly be achieved.  However, it us up to the IRA itself to take this step.  Naturally we would encourage all efforts to persuade it to do so.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has made clear, the official level channel of communication to Sinn Féin remains open.  It can be activated at very short notice once the Government receives reliable assurances from that party that an IRA ceasefire is actually within sight and that identified and attainable things need to be discussed and done to achieve that end.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we are continuing to work with the British Government and the parties participating in the multi-party negotiations, under the able guidance of the independent chairmen, towards the launch of substantive three-stranded negotiations.  While we continue to believe that inclusive negotiations against a background of peace would be the optimum circumstances for the search for a lasting political agreement on the island, we are determined that no individual party should have a veto on progress and will use the present negotiations to the fullest possible extent in pursuit of this goal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government remains extremely concerned regarding the humanitarian situation of the remaining refugees and internally displaced people in eastern Zaire.  I understand that the United Nations agencies along with the World Food Programme have been engaged in providing emergency relief supplies to the refugees since mid-December.  The international agencies engaged in the humanitarian effort have recently been assured by local authorities that access to refugee camps will not be restricted. This is a welcome development as humanitarian efforts had previously been hampered by security difficulties and problems in relation to flight clearances and access to refugees.  The World Food Programme, which is the lead international agency responsible for supplying emergency food stocks to the camps, has been airlifting emergency relief supplies into eastern Zaire on a twice-daily <Col N="182" /> basis since 6 February.  I understand that this has improved the health and nutritional status of the refugees in the camps.</P>
      <P>However, it is clear that the deteriorating security situation in eastern Zaire may have an adverse efect on the viability of the present relief effort.  While it is possible to conceive of circumstances in which military intervention could be feasible, it is not clear that this is the situation at this point.  What is required as this stage is the continuing active engagement by the international community with two principal aims; first, to contribute to the search for political progress as an alternative to the military pursuit of political objectives; and, second, to ensure adequate access for humanitarian assistance.  In this regard we strongly welcome the recent appointment of Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun as joint special representative of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity in the Great Lakes region.  Along with our European partners we look forward to supporting the work of Ambassador Sahnoun, including through the good offices of the EU Special Envoy, Mr. Aldo Ajello, in seeking to find a lasting solution to the problems of the region.  The Government will continue to monitor this situation closely.</P>
      <P>The Government and our EU partners continue to support the early holding of an international conference on peace, security and stability in the Great Lakes region under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity in order to address the root causes of the crisis in the region and to ensure respect for commitments, thus bringing about a peaceful and comprehensive resolution of the conflicts in the region.</P>
      <P>The return and reintegration of over 1.2 million refugees from Zaire and Tanzania to Rwanda in the last two months poses enormous challenges for the Government of Rwanda.  Among these challenges are the need of ensure that the basic requirements of the returnees for food, shelter and basic services are met; the need to bring the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide to justice and the need to ensure that the human rights, both of the returnees, and of genocide survivors, are respected.  If Rwanda is to experience sustainable reconciliation and economic development over the coming years, it is vital that the international community continue to engage with the Government of Rwanda as well as with NGOs and UN agencies.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware of the enormous problems which the judicial system in Rwanda faces, including the continued imprisonment of a large number of genocide suspects.  This issue has been raised on a number of occasions with the Government of Rwanda, who is well aware of our concern for the welfare and human rights of the prisoners.  The Irish Government has funded the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Rwandan prisons since 1995 and intends to continue this funding in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> It is important that the Government, as part of the international engagement, continues to assist the Government of Rwanda in developing its legal systems and expertise in order that a justice system, which has the confidence of all, is fully established.  In this context, the Government has given direct bilateral assistance to rehabilitate the judicial system in Rwanda, including grants to train magistrates, to facilitate the training of communal police and to establish a genocide secretariat for the formulation of legislation pertaining to crimes of genocide.  Support has also been given to the International Criminal Tribunal in Arusha to issue indictments and to bring to trial those responsible for genocide.  The Government welcomes the beginning of genocide trials both in Arusha and in Rwanda as an important step towards ending the culture of impunity and to promoting reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches great importance to the issue of human rights in Rwanda and commends the vital work of the United Nations human rights field operation in Rwanda.  Ireland has recently provided IR£250,000 to fund Human Rights Monitors for Rwanda.  I understand that, desite the appalling killings of five human rights workers in Cyangugu on 5 February, human rights monitors are continuing to carry out their work.  I also understand that the Government of Rwanda has expressed its willingness to assist human rights monitors in this work.  The United Nations human rights field operation in Rwanda, in common with the other international agencies and NGOs operating in Kigali, remains in close consultation with the Government with regard to security arrangements.</P>
    <P>Since 1994, the Government has provided almost £12 million in emergency humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance to the Great Lakes region.  This funding has been made available through a variety of channels.  This includes grants made to Irish and international NGOs, UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as direct bilateral assistance to the Government of Rwanda.</P>

      <P>The prospect of accession by Cyprus to the European Union provides both the opportunity <Col N="184" /> and incentive for both communities on the island to enter into serious political negotiations to achieve finally a comprehensive and lasting political solution.  In view of the natural interest of the European Union in encouraging both parties to seize fully this opportunity, the Presidency-in-Office, since January 1996, has appointed its own special representative on Cyprus to underline the interest and role of the European Union in efforts to make progress on a political solution.</P>
      <P>It has always been accepted by the various interested parties, including the European Union, that their efforts would require to be closely coordinated through regular contact and exchange of information.  These initiatives are intended to be complementary to, and supportive of, the efforts of the special representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Professor Han Sung Joo, in acknowledgment of the leading role to be played by the United Nations in the process of achieving an overall solution.  It is further recognised that any eventual solution should fall within the parameter of existing UN resolutions and decisions on the Cyprus question.</P>
      <P>During the past year, several states which are in a position to complement these efforts have designated special representatives to encourage progress towards an overall political settlement of the Cyprus question.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity, during a meeting in Dublin last July with Professor Han, to assure him that our Presidency efforts on behalf of the European Union, and those of the Commission, would seek to offer support and assistance to his role through close liaison with the UN, in particular, and also other special representatives.  During our Presidency, our special representative on Cyprus, Ambassador Heaslip, maintained regular and close contact with Proffessor Han and with the special representatives of interested states.  It is clear from these contacts that the activities of the parties concerned are contributing to a common effort by the international community to achieving progress towards direct talks between the two communities in Cyprus.  Whilst these efforts will continue and intensify in the months ahead, it must be recognised that they can only succeed if the leadership of both communities, who have the primary responsibility for securing a solution, make serious efforts to move at an early date to direct negotiations leading to a final and comprehensive settlement to this longstanding problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, as a member of the Troika, will continue to work actively in support of the efforts of the European Union to encourage both communities to come together in direct talks aimed at a comprehensive settlement.  The Dutch Presidency has reappointed Ambassador Heaslip to act as its special representative.  Ireland, and the other members of the Troika, together with the Commission, are making considerable efforts to convince both communities, and in particular the Turkish-Cypriot community that they have everything to gain and nothing to lose through the <Col N="185" /> accession of a unified Cyprus to the European Union.</P>

      <P>I would refer Deputy Burke to my reply to Question No. 22 from Deputy Briscoe on 6 February 1997 in which I expressed the grave concern of the Irish Government and our partners in the European Union at developments in Algeria.  Ireland condemns all acts of violence against the civilian population there.  More than 50,000 people have been killed since 1992.  I am particularly appalled at the recent spate of killings, some of them of the greatest cruelty.</P>
      <P>The European Union has repeatedly called for a cessation of all acts of violence in order to allow for peaceful dialogue and the development of the democratic process.  In that context, the Government is encouraged by reports that the Algerian authorities have recently held meetings with a number of political leaders to discuss preparations for the forthcoming parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>Together with its partners in the EU, Ireland has supported initiatives aimed at encouraging dialogue between those who reject terrorism and violence, while acknowledging that it is for the Algerian people themselves to resolve the current conflict on the basis of reconciliation and democratic principles.  We are ready to support any further initiative based on these principles.</P>
      <P>It is also important that Algeria does not become isolated, thus adding further problems, for example, of an economic nature, to the tragic situation there.  The European Union has recently opened negotiations with Algeria on a Euro-Mediterranean association agreement, as part of the EU's strategy of creating a shared zone of peace and economic prosperity in the Mediterranean, based on democratic principles and the rule of law.  This can help to stabilise the situation in Algeria.</P>

      <P>The remarks to which the Deputy's question <Col N="186" /> refers were made by Ambassador Hunter at a transatlantic policy conference last month which was held in the European Parliament in Brussels.  The remarks no doubt reflect the reality that the EU and NATO are both currently preparing to take in new members from Central and Eastern Europe, and that these processes, although autonomous, are complementary in some respects, principally in the objectives, shared by all, that no new dividing lines or lines of confrontation should be created in Europe, and that the common vision of a co-operative future for Europe be translated into reality by creating a common security space in which all states are equal partners.</P>
      <P>The OSCE, at summit level, has repeatedly affirmed that European security requires the widest co-operation and co-ordination among participating states and European and transatlantic organisations.  Former Yugoslavia is a particular example of this concept of mutually reinforcing co-operation in action, where the EU, the UN, the OSCE, NATO, Western European Union and the Council of Europe have all co-operated in the cause of peace.</P>

      <P>I have seen reports of remarks by the French Foreign and Defence Ministers along the lines referred to in the Deputy's question.  The remarks were made in the context of France's Presidency of the Western European Union for the first half of 1997.  The remarks reflect long standing French policy on the Western European Union.  They also reflect the policy of the Western European Union itself, as set out in Western European Union statements since the 1980s and in the Final Act of the Maastricht Conference in 1992, prior to Ireland's assumption of observer status in the Western European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is not a member of the Western European Union.  The decision that Ireland should become an observer in the Western European Union was taken in 1992.  The Government's policy towards the Western European Union is set out in the Government White Paper on Foreign Policy, which makes clear that the Government will not be seeking membership of the Western <Col N="187" /> European Union or NATO, or the assumpation of their mutual defence guarantees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government understands that a number of Rwandan refugees, along with Burundian refugees and internally displaced Zairois remain in eastern Zaire.  These refugees have been gathered in three main camps at Amisi, Shabunda and Tingi Tingi.  The World Food Programme, United Nations High Commission for Refugees and UNICEF have been providing relief supplies to these refugees since the middle of December 1996.  The Irish Government is supporting the international relief effort from the £2.25 million pounds which was allocated to the Great Lakes region at the beginning of November 1996.</P>
      <P>I understand that the international agencies engaged in the humanitarian effort have recently been assured by local authorities in eastern Zaire that access to the refugee camps will not be restricted.  This is a welcome development as humanitarian efforts had prevously been hampered by security difficulties and problems in relation to flight clearances and access to refugees. The World Food Programme, which is the lead international agency responsible for supplying emergency food supplies to the camps, has been airlifting emergency relief supplies into eastern Zaire on a twice-daily basis since 6 February and I understand that this has improved the health and nutritional status of the refugees in the camps.</P>
      <P>I am aware that both Commissioner Emma Boniro and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Ms Sadako Ogata, have visited the refugee camps at Tingi Tingi during the last month.  I understand that, following extensive discussions with Zairean authorities and international aid agencies, Ms Ogata has expressed herself satisfied that the UNHCR and other international agencies will be given all assistance possible to carry out their mandate.</P>
      <P>While welcoming and supporting the continuing humanitarian efforts of the United Nations and other international agencies in eastern Zaire, the Government recognises that the security situation throughout the region is precarious and remains concerned that future military activity in Zaire may affect the ability of the international community to provide humanitarian assistance to the refugees.  The Government will continue to monitor this situation closely as it develops over the coming days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and our EU partners continue to support the early holding of an international conference on peace, security and stability in the Great Lakes region under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity in order to address the root causes of the crisis in the region and to ensure respect for commitments, thus bringing about a peaceful and comprehensive resolution of the conflicts in the region.  In this regard we strongly welcome <Col N="189" /> the recent appointment of Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun as joint special representative of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity in the Great Lakes region. Along with our European partners we look forward to supporting the work of Ambassador Sahnoun, including through the good offices of the EU special envoy, Mr. Aldo Ajello, in seeking to find a lasting solution to the problems of the region.</P>

      <P>GDP has increased by well over 50 per cent in volume terms over the past ten years (1987 to 1996).  The reasons for this performance are complex but include a combination of the following factors:</P>
      <P>&mdash;prudent management of the economy under successive Governments which had lead to lower interest rates and increased investor and consumer confidence;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the consensus approach in successive agreements between the social partners which has resulted in moderate nominal pay increases, industrial peace and broad maintenance of competitiveness;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the strong growth in foreign direct investment which has raised capacity, particularly in exporting industries;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the contribution of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds which have added to domestic demand but which, more importantly, have improved the infrastructure and productive capacity of the economy; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the benefits of very substantial investment in education and training over many years which have raised the productive capacity of our labour force;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the rapid rate of natural increase in the labour force in recent years reflecting Ireland's young demographic structure &mdash; this effect would be enhanced by the increased education level of those joining the labour force.</P>
      <P>Forecasts for GDP growth out to 1999 were published with this year's budget, consistent with the move to a multi-annual budgeting approach. These show GDP growth of 6½ per cent in 1997, 5½ per cent in 1998 and 1999, giving a cumulative increase over the three years of 18½ per cent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>As provided for under the Securitisation (Proceeds of Certain Mortgages) Act, 1995, certain moneys due to local authorities were securitised with the first issue of bonds in 1995 and a further issue in 1996.  The funds raised by these issues paid the arrears owed to women under the EU Directive on equality of treatment in social security payments.</P>
      <P>The securitisation was managed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  Union Bank of Switzerland was contracted by the NTMA to act as adviser and underwriter to the securitisation.  UBS was paid a fee for its services.  No fees remain outstanding to UBS in relation to securitisation.</P>

      <P>Under section 5 (2) of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, the Ombudsman is limited to investigating actions &ldquo;taken in the performance of administrative functions&rdquo;. While the Deputy will be aware that the Government intends to introduce, as soon as practicable, legislation that would extend both the powers and remit of the Ombudsman, it is not the intention that any additional powers will allow investigation of non-administrative matters. Therefore, while extension of the remit to include voluntary hospitals is being considered, it is unlikely that any extension of the role and function of the Ombudsman in the medical area will include matters of clinical judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that any amount can be paid under a deed of covenant but there are restrictions on the amount that will qualify for tax relief.  The amount of a covenant which qualifies for tax relief is treated as a disposition of the income of the person making the payment, i.e. it is treated not as part of the covenantor's income but becomes the income of the recipient of the covenant.</P>
      <P>In relation to covenants made by taxpayers in favour of their elderly parents, the position for 1996-97 and subsequent years is as follows.</P>
      <P>Covenants to individuals aged 65 years or over qualify for tax relief to the extent that the amount covenanted does not exceed 5 per cent of the total income of the payer.  This restriction includes covenants by children in favour of their elderly parents.  However, there is no limit on tax relief for covenants to individuals (including elderly parents) who are permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one sense the tax relief accrues only to the payer of the covenant, i.e. the child.  The child's income for tax purposes is reduced by the amount of the covenant that is tax relieved.  The amount of the covenant tax relieved becomes income of the parent.  The child deducts tax at the standard rate from the payment and accounts to the Revenue Commissioners for this tax.  If the total <Col N="195" /> income of the parent is below his or her exemption limit or is less than his or her personal allowances, the parent is entitled to reclaim the tax deducted from his or her income.  It is in this sense that benefit accrues partly to the parent.</P>
    <P>Take for example a person whose total income in 1996-97 is £20,000.  He or she covenants 5 per cent of his or her income i.e. £10,000 to his or her parent.  The child's income for tax purposes is reduced by £1,000.  He or she deducts standard rate tax from the payment of £1,000 (£270) and accounts to revenue for the tax.  He or she pays £730 to the parent.</P>
    <P>If the child is liable to tax on his or her income at the top rate of 48 per cent the saving to him or her is £210 i.e. the different between the £480 tax which would have been paid if the covenant had not been made and the £270 tax deducted from the covenant payment.</P>
    <P>The £1,000 become income of the parent.  If the parent is not liable to tax in 1996-97, i.e. his or her total income is below his or her exemption limit or is less than his or her personal allowances, he or she is entitled to a refund of the £270 tax accounted for by the child.</P>
    <P>Thus, the maximum relief available is 48 per cent of the amount of the covenant and it is apportioned as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The information requested by the Deputy is not routinely collected.  The Deputy may appreciate that because of the nature of accident and emergency services, i.e. the unpredictability of what may present at any given time in a hospital accident and emergency department, the waiting time before treatment is provided is constantly liable to change.  In addition, many patients who present at accident and emergency departments do not require the services of para-medical staff, although para-medical services form part of the treatment provided to some patients before and following admission to a bed. In providing appropriate staffing levels for accident and emergency services, including those for medical/para-medical staff, hospitals take account of the needs of patients for efficient and effective <Col N="198" /> accident and emergency cover when the shifts are being drawn up.</P>
      <P>In Dublin the acute hospital service has encountered problems in the provision of accident and emergency services, particularly over the winter period in the past number of years.  The causes of the problems which arise have been well documented. Many elderly patients require acute hospital care initially but much of their recovery period could be spent in step down sub-acute accommodation.  For a number of years now there has been a shortage of sub-acute beds, particularly in Dublin.  This has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough, to cater for new patients seeking the services of the hospital.  This sometimes results in patients having to be places on trolleys in accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>In order to provide relief for the acute hospitals and enable them discharge patients no longer in need of acute hospital care but who require sub-acute care, my Department has agreed a plan of action with the Eastern Health Board for the winter of 1996-97.  The plan will cost £2.75 million annually and I have now provided the funding for this major initiative.  I have already provided the Deputy with details of the measures contained in the plan.  It involves tackling a number of areas including services for the elderly, services for the chronically disabled and the management of services provided by the acute hospitals themselves.</P>
      <P>The number of patients who present at accident and emergency departments for treatment has also increased.  For example the number of new attendances at the six major accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin increased by approximately 37 per cent between 1988 and 1996.  The policy in accident and emergency departments is to accord priority to those most in need.  In the normal course, this means that those with less serious complaints have to wait, while higher priority cases are being treated.  Experience in the provision of accident and emergency services has shown that a significant number of those who attend could be treated as effectively and far quicker by their family doctor.  This is why the current public education campaign on the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments was launched.  The thrust behind the campaign is to keep accident and emergency departments clear for real emergencies.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) System collects details of acute hospital admissions. The following table gives the numbers of patients discharged from acute public hospitals during 1995, where drug related psychosis, dependence, or abuse, was listed as one of the relevant diagnoses.  The drugs covered include cannabis, hallucinogens, barbiturates, heroin, methadone, cocaine, amphetamines and antidepressants. Over 80 per cent of these admissions were to hospitals in the Dublin region.  Reliable data are not available for earlier years.</P>

      <Col N="201" /> The rise in admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units for drug dependence from 145 in 1970 to 538 over the years 1970 to 1995 shows that there has been an increase in drug dependence since 1970.  However these figures do not measure the true extent of the drug misuse problem and particularly the misuse of illegal drugs.  The figures given above represent dependence on a number of drugs including prescribed medicines. This is evident from the age of some of the persons admitted.  Another report produced by the Health Research Board on treated drug misuse in the Dublin area over the years 1990-95 noted that in the Dublin area alone the number of cases in the total treatment group who were treated for problem drug misuse in the Greater Dublin area steadily increased over the five years under review.  Treatment for drug misusers is provided by a number of other agencies such as the therapeutic communities and information from these facilities is included in the health research &ldquo;Treated Drug Misuse&rdquo; reports.  In 1995 for example, the total number of persons who received treatment in the greater Dublin area was 3,399.  The total number in other health boards was 776.  These figures give a better estimate of the misuse of illegal drugs, but again they would only be a proportion of the total number of people who are misusing drugs, many of whom may never come into contact with treatment services.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the serious drug problem which exists and my Department, in conjunction with other Departments, is working on a multi-sectoral approach to the problem.  All health boards are working to address the problem at a regional level through education and treatment initiatives. The Eastern Health Board, where the problem is most acute, is implementing a service plan which aims to provide education and support, especially for young people in the areas of highest risk, and treatment for all drug misusers who require treatment in 1997.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Statistics in relation to the activities of psychiatric hospitals and units, both public and private, are compiled on behalf of my Department by the Health Research Board.</P>
      <P>Statistics furnished by the board in relation to admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units for the treatment of alcohol disorders in the years 1990 and 1995 are illustrated in the following tables 1 and 2 and are classified by both age and gender mix.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board's collation of statistics for the years 1970 and 1980 did not include a classification by <Col N="202" /> both age and gender mix.  Tables 3 and 4, following, illustrate the board's collation of statistics for those years.</P>
    <P>Alcohol abuse has, of course, very serious consequences and can lead to significant problems. With this in mind, I launched a national alcohol policy in September 1996.  It is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems in Irish society through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption.  The main aim of the policy is to influence public attitude and habits so that for those who choose to drink, moderate drinking becomes personally and socially acceptable and favoured in the Irish culture.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> A new agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970, was introduced in 1996.  The agreement comprises a package of measures as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  a new contract for the provision of all community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970.  The contract provides a major new emphasis on the professional role of the pharmacist.  It also sets out in the context of the patient-pharmacist relationship new standards in the quality of community pharmacy services expected;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the introduction of appropriate accountability arrangements in the operation of the community drugs schemes;</P>
      <P>(iii)  a new more effective, acceptable and appropriate arrangement for the dispensing of high-tech drugs through community pharmacies;</P>
      <P>(iv)  a system of regulating the granting of pharmacy contracts in accordance with the public health criteria which would have the effect of improving patient access to pharmacy services, improving standards and bringing this country into line with other EU-EEA member states;</P>
      <P>(v)  support for programmes to enable community pharmacists to maintain and update their professional skills by providing approved continuing education courses in the practice of pharmacy;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(vi)  funding to support community pharmacists undertaking the necessary upgrading of their equipment for the purposes of improving IT and telematic linkages with health boards and the GMS (Payments) Board including the <Col N="204" /> implementation of the improved accountability arrangements;</P>
    <P>(vii)  a series of measures designed to improve communications between health boards and community pharmacists.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new agreement will bring about significant improvements in the overall quality of, and accountability arrangements for, community pharmacy services thereby enhancing the role of community pharmacists and resulting in improved patient care.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the ongoing development of child care services, In this regard, an additional £5 million has been made available in the budget to further develop child care services in 1997.</P>
      <P>The funding will allow for: initiatives to strengthen arrangements for reporting of child abuse; improvements in the provision of residential care for vulnerable children; an increase in the foster care allowance for children under 12 years of age; and implementation by health boards of the final two parts of the Child Care Act including inspection of pre-school services.</P>
      <P>This brings to £40 million on an annualised basis the funding that has been provided since 1993 to develop child care and family support services and to strengthen the capacity of the health boards to meet the demands imposed by the implementation of the Child Care Act.  Over 900 permanent posts have been created in the child care area since 1993.</P>

    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Assessment <Col N="207" /> procedures are also a matter for the chief executive officers.</P>
    <P>I have had inquiries made of the Southern Health Board concerning this case and have been informed that the person's medical card was cancelled on 21 August 1996 as he had failed to satisfactorily answer a number of queries in relation to his means.  In September 1996 a new application for a medical card was received by the health board.  Following receipt of this application, the board requested specific information from the person concerned in order to determine his entitlement, or otherwise, to a medical card for himself and his dependants.  To date this information has not been received by the health board.</P>

The board already has significant residential, day and community based services in the Youghal area for persons with a mental handicap.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Improving equity of access to hospital services is a central element of the Government's approach to the development of the health services. Together with developments aimed at improving the range and level of medical and surgical services provided in each health board region, special measures to reduce waiting lists for treatment form an important element of the strategy to improve equity of access to hospital services.  Since the waiting list initiative commenced in 1993, it has focused upon those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times were causing the greatest hardship.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting lists for surgery in the target specialties over the last three years.  When the waiting list initiative commenced in June 1993, there were 40,130 people on waiting lists for hospital treatment. Waiting list figures for the end of 1996 show that the total number of persons waiting for treatment at the end of 1996 has fallen to 25,959. This represents significant progress in the reduction of waiting lists and demonstrates the Government's concern to ensure that the necessary resources are provided to improve waiting times for treatment.</P>
      <P>I am happy to assure the House that special measures to reduce waiting lists will continue in 1997.  The provision of special funding to reduce waiting times continues to be a priority for the Government and £4 million has been provided in the budget to continue progress in this area.  This provision will bring to £8 million the total funding available in 1997 to address the problem of long waiting times for elective surgery.  The funding provided in 1997 brings to £58 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiative commenced in 1993.  My Department will be holding detailed discussions with health agencies in the coming weeks on the allocation of this funding.</P>
      <P>In relation to delays at out-patient departments, the Deputy will wish to know that the charter of rights for hospital patients stipulates that patients, on referral by their GP to hospital for an out-patient appointment, have the right to be given an individual appointment time.  While the charter has no statutory basis, I am satisfied that its provisions are being implemented by most hospitals.</P>
      <P>The question of individual appointment times can be problematic for a number of reasons and delays can occur in out-patient departments where patients either fail to attend punctually or fail to notify hospitals when they are unable to attend.  My Department is reviewing the effectiveness of the charter and this issue will be considered in the context of this review.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The Midland Health Board is responsible for the management of services and deployment of staff at St. Loman's Psychiatric Hospital, Mullingar. Current personnel policy for the health services provides that health agencies which are managing resources within their allocations may fill non-consultant posts without recourse to the Department.</P>
      <P>In April 1995 the Midland Health Board established a panel for the filling of vacant nursing posts in the Longford-Westmeath mental health services.  Ten candidates were offered posts and eight of these took up duty, while the remaining two withdrew from the competition.  The life of the panel was extended by the chief executive officer for an additional year to 4 April 1997, and those whose names were on the panel were advised accordingly.  A further seven candidates have been processed and are ready for offers of permanent appointment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it has been agreed between nursing unions and management, in the context of the nursing dispute, that temporary employment in the service should be reduced to the minimum level consistent with operational requirements.  Under the revised offer arising from the recent Labour Court recommendation, 2,000 nursing posts are to be converted immediately from temporary to whole-time permanent status by means of a confined competition.  This factor is currently being taken into consideration in the filling of further permanent nursing posts.</P>

      <P>I understand, from recent inquiries to each of the health boards, that two boards, the Eastern and South Eastern, placed children taken into emergency care in hospital in the month of January last.</P>
      <P>Nine children were placed in hospital in the Eastern Health Board region.  The reasons for placement varied.  Seven of the children were under 12 years of age.  Four of the children, including the two children over 12 years of age, had complex medical histories requiring medical attention initially and four children from one family were placed in hospital by gardaí following the arrest of their mother.  One of the children remains in hospital awaiting a suitable foster care placement.  The child in question is less than 12 months old and required medical attention initially.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> I should point out that when small children are placed in the care of a health board it is sometimes appropriate to refer them to hospital for assessment and/or treatment.  When this assessment is completed, it is not always possible to find an immediate suitable placement for the children.</P>
    <P>I do not favour the use of hospital accommodation in inappropriate circumstances and the Eastern Health Board is taking all possible steps to provide suitable alternative accommodation in such cases.  In particular, the board plan to provide a residential unit for children under 12 years of age who need emergency placement out of hours.  The board is also recruiting additional foster parents exclusively for use by the out of hours service in an emergency at night and priority for these placements will be given to children under 12 years of age.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that asylum seekers arriving in Ireland can face up to a six-week wait for a medical card; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that many asylum seekers require urgent medical attention following ill-treatment in their countries of origin; the proposals, if any, he has to ensue the prompt issuing of medical cards to asylum seekers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility (category 1, i.e. medical card holders) or limited eligibility (category 2) for health services.  Health boards normally regard a person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland if he/she satisfies the health board that it is his/her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>I have not received any representations regarding a waiting period for a medical card by any asylum seekers.  I have made inquiries of the health boards in the matter and have been informed that asylum seekers are dealt with in the same manner as the general population in the processing of medical card applications; in an emergency, medical cards can be issued within a few days.  If asylum seekers require urgent medical attention, for whatever reason, they are also treated on the same basis as the general population.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of a call to establish a task force as raised by the Deputy.  However, the Irish Association of Care Workers launched a document on the development of after-care services at their annual conference in Limerick in February last year.  The document called for the development of a structured policy and procedural framework in relation to the provision of after-care services and advocated an inter-agency approach with health boards taking a lead role in promoting strategies for inter-agency co-operation. Section 45 of the Child Care Act, 1991 which was brought into operation on 31 October 1995 enables health boards to provide certain after-care services and supports to young people leaving care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A &ldquo;Guide to Good Practice in Children's Residential Centres&rdquo; was published by my Department in December 1996 in conjunction with the Child Care (Standards in Children's Residential Centres) Regulations, 1996.  This sets out guidelines on appropriate leaving care arrangements to be operated by the children's residential centres, in conjunction with the relevant health board, to assist children to make a smooth transition when <Col N="215" /> they leave residential care.  I have forwarded a copy of the guide to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives.  Firstly, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all registered nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act, and secondly to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.  At 31 December 1996 there were 359 registered nursing homes, while a total of 10,106 individuals had been approved for a nursing home subvention.  The total annual cost of the subvention scheme currently stands at just under £17 million.</P>
      <P>With regard to the current levels of subvention payable, the rates have not been increased since the Act was implemented in 1993.  However, it must be stressed that a nursing home subvention is not intended to meet the full cost of nursing home care for those who cannot do so from their own resources.  I am aware that there are certain difficulties being encountered by some providers and persons seeking nursing home care.  I will continue to endeavour to address these problems, and the issue of increasing the subvention rates, within the resources available to me.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The number of permanent and temporary staff employed in health agencies under the aegis of the Department of Health for which information is collected is included in the table following. The figures relate to 31 December 1995, the latest date for which information is available and verified.  The figures do not include other categories of staff (career break part-time, sessional and training).  Details in relation to staff on contract are not readily available in the Department as this is a matter for individual health agencies and varies from time to time.</P>
      <P>The recruitment restrictions in force for health agencies do not constitute an embargo on employment.  Each year development funding and posts are agreed with the Department of Finance and an overall ceiling on health service employment agreed.  Agencies are then notified of revised financial allocations and employment numbers and are required to maintain employment within those limits.  With regard to the Department of Health, the total number of staff, on a whole time equivalent basis, at 31 December 1996 was as follows: Permanent staff, 436.5; Contract staff, 3; Ministerial staff, 14; (Minister Noonan, 4; Minister of State O'Shea, 5, including 2 civilian drivers; Minister of State Currie, 5, including 2 civilian drivers).</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, the development of a day care centre for the elderly in Bishopstown is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board.  I have received a copy of the Southern Health Board's plan for the development of day hospitals and day care centres, and this is currently being examined by my Department. I understand that the board have identified a need for a day care centre in Bishopstown and that this is included in the board's plan.  Funding for the proposals contained within the board's plan, including the proposal for Bishopstown, will be considered in the light of the board's internal priorities and overall capital funding available to my Department.</P>

Three of the permanent staff are employed on a part-time basis and two are employed on a job-sharing basis.  The Legal Aid Board, which is a body under the aegis of my Department, has 166 permanent staff.  In addition, it has three staff employed on fixedterm contracts and 57 temporary staff members. Six of the temporary staff are employed on a job-sharing basis.  The number of permanent staff serving with the Employment Equality Agency, a body under the aegis of my Department, is 14. Four of these staff members are employed on a job-sharing basis.  These figures reflect the numbers of persons employed and do not constitute the number of posts involved.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no direct correlation between the number of applications for legal aid for judicial separation proceedings, or any other proceedings, received by the Legal Aid Board in any year and the number of certificates granted by the board in respect of such proceedings in that year.  At the end of each year the board has on hand a number of applications which have yet to be determined.  For example, 299 applications for legal aid were awaiting determination on 31 December 1994, while 332 of the applications received in 1995 were awaiting determination on 31 December 1995.  These applications were in respect of a range of proceedings, which included judicial separation proceedings.  While the majority of the 1,234 certificates granted in respect of judicial separation proceedings in 1995 would have been in relation to applications received in 1995, a number of the certificates granted in 1995 would have related to applications on hand at the end of 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, as applicants for legal aid in 1995 in connection with judicial separation proceedings were required to satisfy the financial and merits criteria set out in the scheme of civil legal aid and advice, a certain number of such applicants would have been refused legal aid on the <Col N="220" /> grounds that they did not meet the eligibility criteria. Information is not available on the numbers who sought representation for judicial separation proceedings in 1995 and were refused legal services by the Legal Aid Board in that year on grounds of financial ineligibility.  It would not be possible for the Legal Aid Board to provide information on the numbers who were not granted legal aid in 1995 because they were in receipt of disposable income greater than the financial eligibility limits set out in the scheme without the allocation of a disproportionate amount of its available resources to the task.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the areas referred to by the Deputy are the Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).  The EU Habitats Directive requires member states to identify areas of community importance for nature conservation, and to protect them through their designation as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).  Compensation will be payable for the changes in farming practices which are compulsory as a result of the designation as SACs of private land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under European law, grants for afforestation administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are payable only where the proposed planting will not damage the environment. If sanction to a grant is refused because the proposed planting would damage the environment, <Col N="222" /> this is a failure to meet the conditions for grant aid.  This condition applies whether or not the area is in an SAC.  The calculation of losses arising from the inclusion of land in an SAC could not therefore take account of these grants.  Full compensation will be payable for other losses.  However, I am advised that in most cases planting of trees in these areas is not economic without grant aid.</P>

      <P>Natural heritage areas (NHAs) are still only at the proposal stage and no designations will take place until an amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976, is passed by the Oireachtas.  I expect to be in a position to publish this Bill in the near future.  Before any formal designations are made, those affected by designation proposals will have an opportunity to object or to suggest modifications to the areas proposed for designation. <Col N="223" /> I will consider any recommendations received from local authorities on these matters.</P>
      <P>The EU Habitats Directive requires member states to identify areas of community importance for nature conservation, and to protect them through their designation as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).  I am about to make regulations to transpose the Habitats Directive into Irish law, and the process leading to SAC designation will commence very soon thereafter. Those affected by designation proposals will have three months from when proposals are published to object to the proposal.  The directive provides that only scientific objections can be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>Compensation will be payable for the changes in farming practices which will be compulsory as a result of the designation as SACs of private land. Changes will not be compulsory in NHAs to the question of compensation will not arise.  Under the European law, grants for afforestation administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are payable only where the proposed planting will not damage the environment. The calculation of losses arising from the inclusion of land in an SAC could not therefore take account of these grants.  Full compensation will be payable for other losses.  However, I am advised that in most cases planting of trees in these areas is not economic without grant aid.</P>

Local authorities will still be empowered to levy charges under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 for fire call outs, etc.  All revenue foregone by local authorities on domestic water and sewerage charges will be made good in full under the new funding system and accordingly, there will be no detrimental impact on the fire service, or other services.  On the contrary, the increased buoyancy in the new system should enable local authorities to improve the quality of their services generally, including the fire service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 and 203 together.</P>
      <P>No official from my Department has visited the school referred to by the Deputy.  I have no plans to send personnel from Ireland to be trained at the school in question.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have statistics available on the number of children diagnosed as being autistic.  Diagnostic services are the responsibility of the relevant health authorities.  It should also be noted that the severity of the autism involved in each individual case will have a major bearing on the nature of the educational supports required.  In some cases, children with some features of autism are capable of being educated in ordinary schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial, resource or visiting teachers.  Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools dedicated to children with emotional disturbance.</P>
      <P>In the 1995-6 school year, I established a pilot programme of special education services for children with autism.  Under this programme, a number of special classes dedicated specifically to the educational needs of children with autism are now in operation.  These classes are attached to special schools located in Beechpark, Stillorgan, County Dublin, and Cratloe national school, Ennis, County Clare.  A further special class catering for children with autism was established at St. Brigid's special school, Dundalk, County Louth, in the 1996-7 school year.  Each of these classes caters for a maximum of seven children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of demands for the wider provision of dedicated facilities to meet the educational <Col N="236" /> needs of autistic children.  However, I am anxious that any such development should be soundly based and have regard to the wide spectrum of educational needs which can accompany the autistic condition.</P>
    <P>The experience gained through the pilot programme will provide a basis for the future development of education services for the children in question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year. I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>In so far as records which can readily be consulted in my Department, the District Court office and Donegal County Council indicate Moville court was established at least since September 1935.  The <Col N="250" /> available records, show that the court in Moville sat in St. Eugene's Hall since the early 1950's.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the need to rearrange certain District Court areas arose following queries raised in court in Milford, County Donegal by a solicitor concerning planning requirements for the use of rented accommodation for sittings of the District Court and the decision of the District Court Judge that court sittings could not be held in such places, without specific planning approval.</P>
      <P>Before arriving at his decision the judge had heard the views of a solicitor representing Donegal County Council who argued that such permission was not necessary.  Following consultation with the Attorney General, other District Court areas including Moville where court sittings have up to now been held in non-court accommodation were rearranged so that hearings would be held in dedicated court facilities.</P>
      <P>I understand that Donegal County Council, as the local authority, which has statutory duty to provide court premises has referred the question raised in relation to the need for planning consultation in these cases to An Bord Pleanála under section 5 of the local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 for determination.  I am awaiting the ruling by An Bord Pleanála in the matter before taking further action.</P>

      <P>Section 179 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 as substituted by paragraph 3 of the 6th Schedule to the Act, provides for the payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The legislation also enables the Minister to make regulations prescribing the circumstances and conditions under which such a supplement may be paid, the class or classes of persons to whom a supplement may be paid and the amount of supplement that may be paid, and this has been done in S.I. 382 (Social Welfare (Consolidated Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Regulations) of 1995.</P>
      <P>Article 9 (2) (g) (iii) of the regulations requires the health board to be satisfied, in deciding entitlement to a rent supplement, that the rent payable by the applicant &ldquo;...is just and proper having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In order to comply with this legislative provision, each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of the various classes of persons, as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable.</P>
      <P>In addition, Article 12 (1) of the regulations specifies that the amount of weekly rent supplement paid will be calculated so as to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources. However, the legislation requires that the health board must be satisfied that the amount of rent supplement payable must not exceed such amount as the health board considers reasonable to meet the applicant's residential needs.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the legislative requirements of both these articles, all health boards set maximum rent limits in respect of the various classes of persons &mdash; e.g. single persons, couples, lone parents with one child, etc.  Such limits are set by the health board using local knowledge of reasonable rents for private rented accommodation within and across the health board area.</P>
      <P>Accommodation costs are based on information on average rents charged in the area received from local auctioneers and letting agents.  The maximum rent levels on which rent supplements are based are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of fluctuations in accommodation costs.</P>
      <P>An applicant who chooses to live in accommodation costing above the set limit will generally be expected to pay the additional costs themselves. However, in very exceptional circumstances, for example where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances, the board will consider basing the supplement on the higher rent level having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  In addition applicants must live alone or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right.</P>
      <P>No new conditions relating to the fuel scheme have been put in place in the past year other than an increase in the income limits from £10-£15 per week in the case of non-means tested payments which applied from 14 October 1996.  A review of the scheme was recently carried out on behalf of the Department by independent consultants to ensure that the scheme is operating effectively and equitably.  A draft of the consultant's report has been received and the final report is expected in the near future.</P>

      <P>The SWA scheme is administered by the eight regional health boards on behalf of my Department and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.

      <P>I am aware of employment difficulties being experienced by some companies in the Drogheda area.  These have arisen because of necessary technological applications and consolidation. The objective of the industrial development agencies under my Department is to secure the long-term future of the plants in question and to ensure maximum job maintenance in the course of necessary adaptation in these firms.</P>
      <P>A very positive development has been that during 1996, DSC Communications announced its intention to establish a facility in Drogheda.  The company is currently recruiting staff in a start-up phase and it is expected that 475 jobs will be created at full capacity.  This will significantly assist the growth of employment in the north-east region including Drogheda.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is actively responding to the challenge of attracting new inward investment to the north-east region including Drogheda through the acquisition of land for industrial development. A range of options is being considered in conjunction with Louth County Council to provide a large landbank in the Drogheda area.  To date various sites have been identified but issues relating to the price and availability of these sites have yet to be resolved.  This issue will be progressed over the coming months.  Necessary funding to acquire this landbank is allocated within the IDA Ireland property budget subject to a satisfactory site being available.</P>
      <P>In the past two weeks, the Government has decided on the expansion of the local employment service to Drogheda and three other areas. The LES, when operational in Drogheda, should help to address the employment needs of the long-term unemployed and other unemployed groups in the area.  Combined with other actions, this ensures that there is a comprehensive service in the area to maximise employment opportunities.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring either to the part-time job option under community employment or to the whole time job programme, Job Initiative.</P>
      <P>Both of these programmes are targeted at the older long time unemployed person who is particularly disadvantaged and is considered to have little prospect of obtaining a mainstream job.  As such the programmes are confined to those over 35 years of age.</P>
      <P>Approximately 25 per cent of community employment places are retained for the part-time job option while the job initiative is a pilot programme comprising full-time work for 1,000 persons and is confined to specific pockets of high unemployment in the cities of Cork, Limerick and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the eligibility criteria for community employment only came into effect last year follows a detailed review of the programme and in response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployed and taking into account that the Job Initiative is a pilot programme, I have no plans to review the eligibility criteria for either of these programmes at present. However, I do of course keep all programmes <Col N="257" /> under constant review in so far as their objective-effectiveness is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standards-based apprenticeship system, which is administered by FÁS, was introduced in September 1993 and includes 25 trades at present.  The duration of an apprenticeship is now four years, approximately, and there are seven phases in all &mdash; four on-the-job with the employer and three off-the-job in a FÁS training centre or an educational establishment.</P>
      <P>In the first full year in which the new standard-based apprenticeship applied to all the major designated trades i.e. September 1995 to August 1996 the total number of new apprentices registered with FÁS was 3,587.  This figure was marginally in excess of the figure of 3,500 set as an annual apprenticeship intake target for FÁS in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following tables show the numbers of new <Col N="259" /> apprentices registered with FÁS in 1996, and in 1997 &mdash; up to 14 February &mdash; by trade, age and qualifications.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the recruitment of apprentices rests with employers in the relevant industry sector and is therefore demand-led.  FÁS does not set targets in respect of individual trades as such. However FÁS continues, in consultation with the industry sectors, to monitor areas of emerging demand and to promote the employment of apprentices both overall and particularly in areas of emerging shortages.</P>
    <P>In that regard, there is a small number of trades where the intake figures continue to be a matter for concern.  These are mainly in the so-called &ldquo;wet trades&rdquo; in the construction industry i.e. painter, bricklayer and plasterer.  In a report on apprenticeship produced by the Construction Industry Federation in April 1995 difficulties were predicted as a result of the lower than normal ratios of apprentices to craftsperson in these trades over a number of prior years, even if there <Col N="260" /> was to be no overall growth in demand for craftspersons in these areas.  The report further states that any shortage of skilled workers during the period 1995 to 1999 would mainly arise because of the low recruitment of apprentices in the years prior to the introduction of the standards-based apprenticeship system.</P>
    <P>In an effort to deal with the current short-term skills shortage affecting a number of trades, and in addition to its ongoing promotional work, FÁS is working in collaboration with the CIF in a campaign to attract and bring back skilled craftspersons from Europe.  This campaign has a particular focus on London, Holland and Germany.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the SIMI, FÁS continues to encourage employers in the motor trade to recruit and train apprentices.  The FÁS motor industry working party, in conjunction with the engineering industry training committee, is in the process of developing methods aimed at increasing the recruitment of motor apprentices in preparation for the increased demand for craftspersons which is likely to arise from the introduction of compulsory private car testing.</P>

      <P>The Leader groups in counties Sligo and Leitrim have reported that 44 new full-time and 49 new part-time and seasonal jobs have been created to date under the Leader programme. These figures are in addition to jobs which were retained in the area as a result of Leader support.</P>
      <P>The Leader programme promotes the bottom up involvement of local communities in the development of their areas.  The emphasis under the programme is on a broad developmental process at community level of which job creation forms a part.  Given that the Leader II programme has been operating in these areas for just over a year and has almost three years to run, I am satisfied with the number of new jobs created to date.</P>

      <P>Pigmeat prices throughout Europe have been falling gradually over the past six months.</P>
      <P>The pattern in Ireland has been the same but it should be recognised that prices over the past two years have been at quite high levels.  The main cause of the decline in prices is that pig numbers have increased resulting in increased supplies on the market.  Consumption has not kept pace with the increased supplies thereby causing pressure on prices.  Export outlets are limited with EU markets being well supplied in the light of the increased production.</P>
      <P>The latest figures available to me in relation to imports of pigmeat from the Netherlands show a total of 3,774 tonnes for the period January-August 1996.  I have no information on what proportion of those imports were sides or the identity of the importers or to whom the meat was distributed. In 1995 a total of 3,701 tonnes of pigmeat was imported from the Netherlands.  While there has been an increase in the level of imports from the Netherlands, this has not been the major factor influencing the trend in market prices.</P>

Following a recent review of the future of the scheme by the European Commission, the conclusion was reached that it should be extended for a further two years, but that the monthly entitlement should be halved to reflect the general decline in butter consumption in Ireland.

      <P>Under the revised disease eradication arrangements which were introduced on 1 April, 1996 herdowners generally pay their veterinary practitioners in respect of first herd tests each year.  In the first full year of operation, this should result in a reduction of about £14 million <Col N="266" /> in expenditure by the Department on testing costs.  In recognition of this, the amount collected under the diseases levy arrangements will reduce by about £18 million per annum.

      <P>The position is that to date some 95 per cent of 1996 cattle headage applicants have been paid in full.  There are outstanding problems in a relatively small number of applications including some applications where the land is split between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged and between more severely disadvantaged and less severely disadvantaged.  In most of these cases the difficulty is that my Department either has not received maps from the farmers in question or has received incomplete or illegible maps. These outstanding problems are being addressed urgently with a view to making payment in all eligible cases at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>By virtue of EU legislation, the export of mammalian meat and bonemeal from the United Kingdom has been prohibited since March 1996.  Prior to that date, national controls were in place on the import of mammalian meat and bonemeal from Great Britain since 1966 and from Northern Ireland since 1989 by virtue of the Importation of Carcases and Animal Products (Prohibition) Orders, 1966 and 1989.  These orders required any person importing mammalian meat and bonemeal to do so only in accordance with an import licence.  No such licences were issued by my Department for mammalian meat and bonemeal during the periods in question.  As there were no controls on mammalian meat and <Col N="269" /> bonemeal imports from Northern Ireland prior to 1989, my Department has no records as to the imports, if any, which took place from there prior to that date.</P>

      <P>Four orders have been signed by me within the last 12 months in relation to the incorporation of meat and bonemeal in animal feeds. The dates on which they were signed and the main implications for the animal feed industry are as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (No. 2) Order, 1996</P>
      <P>Date of signature: 20 September 1996</P>
      <P>This order prohibits the following activities except in accordance with a licence issued by my Department&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the manufacture of meat and bonemeal;</P>
      <P>(b) the purchase of meat and bonemeal;</P>
      <P>(c) the holding of meat and bonemeal or any feed in which meat and bonemeal has been incorporated on any land or premises used for or in connection with the manufacture of animal feeds or on which ruminant animals are held, kept or handled; or</P>
      <P>(d) the incorporation of meat and bonemeal into any animal feed intended for feeding to non-ruminant animals or poultry.</P>
      <P>(2)  Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (No. 3) Order, 1996</P>
      <P>Date of signature: 20 December 1996.</P>
      <P>This order requires, subject to certain exceptions, animals feeds intended for feeding to non-ruminant animals or poultry which contain meat and bonemeal to be appropriately labelled or packaged.</P>
      <P>(3)  Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (Amendment) Order, 1997</P>
      <P>Date of signature: 12 February 1997</P>
      <P>By virtue of this order, any person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) incorporates poultry offal into any animal feed, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) holds poultry offal or any animal feed in which poultry offal has been incorporated on any land or premises used for or in connection with the manufacture of animal feed, <Col N="271" /> must do so only under licence.  While poultry offal does not pose a risk as far as bovine spongiform encephalopathy is concerned, control problems are caused by the use of such offal as the test used by my Department to determine the presence of meat and bonemeal in animal feed cannot distinguish between poultry bone and animal bone.</P>
    <P>(4)  Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (Specified Risk Material) Order, 1997</P>
    <P>Date of Signature: 12 February 1997</P>
    <P>This order requires, <i>inter alia</i>, specified risk material from the carcases of bovine, caprine and ovine animals to be removed from the animal feed chain from 21 February 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> In each case, the order was adopted as part of my Department's strategy to control and eradicate bovine spongiform encephalopathy.</P>

      <P>The official position of my Department and that of the Government in the matter is that these systems are operating illegally.  However, the House will be aware that following the judgment in the High Court case taken by South Coast Community Television I must reconsider an application from that organisation for a licence to operate.  To that end I commissioned a technical analysis by consultants, nominated by the European Broadcasting Union, who have, in the last few days submitted their report.  That report is now being examined by my officials and a decision on the application will be made as soon as possible.  In reaching that decision account will be taken of the implications which may arise for the operation of deflector systems generally in the country.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Government's approval in 1988 for the setting up of ESB subsidiary companies, the consent of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the Minister for Finance is required when ESB wishes to dispose of the properties and liabilities of any subsidiary company.</P>
      <P>In January 1995 a proposal by the ESB to dispose of its four off-shore fish farms and smolt rearing facility received Ministerial approval.  The purchases involved were as follows:</P>
      <P>To: Gaelic Seafoods, Deenish, Kealincha, Roancarrig, Lough Allen.</P>
      <P>To: Gallagher Brothers Inver</P>
      <P>The sale of the business realised £4.5 million. This price reflected the value of the stock in hand when the farms were sold.</P>
      <P>The Ministerial approval followed an open, transparent, tendering procedure conducted by the ESB.  The board's fish farming business had become loss-making and the Minister was satisfied that the board's proposal to dispose of the business was the proper commercial decision in the circumstances.</P>

One of the main features of the reorganisation and restructuring of the Defence Forces is to increase the number of operational troops available at any given time.  It is not envisaged that the reorganisation will have any implications for the development of military barracks in the region.</P>

      <P>A biological survey of the River Maigue in County Limerick has been approved as a project for funding under the tourism angling measure of the operational programme for tourism.  Prior to undertaking the survey, which will cost in excess of £68,000, title to the fishery has to be established. This is required in order to protect investment under the tourism angling measure so that access for tourist anglers to the fishery is guaranteed after the biological survey and any necessary development works.</P>
      <P>Title research has been completed on 177 miles of the Maigue catchment and this has shown that riparian owners have title to 120 miles and that only 14 miles of the catchment is in State ownership.</P>
      <P>The manager of the Shannon regional fisheries board is currently in discussion with the riparian owners with a view to achieving agreement on access for tourist anglers.  Pending resolution of this issue funding of the survey project is on hold. However, with goodwill from the riparian owners in the Maigue catchment, it should be possible to proceed with the project at an early date.</P>
