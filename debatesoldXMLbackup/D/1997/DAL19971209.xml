      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of times he has had official meetings with the President since her inauguration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have complied with the terms of Article 28.5.2 of the Constitution in keeping the President generally informed on matters of domestic and international policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to indicate the number of times he has complied with that constitutional requirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is a long-established precedent that Taoisigh comply with that constitutional requirement.  That being said, I have been talking to the President on the telephone both formally and informally a number of times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the greater transparency and openness that characterises this Administration, does the Taoiseach agree there is now an expectation that the occasions on which he would meet the President formally, as distinct from informal conversations with her at official functions or by telephone, is a matter of legitimate, political, if not constitutional, concern?  Notwithstanding any past conventions, does he also agree that my question is a reasonable one and I am not unreasonable to expect an answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is not unreasonable since it is not that difficult to reply.  Apparently over the years official formal meetings have not taken place.  The Constitution does not refer to visits, formal or otherwise but at Article 28.5.2 simply says:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach shall keep the President generally informed on matters of domestic and international policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> However, official meetings may well have taken place over the years when former Taoisigh and Presidents met in the course of their respective duties or at other times.  In recent years that practice has been substituted by greater telephone communication on day to day issues.  I intend to continue the practice of formal monthly or bi-monthly meetings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While not wanting to embroil the office of the Presidency in any form of controversy, having regard to the fact that in the past telephone conversations from Government to Áras an Úachtaráin have been less than solicitous, also bearing in mind that this President has indicated clearly that she intends, as is her right, to pursue a policy of building bridges &mdash; bridges which directly affect Government policy in respect of Northern Ireland &mdash; can the Taoiseach indicate whether there is any formal means by which regular formal meetings can take place between the Taoiseach and President so that process of bridge-building at least can be harmonised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of the overall philosophy of any particular President.  The Constitution states that the Taoiseach should keep the President informed on domestic and international policy, and I will continue to do that.  I do not think it is necessary for me to report to the House every time I have a telephone conversation with the President or have a formal or informal meeting with her.  In so far as formal meetings are concerned, I intend to follow the practice that the Taoiseach meets the President on a formal basis a number of times per year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to publish the assessment of the new material relating to the events of Bloody Sunday in the early months of 1998.  It is important that the truth is told about those events and I believe the best way to achieve that is through an independent inquiry.</P>
      <P>I visited Belfast yesterday.  During my visit, I met Mr. Alban Maginness, Lord Mayor of Belfast, at City Hall.  While there, I met the chairman and members of the Belfast Partnership board, drawn from the various political parties, the social partners and the voluntary and community sector; visited the location of the proposed Springvale campus where I met Professor Trevor Smyth, Vice Chancellor of the University of Ulster, Dr. Paddy Murphy of the Belfast Institute of Higher Education and Dr. Wallace Ewart, the director of the project, together with local elected and community representatives, including Mr. Gerry Adams, MP, Dr. Joe Hend-ron, Ms Una Gillespie and Mr. George Beavis; and visited the nearby Synergy Training Centre. I also visited Cultúrlann Ó Fiaich-Mac Ádhaimh, the Irish language cultural centre on the Falls Road and, within it, Meánscoil Feirste.  While there, I had a meeting with Mr. Gerry Adams, MP, and representatives of a number of organisations including the United Campaign against Plastic Bullets, Cearta, Saoirse, the Anti-Extradition Campaign, Relatives for Justice and Gaeloiliúint. I also met relatives of Robert Hamill who died in May 1997 after being attacked by loyalists in Portadown.  I visited the Andersonstown Leisure Centre where I met a wide cross-section of the community in West Belfast of all traditions and religions.  At Belfast City Airport, I met Mr. Eamon McMahon, Secretary of the County Antrim Board of the GAA; I discussed and sympathised with him on the recent murder of Mr. Gerry Devlin from St. Enda's GAA Club, Glengormley, a cowardly and brutal slaying I had previously condemned utterly.</P>
      <P>The focus of my visit was the talks.  I met Dr.</P>
      <P>Mo Mowlam, Secretary of State.  I met Mr. Paul Murphy, Minister for Political Development, Mr. Harri Holkeri and General John de Chastelain at Castle Buildings.  I had bilateral meetings with the party leaders and delegations representing the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, Labour, the UDP and the PUP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a useful and positive round of discussions which I hope will assist in moving the process forward. I have not arranged further meetings at this point with the party leaders and delegations other than a meeting with the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition. <Col N="457" /> The recent decision of the talks participants to form a restricted sub-group of the plenary, charged with preparing by 15 December an agreed statement of the key issues to be resolved and the formats and processes for consideration of those issues, is I believe a sensible move.  My own experience of negotiations &mdash; stretching over many years &mdash; has taught me that small, clearly focused groups are more conducive to producing proposals and agreements.  Senator Mitchell, in introducing this proposal, and the participants by accepting it, would appear to have come to the same conclusion.  I share the Chairman's hope for a productive period before the Christmas break. While it will be necessary to make progress across all strands, I do not believe it would be appropriate now to expand further on the negotiations.  I would, however, refer Deputies to my speech to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation on Friday last, which I will circulate to the Deputies.</P>
    <P>Last Friday the forum reconvened in Dublin Castle and I am pleased that, in addition to the previous participants, the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition and Labour accepted the invitation to participate.  So too did Senator Maurice Hayes who took the place previously filled with distinction by the late Senator Gordon Wilson. The participating delegations made statements on the theme &ldquo;Northern Ireland : Political Situation and Developments.&rdquo;  While the primary focus of all our efforts is the multi-party negotiations, it was widely accepted last Friday that occasional meetings of the forum, with the involvement of the parties not participating in the talks, will help the development of the public debate that is necessary as we move towards being able to validate an agreement through referendums.</P>
    <P>The Sailors and Soldiers and Sailors Land Trust is currently being wound up and a motion will be taken in the House tomorrow to facilitate expediting the matter.  When wound up, on foot of an agreement with the British Government reached some years ago, the Irish Government's share will be approximately £1.2 million.  Of this, commitments have already been given for expenditure of £150,000, which I recently announced towards the cost of the War Memorial in Messines. I have also endorsed expenditure of £180,000 over five years to the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool to fund a lectureship in modern Irish language and literature. When the money has been received advertisements will be placed in the newspapers and criteria and guidelines will be issued for the assistance of applicants.  The trust, which is chaired by Sir Philip Woodfield, is a British trust and the Irish representative on it is Lord Killanin.  Under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988, decisions on funding are made by the Taoiseach with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to say how shocking it is that there has been another sectarian <Col N="458" /> murder in the North since we last spoke in this House.  It cautions us to do everything we can to keep in contact with the reality of what is happening there and not to overstate the position or be overly optimistic or pessimistic.</P>
      <P>While noting the value of bilateral talks and hoping they will continue, what measures has the Taoiseach taken to allay the concerns of those who counsel against allowing the centre of gravity in the process to move away from the talks in Stormont as might be indicated through media reports?  In speaking with the Unionist parties, in particular, did the Taoiseach get any sense that they understood that the remit and authority of any North-South body would relate to the degree of proportionality in terms of the access to power within Northern Ireland agreed in the talks and the degree of institutional expression of the Irish identity also agreed in the talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the comments made by the Deputy about the murder of Gerry Devlin, unfortunately for him he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He had no intention of visiting the GAA club that evening but called back to collect members of his family.  Quite a number of the members of the officer board of that club are of the Protestant religion and are very active in the club.  The late Gerry Devlin was married and his wife, Hazel, is a Protestant.  He was involved in a number of activities of a cross-community nature, as he would have been the following morning in a soccer match with his son.  He only called to the club to collect members of his family and that is how he was assassinated.  For the record of the House, when I met a number of people from that community yesterday I learned that club has been attacked 23 times in recent years.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's question about the benefit of the talks, in all my discussions yesterday I stated that I felt the focus and emphasis should be on trying to work towards agreement between the parties and that the centre of focus should be the talks, particularly the sub-groups. As the Deputy knows, what has been happening for many months is there have been 85 or 86 people in the room and it has been something like other meetings of which we have experience.  The day can pass with the making of fixed statements and there can be very little dialogue.  We only do that occasionally but when it becomes an everyday occurrence it does not create the best method of negotiation.  Small sub-groups are now moving between the parties in working groups and in liaison groups and are therefore more clearly focused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The papers have come from strands one, two and three but there remains some considerable difficulty in getting the process to a stage where draft papers will serve as working documents.  If that happened, it might be far easier to make progress. However many fears, concerns and mistrusts exist about doing things in that order.  I got the impression yesterday that most of the delegations <Col N="459" /> believe they have been operating too slowly.  A certain amount of confidence has been built between most of them at this stage and that might allow progress to be made more quickly.</P>
    <P>My meetings with the Unionists centred on most of the key issues; there is no doubt but that the constitutional issue and the strand two issues will be the more difficult ones.  However, they are not the only ones and much work could be done in preparing agreement to a stage where one could deal with some of the real difficulties.  As I stated yesterday, it is not a good idea to hold back all the time from dealing with the few central issues.  People are moving around them but are not having any meaningful dialogue about them. There are many other issues, particularly in relation to strand one, which could be fundamentally drafted, not with unanimity at this stage, but with a fair amount of substantive agreement.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Unionists' willingness to engage in direct dialogue, my answer to that would be in the affirmative following yesterday's meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate on Questions Nos. 4 and 7 and indicate to us what is the Government's position on the report on Bloody Sunday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have directly raised the question of the British Government's decision on the Bloody Sunday issue at a number of meetings over the past few months.  When the former Taoiseach completed the report it was stated that some time should be given to the British Government to examine it in a confidential way and make its assessment of it.  I fully supported that. The British Government has been doing that since September and I hope it is relatively close to completing its report.  I understand that will happen sometime in the new year.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, fully understands we wish to publish the report.  Many of the groups which co-operated with the Government and which have argued for this have asked us not to hold back publication of the report indefinitely.  On the other hand, I do not want to exert undue pressure in this regard. I will publish the report in the early months of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and other Members of the House will have heard representatives of Sinn Féin articulate their concern on this issue last Friday in Dublin Castle.  Am I to understand from the Taoiseach's reply that he has received explicit assurances from British Government authorities that they intend to publish a response to this report in the near future and the Taoiseach is accordingly deferring personal or Government action until such time as that happens?  If he has received such an explicit undertaking from representatives of the British Government, could he give some indication of what the timetable would be?  Has he a reserve position whereby, notwithstanding <Col N="460" /> what might happen on the other side of the Irish Sea, the report will be published by the Irish authorities by a certain date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding with the British Government is that it will not delay unduly.  The next anniversary date would be considered an undue delay, so January was always the focus of the discussions.  In fairness, the British Government has had a great deal of difficulty with some aspects of the report, in terms of following through with the individuals involved, so there was no delay on its part.  It was reasonable to give the British that amount of time.  Those contacts have now been made although I am not sure about the legalities involved.  I will raise the matter again with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, when I meet him on Saturday at the European Summit.</P>
      <P>I prefer to defer publication of the report until the British Government has made its position clear, provided it does not delay unduly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the British Government doing with the report?  Is it preparing a parallel report or is it simply preparing an announcement? What indication has the Taoiseach received as to the nature of that announcement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am expecting a detailed reply to the assessments given to the British Government by the Irish Government.  I expect its response to take account of all aspects of the case and to outline what it intends to do.  The British are aware that we believe the Widgery report is fundamentally flawed and that a new inquiry should be conducted, and it is a matter of whether they will answer in the positive or negative to that proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the killing of Gerry Devlin, a member of the GAA, at Glengormley has caused great trauma to that part of north Belfast and created a sense that the community is surrounded by people with violent intent?  Does the Taoiseach further agree that that community should be reassured as to its safety in that part of Belfast?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach offer his views on progress in strand one of the talks, particularly the equality agenda which relates to flags and emblems, policing and the status of the Irish language?  While the Irish Government is not directly involved in strand one, has it put forward any proposals to be considered by the parties under the equality of treatment rubric within strand one of the talks? Does the Taoiseach agree it is essential that the North's institutions should be workable and not susceptible to being blocked by, for example, one member of a three person panel, for whom unanimity will be required for every decision?  If institutions in the North do not work, their contribution to the north-south body will not work either.</P>

      <P>With regard to the first question, I agree with the Deputy.  In our discussions with the Northern Secretary, Dr. Mowlam, last night, the Minister for Foreign Affairs raised the issue of the security of that area, and he intends to follow through on the matter.  He also told the members of the club and of the GAA that he would raise it at intergovernmental council level.</P>
      <P>We are not directly or indirectly involved in strand one talks, although we have presented papers on the extended equality agenda.  There has not been much movement on those issues for some time, even though there is a feeling that everybody is happy enough that the position reached in 1991-2 is something on which one can move forward.  Why parties will not do so is a matter for them.  They have not undertaken as much work as they could have done.  I do not want to get involved in that issue because strand one talks concern the parties in Northern Ireland.  The human rights and policing issue, especially as presented by Séamas Mallon in the most comprehensive document on policing, is one in which we have taken much interest. The SDLP stressed to me yesterday that the policing issue is of fundamental importance and it is anxious it should be kept centre stage.  While there are many other important issues it believes that in terms of building trust and confidence in the future, policing is the number one issue.</P>

      <P>Like every other Deputy, I condemn the murder of Gerry Devlin.  Has the Taoiseach contacted the authorities or the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the progress, if any, in apprehending whoever is guilty of that appalling murder?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree &mdash; and I suspect he does from what he said &mdash; that the Bloody Sunday report which we handed over to the British Government should be published by agreement, from the point of view of maintaining good relations between Ireland and Britain?  I would like the British Government to announce its intention to hold a serious inquiry into the events of that day, chaired by someone with an international reputation.</P>
      <P>In his meetings with Gerry Adams, has the Taoiseach stressed the need for the IRA to inform the families of the disappeared where the bodies of their loved ones are buried?  This would contribute enormously to building confidence in Northern Ireland that the 27 years of appalling violence which is unfortunately continuing in certain quarters, is coming to an end as far as the IRA is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach raised with Gerry Adams the problem which, judging from reports, appears to be prevalent in the talks &mdash; that Sinn Féin is not engaging on issues which indicate it is prepared to accept the need for compromise to reach agreement?  Judging the contribution made by Martin McGuinness at the forum last Friday, what we seem to hear from Sinn Féin in public <Col N="462" /> arenas is tired anti-British, anti-partition rhetoric which is not reflected in the language of any other party in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to publish the report on Bloody Sunday at an agreed time.  I do not want the publication of the report to result in building tension and pressure.  I would rather the British Government be allowed to finish its assessment, give its full judgment on all the material and state its position.  There has been much talk about new findings which cannot be allowed to go on indefinitely.  As the Deputy knows from his involvement in the previous report, this report is comprehensive and worthy of examination to try to undo the findings of the Widgery report, which is not considered a good report by Nationalists and others.</P>
      <P>Deputy Currie asked me on many occasions, to raise the matter of victims of IRA violence, which I have done and will continue to do.  I met many groups and families in Belfast and all the issues of the years of violence, are still to the forefront, whether it is deaths from plastic bullets, mobs, paramilitaries, bombings, burnings, attacks or those who believe the security forces are singling them out.  It is difficult for this House to understand the extent to which these issues drive the everyday agenda, whereas we believe people should discuss the issues of the future at the talks. We must understand it is a huge challenge to move away from these issues before one can discuss the daily agenda.  Perhaps this will take years, but their importance is illustrated in practically everyone's language.  I can say it, understand it and then try to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Practically everyone is engaging in the talks but the participation of Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party is still not satisfactory on certain issues.  However, the chairman is making substantial progress and there is more engagement than there was a fortnight ago.</P>

      <P>I will look at the matter of advertising for the Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust. The matter was raised by Deputy Quinn last week who said that the money should be used for its original purpose as envisaged in 1922.  Some ideas were previously put forward by Deputy John Bruton.  As soon as we get the remainder of the fund I will look carefully at the criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On that last point I want to raise a matter I raised in the course of an Estimates debate.  Notwithstanding what Deputy Gay Mitchell has said, as a former Minister for Finance the Taoiseach will surely agree that when the identifiable beneficiaries for whom the trust was first established have all but disappeared, the proper and correct accountancy procedure would be for the residue of that money to be put into central funds to be distributed in the normal way.  I calculate that of the £1.2 million left, the Taoiseach has allocated approximately £330,000 and now has at his disposal, accountable only to this House, a sum of £870,000.  Can I take it from what he said this will be used to fund projects that may from time to time catch the attention and enthusiasm of the Taoiseach of the day?  Surely it would be more correct for the balance of that money to be assigned to central funds or, alternatively, used specifically for Irish soldiers suffering from disabilities of one kind or another.  Would the Taoiseach agree it is hard to justify using these funds <Col N="464" /> for investment in the Irish School of Ecumenics and other such projects, no matter how worthy such causes may be, and that it is a long way from the purposes for which the trust was established in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy on accountancy practice in regard to this trust. There are two commitments.  It was agreed with Sir Philip Woodfield that certain criteria would be set down and we would try to ensure the money went into areas related to the original purpose of the trust. The amount of money in question would not make an extraordinary difference to the Exchequer, but I wanted to check if it was the view of the trust that it should be used for appropriate projects.  The trust is anxious the money should not be used for just any project and is keen that proper procedures are followed.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree this trust arose out of a European civil war that we, as Europeans, have the arrogance to describe as the First World War, in which British and Irish soldiers fought on the same side against other Europeans?  Would he agree that if the benefits of this trust are to be put to the purposes for which it was established, we should consider mechanisms for reconciliation between the peoples of these islands and other parts of Europe, particularly an enlarged Europe?  The idea that this money would be put into a British-Irish studies trust&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ten very disparate questions have been taken together.  Would the Taoiseach not accept that the moneys from this trust, in being allocated to British-Irish studies, are not being used as they should having regard to the manner in which this trust was established in the first instance?  It was set up in connection with a European civil war in which British and Irish soldiers fought against other Europeans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent allocation of the trust was fairly close to what the fund was set up for.  It is my intention to stick as closely as possible to whatever criteria are set down.  In regard to the other donation, it was believed this could be a useful project.  Otherwise the donation would not have been made.</P>

      <P>Earlier the Taoiseach spoke accurately and quite movingly about his experience in the talks yesterday, and the fact that many people are concerned about the aftermath of the violence that has occurred over 25 years and have difficulty in engaging in the talks process because they feel so deeply about things that happened over that period and which, unfortunately, in the case of the late Gerry Devlin, are happening to this day.  In that context has the Taoiseach considered the possibility of having a fourth strand <Col N="465" /> in the talks, namely, a truth and reconciliation strand involving an investigation of the truth about all atrocities on all sides, military and paramilitary, so that truth will be seen to be in the service of reconciliation and to be comprehensively laid bare rather than simply laid bare in regard to one or other section of the community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this involves all communities. Yesterday I heard from people from the majority community who had to leave their farms. It is not just one community that has suffered. Most of the groups to which I spoke yesterday at different locations would be represented.  That issue was looked at in earlier sessions of the forum and a document was prepared on it.  The South African model has been examined to see what similarities there are with it.  I agree with the Deputy to the extent that in principle we have to find some way of dealing with this aspect.  No matter what I or the British Government say, if people cannot move beyond that period, if they all the time remember the terrible, horrific and barbaric cases over 30 years, it will be very difficult for them ever to do business together.  We have to find a mechanism for dealing with that. Otherwise people will be continually drawn back into conflict, and as soon as they are into the heart of the conflict, it is impossible for them to move forward.  I understand why, but we have to find a mechanism to overcome it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We aim to deliver on this commitment by progressively increasing the number of people on the community employment programme who will be paid the rate for the job.  The community employment <Col N="467" /> programme is under continuous review in the light of the dynamics in the labour market arising from the booming economy.  It is against this background that the rate for the job initiative will be introduced.  Last week's budget provided for an additional 2,000 places on the community employment programme.  A total of £314.1 million is being allocated to FÁS for community employment next year.  I assure the Deputy that any further action I take in this area will be driven by the need to ensure better opportunities for the long-term unemployed.</P>

Will the Minister indicate how many of the 2,000 places for next year are new places?  How many people were projected to be on community employment schemes this year and how many of these will be on schemes next year?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for her good wishes.  I also hope my arm injury will not deter me from dealing with unemployment blackspots. I am not suffering from a disability but my temporary injury has certainly made me more sympathetic to the needs of disabled people, with particular reference to ensuring they get job opportunities.  Responsibility for the training of the disabled is being moved from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in line with the recommendation of the Commission on Disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the issue in that 25,000 new places are not being provided.  The Government's aim is to move to a situation where 25,000 participants on community employment schemes are paid the rate for the job.  At present the figure is approximately 1,000.  An additional 2,000 places will be created next year, bringing the number of persons on community employment schemes to an average of 42,000, as opposed to a figure of 40,000 this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>If 1,000 people are being paid the rate for the job this year, how can the Minister expect us to believe the Government can create an additional 6,000 places each year over the next four years?  What steps has the Government taken to ensure that the necessary resources are made available and that jobs are created so that people can be paid the rate for the job?  Will the Minister confirm that the projected number for this year was 40,000 and that the projected number for next year, taking into consideration the budget, is 41,000?  According to my calculations, that is 1,000 more places than the projected number for this year.  I received the figures from FÁS <Col N="468" /> and would like the Minister to explain the discrepancy between them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government came to office there was a shortfall in the provision for 1997 and one of its first initiatives was to provide additional funding to ensure it met the 40,000 average for this year.  Our aim is to increase the figure by 2,000 next year.</P>
      <P>On the additional money for the 25,000 participants moving to the rate for the job, the Deputy misunderstands the position.  Nobody gets paid more than the amount given under the community employment programme.  In order to receive the rate for the job participants must work for a specific number of hours.  For example, if the rate is £7 per hour and the community employment cap is £90 the participant will work for approximately 13 hours.  This is how the rate for the job operates.  No additional funding is required, it is merely organised in a different way.</P>
      <P>In recent negotiations CORI concluded that we should aim to move 10,000-15,000 to the rate for the job over the next three years.  In line with Partnership 2000, a monitoring group headed by my Department is being set up to examine how we can achieve this.</P>
      <P>The entire community employment programme is being examined in the context of the implementation of the White Paper on human resources.  We have to decide what we want to achieve under the programme.  There are two main elements to the programme at present.  The first is the reintegration element which seeks to reintegrate 75 per cent of participants into the labour market.  Essentially these participants have been on the live register for one year and are over 21 years of age.  The second is the part-time element which involves approximately 25 per cent of participants.  These people have generally been unemployed for more than three years, are over the age of 35 and have very slim chances of being reintegrated into the labour market.  We must decide whether the programme will follow more the social economy model, as recommended by Father Seán Healy, or the labour integration model.  In the context of the implementation of the White Paper on human resources we will have to address this issue very seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The protection of the health and safety of the Irish workforce is provided for in the comprehensive block of occupational health and safety legislation. This legislation sets out the actions necessary to protect workers in all sectors of the <Col N="469" /> economy, including the construction sector.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work, Act, 1989, and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993, form the principal body of legislation dealing with occupational health and safety.  They set out in clear and unambiguous terms the responsibilities of employers, of others concerned with places of work and of employees, in the provision and maintenance of a safe working environment. Under this legislation, the primary duty to identify and assess risks and to manage health and safety rests with employers in relation to their own business.  The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health has published a detailed guide to this legislation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the 1995 construction regulations form part of the most detailed legislation dealing with any one industry.  Their purpose is to reduce accidents, fatalities and ill health, during the construction phase of the project and building maintenance. Under these regulations construction work is seen in project terms.  The health and safety dimension must be factored into the project management, including the advance planning, preparation and assessment, together with effective management and co-ordination while on site. These regulations introduce the very important concept of a chain of responsibility, thus making health and safety an integral part of construction work from inception through to completion.</P>
      <P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is responsible for the enforcement of all occupational health and safety legislation. This ongoing enforcement is carried out in a proactive manner and entails inspection and educational activity.  The Authority works to a targeted annual work programme as well as regularly reviewing and focusing on sectors with high accident rates, in particular, the construction sector. In 1996 there were more than 4,500 formal inspections carried out in the construction sector. This was the highest figure for any single sector.</P>
      <P>In the context of recent controversies questions were raised about resourcing the Authority. There has been a steady increase in funding and staff allocated to the Authority in recent years.  In 1990 Exchequer funding amounted to £2.3 million and in 1998 it will amount to £4.7 million. Recently sanction was conveyed to the Authority to increase its staffing complement by seven, bringing its total staff numbers to 119 with effect from 1 January 1998.  This will represent an increase of 20 per cent in approximately three years and an overall increase of 55 per cent in the past eight years.  In addition, I have recently received from the Authority a comprehensive submission on its future staffing needs which is being studied by my officials.</P>

      <P>The overall rate of death and injury in Irish business generally is appalling, with 45 deaths per year, 17 of them in the construction industry, and many serious injuries.  The Minister has a responsibility in that.  He referred to the <Col N="470" /> performance of the HSA.  Was there an inspection of the Zoe site at Charlotte Quay a short time before the worker tragically lost his life?  I understand that under the health and safety legislation of 1989, before contracts are signed and a site is opened, a health and safety plan must be approved by inspectors of the Department.  Was that done on the Zoe development site and the Cruson development site, on which work was recently suspended?  Is a site inspection carried out and a site plan approved on all building and industrial sites before work proceeds?</P>
      <P>On the provision of resources, the Minister said the staff of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health has been increased to 119, but how many of those people are inspectors? How many of them inspect workplaces, colleges, shops and business sites?  We provide less than half the resources of the average EU country for health and safety.  For example, Finland has at least twice as many inspectors as Ireland.  Has the Minister and the Authority a case to answer in terms of lack of resources for this purpose?</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the need for greater resources in this area.  Since I took office I have been fighting for resources. My predecessor, the Deputy's party colleague, secured four additional members of staff last year and I succeeded in securing seven additional members this year.  I presume anybody who held this office &mdash; the Deputy's colleague who is present is one such person &mdash; has always fought for resources, and I will continue to do that.  An ongoing review of this matter is being carried out. Because of increased activity, particularly in the construction industry, additional resources are necessary and I ask the Deputy to support me in that cause, as he has done in his contribution today.  In regard to the Zoe site, I ask the Deputy to table a specific question on that matter.  That site is one of a number of sites on which the HSA would have focused.</P>

      <P>I referred to the construction regulations of 1995.  That legislation was agreed following lengthy discussion with the social partners. As the Minister's colleagues who have worked in this area will confirm, there is a chain of responsibility in this area.  I referred to the principle of a project management plan.  If the Deputy queries the background to individual accidents he will find, for example, that an unfortunate worker may be seriously injured or killed because a sub-contractor removed a piece of scaffolding.  That happens because of lack of responsibility.  I will <Col N="471" /> continue to fight for additional resources.  The Deputy asked for specific figures and I will be glad to forward that information to him.</P>
      <P>There are two elements to this question, one of which is enforcement.  Accidents must be prevented.  There is a procedure through which inspectors must visit sites and provide warning and prohibition notices and, in some cases, part or all of a site is closed down, as was done recently on two sites where action was taken at High Court level.  There is also the information aspect, and it is important we highlight the awareness and information element of this debate.  I visited schools and farms to discuss the dangers in those sectors.  I accept, however, we are concentrating on the construction sector today.  Much work remains to be done and I assure the Deputy of my continued effort.</P>

      <P>On taking office in July, one of the Government's first decisions was to allocate an extra £5 million to commence the expansion of intake in computing and technician courses, with a view to achieving an increased annual output of 1,000 computer graduates and 750 technician graduates.</P>
      <P>More recently, the Government decided, in a radical initiative, to establish a £250 million scientific and technological education investment fund. In 1998, £100 million is being allocated to the fund, with the balance of £150 million over each of the following two years.  In addition, the fund will be open to private donors.  This is a direct and tangible Government response to the needs of our rapidly developing economy.</P>

My Department and FÁS, as appropriate, are examining these proposals with a view to identifying areas in which they could provide further assistance and encouragement to potential entrepreneurs.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree the budget failed dismally to deal with the gap in the market?  In every town and village there are advertisements for staff in shop windows.  I am not talking merely about the high-tech computing skills that are absent in the workforce, but about drivers, warehouse minders, contract cleaners, caterers, painters and decorators, hairdressers and people to work in launderettes and dry cleaning businesses.  Every section of the service industry lacks staff.  Is the Minister aware the budget did nothing to correct the mismatch between what is needed in the workforce and what is being provided, even by FÁS which provides good courses?  Is she aware that 80 per cent of the small firms questioned in a recent survey carried out by the Small Firms Association said they could not fill vacancies.  What is the Minister doing to ensure the training and skills being provided are what is required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the huge problem that exists in our economy.  Growth outturn for 1998 will be 8.4 per cent while almost 10 per cent of the workforce is unemployed.  There is a huge inconsistency in those figures.  Thankfully, the number is moving downwards, but not as rapidly as I would like.  The Government's first economic mission is to ensure that more people participate in work and that more opportunities are provided for the unemployed.  Next year we will spend almost three-quarters of a billion pounds on schemes to encourage people to move from welfare to work.  That is a huge increase on the previous year.  The budget for training for the unemployed has increased by 21 per cent, the local employment service budget has increased by 95 per cent and training for people at work &mdash; we must ensure we sustain existing jobs &mdash; has also increased by 95 per cent.  This shows a major commitment on the Government's part to make it easy for people to move from unemployment into the world of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the budget did nothing in this area.  We moved the threshold for the payment of PRSI from £80 to £100 which will make it more attractive for people to take up low paid jobs.  We introduced a tax initiative for the long-term <Col N="473" /> unemployed.  A long-term unemployed person will receive an additional personal allowance of £3,000 and an allowance of £1,000 per child in the first year.  That will be scaled down to £2,000 and £1,000 in years two and three, respectively.  In addition, companies that take on a long-term unemployed person will receive double the cost allowance which should make it attractive for them to do so.</P>
    <P>In the context of implementing the White Paper on human resources and the employment service, my Department intends to introduce initiatives early next year with a view to providing opportunities for more unemployed people to participate in training and work.  This must be directed, in particular, at young people.  We want to ensure that fewer young people go from school to unemployment.  Many of them end up unemployable at an early age because they have been out of school and work for a number of years.  In the context of the EU summit on unemployment and other initiatives the Government intends to pursue, there should be dramatic improvement in the opportunities for the unemployed in our economy in the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there is something seriously wrong when there are approximately a quarter of a million people on the unemployment register, but business people cannot fill vacancies?  Is she aware that in the past few days a major employer, Mr. Campbell, indicated that 20 per cent of the people working in his business are not Irish?  What has the Minister done, in conjunction with FÁS and her colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and the Family Affairs, to create more incentives for the unemployed to take up these jobs so that they can be filled from the quarter of a million who are unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done a considerable amount in that respect.  The skill shortages have been emerging for a considerable length of time. Notwithstanding the fact that my predecessor spoke a great deal about it, no action was taken. Within two weeks of forming the Government, one of our first decisions was to allocated £5 million for the academic year 1997-8 to ensure that more people take up computing and technician courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a ludicrous situation whereby the economy was financing inward investment, but those inward investments had to go outside the economy to get employees.  Let us give credit where credit is due.  The £250 million fund will assist the economy considerably to provide us with skilled people for the emerging jobs. As a result of various discussions between my Department, the Department of Education, FÁS and the Higher Education Authority, we have set <Col N="474" /> yearly targets for the increased numbers of people needed with computing and linguistic skills and technician qualifications.  They were the three main areas in which a crisis was emerging.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy is saying.  It is not satisfactory that almost 10 per cent of the workforce should be unemployed while employers find it difficult to fill vacancies.  That is why the Government placed great emphasis on personal income tax in the budget and allocated £517 million in a full year towards the reduction of personal income tax.  In particular, the tax incentive for the long-term unemployed will make it easier for people to take up employment.  In the first year a long-term unemployed person with three children will receive an extra £6,000 by way of a tax free allowance.  In addition, the employer will get double the cost of employing that person.</P>
      <P>That is a targeted and sensible approach to encouraging the employment of the long-term unemployed.  People registered as unemployed are trained in the areas mentioned by the Deputy, but employers cannot get them to fill vacancies. There are wider issues we must address in that context and we intend to.  It is not the case, however, that we do not have people trained in those areas.  Sometimes, the incentive is not there for those persons to take up employment.  Everybody responds to the economics of their own situation. If we make it sensible by changing tax, the PRSI threshold and by encouraging employers to take on the long-term unemployed, it will make a difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very satisfied with the way he handled my question.  I would like to have been here because I was so much involved in that issue, but I was at a meeting of Social Affairs Ministers in Brussels at the time.</P>
      <P>The supervision of authorised insurers and the monitoring of insurance market issues, including the cost of insurance, are handled by my colleague Deputy Treacy, the Minister of State with responsibility for Science, Technology and Commerce. The Minister of State recently held an informal meeting with the Irish Insurance Federation, in the course of which the cost of insurance for the young driver, the factors giving rise to relatively high premium rates and the initiative taken by the IIF to promote safer driving standards among young drivers as the basis for reducing premiums, were discussed.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also met the management of Guardian PMPA Insurance last week to express his concern at recent increases in motor premiums.  Consultations will continue with the industry.</P>
      <P>The basic problem is that young Irish drivers' claims experience is extremely poor.  Such drivers represent a very high risk to insurers, hence the relatively high motor premium levels charged to them.  In this connection, I draw the Deputy's attention to detailed replies which the Tánaiste gave to the House on 21 October 1997 and 6 November 1997 regarding the issue of motor insurance costs, especially for young drivers.  In those replies the Tánaiste outlined the findings of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, the Deloitte and Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs and statistical information contained in National Roads Authority annual reports.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that the Minister of State has met the various bodies.  That basically answers my question, but his statement is disappointing as he rehashed what has already been said a number of times by the Tánaiste.  Where has the Minister of State's imagination gone? Before the election his party came up with some attractive vote catching proposals.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, spoke about advanced driving courses.</P>

Is he considering probational driving licences as they have in Sweden?  What about the low mileage factor where drivers are concerned? Has the Minister of State or his colleague done anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="476" />
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes.  I appreciate that this issue has been with us for some time and successive Ministers have endeavoured to deal with it.  However, I assure the Deputy that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is determined to make progress.</P>
      <P>I will outline some of the recent initiatives.  The Department of the Environment co-operated with the Automobile Association in the launch of an AA drink driving video aimed at young drivers. An insurance incentive scheme has been established by agreement between the Irish Insurance Federation and the driving instructors' register whereby insurance discounts will be offered to young drivers who have completed an agreed number of driving lessons over a calendar year.  The Ontario graduated licensing system for learner drivers is currently being examined by the Department of the Environment.  The National Safety Council is also working to produce course material on road safety to fit in with the new primary school curriculum.  The council recently adopted a five year road safety programme which includes the development of educational material in 1998 for transition year students in secondary schools.  Some schools are also offering driving training courses on a commercial basis.</P>
      <P>The next and last element deals with one of the Deputy's questions.  In its adjustment of motor rates the Hibernian group, the second largest underwriter in the Irish motor market, incorporated a reassessment of the young drivers' insurance risks profile resulting in a new insurance scheme that will take into account a young motorist's claims free experience as a named driver on his or her parents' motor insurance policy, and a no claims bonus incentive to reward such claim free driving.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that there are many statistics and, thanks to new information technology advances, a database specifically dealing with the key areas is now available.  For example, it is clear from the information I have, and I am sure the Deputy has also, that the basic problem is not just young drivers but young male drivers who constitute the major risk area.  It goes without saying that young females are less of a risk.  The key is to work on these risk areas.  There is a need for insurers to refine and segment the young drivers' market in a more scientific manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear this.  Will the Minister of State go further and encourage advanced driving courses?  As such courses are very expensive, has the Minister of State any plans to help younger drivers to pay for them? Has the Minister of State looked at the fact that over 700,000 people are now driving with provisional driving licences?  I know this is not within his remit, but it is a big factor in the high cost of insurance.  Surely the Government is failing in not hiring more driver testers to cut down on the number of people with provisional licences and thereby helping to cut high insurance costs.</P>

I welcome the constructive suggestions the Deputy made.  As I said, schemes such as the Ontario graduated licence system are being examined.  The Minister of State is endeavouring to put together many of the fine proposals that have been in the public arena for some time.

      <P>I am concerned that the large number of initiatives to help in the fight against unemployment are as effective as possible.  They are under continuous review to ensure they are focused on and targeted at the real needs of unemployed people. I want to see an improvement in the service the State delivers to unemployed people and in this regard I am considering the best means of achieving this in the context of implementing the White Paper on human resources and other such matters.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that if an employer takes on people from a FÁS scheme and one leaves, he or she will have to take on two people to get a grant and that people on community employment schemes will not take a job afterwards as it will not pay them to do so?  There was an incentive to make it worthwhile for people to leave community employment schemes but in service industries there is a lack of information on it.  Will the Minister simplify information for employers as there is a huge number of schemes <Col N="479" /> and it is difficult to get people working on the shop floor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is a large number of schemes, some of which are aimed at encouraging the unemployed to re-enter the workforce and others targeted at industry.  Industry can avail of in excess of 45 different schemes to expand employment.  I am anxious to ensure schemes have a very focused approach for industry and particularly to help unemployed people.  As I stated earlier in response to Deputy Owen, £750 million will be spent in 1998 on various schemes to help people from welfare to work.  It must be ensured in the first instance that the taxpayer gets value for money but, more importantly, that unemployed people get the greatest possible benefit from that huge State resource in the context of implementing the White Paper on human resources and reviewing community employment.</P>
      <P>The changes made in the budget, such as calculating family income supplement on net income, changes in tax benefits for the employment of the long-term unemployed, the double allowance for employers and the fact that a long-term unemployed person will get an increased personal allowance of £3,000 in the first year, an additional £1,000 for every child and keep his or her secondary benefits should have an impact in encouraging long-term unemployed people back to work and employers to take them on.  However, we do not live in an ideal world and the fact that almost 10 per cent of the workforce is unemployed, notwithstanding the Celtic tiger and 8.4 per cent growth this year, must concern any Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  All schemes which help industry and unemployed people need to be examined to ensure we have the most focused and targeted response possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on a FÁS scheme only 10 per cent of people are allowed to be re-employed on a continuation of the scheme? As a result people are not suitable for other employment and return to receiving unemployment assistance because training on the scheme is inadequate to provide them with jobs elsewhere? A major anomaly in the system is that the figure of 10 per cent is not increased to 50 per cent in rural areas, which would increase employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of community employment is to help reintegration to the labour market, not to provide people with long-term or permanent jobs and 75 per cent of all participants are taken on with that in mind.  To the best of my knowledge, approximately 70 per cent of those who participate in community employment continue into full-time employment afterwards.  It is a high percentage but I wish it was higher and we must examine how the participation rate can be further increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community employment has social economy dimensions which CORI, in particular, is very <Col N="480" /> keen to expand.  We must separate its social economy function from its reintegration to the labour market to ensure we know what we are doing and that FÁS knows what it is expected to do.  There is capacity to change some of the rules, such as the Deputy suggests, but I am not certain about the problem he highlights in rural areas. However, there are difficulties for people in rural areas in participating in community employment and in some cases even getting people together to get a scheme under way.  Greater flexibility is needed to ensure the scheme is targeted at those it is meant to help.  I will look at the Deputy's suggestion in the context of the review that is under way.</P>

      <P>The sum of £517 million that will be given to PAYE taxpayers is long overdue and the Government as a whole supported the package of measures.  It is wrong to suggest somebody was taken prisoner and the Government is committed in its programme to reduce the burden of tax on all workers.  Four hundred thousand workers, mainly in the PAYE sector, pay the top rate of tax and taxes on work in our economy are too high.  In Northern Ireland and Britain, for example, there is an initial rate of 10 per cent, a standard rate of 23 per cent and a higher rate of 40 per cent.  Will Deputy Broughan increase tax rates if he gets into power after the next election?</P>

      <P>Between 1989 and 1992 I heard the same cries from some of the same sources but when those parties were in power they did not restore the old rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasing the PRSI threshold from £80 to £100 and calculating family income supplement on net income will greatly benefit recipients of low pay. The average increase will be £11 per week which is enormous.  One would have to receive a huge <Col N="481" /> increase in nominal pay to get such an increase in take-home pay.</P>
    <P>The tax allowance referred to by Deputy Rabbitte for a long-term unemployed person is £3,000 in the first year, £2,000 in the second and £1,000 in the third and £1,000 per year for each child.  If it costs £150 per week for an employer, he or she will be able to claim double, £300 per week, against his or her tax liability.  I am not the Minister for Finance but that is my understanding of its operation.  Employers will receive double the cost of employing a long-term unemployed person and that person will keep all of his or her benefits during the three years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 52, 82 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>My Department and the industrial development agencies have been working with the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Finance, the Higher Education Authority and FÁS to ensure that the skills needed for the development of industry and employment are available.</P>
      <P>As a result of this co-operation targets have been set for an increased annual output of 1,000 additional computing graduates, 1,000 additional linguists and 750 additional technicians.  The Government provided £5 million to commence intake into these courses in 1997.  In addition over the last two years FÁS has provided training for 832 people in software-computing, 1,083 in electronics and related courses and 487 in telesales courses.  FÁS is examining how it might enhance its activities in this area in 1998.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the Governments decision to establish a £250 million scientific and technological education (investment) fund which will be used to develop technology education at all levels ranging from primary schools to advanced research and to promote new areas of activity where emerging needs are identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has missed the point of the questions.  I spoke with two industrialists in my area last week, one of whom has 12 vacancies in his factory and the other ten which they cannot fill.  These are ordinary factory jobs not requiring computer skills.  Does the Minister see a role for her Department in discussing with industrialists courses which suit their needs?  Perhaps she would look at the possibility of making grant aid available directly to industrialists to help them design and provide their own courses and training with the view to taking on employees.  Given that both companies are in the export business, this would boost our exports. Will the Minister agree there are many vacancies <Col N="483" /> in factories such as those in my own area?  How can we get to the core of providing training to enable people to be employed in those factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues here.  There is an emerging skills shortage.  The Government moved rapidly to allocate funds to deal with the shortage in the electronics industry, computing graduates, linguists and various technicians. Clearly there were shortages and people were being brought in from abroad to take up many of the new jobs.  I agree that while there are 239,000 people unemployed, many employers are complaining that they cannot get people to work.  I am not certain that a shortage of skills is the problem.  I said earlier to Deputies Owen and Perry, in the context of implementing the White Paper on human resource development &mdash; published during the reign of my predecessor &mdash; and reviewing community employment that we will be making an announcement in relation to those matters shortly which should help target the State's response to the unemployed, in such a way that more people will be in a position to take up employment opportunities and that it will be easier to move from welfare to work.  The £0.75 billion we will spend in 1998, which is a considerable resource from the taxpayer, to help unemployed people into the world of work must be used to the best effect for the unemployed.  That requires a radical overhaul of some of the measures under which we have been operating in the past number of years.  Given the diffuse response, it has not been easy for the agencies with responsibility in the matter &mdash; the industrial development agencies and the training agency &mdash; to target their resources in such a way as would help unemployed people get back to the world of work.  Funding for the training of the unemployed has been increased by 21 per cent for 1998, training for the employed by 95 per cent and the local employment service by 95 per cent.  That is a huge commitment from the Government to this whole area.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister ask her officials to broaden the understanding of the word &ldquo;skills&ldquo;?  Will she broaden it to include ordinary people who can work in factories?  Does the Minister see any advantage is meeting industrialists and their approving appropriate courses that will provide these skills for the people they want to employ?  The courses should not be generated from Kildare Street or any other place.  The employers who will take on the employees should be talked to and should approve the courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Deputy McGrath's question is yes.  The private sector is involved in devising many of the courses.  We want to ensure that those who will provide employment are involved in consultation and discussion about the courses available.  There is some merit in what Deputy Rabbitte said about the fund, that essentially it will go to people who are better educated. It will be invested at an early stage in first and second level schools to ensure our young people are equipped with skills for the emerging jobs.  In the world of work of the future, particularly in the context of the Irish economy, there will be virtually no employment opportunities for those who do not have some level of skill.  We must ensure that more people are equipped with the skills to get the jobs being created in the economy. That is particularly the case in areas such as Clondalkin, Ballymun, Tallaght, Finglas and so on.  One of the tragedies is that notwithstanding the huge level of new jobs being created in the economy the level of unemployment in these areas is not changing much.  Therefore, any response on our part must be targeted very much at the needs of people in those areas.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with the two projects the Deputy mentioned.  I have already been invited to Ballymun and hope to visit the group there very shortly.  I would be delighted to meet anyone to inform myself better of what may or may not be needed.  There is need for much flexibility in relation to many of these schemes and to ensure that State money is spent on equipping people with skills for the kinds of jobs emerging rather than on training a large number of people in areas where they have no possibility of obtaining a job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to all four questions together.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday last, 3 December, the United Kingdom Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food &mdash; MAFF &mdash; received new advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee &mdash; SEAC &mdash; based on the findings of continuing research into BSE.</P>
      <P>An experiment designed to re-check which parts of cattle may contain BSE infectivity has detected infectivity in nervous tissue called the dorsal root ganglia which lie within the bones of the spinal column and which would be left with the bone when meat is cut off the spine.  The dorsal root ganglia are not currently covered by the specified bovine restriction &mdash; SRM &mdash; which ensures that all tissue in which infectivity is detected is removed from the human food chain.</P>
      <P>Further new findings, still being evaluated, indicate that infectivity may also be found in bone marrow in cattle which are at a very late stage of the disease and are already showing clinical symptoms.  Although, in its advice, SEAC emphasised that the risk to the consumer is very small, the United Kingdom Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food decided to opt for the deboning of all beef, whether from home suppliers or imported, before sale to the consumer.  He also decided that the bones should not be sold, given to consumers or used in the preparation of food.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my primary concern and first priority in relation to food is to ensure that all food on sale to the consumer is of the highest standard of safety and is fit in all respects for human consumption.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement of the United Kingdom measures in this area, I immediately sought independent advice to ascertain what implications, if any, this new information might have for Irish consumers.  The scientific advice available to me as Minister for Health and Children includes that of the CJD Advisory Group, the Food Safety Advisory Board and the Interim Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The CJD Advisory Group was established in l996 to advise the Minister for Health on CJD-related matters including its surveillance, research strategies and international developments generally in this area. The group comprises experts in disciplines relevant to this subject, that is, neurology, neuro-pathology, public health, veterinary medicine and microbiology.</P>

    <P>Having examined the information available in relation to the latest United Kingdom research, the CJD group made a number of recommendations to me which included agreement with the SEAC advice in relation to dorsal root ganglia and a recommendation that immediate arrangements be put in place to ensure that no meat with the backbone (vertebrae) be sold to the consumer; that the most practical way of ensuring this is to require it to be carried out at the retail level, for example, by butchers; that bones removed in this way should be disposed of as not fit for human consumption; that the issue be <Col N="487" /> raised at Community level as a matter of urgency and that there is a need for further information, notably in relation to the findings on bone marrow, to allow more detailed consideration of this issue.</P>
    <P>The microbiology sub-committee of the Food Safety Advisory Board will meet on Thursday next to examine the issue and I look forward to receiving its advice.  The Food Safety Authority will also consider the matter.</P>
    <P>The European Union Scientific Steering Committee, which met in Brussels yesterday, referred the new British evidence to a specialist sub-committee for consideration, whose deliberations will be closely monitored.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the provision of public information, my Department operates a sophisticated food alert system which, as appropriate, rapidly disseminates information to health boards, producers, retailers and consumer organisations.  I am satisfied that this system, which is part of an integrated EU-wide alert system, operates efficiently.</P>
    <P>The Enfer BSE test is a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Food and I am sure my ministerial colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, will give the matter due consideration.</P>
    <P>Over the coming days and weeks I shall consider all the scientific advice available to me and review the position in the light of such.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that my primary duty as Minister for Health and Children is the protection of public health and my main concern in dealing with this issue is to ensure that consumers are kept informed of any risk, however small, to food safety.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the fact that he made his statement to consumers and butchers in a very inadequate manner was not helpful and that since then there have been alternative opinions expressed by highly reputable experts?  For example, would he not agree that Mr. McNulty or Miss Darina Allen have made statements which, if not casting doubt on the Minister's position, would certainly present a different view to the consumer and that this should lead him to consider that he needs to do more; that it is incumbent on him to undertake further examination rather than simply resort to existing structures and that it would be advisable for him to explain to our consumers precisely his reason for issuing that advice?  What means are available to him of communicating with the public to ensure that the small risks involved are sufficiently explained?  Would he elaborate for the benefit of the House on the actual position here and how it varies from the British experience? Does he agree that this type of information is the type our consumers are entitled to have available to them, rather than travel to the supermarket on a Friday evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Often.  I might be permitted to make a couple of comments in relation to this issue.  I issued a press statement on Friday last, which comprised clear and simple precautionary advice.  Deputy McManus has suggested that that statement was inadequate in some way.  In my statement I pointed to the fact that the position here was totally different from that in the United Kingdom.  I spoke about the much greater control mechanisms that obtain here, the banning of meat and bonemeal and the fact that we have a very low incidence of CJD compared with the United Kingdom.  Any suggestion that I was in any way equating our position with that in the United Kingdom is wrong.</P>
      <P>The second line of criticism was that I slavishly followed the UK position.  It seemed to come as news to some of the people making this criticism that we have our own CJD expert group which advises me on these matters.  Those two criticisms, therefore, simply do not stand up to scrutiny. The question of adequacy or inadequacy is a subjective test. My press statement is more than adequate.  It sets out the position precisely in simple terms.</P>
      <P>My primary responsibility is to public health matters and, as Minister for Health and Children, it is my duty to inform.  We have come through an extremely traumatic experience in relation to a public health failure involving the blood system precisely because there was failure to inform.  I believe in the commonsense of the public.  My statement was measured, reasonable and rational. It was to the effect that if we can take any practical step to eliminate a potential risk, however small, we should take that step particularly &mdash; and this would not be a primary consideration as Minister for Health &mdash; when it does not involve any major inconvenience to the retail trade which is already selling meat in a boneless state to the tune of 95 per cent of its product.  Those are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On risk assessment, it is true the risk in this case is extremely low.  I never suggested otherwise, and any attempt to inject hype into this situation will not serve the interests of producers or consumers.  I have simply given precautionary advice as a result of expert advice available to me.  I have a duty to inform the public.  I believe <Col N="489" /> in the commonsense of the public and the public will react accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he took advice and did not slavishly accept the view of the British scientists, but the expert advice available to him was only based on the information this body received by fax from the British.  No animal in this State under five years of age has been found to have BSE, and the meat normally sold in butchers' shops is from animals under two years of age.  Is it not true, therefore, that the expert group is not properly informed?  British buyers of beef today refused to buy any more beef on the bone from this country and, as a result, the majority of factories are not killing cattle today.  The industry is on its knees as a result of what the Minister said last Friday.</P>

      <P>I spoke to a number of factory owners today who informed me of this; I am telling the Minister what they said.  Will the Minister inform the public that beef on the bone is safe to eat because all of the beef sold in Irish butcher shops is from animals under two years of age? Finally, in reply to Deputy McManus the Minister informed us the Minister for Agriculture and Food will deal with the new proposals concerning a BSE test. At its meeting today, did the Cabinet decide to take action on this and direct the Minister for Agriculture and Food to employ this test in factories around the country?  Action must be taken because the industry is on its knees as a result of what the Minister said last Friday.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate when people are too predictable.  I know Deputy Farrelly would like to put himself forward as the sole defender of farming interests.  I represent farmers as much as the Deputy.  I also recognise the importance they attach to the integrity of their product and the number of steps they are prepared to take, more than any other producers in the EU, to ensure the integrity of that product is maintained and upheld.</P>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly made a statement, which is totally wrong, which suggests exports to Britain have been put at risk as a result of a precautionary advice I gave.  He also made a mistake in suggesting the majority of beef exported to Britain is on the bone.</P>

      <P>He said factory owners are not killing cattle today because of what I said and that beef on the bone cannot be exported to the UK. Ninety five per cent of beef exported to the UK is boneless.  I do not know where the Deputy is getting his information from but it is totally at variance with the facts.  Deputy Farrelly also made the point that I should not mention this because the scientific finding was made in the <Col N="490" /> UK.  I remind the Deputy that the establishment of scientific fact is location neutral.  When the apple fell on Isaac Newton, it did not matter whether it fell in Navan, County Meath or in Kent.  The principle was the same; gravity was discovered.</P>

      <P>Despite the fact that it is only experimental evidence, the scientific basis for this issue confirms that infectivity can be lodged outside the spinal cord and within the vertebral column. That is a scientific fact which has become available as a result of this evidence.  Regardless of whether that information came from China, the UK or Ireland, it is a matter that I, as a defender of public health, must take into account.</P>
      <P>I went to these experts Deputy Farrelly regards as having no expertise.  These people are neuro-pathologists, neurologists and public health experts who have some degree of expertise in CJD.  One member of that committee is highly acclaimed world-wide for her knowledge of the emerging facts on this problem.  I remind the Deputy that we are talking about a fatal disease. When such information becomes available, commonsense must prevail.  We have simply given precautionary advice which does not attack the integrity of the beef product.  The purpose of precautionary advice is to enhance the integrity of the beef product.  Given that the level of inconvenience to the trade in meeting that precautionary advice is minimal, I do not understand the hoo-ha the Deputy is trying to create.  The consumers are treating this matter with the degree of discernment one would expect from reasonable, rational people, unlike Deputy Farrelly.</P>

In the context of the risk that is alleged to exist, will the Minister accept the statistic that there is a one in 600 million possibility of someone contracting new variant CJD through this suggested risk?  If that is not the case, is the Minister in a position to indicate the <Col N="491" /> extent of the risk in the context of providing consumers with the full comprehensive information to which they are entitled?  Will he agree that simply saying there is a risk, but a small one, is not the appropriate way of dealing with the matter? Will the Minister accept one should not deal with a matter such as this by creating alarm and then trying to talk it down?  Will the Minister clarify in simple terms if he is saying it is safe for people today to eat T-bone steaks or is he saying they are at risk?  Will he agree he cannot sound a warning and then rubbish it by giving an interview to a newspaper during which he announces he would be quite happy to buy a T-bone steak? In the context of providing the information to which people are entitled, will the Minister clarify the nature of the risk and the degree to which consumers should take his pronouncement seriously when shopping for their families?</P>

If a matter, such as this, comes into the public domain, people have a right to know about it.  That is the first principle.  One can either dilute that principle or abide by it.  Is the Deputy telling me that is a principle by which I should abide?  He complimented me on it, but then he decided there are situations where perhaps I should not say anything and not cause alarm.  He claimed the risk is 600 million to one.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter will not accept his logic from me.  I gave the information because I believed it was relevant to the public and the consumer. I did not seek to cause alarm.  The purpose of my precautionary advice was to do the exact opposite; it was to give the information so that people could assimilate it.  The risk assessment made by the public confirms there is no cause for alarm, but when Deputy Shatter asks me to say what is the risk assessment I remind him that even experts in this field are learning about this <Col N="492" /> disease and the possible transmission of BSE to CJD on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.</P>

An expert committee advised me on that and, knowing what I do, I am prepared to back, to use Deputy Shatter's words, &ldquo;a 600 million to one chance&rdquo; by having a T-bone steak.

      <P>It is not in the interests of consumers or producers to make a political football out of this issue and we should resist the temptation to do that.  Will the Minister clarify the role and responsibility of various State agencies on advising the consumer of the extent of the risk involved?  Will he also clarify what measures he has put in place to ensure that information is given in an informed and calm manner to consumers? What is the role of the consumer liaison group in the Department of Agriculture and Food, appointed by the previous Government last March, in this regard?  What is the role of the Food Safety Authority on advising people on this matter?</P>
      <P>Regarding the Minister's advice to butchers to debone beef before offering it for sale, is he aware that several butchers continue to sell beef on the bone in spite of his advice?  What measures does he intend to take to ensure there is proper monitoring and enforcement of his deboning advice?  Why did the Minister choose to advise butchers rather than putting in place a system of close supervision of deboning in retail outlets or in meat plants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for her responsible approach, unlike others, to this matter. The reason this is precautionary advice is to <Col N="493" /> take into account the risk assessment factors articulated by other Deputies as to what is the real danger.  There is no imminent danger in so far as one can advise that, but one must make a specific point of view clear.  I said, given that the potential risk is so low, I would advise as a precaution the practical step of taking out the bone, which would eliminate the risk, however small. That is practical advice that should be given, which need not and does not cause a major inconvenience and would deal with the matter on the basis of the knowledge we have at present.  That is the reason I gave that advice.  It would have been easy for me to do nothing about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That type of approach has created public health disasters that we do not wish to revisit.  The advice given was practical and precautionary. The monitoring that will take place will be carried out by the industry and the Department in the normal manner.  I have not sought to be prescriptive at this stage in terms of, for example, amending food hygiene regulations. I do not believe the information available requires us to take that step, but the EU steering committee is examining this and we are seeking a harmonious approach to this on an EU wide level so that everybody will be in agreement as to what the approach should be.  In the meantime I felt it incumbent on me to discharge my duty by doing what I did, which was not earth-shattering in any way, but was the least I should do in terms of informing the public.</P>
      <P>The CJD expert committee advises me specifically on this area.  The Food Safety Authority is another body that is meeting next week and will consider this matter.  I take advice from those quarters as it emerges, but I felt, given that a scientific issue has been established in this matter, that apart from the brain and the spinal cord there is a prospect of infectivity in the vertebral column, that should be made known to the people, while understanding that the risk assessment was very low.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, this is an issue on which various Members of the House validly wish to raise supplementary questions.  I am not aware that there is a precedent in this House where a series of questions are taken to which the Minister subsequently responds.  This is a matter of order and the normal approach is that a question is put to the Minister to which he responds and the next question raises a question.  Otherwise, the Minister can pick and choose the nature <Col N="495" /> of the answer he will give and which questions he will reply to.  This is a matter of some seriousness and one which is of concern to many people outside of the House.</P>

    <P>As previous speakers pointed out Mr. John Pattison, chairman of the SEAC, said there was a &ldquo;risk&rdquo; involved in eating beef on the bone.  If we are talking about risks, should we impose a ban on fish in case someone might swallow a <Col N="496" /> bone and choke?  Should people stop using cars or crossing the road because there is a risk involved?  Should people not travel to Egypt or Sri Lanka?  I believe that, as a result of the Minister's actions, this matter has been dramatised out of all proportions.</P>

      <P>On Deputy Gormley's comments about a test for BSE, that may have possibilities based on what I have heard.  The test has been validated and discussions are continuing on it.  It is a commercial issue for that company or group of persons to come forward with a test which would hopefully render this kind of discussion irrelevant. If we could get an absolute guarantee that the beef coming out of our processing factories was BSE-free, it would enjoy a premium price in many European markets.  Clearly it is something we would like to encourage and see come to fruition if possible.</P>

      <P>The British Minister with responsibility for the internal market, Lord Simon, has been contacted and has made statements.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has also been in touch with Commissioner Monti to express the Government's deep concern about this issue.  The Irish Embassy in London has been in contact with the various British authorities each day and the Ambassador raised the matter with Michael Packenham, the Deputy Secretary in the Cabinet Office, when the blockade started and has continued to do so.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs raised the matter with the British Foreign Secretary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> Before the debate was adjourned I said that the budget was the first real test of the economic and social priorities of the Government.  While individual items in the budget are welcome, the overall response of most people has been one of disappointment. The budget was produced in unique circumstances and must be judged against this unique background.  Never before has a Minister for Finance in his first budget inherited such a favourable financial situation from the previous Government.  Never before had a Minister to prepare a budget when the Exchequer was awash with money nor had he so many easy decisions to make.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months there has been an important debate on the direction taxation policy should take.  The two alternative strategies advanced were to increase the allowances and widen the bands, as advocated by Democratic Left, or to cut the tax rates, as proposed by the Progressive Democrats.  As the debate progressed a substantial consensus emerged supporting the approach advocated by Democratic Left, which included not just the parties in the rainbow Government but also the trade union movement, the Combat Poverty Agency, the INOU, CORI, NESF and even employer organisations such as IBEC, and the Small Firms' Association. However, the Minister has chosen to ignore this consensus and went instead for the narrow, sectional approach of cutting the nominal rates.</P>
    <P>The problem with the tax system is not that the top rate is too high but that too many taxpayers start paying it too early and end up paying it on too high a proportion of their income.  Increasing the allowances and widening the standard band increases the take home pay of all taxpayers, reduces the numbers paying at the higher 48 per cent rate, helps the lowest paid most and reduces the tax wedge.  Every pound spent on increasing the tax allowance is five times more beneficial to a person on £100 per week than a pound spent cutting the tax rates.  If the Minister had adopted this approach, those on low and middle incomes would have experienced real and substantial improvements in their take home pay.  Instead, as we can see from any range of the tables produced, the benefits are going disproportionately to high earners.  A single person earning £10,000 benefits to the tune of £233 per year, while a single person on £50,000 gains almost £1,050.  A couple with one spouse working earning £10,000 gains £151, while a couple earning £50,000 gains £1,124.  A married couple with one earner and four children earning £10,000 benefits to the tune of £286, while a similar couple on £50,000 gains £1,187.  It is not just the amounts as all of the charts show that the percentage gain is invariably much greater for the higher earners.</P>
    <P>The budget has been most disappointing for those on very low pay.  The Minister has passed up the opportunity to remove many people from the tax net who should not be paying tax at all. While there are no PRSI contributions payable on the first £100, tax starts at £79 per week for a <Col N="511" /> single person.  A young single man or woman earning just £100 still pays nearly £6 in tax.  If the Minister had increased the tax free allowance by £1,000 instead of lavishing his resources on the better off, the threshold for entry to tax would have been over £90 and the tax burden on a person earning £100 would have been reduced to £2.50. There will be real anger among workers that the Minister did not begin a process of closing the gap between the average tax paid by farmers and PAYE workers, particularly as that gap is widening.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the only group singled out for attack by the Minister were the nurses, a soft target for a Minister for Finance in the strongest ever financial position.  The nurses were subjected to public abuse by the Minister for seeking a decent rate of pay for the job they do, while he not only had nothing to say about the failure of farmers to make a proportionate tax contribution to the Exchequer but lavished further goodies on them.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the average tax paid by a PAYE worker was £3,122, while that for a farmer was £804.  The 1989 tax take from a farmer represented 25.7 per cent of that of the PAYE worker and the gap between the two was £2,318. By 1996, the average tax paid by a PAYE worker had risen to £4,308 while that of a farmer was £1,028.  In the intervening seven years the tax take from the PAYE worker increased by £1,186, while that from a farmer grew by only £224.  The gap between the two payments increased in real terms to £3,280, while farmers' tax declined to 23.8 per cent of that of the PAYE worker.</P>
    <P>These tax payments bear no relationship to the income levels of the two groups and demonstrate once again the disproportionate share of the tax burden carried by PAYE workers and others. Over the years the gap between PAYE workers and the self-employed has been virtually closed but nothing has been done to address the reasons the contributions from farmers remain so minuscule.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are many farmers who earn very modest incomes.  I also acknowledge that part time farmers who have other jobs pay on the same basis as PAYE workers, as do many members of their families.  However, that does not explain the huge disparity in the tax take when the income from farming has increased consistently in recent years.  According to the report of the European Court of Auditors agriculture received £1.5 billion in EU aid in 1996.  However, this does not seem to have had any impact on the tax take.  The most recent household budget survey undertaken by the CSO shows that the average farm household disposable income in 1994-5 was £302.07 compared to £292.73 in urban areas.  According to the survey, farmers live in bigger, newer houses and own more cars and phones than their urban counterparts.  In these circumstances, the failure of the Minister to take any steps to ensure a fairer tax contribution from <Col N="512" /> the farming sector is almost beyond belief.  Will the Minister explain why only 2,000 of the 100,000 farmers are registered for value added tax?  This is active collusion by the Government in tax dodging by farmers.</P>
    <P>While the social welfare package has a number of welcome aspects, like the tax package it is a missed opportunity.  I welcome the continuity of the policy approach initiated by me in the family, child poverty, community development, pensions and poverty strategy areas.  The Minister's package is biased against those on the lowest levels of social welfare and the £3 increase fails to bring the lowest rates &mdash; SWA and short-term unemployment assistance &mdash; even up to the levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The £5 increase for old age pensioners is welcome and brings the contributory rate to almost 119 per cent of the commission target and the non-contributory rate to 104 per cent.  The tragedy is that for just £10 million, or half the money given to the GAA, all of the lowest social welfare rates could have been brought up to 100 per cent of the commission's recommended levels.</P>
    <P>The 3 per cent increase for qualified adults will mean fairly miserly amounts; for most it will mean about £1.20 per week.  The effect is to reduce these allowances as a percentage of the full rate, whereas the aim should be to increase them progressively towards 100 per cent.  They have fallen from 59 per cent to 58 per cent in most cases and from 65 per cent to 63 per cent in the case of old age pensioners.  We must move to a fairer way of ensuring that people who have no option but to depend on social welfare income have a reasonable standard of income.  Increases in social welfare should be linked to increases in average earnings and the review of the Commission on Social Welfare recommendations, initiated by me in Government, carried out by the ESRI and published last year, should be used as the appropriate reference point.  Linking increases to average earnings instead of inflation shows that none of the current rates reaches the targets set in the ESRI report.  There is still a long way to go before the living standards of all social welfare recipients can be said to have reached acceptable standards of adequacy.</P>
    <P>The Minister is guilty of a three card trick in regard to social welfare payments in that he has increased by almost two months the gap between the announcement of the new rates and their delivery.  The budget last year was at the end of January and the new payments came into operation in the first or second week of June.  This year the budget is two months earlier, but the increases have been brought forward by only one or two weeks.  Yet the increases in cigarettes and petrol come into effect immediately, or two months earlier than last year.</P>
    <P>One of the achievements which I regarded as most important in my term of office in the Department of Social Welfare was the increase <Col N="513" /> of almost 50 per cent in child benefit over three budgets.  Unfortunately, the Government does not seem to acknowledge the importance of child benefit as a weapon for combating child poverty, and the result is that for most children the increase will be just 35p per week, enough, as one commentator remarked this morning, to buy a bar of chocolate.  For those on social welfare the increase is barely enough to compensate for the freezing of the child dependant allowance element of their payment.  The Minister failed to deliver on the promise contained in the programme for Government of a £2,000 tax allowance for married people who stay at home to mind children.  Increased child benefit is a far better mechanism for helping parents to pay for child care or for compensating parents working full time in the home.</P>
    <P>Many of those working in the home as carers will be very disappointed with the budget.  There are more than 20,000 full time carers who do not, for a range of reasons, qualify for the allowance. Despite the commitment given in the programme for Government, nothing has been done to bring them into the system.  In 1996 carers got an extra £5 over and above the general increase, and other major improvements were made in both 1996 and 1997.  For £50 million, less than the cost of reducing the top rate of tax by 1 per cent, the Minister could have introduced a carer's benefit which would provide a social insurance payment in response to the growing need for full time care for older and incapacitated people.</P>
    <P>I am glad the process I started of moving the calculation of family income supplement onto a net income basis has been completed.  However, the fact that the thresholds have been increased by £7 per week, compared to £10 last year, means that many FIS recipients, who are not paying tax, will receive increases of only £4.20 per week, compared to £6 last year.  That means those in the higher range of incomes will receive considerably more, and this of course is in line with the general thrust of the budget, that the better off get most and the worst off get least.</P>
    <P>There is very little of significance in the budget on job creation and despite what he said last night, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, clearly believes that the long-term unemployed should be left primarily to the mercies of the rising tide philosophy.  I welcome the 5,000 extra places for the very successful back to work allowance scheme, but I regret there has been no similar increase in the number of community employment places.  These are the two most successful schemes, probably because they provide the incentive to the worker rather than the employer. The Government does not seem to have learned this lesson because it is putting money into the less successful schemes such as the jobs initiative and even introducing double tax relief for employers who take on the long-term unemployed, a scheme wide open to abuse and scams by unscrupulous employers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> Another group who will feel very let down are the handicapped.  The representatives of the physically handicapped who were invited to pose for pictures with the Minister for Finance will feel they were short-changed by the £3 million provided. At a time when there is so much money available, how can anyone possibly justify giving the mentally handicapped just £7 million, in view of the scale of the need for extra places and for respite care?  The National Association for the Mentally Handicapped in Ireland estimates that the total number of additional residential or respite places required is 1,439 and the number of day places required is 1,036.  The estimated cost is £63 million, of which £25 million is required in 1998.</P>
    <P>What sort of a value system can give £20 million to the GAA and just £7 million for the families of those with a mental handicap?  How does the Government justify giving an extra £20 million for the development of Croke Park?  Is it just a happy coincidence that it is located in the Taoiseach's constituency?  I am in favour of putting money into sport, but it should be put into the development of facilities for smaller clubs and for the benefit of players.  If this £20 million of taxpayers' money was to ensure access to Croke Park for a greater number of ordinary fans and for participants in other sports, it would be a positive development, but the money will presumably go to the development of yet more corporate boxes and catering and entertainment facilities in a stadium which, as it grows larger, is used for fewer and fewer matches and becomes less accessible to ordinary fans.  As I said on the Order of Business last Thursday, a reasonable <i>quid pro quo</i> from the GAA in return for such lavish support from the Exchequer would be the dropping of rule 21, which has been described so accurately by President McAleese as &lsquo;sectarian&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>The budget will be seen as a major lost opportunity. It was an opportunity to ensure the benefits of economic progress were shared more fairly, to significantly ease the burden on low and middle earners and to take many on low pay out of the tax net.  It was an opportunity to do something about the scandal of farmer taxation, to build on the work done by the previous Government in the social welfare area and particularly to continue to combat child poverty by a significant increase in child benefit.  It was an opportunity to recognise the real need of the mentally and physically handicapped.  The Minister chose to pass on those opportunities and instead to lavish much of the benefits of the economic boom on those who least need them.  The end result of the efforts of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance is a budget which has disappointed most taxpayers, annoyed the trade union movement, seriously jeopardised social partnership and snubbed those working for the inclusion of people with disabilities, while leaving the poor waiting.</P>
    <Col N="515" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the budget debate.  The economy continues to enjoy unparalleled levels of growth, with economic growth this year forecast at 8 per cent.  That growth results from the fact that people avail of a good education system, work hard and are professional in their approach to industry.  There has been spectacular success in the marketing area &mdash; being a small country, we must do business outside the island with the most competitive economies worldwide.  The outstanding performance in the past decade results essentially from the partnership role played by the social partners, workers, employers, trade unions and the Government.  I particularly laud the farming organisations which, together with the other social partners, played a constructive role during the past decade.</P>
      <P>The outlook for 1998 is promising, with inflation remaining at less than 2 per cent.  It is critical that, in line with the spectacular growth rate of the past decade, inflation is retained at a low level.  That should ensure another substantial increase in employment while allowing Ireland to comfortably qualify for entry into the EMU with an economy which is in a healthier condition than ever before.  The low levels of inflation and interest rates which Ireland continues to enjoy are of enormous benefit to farmers who save millions of pounds in interest payments on their borrowings. The low rates of interest payable on loans is highly conducive to facilitating investment.</P>
      <P>The CSO recently published advance figures which show that income from agriculture declined this year by 5.1 per cent, while there was a decline of 6 per cent in the value of gross agricultural output.  I have just listened to a savage attack on farmers, but despite the healthy economy the farming sector has experienced a serious setback, particularly since the outbreak of BSE in March 1996, the repercussions of which are still evident.  In its advance estimate the CSO announced that farm incomes declined across all sectors this year, with the beef sector being particularly badly hit.  We are aware of the difficulties being experienced by exporters and Bord Bia in promoting Irish beef abroad following the closure of market segments worldwide.  While the milk sector improved considerably during the year, overall it was not a particularly good year.</P>
      <P>Direct payments are now an important part of farmers' incomes, but some people begrudge them this income supplement.  It is compensation for cutbacks resulting from the supply-control philosophy that pertains in the EU.  The Department of Agriculture and Food is in the process of issuing direct payments to farmers, which in l997 will amount to £940 million.  Farmers are entitled to this payment, it is compensation for cutbacks in various quota regimes.  This £940 million is unprecedented and plays a substantial role in mitigating the fall in farm incomes.  Direct payments account for 40 per cent of their incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> As a result of the continuing recovery in consumption and reduced production, it is expected the serious imbalance in the EU beef market caused by the BSE crisis will be more or less corrected in l998.  Beef consumption has recovered well from l996 levels while measures introduced in the wake of the crisis, most notably the calf slaughtering scheme and the UK cattle cull, will reduce production by 500,000 tonnes per annum. The recovery in EU and world markets should have a knock on effect on Irish cattle prices which have been showing a gradual improvement in recent weeks.  The decline in intervention purchases, and their non-existence in continental member states for some time, is another positive signal.  However, the large stock of intervention beef, which stands at approximately 600,000 tonnes, is a serious threat to market stability. That stock is overhanging the market and will have to be disposed of within GATT limits on subsidised exports.</P>
    <P>While it should be possible to dispose of intervention stocks in the next few years, the market balance in l998 will not be sufficiently stable to enable any significant quantity to be sold without disturbing the market.  The Commission's policy on intervention stock disposal will therefore be a crucial factor in l998.  The Commission will need to be very careful and prudent regarding sales out of intervention, especially to third countries.  In addition, its policy on export refunds, in circumstances where GATT limits on subsidised exports fall further, will also be critical in determining prices for the coming year.  Prudent management of the EU market will be crucial for the period ahead.  I will insist that the Commission does not make hasty decisions in response to the disposal of intervention stock.</P>
    <P>The blockades at UK ports have caused serious problems for Irish beef exporters.  It is unacceptable that problems facing UK producers and the difficulties they are experiencing with their Government's policies should be translated into blockading trade from Ireland.  This view has been conveyed to the UK authorities at all levels, including at Prime Ministerial level.  I met the UK Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Jack Cunningham, on Thursday last to discuss the developments.  He assured me the behaviour of the producers in impeding Irish trade was illegal and unacceptable to his Government and that everything possible would be done to ensure the principles of the Single Market were upheld.  I am hopeful that the strong views conveyed to the UK will result in the lifting of an illegal restriction on our trade.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to unimpeded access to all parts of the EU for our products, which are of the highest standard.  They are not under-priced. We have been trading with the UK in an orderly manner for generations and the balance of trade favours the UK.  We purchase in excess of £6 billion worth of products per annum from the UK and export approximately £5.8 billion worth to it. The question of the blockades has been taken up at EU level with all the relevant commissioners <Col N="517" /> and I hope the matter will be resolved soon to everyone's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>By now both the UK authorities and the EU Commission should be fully aware of our position on the matter.  I have also asked Bord Bia to continue its efforts to affirm and project the role of Irish beef in the UK market and the high quality status of our product.  In a court in Luxembourg today the French authorities were chided for their ineffectiveness to ensure unimpeded trade between Spain and France.  A similar position pertains in respect of our trade with the UK and I am sure the UK authorities will note today's court finding against France.</P>
    <P>The outlook for 1998 in the dairy sector is positive. The indications are that strong commodity markets should be maintained into the early part of 1998.  For the year as a whole, the performance will depend on a number of factors, including the extent of the Russian demand, competition from the main dairy exporting countries and currency developments.  However, butter prices are unlikely to be maintained at the current very high levels as supply comes on stream later next year. Nevertheless, farmer incomes should stabilise as the benefits of the strong market are reflected in the milk price paid to producers.  I am optimistic about the dairy sector for 1998.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the sheep sector in 1998 is somewhat unclear at present.  Although lamb prices were quite buoyant throughout most of 1997, they have declined in the past two months as a result of a diminishing of our traditional French export market and a backlog of lamb on the UK market which is now being disposed of at low prices.  In addition, recent French lamb prices have also dropped.  On the other hand, there is a possibility of reduced Irish production in 1998 and this could go some way towards maintaining prices.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the pig sector for 1998 looks reasonable at this stage.  The overall supply position is expected to be satisfactory.  Prices are expected to remain stable in the short-term, but in the early part of 1998 some reduction could occur as those member states affected by classic swine fever are cleared of the disease and begin to get production back to normal, thereby increasing supply on the EU market.</P>
    <P>In the cereals sector, the level of production in the EU and in other production regions of the world will have implications for price levels here. In addition, quality and quantity of production is weather related.  However, with normal cropping conditions and a recovery in the quality of grain harvested there should be some improvement compared with 1997.</P>
    <P>Looking towards the outlook for the longer term, the greatest force for change in the agri-food sector over the next few years will be the European Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals. In relation to CAP, Agenda 2000 proposes reductions in price support, compensated for by increased direct payments.  It is proposed to reduce the support price by 30 per cent in the <Col N="518" /> beef sector, by 20 per cent in the cereal sector and by 10 per cent in dairy sector.</P>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 proposals presented by President Santer in July this year indicate the general direction and preferred policy options put forward by the Commission.  However, very detailed negotiations will take place over the next year or two before any final decisions are agreed. Throughout this process, I will strive to ensure the interests of our farmers and rural communities are fully protected.  This will involve ensuring full and permanent compensation for any price reductions, a fair and equitable compensation system that is vigorously defended in the next GATT round.</P>
    <P>To help ensure that Ireland's position in the forthcoming negotiations reflects the interests involved, I am in the process of setting up four consultative groups &mdash; one each for beef, milk, cereals and rural development &mdash; on which I will be inviting farmers, processors and others with a direct interest, as well as academics, to serve.  These groups will remain in existence for the duration of the negotiations and I expect an expert input from them so that the strongest possible case can be put in defence of Irish interests.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the 1998 budget will be of benefit to farmers, the rural community generally, and all sectors of society.  This budget provides for cuts in personal tax worth £517 million, while also increasing social welfare benefits by £282 million and providing for new expenditure items of £214 million.  It is remarkable that this is achieved while running a large current budget surplus and cutting debt as a percentage of our national income.</P>
    <P>We are now projecting general Government surpluses for each year to 2000 and a fall in the general Government debt from 67 per cent of GDP this year to 58 per cent in the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The budget is prudent in its treatment of the public finances, caring in its approach to the elderly and those on social welfare and provides the basis for continued strong growth in the economy. Our economy will grow by 8 per cent this year and next year, and employment will also grow by about 50,000 jobs per annum.  This benefits us all, in particular rural communities which deserve to get their fair share of the good growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>Many of the general taxation and social welfare changes in this year's budget will be of substantial benefit to farm families and rural dwellers and are worth highlighting.  Farmers will, like others, share the benefits of the radical personal income tax package introduced in this budget.  The 2 per cent cut in both the standard and higher rates of income tax, coupled with the increase in personal allowances, widening of tax bands and raising of the exemption limits will all contribute towards a substantial improvement in the after tax income of farmers this year.</P>
    <P>I strongly dispute the savage attack made on the farming community today by Democratic</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> Left.  Before the budget, Deputy Rabbitte called for a scourging of farmers in terms of taxation. Today, Deputy De Rossa stated, with some element of truth, that farmers were lavished with further goodies in the budget.  He added, however, that farmers' taxation had declined and that nothing had been done to address the minuscule taxation paid by farmers or tax dodging by farmers.  It is quite difficult to have to listen to such misinformed and uninformed comment.  The facts are that both this year and last year there was a decline in farm incomes.  While the Celtic tiger is performing extremely well, farmers are not participating in the general economic improvement to the extent that they should.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the rate of capital gains tax to 20 from 40 per cent will be of benefit to those who are retiring from farming and disposing of their assets.  Some farmers in co-op plc areas will particularly benefit from this improvement.</P>
    <P>The real increase in the weekly payment rates for all welfare categories, and in particular the large increase in payments to the elderly, will assist the most vulnerable members of the farming and rural community.  The substantial increase from 3.3 to 3.6 per cent in the farmer's flat-rate VAT will boost farm incomes by £8 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, the food industry and rural areas have fared very well in this budget.  Farmers and rural dwellers will, as I have said, benefit from the general reduction in personal and corporation tax rates and social welfare increases.  The budget has, in fact, put in place a coherent set of targeted measures designed to aid the long-term competitiveness of the sector.  This package of measures has three principal aims: accelerating the early transfer of farmland to younger farmers, protecting the rural environment and stimulating rural regeneration.</P>
    <P>In relation to younger farmers, I believe that the ability of the agricultural sector to compete successfully in the more challenging and liberal trading environment of the future depends crucially on the continued improvements in farm structures.  In recognition of the fact that the relatively high age profile of Irish farmers has been a persistent obstacle to structural change within the agricultural sector for many years, this budget has introduced some measures aimed specifically at the younger farming community.  These measures should make a significant contribution to speeding up the transfer of land to a younger and more productive generation of farmers.</P>
    <P>For example, in 1998 there will be an increase in funding for the farm retirement scheme of 17 per cent to over £71 million.  This should ensure that the target of participants by the year end will be achieved.</P>
    <P>As regards the scheme of installation aid for young farmers, I was glad that I was able to provide a budget allocation of £3.5 million to provide for all outstanding legitimate applications to be processed in 1997 and 1998.  In addition, I will be <Col N="520" /> starting discussions with the farming organisations very soon, with the aim of drawing up a new and tightly focused scheme of installation aid targeted towards smaller farmers.  This will be financed from within the overall allocation approved by the Government for my Department.</P>
    <P>Stock relief is an important mechanism in allowing farmers to direct scarce resources to productive on-farm investment in stock and facilities. Full stock relief for young trained farmers was introduced in 1995, but only allowed young farmers to avail of the full relief for two years after qualification.  In this budget that has now been increased to four years.</P>
    <P>Another new measure which has been introduced relates to capital gains tax retirement relief.  This concession exempts farm disposals under £250,000 from capital gains tax (CGT).  It is a central policy aim of my Department to encourage older farmers to avail of the early retirement scheme.  The scheme is popular and being availed of in a major way.  There was a difficulty, however, regarding leased land which led to a situation where, under capital gains tax law, they were not eligible to avail of retirement relief because of a requirement that they operate the farm for a ten-year period prior to retirement. Thus, they often found themselves facing hefty tax demands.  I am pleased we were able to address that matter in the budget.</P>
    <P>These new measures will complement other provisions already in place to encourage the earlier transfer of land to a younger generation of farmers, for example, the two thirds reduction in stamp duty allowed on farm transfers to younger farmers, the tax exemption allowable on leasing income, 90 per cent agricultural relief under capital acquisitions tax law, and a 30 per cent reduction in the amount payable in probate tax.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the 1998 budget to increase the level of expenditure which can be written off under the special farm pollution control allowance against farming profits from £20,000 to £30,000.  This will be extremely helpful in maintaining the environment in rural areas.</P>
    <P>All these measures will contribute to more sustainable farming practices, increased efficiency, improved pasture and income effects.  They will also indirectly benefit the agri-food industry, tourism and the economy generally through the reduction in water treatment costs as a result of reductions in pollution and fish kills.</P>
    <P>The importance of the environment was, of course, recognised in the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry, which established schemes for the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene.  These schemes, although unfortunately suspended by the previous Government due to lack of Structural Funds, have paid out £97 million and £18 million, respectively, to date.  I assure the House that all applications on hand will be processed.</P>
    <P>The REP scheme has also made a significant contribution to improving the rural environment. <Col N="521" /> Currently over one million hectares of land are being farmed in accordance with the environmental conditions required by REPS.  In 1998 a further £45 million will be made available towards REPS, bringing total expenditure to £145 million for the year.  By the end of 1998 over 40,000 farmers will be participating in REPS.  This exceeds the targets set when the scheme was announced.  I am confident that the measures described above will help to make a significant and lasting contribution to the protection of our rural environment in the years ahead.  In the area of rural regeneration we are carrying out a pilot scheme which hopefully will grow over the years.</P>
    <P>One of the most important contributors to the maintenance of rural incomes is the headage payments scheme.  As Deputies are aware, headage is funded under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, which covers the period 1994 to 1999.  The position on funding is that approximately 72 per cent of our overall allocation under the operational programme will be spent by the end of this year. On the headage side, expenditure will probably also be as high as 72 per cent of the amount allocated for that item by end of 1997, with the result that an inadequate provision of only £88 million was made available in the 1998 Estimates.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that substantial cuts would have to be made to individual farmers, many with very low incomes, if we had to live with the funds available.  I am equally aware, however, that several independent evaluations, including the recent evaluation carried out by the ESRI as part of the mid-term evaluation for the CSF for 1994-9, have pressed for some reductions in this type of income support and for a reallocation of such expenditure to more developed investment.  I have to admit that the estimated overall expenditure in headage of £489 million by the end of December, for the 1994-7 period, is indeed very high as a proportion of the total Structural Funds expenditure available for agricultural purposes, that is, 60 per cent.  I feel that both of these somewhat opposing aspects of the headage scheme can now be tackled.  As already announced by the Minister for Finance, £23 million in extra funding has been provided to help plug the gap in the available funding for 1998.  This will bring the total allocation for 1998 to approximately £111 million and, after certain provisions already agreed under Partnership 2000 have been effected which will enable the scheme to be targeted better at lower income farmers, the revised amount available should be adequate to meet all requirements under the headage scheme for 1998.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions will provide a new ceiling of £3,024 on headage payments which will affect 4,000 farmers or 4.5 per cent of headage applicants. The vast majority of them are in receipt of payments under EU livestock premium schemes with average annual payments in excess of £12,000 each.  The applicants involved each receive an average total payment of £15,702 in headage and premia grants.  To restrict headage <Col N="522" /> payment to £3,024 for this minority of farmers will entail an overall reduction of £659 or 4.2 per cent and they will still receive substantial other payments.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce that I am arranging a top-up on 1997 sheep headage payments &mdash; which will particularly help mountain sheep farmers &mdash; valued at £2.6 million to 30,000 sheep farmers in disadvantaged areas who must eke out a living in most difficult circumstances.  Payments will be made immediately and will raise the 1997 sheep headage rates to £11 for mountain breeding ewes and £12 for hogget ewes.  This will provide welcome additional support for the sheep farmers in those most severely handicapped areas.</P>
    <P>Leader groups have made an invaluable contribution towards encouraging local enterprise and community development over the past number of years.  The 1998 allocation for Leader will increase from £11 million to almost £21 million, an increase of 84 per cent and it is well deserved.</P>
    <P>The food industry, and agribusiness generally, will also benefit along with every other industrial sector from the general easing of the tax burden in this budget.  The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 36 per cent to 32 per cent and from 28 per cent to 25 per cent on the first £50,000 of company income will reduce tax on non-manufacturing activities.  This reduction is the first step in the Government's move towards a single 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax by the year 2005, or earlier.</P>
    <P>Companies in this sector will also benefit from the large reduction in the tax wedge which will be achieved by the new income tax and PRSI rates for employees.  A new initiative to help the long-term unemployed back to work was also launched in the budget and a double tax deduction for wages for employers who employ long-term unemployed persons was granted.  This double deduction can last for up to three years and participants in the scheme can retain their secondary benefits.  This will be of assistance to agri-food businesses as it will reduce significantly the cost of recruiting and employing people in their firms.  The reduction in the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent will also be of benefit to agribusiness, encouraging greater levels of investment in the economy.  This will particularly benefit companies where farmers are members.</P>
    <P>Additional incentives for investment, employment and enterprise provided in the budget should provide a significant boost for small, medium and large food companies.  These companies are a key element of the rural economy and the incentives will therefore have widespread spin-off benefits throughout rural Ireland, particularly in the form of more jobs for rural young people.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the general and specific measures in the budget which I have just outlined will provide a major boost to the agri-food sector. They demonstrate the Government's strong commitment to the farming sector and to rural communities <Col N="523" /> in general, many of whom are built around, and dependent upon, a vibrant farming sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before analysing the budget I propose to make a few general introductory remarks.  I am pleased to be able to comment on the budget but deeply disappointed with its content. On a radio programme last week, I heard Fr. Séan Healy of CORI describe it as the worst budget for 15 years and he is correct.  His detailed analysis, a copy of which all Members have, makes that clear.  He states:</P>
      <P>As a result of budget '98 the take home pay of the better off will increase substantially.  The tax payable by employers on their profits will be reduced.  The tax burden will be moved away from profits in the long-term and the major resources in agriculture will continue going to the better off.  There is something profoundly wrong with this society when it fails to give priority to tackling poverty, unemployment and exclusion.  This Government could have targeted these three core issues.  It chose instead to prioritise benefits for the better off. This may fatten the Celtic Tiger but it is not progress.  Substantial resources exist, yet these resources were dissipated.</P>
      <P>Other commentators have shown similarly dismissive reactions towards the budget.  It was sad to see Mr. Clear, president of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, come out so strongly against the failure of the Minister for Finance's first budget and he again drew attention to the fact that it has exacerbated social divisions in society, widened the gaps between segments of it and, in general, abused the massive resources which were there for the taking by a caring Government which would want to narrow such gaps.</P>
      <P>One of my constituents, <i>Sunday Business Post</i> journalist, Emily O'Reilly, blamed it on the fact that the Labour Party unfortunately was not in Government with Fianna Fáil.  Had it been in Government with the larger party, as was the case a number of years ago, this despicable Progressive Democrats Party agenda would not have emerged.  Perhaps that is a simplistic view, and she has changed her mind about different issues over the years, but it reflects how many people on the street feel about it.  Many other commentators, including my party's financial spokesperson, Deputy McDowell, described it as the most regressive budget in living memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a moral obligation on every Minister for Finance on budget day.  He or she should analyse serious problems facing the country and attempt to the best of his or her ability to resolve them but on this key criteria the Minister failed dismally.  On reflection, he did not even try to face that problem.  I have seen Ministers for Finance in much more trying circumstances than those faced by Deputy McCreevy make a decent fist at producing a budget for all people.  His error <Col N="524" /> is that he inherited the best set of economic figures in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> is pleased and so it should be.  My views on the vulgarity of its preelection editorial, &ldquo;It's Payback Time&rdquo; are well known.  It has had its way and I hope it has the courage of its convictions next April when ordinary working people reading the rubbish of budget 1998 realise that the reality does not live up to the hype.</P>
    <P>With the amount of money at the Minister's disposal it would have been impossible, even for him, not to get a few things right.  I welcome the decision to increase the old age pension by £5, although the increase in dependant allowances is worse than in the previous budget.  I welcome also the increase in the tax exemption limits for those over 65, an initiative begun by my party leader in January.  A number of senior citizens who are under 65 but are retired and opt to be taxed at the marginal rate are bitterly disappointed with the sum of £100 which they received from the Minister.  It seems as if he did not even consider those people and their circumstances.  One told me that his net addition from the budget works out at less then £1 per week.</P>
    <P>For all the bravado of the Taoiseach earlier in the debate, the child benefit package is dreadful and completely wrong.  Child benefit has been identified as the best way of tackling family poverty since it is universal and untaxed.  During the two periods in which the Labour Party was in Government, recently, with other parties, we wanted to boost child benefit.  We had a target of approximately £20 per child per week as being what we should aim for.  In a dismal reaction the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, was not prepared to develop that idea, except in relation to the small improvement for twins.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with the social welfare system is the extent to which we rely on means tests.  Means tests by definition create welfare and poverty traps.  Child benefit is the one basic payment which bypasses this problem.  The increase this year is about 6 per cent.  Labour, in Government, increased this payment by almost 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is precisely because of the problem of the interaction of our welfare and tax systems that I wish to return to the issue of tax.  This is perhaps the most central difficulty facing our economy.  It is partly responsible for confining a sizeable proportion of our people to relative poverty.  It helps to perpetuate cycles of disadvantage, lack of opportunity and powerlessness.  Its effect is communities deprived of life and energy, communities destroyed by drugs and crime.  Despite all Fianna Fáil's rhetoric, neither of these issues was considered as important as the refurbishment of Croke Park to warrant a specific mention in the budget.</P>
    <P>We have a moral duty to tackle the key problem of disadvantage in society.  It will require us to undertake considerable programmes of investment to undo the damage done for over a generation. <Col N="525" /> The budget contained little or nothing on this issue.  Other important issues such as the quality of our training programmes &mdash; the real bridge between opportunity and lack of it &mdash; hardly warrant a mention.</P>
    <P>As a starting point it is critical that our tax system does not act as an impediment to other measures we need to take.  Some progress has been made in recent years but this year was the appropriate time to do something substantial in terms of allowances and it was not done.  What would have been the reaction of our constituents if the Minister had the courage to use the £517 million to increase personal allowances?  We know the impact that could have had, especially on the lower paid.  That opportunity was not taken because Fianna Fáil cares more about staying in power with the Progressive Democrats than it does about much of its traditional support base. This will become clear in the forthcoming by-elections in Dublin North and Limerick East.</P>
    <P>The decision not to substantially increase the standard tax rate band is similarly immoral.  It has been said time and again that the issue is not that the middle income earner pays tax at 48 per cent or 46 per cent but that they pay tax at the top rate.  A single person earning over £13,000 pays tax at the same rate as a millionaire.  That is a central problem which the Minister did not bother to look at.  The Government has not sought to do anything meaningful about that problem.  This is an issue on which the previous Administration made substantial progress.  This Government has chosen to ignore it and the effects are devastating as example 1 of the implications of this budget amply illustrates.</P>
    <P>Put simply, this has been a terrible budget for middle income earners.  Not only have they been discriminated against in the distribution of the tax dividend but the basic services on which they rely more than others, have suffered also.</P>
    <P>Take for example the health system.  The Estimate provides for a 10 per cent increase but most of this will go on the public service pay bill and the hepatitis C payments, both of which I fully support.  Those aside, the increase for the supply of basic services is paltry.  There were little additional moneys in the budget &mdash; the £36 million supplied represents only a 1 per cent in the Department's overall budget of over £3 billion. For the first time in years, there has been no specific allocation to tackle the waiting lists which have been growing in the past few months. Obviously the intention of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, to re-jig the waiting lists will be a comprehensive project and we await with interest what he tries to deliver as the waiting lists grow longer.  This is an area to which I hope to return later in my speech.</P>
    <P>I am deeply disappointed at this budget.  In the mid-1980s, to dream of a society in which each citizen had an opportunity to live a meaningful and fulfilling life was often subjected to ridicule. That is no longer the case but rather to try to work to make that vision a reality the Government <Col N="526" /> has chosen to reward those who are well off.  It is a mindless decision it will regret.</P>
    <P>In my introductory remarks on budget day, I referred to the Minister for Finance as a gambler, who had got his fundamental sums wrong.  I said he was also a chartered accountant and that he knew the implications of the basic background budgetary arithmetic.  He knew what he was doing when he took several significant payments from the 1998 financial year back to 1997.  All my former colleagues in the teaching profession will be interested to know their January salaries are being paid out of the 1997 budget.  The same was done with the higher education grants and across a range of measures.  This Minister for Finance effectively fiddled the books.</P>
    <P>On budget day the Minister talked about Government spending and the EBR increasing by 3.8 per cent, an EBR of £280 million, 0.7 per cent of GNP and the 1998 EBR of £89 million.  This was all fantasy, figures were being plucked out of the air.  If the Government was a large company and an accountancy firm examined the figures, there is no question but that they would have to be qualified.  Somebody might have said the figures require explanation.  Will our colleagues on the Committee of Public Accounts deem it necessary next year to look at the budget again?</P>
    <P>There was a famous budget in the early 1980s when the Department of Finance got its background figures so hopelessly wrong that many commentators, in particular Vincent Browne, accused the then Taoiseach and Minister for Finance &mdash; who went on to become an MEP or a Commissioner in Europe &mdash; of cooking the books.  Given the general projections for 1998-9 effectively that is what the Minister has done.  In addition to doing that and not living up to the basic precepts of his own profession of accountancy, there is also the problem that he is gambling on the Celtic tiger.  As one who did a study on and taught economics, it is interesting to read the projections by commentators in the 1970s and the 1980s which are so dreadfully wrong.  In that context we have seen the situation in relation to the first dragons.  Only the other day I was reading <i>The Economist</i> projections for 1993 which had a special article about the little tigers of southeast Asia.  It showed how the Malaysians and the Indonesians were beginning to join the bigger tigers led by the great Japan itself.  Problems have now emerged, some caused by nature, for example, the fires in parts of Indonesia and so on which drifted across Malaysia and caused different types of problems.  Nobody can foretell what can happen in economic terms.</P>
    <P>When we lock into the euro on 1 May there will be significant implications for domestic industry.  As the Labour Party spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Employment I hope to tease out with the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, what they propose to do to protect our domestic industry as we go into that regime, which will give us significantly less control over our affairs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> The Minister has gambled that the present trend will continue.  He referred to a minor contingency fund.  The interesting point was made at the Committee of Public Accounts that Government commitments should be insured because the cost of claims can be significant.  I cite the equality payments, hepatitis C compensation payments and Army hearing claims as examples.  In fiddling the figures the Minister has gambled with our future.</P>
    <P>The Minister berated and lambasted public servants. Was he referring to clerical assistants, ushers or nurses who are on extremely modest rates of pay?  I appreciate there are difficulties in implementing the strategic management initiative but one cannot encourage public servants to be ambitious and at the same time berate them in respect of the 6 per cent increase in the public service pay bill.  It was the Labour Party that forced Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to honour the promises they made in their manifestos to public service pensioners.  We were victorious in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play of the size of the overall social welfare budget in which provision was made for social inclusion measures.  In throwing back at the Opposition its own Sunday trading Bill, in refusing to provide for the introduction of a minimum wage to which it is opposed in spite of the commitments given in the manifestos and in opposing trade union recognition and representation, the Government is endangering the concept of social partnership and Partnership 2000.  I do not think our trade union colleagues, Bill Attley and Jimmy Somers of SIPTU who have spoken out about this matter, are bluffing. By flagrantly adopting the Progressive Democrats' programme Fianna Fáil may end up breaking the partnership.  If that happens the Government will be opposed relentlessly by all the representatives of the labour movement.  It is on shaky ground.</P>
    <P>I welcome the steps taken by the Minister but the level of many payments, particularly the single rate of unemployment assistance paid to the long-term unemployed which currently stands at £67, is still too low.  Those who will benefit from the reduction in capital gains tax by 50 per cent could spend more than the amount mentioned on a single meal.  There is no point talking about the Commission on Social Welfare which reported ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase granted to the elderly but the decision on child benefit was disgraceful. The increase is miserly.  It broke the momentum generated by the Labour Party first with Fianna Fáil and later with Fine Gael and Democratic Left.  According to <i>The Economist</i>, in an international comparison we have overtaken New Zealand on <i>per capita</i> income and the United Kingdom in some areas.  Yet, the opportunity was squandered to help the 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the population dependent on social welfare <Col N="528" /> who account for less than 10 per cent of the projected budget for next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister was taken prisoner by the Progressive Democrats.  There were rumours in the mid-1980s that he was about to join them.  Perhaps he has the same mindset.  The four Progressive Democrats Members have taken over the 76 Fianna Fáil Members which is remarkable.  As the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, is aware this happens in business where small companies take over large ones.  Former Member Michael McDowell berated the rainbow coalition Government and referred constantly to its tax and spend programme.  Fianna Fáil has surrendered to him. His spirit hovers over it.  He has won the battle and the ideological argument.  The selfish agenda of the Progressive Democrats has won the day.</P>
    <P>I am enraged at the carer's allowance provisions. Like all other Deputies, I have received representations about the means test. A constituent of mine has reared two sons with muscular dystrophy.  She was in receipt of the old domiciliary allowance until they reached the age of 16 years.  She has received nothing since even though she had to stay with them in school to bring them to the toilet and has seen them through college. The Government has effectively told her and the many other unpaid heroes and heroines to get lost for another year.</P>
    <P>The health budget has been increased by 1 per cent.  Constituents of mine were delighted to receive appointments in one of the major hospitals in Dublin in mid-1998 and early 1999. In an interesting report in <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> I think by Martin Wall, it was indicated that in recent years people had died while awaiting urgent heart bypass surgery.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, cannot be happy.  If it all ends in tears both he and the Minister for Finance may be rivals in a Fianna Fáil leadership contest. What has happened to the waiting list initiative for which millions of pounds are needed?</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday we all wore yellow and blue ribbons, the colours of the Progressive Democrats, to mark national disability day.  This was ironic given their impact on the budget.  The Minister boasted about the types of measures he had taken in that regard.  Certainly on the north side of the city there is enormous need for the provision of residential care and support services for adults with learning disabilities.</P>
    <P>Formerly many of their parents, now senior citizens, struggled with the help of organisations such as St. Michael's House over some 20 to 25 years but they now experience great difficulty in coping with such disabilities, in respect of which the princely sum of £7 million is being provided. I am proud of what the preceding Government, of which my party was a member, did in that regard and its emphasis on catering for the disabled. During the general election I was asked by many members of the public why our Government had not implemented the recommendations of the report of the Commission on Disability. <Col N="529" /> This budget does nothing whatever to advance the cause of the disabled.  What is the point in establishing a national authority on disability if one is not prepared to invest appropriate amounts for that purpose, whether for those with learning disabilities, personal assistance for those with severe physical handicap or others?</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures announced for the benefit of the long-term unemployed, particularly the additional tax allowance for employers who recruit people from that category.  Nonetheless, it is a very small effort when viewed within the context of the huge overall problem of the unemployed. There is a miserly increase in the community employment provision within the Vote for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The commitment of 50,000 places in community employment schemes under Partnership 2000 has been totally abandoned.  The comments of the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on the Government reaching a social inclusion budget within two years rather than three were a load of rubbish.  The rainbow Government promised the social partners to provide 50,000 places to help people back into full-time employment but nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>The miserable increase of approximately 9 per cent in funding for health and safety measures within the Vote of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was also deplorable. Effectively the Minister acknowledged during Question Time today that many building sites in this city are not inspected before construction begins.  We do not have safety plans but instead a very lethargic health and safety regime.  Let us hope that that fact does not return to haunt this House, which is responsible through the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the high level of injury and deaths, particularly on construction sites but in other areas also.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I asked the Taoiseach what were his intentions in respect of the capital city for the forthcoming millennium.  As the House will be aware, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown all have interesting plans on how to co-operate in celebrating the second millennium.  I might remind the House that nearly 2000 years ago Ptolemy noted that Dublin existed, under the famous title of Eblana, but nothing has been provided in this budget for any such celebration.</P>
    <P>However, there is a provision of £20 million for redevelopment of Croke Park, which will be to the benefit of those who play and follow Gaelic football, the only game I ever played with distinction and for which I retain a deep and abiding affection.  Since it would appear the proposal is to build a national Olympic-type stadium on the north side of the city, our citizens competing at the highest levels should have access to its facilities. Without going into the boring history of the Gaelic Athletic Association and its relationship with other sports or sporting organisations, I <Col N="530" /> might point out that, whereas the Taoiseach earlier indicated that such access would be made available, over the weekend we discovered that he had slipped in the figures, leaving the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation embarrassed, since he was unaware of the fact and about the provision of £20 million for Croke Park.  Yet he is supposed to be the Minister with responsibility for sport generally.</P>
    <P>I had also requested the Taoiseach, as part of the millennium celebrations in respect of our parks and open spaces, with particular emphasis on the area which is the responsibility of Dublin Corporation, to draw up a major environmental plan for Dublin.  This he has refused absolutely to date.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that, on the matter of taxation, the Government followed the Progressive Democrats' agenda in reducing the prevailing rates of income tax rather than broadening the bands.  I was very disappointed at the lack of any action on the overall matter of tax evasion, about which the Minister for Finance made a few perfunctory remarks.  It would appear that a significant proportion of the increased taxation yield over recent years has been accounted for by the greater efficiency with which Mr. Cathal Mac-Dómhnaill, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, and his team work in Dublin Castle. Particularly in this, the year of the famous Ansbacher accounts and various other allegations about big business, I should have thought the Minister had greater scope and I would have expected more action on this matter.</P>
    <P>I was also disappointed that the Minister for Finance saw fit to reduce corporation tax.  He had an opportunity of helping smaller businesses, particularly through increasing the £50,000 limit, but instead he gave the huge players within our economy, especially the large banks, an enormous boost.</P>
    <P>This budget was based on false figures and its provisions gamble with our future.  It is a litany of missed opportunities and was rightly criticised by organisations such as CORI, the St. Vincent de Paul Society and others.  I hope the missed opportunities of Wednesday last will not return to haunt this Government.</P>

      <P>We in Fianna Fáil always have been the party of care, understanding the hospital needs of our people, especially those most in need of care.  This side of the House will not be found wanting over the next five years.  As all parties do, we have presented a programme for Government, in co-operation of our partners in Government, which will take us into the next millennium, giving us a full five year tenure of office.  Members opposite can be assured that they will remain lonely for quite some time to come.</P>
      <P>Turning to the specifics of the personal taxation and social welfare provisions of this budget, they will go a long way towards reducing the tax burden on all taxpayers while protecting the most vulnerable sectors of our society.  For example, the personal tax allowance of a single person was increased by £250 to £3,150 and that of a married couple by £500 to £6,300, and the income tax exemption limit raised by £100 to £4,100 in the case of a single person and by £200 to £8,200 in the case of a married couple under 65 years of age, with higher increases for those over that age. I have heard nobody complain about those provisions.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance also announced significant reductions in both the standard and higher rates of income tax, the former being cut by 2 per cent to 24 per cent and the latter from 48 per cent to 46 per cent.  Many taxpayers had waited many years for these cuts.  The PAYE sector is more than delighted with this development.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Minister proposed a reduction in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent which will benefit the housing market.  Bearing in mind its present buoyant state, investors may be encouraged to dispose of their extra properties, incurring a lesser amount of capital gains tax in that process while the resultant increase in the housing stock will lead to price stabilisation in the market.  This capital gains tax reduction may also act as a catalyst by increasing activity on the Dublin Stock Exchange, as henceforth investors may view capital gains tax as somewhat less of an inhibitor when considering investing in share capital.</P>

      <P>With regard to agricultural income in 1997, as Minister Walsh indicated a short time ago, the first official estimate of income in 1997 was released by the Central Statistics Office yesterday.  In that release, farm incomes are estimated to have declined by 5.1 per cent this year.  Before going on to deal with some of the main issues arising from this estimate, it might be appropriate to put the current estimate for agricultural incomes in context by examining the growth of incomes over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard, agricultural incomes increased each year from 1991 to 1996, with an overall increase of 36 per cent over the period, or 22 per cent in real terms.  During this period farmers also benefited from the fall in interest rates which has led to a sharp fall in interest payments by farmers from £228 million in 1992 to £167 million last year.  This saving of over £60 million per annum, which is not included in the CSO's income figures, will be maintained as interest rates remain low.  EMU is also expected to deliver further benefits in this regard and will be very good for agriculture.  We hope that day is coming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, however, income in the agricultural sector has declined by 5.1 per cent, while gross agricultural output declined by 6 per cent in value.  The decline was spread across all of the main commodities, and arose mainly as a result of reduced prices in 1997 as compared to 1996.  The main factors involved in these output declines include world and EU market price developments and the impact of revaluation on export refunds and intervention prices, as well as actual cuts in export refund rates.  They also included continuing BSE difficulties in the cattle <Col N="533" /> sector, as many of our traditional export outlets either remained closed entirely or provided us with a greatly restricted market.</P>
      <P>Farming remains vital to the economic and social well-being of rural communities, and to Ireland in general.  The importance of this sector is acknowledged by special provisions in the budget in relation to my Department's expenditure for 1998, and by specific taxation measures targeted at farmers.</P>
      <P>Following the budget, the gross Estimate for my Department for 1998 has increased by £13.5 million to £748 million &mdash; another record for expenditure on agriculture and food.  Total expenditure, including FEOGA guarantee expenditure which is not included in the Vote, will be approximately £2 billion in 1998.  This expenditure will be run on an administrative budget of under £120 million, that is approximately 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>The headage scheme, as Deputies are aware, makes an important contribution to farm incomes in disadvantaged areas.  The budget has provided an additional £23 million for headage payments in 1998.  This is to supplement the earlier estimate of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The budget provided an additional £3.5 million to meet existing commitments under the scheme of installation aid for young farmers.  This should enable all outstanding legitimate applications to be processed.  More importantly for the future, as Minister Walsh has already announced, we have secured the agreement of the Minister for Finance to draw up a revised scheme of installation aid which will be more tightly focused and targeted towards smaller farmers.  Discussions with the farm organisations to design such a scheme will begin in the near future.  Other key areas for expenditure in 1998 will be the beef assurance scheme, REPS, farm retirement and Leader.</P>
      <P>A sum of £6.5 million is being provided for the beef assurance scheme.  Our beef industry is worth in excess of £1 billion to our economy.  It is vital, therefore, that we have a proper beef assurance scheme in place and that we can protect existing markets without fear or favour.</P>
      <P>As the largest exporter of beef in the northern hemisphere, Irish beef is our flagship agricultural commodity.  However, as witnessed last week, two major developments served to focus the attention of the public and the media on the role of beef in our daily lives.  The first was an attack on our exports at British ports, due to the exemplary international reputation we hold as a beef producing country, which culminated in violent disruption of this trade by UK farmers.  British farmers demanded justice and fair play concerning beef prices and stated that Irish farmers should not take their actions personally, but did they consider for one moment the livelihoods of our producers and hauliers?  Many hauliers telephoned me to complain they were not allowed travel to France and had to turn back.  That is unacceptable when we have all signed up to the free movement of trade.</P>

      <P>The second development was a statement by Dr. Jack Cunningham, the British Minister for Agriculture, responding to a report by SEAC, a British Government scientific agency, which showed that in some conditions BSE agents could exist in bone marrow and nerve endings inside the bones of BSE infected cattle.  It must be stated again that BSE controls in Ireland, which involve the slaughter of complete herds in which a BSE case is found as well as the slaughter of cohort animals, are substantially different to those rules that apply in the UK.  Consumer safety is the hallmark of Irish Government policy. The setting up of a Food Safety Authority is further testament to this fact.  I compliment the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, on his action last week in protecting the health and safety of Irish people.</P>
      <P>We should draw a salutary lesson from last week's events, namely, that our beef is the best and we must support and protect the industry, thereby protecting farm incomes and maintaining consumer confidence.</P>

      <P>We have 120,000 beef producers and their product is vital to the economy. Furthermore, we must put standards in place so as to afford consumers maximum confidence in their beef purchases.  We are determined to do business on this side, and do it right.  Accordingly, my Department shall undertake to implement a quality assurance scheme for beef that will marry the concepts of animal traceability and integrated standards applying to all parties in the industry. Notwithstanding the scale of this operation, and via legislation, officials at the Department will have this mandatory scheme up and running next year.</P>
      <P>The sum of £6.5 million will enable the Department to create a fully computerised system for identification of cattle and monitoring of all cattle movements.  This will enable the life history of the animal to be verified at slaughter.  Work is advancing on this aspect of the scheme.  It will enable it to conduct a full cattle census to act as a baseline for the above system; develop integrated production and processing protocols applicable to all parties involved in the production chain; enforce the protocols by introducing a national registration and approval process covering all parties in the production chain; and publicise and promote the benefits and obligations of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cattle and beef industry is of vital importance to the national economy.  This scheme will underpin the safety of beef and beef products, <Col N="535" /> provide further assurance to consumers and further restore consumer confidence in the wake of the BSE crisis, thereby enhancing the marketability of Irish beef at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the food industry for which I have special responsibility.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, made the point at the Kerry Co-Op opening yesterday that good progress is being made under the current development strategy for the food industry.  The strategy's aim is to maximise the industry's contribution to national wealth and employment.  It covers the period 1994 to 1999 and the targets set are ambitious.</P>
    <P>While all segments are contributing to the industry's growth, the performance of the value-added prepared consumer foods and ingredients sectors has been particularly encouraging.  The value of output in the two sectors increased by 13 per cent and 11 per cent respectively in 1996. Both sectors have also contributed to the employment created in the food industry which has exceeded expectations.  An estimated 7,500 gross jobs were created in the period 1994 to 1996 as against an annual average target of 2,000.  In the case of exports, the outturn for 1996 was close to the previous year's level.  The significant features were the decline in beef exports due to BSE problems and substantial increases in consumer foods and ingredients exports.  At yesterday's meeting I commended the Minister who spoke about competitiveness in the dairy sector.  He said we should not become over reliant on bulk commodities and we should move to more consumer orientated products in the dairy sector.  That is the direction the industry must take and it is my job to drive it in that direction in the future.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that 1997 has witnessed an improvement in the beef export trends and the overall results for the year should be very satisfactory. However, strategies cannot stand still. They must respond to changing circumstances.  In the case of the food development strategy, I am satisfied that the changes made in the recent mid-term review of Structural Funds were correct. Those changes involved a redistribution of funding to areas such as farmyard pollution and a new research, technology and innovation measure which will benefit, either directly or indirectly, the food industry.  They also place an increased emphasis on health and food safety while, in the area of human resources, they provide that programmes addressing world class manufacturing techniques and improvements in delivery to customers will receive priority.</P>
    <P>The changes made in the mid-term review of Structural Funds recognise that innovation and a responsiveness to market needs will continue to be critical factors for the food industry.  They also emphasise that future growth must be under-pinned by the highest health and food safety standards. These aspects will be borne in mind in developing the post-1999 strategy for the industry. Obviously, there will be many other influences <Col N="536" /> such as the outcome of negotiations on future Structural Funds.  My Department will continue its work with the industry and the relevant State agencies to ensure that the new plan maximises the contribution of the industry to the overall economy.</P>
    <P>The budget contained a number of innovative measures which will be of great help to agri-business companies.  The rates of corporation tax have been significantly cut.  I understand my remaining time is to be shared with the Minister of State, Deputy Flood.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide the necessary investment to upgrade the national railway network with continuous welded rail, automatic signalling and adequate rolling stock to ensure a safe, reliable and efficient public transport service.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this debate is to refocus the Government's priorities to ensure there is a completion of the investment plan in the development of our railways.  The background to this motion is that under a co-financed EU National Investment Programme the railway lines from Belfast, Mullingar, Galway, Limerick, Tralee, Cork and Waterford, respectively, to Dublin have all been or are in the process of being modernised. However, three national radial routes have no such investment programme: Dublin to Rosslare, Mullingar to Sligo and west of Athlone through Claremorris to Westport and Ballina.  It is estimated that the cost of providing continuous welded rail, concrete sleepers instead of the wooden ones and automatic signalling on these routes is approximately £85 million.  That is comprised of approximately £25 million on the Dublin-Rosslare line, £30 million on the Ballina-West-port line west of Athlone and £25 million to £30 million to complete the Dublin Sligo line from Mullingar to Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental choice facing the Government is to gradually close down or modernise those lines.  The Government cannot have it both ways.  It cannot maintain regional access to those provincial towns with a less safe, less reliable service than is deemed appropriate by the relevant experts. <Col N="537" /> This issue has been put into sharp focus by the recent accident at Knockcroghery in County Roscommon. Thankfully and fortunately there were no fatalities.  If the accident had been a couple of 100 metres further along the route or if there had been a full load of passengers, as is common at the weekend, the outcome might not have been so fortuitous.  I greatly fear that, unless there is a modernisation programme on the network, further accidents are waiting to happen.  That is because many of those routes were originally constructed in the middle of the 19th century and were last modernised in the 1930s.  It is conventionally accepted that a rule of thumb life expectancy of those jointed tracks is of the order of 50 years.  Metal fatigue at the fishplates requires daily inspection under the present outdated track facilities.  Where the fishplate wears off there can easily be a derailment.</P>
    <P>Over the last five years there have been nine derailments.  One of these was caused by a broken spring in one of the carriages and, therefore, was not track related.  Of the remaining eight, all occurred on jointed track.  Last Sunday evening at 8.20 p.m. there was a further freight related accident on the Athy-Carlow route.  It involved a freight train and fortunately no one was injured. Will the Minister tell us what she knows about that accident and the outcome of the early indications of the probe into it?  I understand that the rail line has reopened and the track has been replaced.  It is worrying that another accident, this time on the Dublin-Waterford line at Bestfield, has occurred.</P>
    <P>Not only is there a threat to passengers, there is also the question of freight.  Many dangerous substances, such as ammonia, are carried on our railways.  There was a recent derailment in the late summer at Glasnevin in Dublin when a train carrying empty ammonia tankers derailed and crashed.  If those tankers had been full and the accident more serious, there would have been a national emergency.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is not to make a political football out of the railways.  It is accepted by all parties that the fundamental case for railway investment is agreed on the basis of meeting our national overall transport policy objectives. Specifically in this regard, it would relieve further congestion on the roadways and meet freight objectives.  Our railways are a crucial aspect of social, community and regional policy.  It was also accepted at the time of the £275 million co-financed EU investment programme that there is a justifiable investment case for separating investment in a permanent way from investment in rolling stock and the day to day costs of running Irish Rail.  By the same token, buses carrying road passengers or hauliers carrying road freight are not expected to bear the full cost of their permanent way, namely the national road network.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise has promised to establish an international consultancy study to review railway safety.  That is urgent and necessary, not only to overcome the problem <Col N="538" /> where effectively the sole authority on railway safety here is Irish Rail and, therefore, procedures are somewhat internalised, but also because it would provide the basis for prioritising the investment needs into the future.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for the investment for which I am calling in this year's Book of Estimates, the budget or in any Operational Programme set out for the expenditure of Structural Funds up to the year 1999.  The opportunity was missed in the mid-term review in July and August of this year to switch further investment into the railways to complete this investment programme.</P>
    <P>Given that approximately 40 per cent of our railway network is over 50 years of age, this problem can only worsen in time.  I know many Deputies from the affected constituencies, who are committed to the maintenance and development of the fabric of rural life consider this a fundamental issue of priority investment.  The alternative consequences of failure of the Government to respond positively to this motion are clear-cut.  It will mean that the railway service to those affected areas will have to slow down to remain safe.  That will affect the reliability and efficiency of the routes.  It will result in lower passenger numbers and a clear spiral of uneconomic decline.  Therefore, by stealth we will have a terminal decline of those railway routes and that should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>As a Wexford Deputy, I am particularly concerned about the lack of attention to the Dublin-Rosslare route and there are a few special features in this regard.  European authorities have already designated the Rosslare to Larne road route to be the euro route with number one priority in the country.  Given that Belfast to Dublin on the parallel rail route has been upgraded and that the DART exists from Dublin to Bray and will be extended to Greystones, it is imperative that the rail route from Greystones to Rosslare is upgraded.  There is a strong commercial case for this given the extent of urban and housing development in the peripheral Dublin area which requires a commuter service to meet its needs.  We all know the cost of housing and accommodation in Dublin is prohibitive to many people working in our capital city and its environs.  The reality of this extends right through from beyond Greystones down to Arklow, whereby on a daily basis people commute Monday to Friday to and from work in Dublin.  It is imperative this route is given priority, not only for those reasons but also because of the growth of Rosslare Port in terms of passenger and tourism development and that port is owned and operated by Irish Rail.</P>
    <P>We cannot wait for an horrific event to act as the catalyst for Government action.  Too often Government is in effect crisis management, whereby issues come to the top of media and public attention and are responded to with urgency and resources.  Now is the time to try to avoid such an occurrence on our railways.  We need planning and the investment structure put <Col N="539" /> in place to ensure that the future of our national railway network is secured.  The latest CIÉ Annual Report shows that there were almost 28 million passenger journeys in 1996.  There is great scope for further growth in this premium form of travel.  Cost cutting, viability reforms, better management, greater focus on quality and consumer concerns all play a part in ensuring a vibrant and viable national railway service.  All of this will be impossible without a secure, safe and reliable permanent way.</P>
    <P>This issue will not go away.  There is an onus on the Minister to approach the Minister for Finance and bring a memorandum to Cabinet.  She must discuss the possibility of getting a fairly modest allocation of resources in this area with Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies, the transport director and person with responsibility for infrastructural funds.</P>
    <P>I could come to the Minister with a fanciful list seeking to upgrade the track from Claremorris to Galway, from Foynes to Limerick and Ballybrophy and from Limerick junction to Waterford through to Rosslare.  However, I have modified my request. I realise there are constraints and the Minister did not set out the co-financed EU programme. As she is aware, part of the pleasure of being a Minister is that when the music stops responsibility falls to the Minister for this area and it is she who will be ultimately held responsible if an accident occurs.  If there is an accident, Irish Rail will say it outlined its requirements to its parent Department, formerly the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and now the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>I hope this motion is seen as constructive and timely.  One could debate the railways in the context of the very large annual subvention they receive.  I know there are economists in this city who believe the railways should be closed down. We have a low density of population and an economic case cannot be made for all our railway routes.  Therefore, the case must be made on the basis of regional policy and political priorities in terms of community access.</P>
    <P>If a European, American or Japanese investor were to consider locating a manufacturing industry in a particular area, rail routes are one of the issues they would consider.  Many industrialists do not look beyond Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Galway. We must ensure the decline of the railways is not allowed to continue.  An Post no longer uses the railway service whereas in the past it used it for certain types of deliveries.  The port in Waterford, a huge lo-lo facility linked to Bell container traffic, has closed down.  There is a need to generate new business.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Turf Development Bill, the Minister will recall an interesting proposal on waste disposal between CIE and Bord na Móna which will I hope generate new freight business. A fundamental prerequisite to all of this is a permanent and satisfactory rail system.</P>
    <P>It may be false but there is a rumour in circulation <Col N="540" /> that old sleepers from lines which are being upgraded particularly the Dublin-Belfast line are being used to maintain some of the western tracks.  Apparently this is called &ldquo;cannibalisation&rdquo;. It is bad enough not having concrete sleepers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am trying to deal with this issue in a dispassionate manner.  However, this is a fundamental issue for my colleagues who hail from the affected areas of Ballina, Westport, Claremorris and so on.  In my former role as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I listened on a daily basis to people's fears about the flight from the land, population decline in rural Ireland, post office closures and so on.  Rural communities are under threat yet the quality of life there is unique in Europe and many aspire to it.  Further decline of the railways can only be seen as a fatal blow. The buck stops with the Minister.  The Government can and should accept this motion and implement its proposals without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion which is of importance in a general sense countrywide but in a particular sense to the west of Ireland.  I realise the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke is a very practical politician who understands the needs and fears of the ordinary people.  She is newly appointed to a very important Department.  This issue is fundamental to the legacy she will leave behind her.</P>
      <P>I have served in this House for more than 20 years and have used the rail service for most of that time, with the exception perhaps of my own period in Government.  I believe in the rail transport system as a system of transport for freight and people.  It is possible to move more passengers per hour by train than by any other method of transport.</P>
      <P>The rail map of Ireland over the past 150 years has contracted.  There have been a series of closures arising from economic factors over the past 50 or 60 years.  The west Clare line, the line from Galway to Clifden, the line from Westport to Achill, the line from Claremorris to Ballinrobe and the line to Donegal have all been closed. Were these lines to be available now they would be unique and would generate a massive amount of finance in local areas in the area of tourism. However, that has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish railway lines are reminders of a very sad period in our history.  Pictures of railway stations in the black forties and fifties with emigrants leaving home carry very special and poignant memories <Col N="541" /> for many people, particularly those in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will confine my remarks to the western line, specifically to the Dublin-Galway, Dublin-Sligo and Dublin-Westport-Ballina lines.  Deputy Yates has outlined various costings for these.  The Dublin-Galway and Dublin-Sligo lines will cost approximately £30 million and the Dublin-Westport-Ballina line will cost in the region of £25 to £30 million.</P>
    <P>Galway is one of our major metropolitan areas and as such a decent rail line to Galway is very important.  The plan for the Galway line will be implemented over a three year period at the rate of 20 miles per year.  By 1999, there will be a fine line of continuous welded rail with concrete sleepers going into Galway.  That will provide the administration of Iarnród Éireann with the ability to provide a decent, efficient, comfortable, fast and safe service.</P>
    <P>EU funding only applies as far as Mullingar on the Sligo line.  I recall a Private Members' debate in this House some years ago during which former Deputy, Ted Nealon, produced the original timetable for the Dublin-Sligo train which showed it travelled the distance in a faster time then than it did on the day the debate took place because the quality of the line was inferior.  There is also the Dublin-Westport and Dublin-Ballina line at a cost of £30 million.  Some would argue that if the Taoiseach can give £20 million to Croke Park, which is a laudable effort to support&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Gaelic Athletic Association and always have.  However, the equivalent amount would complete a great deal of that line and these priorities should also be examined.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has been given a subsidy of about £100 million per year or £1 billion per decade so it should not deliver an inferior service to some parts of the country.  The problem with the line is the quality of the track.  The quality of a railway track is determined by whether it has continuous welded rail and concrete sleepers.  I do not know if concrete sleepers were manufactured 50 years ago, but Deputy Yates is correct to point out that if secondhand equipment is used, a first class modern service will not be produced.  The two priorities are continuous welded rail and concrete sleepers.  The Minister must bring a memo to Government pointing out the priority that must be given to this line and money must be made available in a projected plan over three or five years to upgrade it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inferiority of the line is not due solely to wooden sleepers and inferior track.  It is also due to the size of the engines.  Iarnród Éireann purchased a number of new engines about ten years ago.  They have a long lifespan but they are so heavy that, when running at full power, they <Col N="542" /> destroy the line.  On sections of the western line, for example, these engines must travel at a maximum of 50 miles an hour, which results in an inferior service.  I do not know if the Minister has travelled on the Westport line on a Friday evening but it would be a useful experience.  She should visit Heuston Station and make the journey unannounced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The new railway station in Athlone was built on the east side of the river.  If any structural damage ever occurred to the bridge across the Shannon, the rail service to Galway, Westport and Ballina would be wiped out.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a responsibility to bring a memo to Government about this matter.  I accept she will examine it seriously but it requires Government clout and political commitment. People who use the western line are as prepared to pay for the service as customers on other lines. When I asked a question in the House after the accident occurred in Knockcroghery, I tried to quote from an advertisement for the &ldquo;gold service&rdquo; on the southern line.  According to that, the traveller has space for fax machines and laptop computers and can conduct his or her business in comfort.  The train was compared to a cushion of air.  The same does not apply to the wind rushing in one's face on the western line.  If one can drink a cup of tea, not to mind use a laptop, one must have a considerable degree of athletic expertise. There is a faster service on the southern line and people are prepared to pay for it.  People on the western line would be prepared to pay for the same service.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann is managing badly the number of passengers it is carrying and it will never know what revenue it has lost. If there is a good, efficient rail service that is competitive and safe, people will use it in huge numbers.  This will lead to a reduction in the number of cars on the road, lessen the necessity for operations such as operation freeflow in Dublin, avoid having tired and over-stressed motorists driving long distances and allow people to do business on the train.  The country could operate in a more efficient and professional manner.  Iarnród Éireann does not look to young students, thousands of whom travel on these trains, as the business people of the next generation who would use the train service if a good service were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why one cannot contact one's local railway station and book seats in advance.  One must turn up at the station.  If there is a big occasion, such as an All-Ireland final or semi-final, there will be thousands of people on the platform and a mad rush to scramble onto the train.  There is no understanding of safety standards. Overcrowding does not appear to constitute a safety hazard on the trains because if they are overcrowded they are still deemed to be safe. If the Knockcroghery accident had occurred further down the line where there are high <Col N="543" /> embankments, there would have been serious loss of life despite the fact that the carriages on the line are good quality.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the administration of a railway system does not anticipate such situations. Mayo has been in three All-Ireland finals in 12 months and each time thousands travel on the train.  Many more are unable to get tickets for either the match or the train.  The train is usually grossly uncomfortable.  The trolley service cannot operate.  People who should not be on the train are allowed to travel on it while the disabled who must use wheelchairs are obliged to stay in the junction space between the carriages which is highly dangerous if there were an accident or a shunting of the carriages.  That is not good enough.  I commend the Minister on her work on safety guidelines.  They must be brought forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The staff of Iarnród Éireann are competent and committed to the rail service but they are demoralised because they are the butt of so many jokes.  Remarks about derailments and trains being late are regularly heard.  However, the problem is that if something small goes wrong on the western line it causes tremendous difficulty throughout the area.  The train from Westport to Dublin usually arrives in Heuston Station on time on Tuesday mornings.  The train back to Westport, however, is invariably much later because of delays on other lines and so forth.</P>
    <P>Is it true that almost 45 coaches are under repair in Inchicore?  It appears the craftsmen in Inchicore operate an 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. business so there are insufficient coaches for the tracks. Forty-five coaches could provide almost five trains.  These coaches should be out on the tracks and used for the purpose for which they were intended.</P>
    <P>I have been in Heuston Station on many occasions and it is a sight to behold each Friday evening.  It would do the Minister the world of good to go there one Friday evening, even if she does not travel on the train.</P>

      <P>About £15 million is to be spent on Heuston Station.  As it is the central or radial station, there must be efficiency and space and the ability to move people through it quickly. God forbid that this problem in Heuston Station should continue into the next century.  It is not good enough that in 1997 there is still the same <Col N="544" /> mad rush along the line in the hope of getting a seat.</P>
      <P>There is huge scope for Iarnród Éireann to conduct its business efficiently.  The company is genuinely anxious to do that but it needs help as it does not have the capacity within its own resources.  The Minister must bring a relevant memo to Government.  I believe she will have the support of her colleagues.  The Tánaiste was in Castlebar yesterday to open a huge American plant and she was enthusiastic about the effect of the tiger economy on the county.  We want to hear the O'Rourke line on the matter.  The Minister understands what is required.  We will see if the Government is as flúirseach when she presents her memo as it was last week.  I look forward to the Minister's reply and to her dealing with these issues so we get a line which will give an efficient, fast, safe and comfortable service in keeping with the modern Ireland which we pretend exists.</P>

My uncle worked for the company for 47 years and owns the Railway Tavern beside the station in Westport.  I do not want to be critical of Irish Rail, although I have been involved in rows with many of its staff.  However, I thank the staff who have to work under difficult conditions &mdash; people like Tommy Browne, who features in an advertisement for Irish Rail.  He has that smile 24 hours a day.  I have seen him under pressure from the public when a train might be an hour or an hour and a half late. However, he is always nice and courteous to customers. I also compliment the station master, Anne Elliot, who has improved the service on the Westport line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates was right to ask whether Irish Rail has made a decision to run down its service so the Minister will have no option but to close the line.  I know she will not do this because she is a strong Minister.  I ask her to go to Cabinet and put her mark on this line by obtaining the necessary funding.</P>
      <P>The funding which Iarnród Éireann receives is not spent in the west. It looks for funding for the western line but will not spend money on it.  They will not spend it on the carriages or the service.  I heard the Chamber of Commerce representative, Peter Shanley, on radio recently.  He uses the line on a regular basis and said it is a good service, but with bad trains and a bad track.</P>
      <P>A colleague of the Minister's told me he came up from Cork today on the train.  He missed the first two trains of the morning but got a third one. We have no such luxury in the west. There is one train which leaves at 6.35 a.m. I stopped using the service because I can never estimate its arrival.  I might have a meeting and I cannot be sure that train will be on time.  I used it on All-Ireland day and I told the station master I will never do so again.  I got abuse from the public about what politicians should do about the line.  I wrote to the area manager that the service was a disgrace that day and he responded with the same excuses.</P>
      <P>The problem is there has been no investment in that line for many years.  I raised with the Minister the accident which happened a few weeks ago and a number of speakers have referred to it. We were lucky we got a warning a serious accident would take place.  It would be unfair if in the future this problem was put on the Minister's desk.  On that Saturday morning, we were lucky the train derailed where it did and that there was a small number of passengers.  God was on our side but that may not be the case the next time an accident like that occurs.</P>
      <P>The people of the west are aggrieved when they see Structural Funds spent on roads on the east coast, Luas and thousands of jobs announced every week.  There is nothing for the west. The rail service is not satisfactory because the people of the west have lost confidence in it.  They are afraid to use the service because of what happened a few weeks ago.  I ask them to give the service a chance.  It is important we use it because we do not want to lose it.  The service is a major link between Dublin and the west. It brings thousands of tourists to the west.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke understands rural Ireland and as a Minister is in a position to do something about this matter.  The funds are there, as we saw in the budget last week.  I ask her to make a political decision which I will thank and congratulate her for.  If she says this Government will provide funding for the Westport to Dublin line, I will be the first person to welcome her to the station in Westport and give her a civic reception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I had words about this issue a couple of weeks ago.  I spoke about the Sligo to Mullingar line rather than the <Col N="546" /> Sligo to Dublin line.  The Mullingar to Dublin line works and the Sligo to Dublin line is not in good condition.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about the Irish rail service.  I was lucky enough to go to Germany a year and a half ago where I was brought on a tour of the rail network, especially where new infrastructure was being constructed in East Germany.</P>
      <P>It was fascinating that the German Government, which is known to have promoted excellent infrastructural development, first put down a new structure of rail lines.  The railway stations and carriage services were the second and third matters to be looked after.  Some of the railway stations were appalling but the German Government decided that if there was a proper line facility the trains would run on time.  We are doing it the other way around.  We are spending £15 million on Heuston Station.  Obviously the rail line from Cork to Dublin is excellent, but there is difficulty with the rail track in the west. The only way the line will be maintained is if there is capital expenditure on the track.</P>
      <P>Safety is also in question.  If the consumer does not have faith in the rail service, he or she will not use it.  Economies of scale will be brought to bear where adequate numbers of people will not use the service.  As my colleague Deputy Yates said, the most economic solution would be to shut down the service.  This will happen if we do not inject capital expenditure into the rail lines between Westport, Sligo and Dublin.  I used the Sligo to Dublin rail line in the past few weeks.  I expected to be in Dublin at 11 a.m. but did not arrive until 12.30 p.m. If the public cannot rely on the service they will use their cars.  However, we are trying to take cars off the streets in Dublin city, and the only way we can do that is by having a proper rail service.</P>
      <P>Overcrowding on trains, particularly at week-ends, must also be addressed.  It is extremely dangerous, and it is unfair that fare paying passengers, including elderly people, have to stand for up to two and a half hours.  Much work has to be done.  I request the Minister to go to her Government colleagues to get capital expenditure on the rail tracks, particularly in the west, as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;welcomes the £275 million programme of investment in the renewal of railway track, upgrading of signalling and replacement of rolling stock, co-financed by EU and national resources, being undertaken in the period 1994 to 1999 and notes that studies are already well under way to determine rail investment requirements for the post-1999 period and welcomes the decision of the Minister for Public Enterprise to commission <Col N="547" /> an independent consultancy study into all aspects of railway safety.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome the spirit in which the motion was put forward.  I appreciate the comments of Deputy Ivan Yates, the chief Opposition spokesperson and Deputies Kenny, Ring and Gerry Reynolds. As each of the four who spoke put their railway credentials on the line, it is proper for me to do the same.  I was brought up within 50 yards of Athlone railway station.  It was our playground. The stationmaster and his family and our family were the closest of friends.  The noise of the trains and the constant shunting of the railway carriages and goods wagons were the fondly remembered noises of my childhood.  The operation of the railways and the safe carriage of people is paramount in my brief.</P>
    <P>I welcome the helpful input by Deputy Yates when we spoke on radio.  My mind was moving in that direction, and what Deputy Yates said was interesting.  Deputy Spring and I also spoke on the matter on the Adjournment here.  Nobody has received wisdom on everything, and the suggestions and interventions of others help to clarify one's mind.</P>
    <P>This Government, in its Action Programme for the Millennium, has identified investment in the mainline and suburban rail network as one of its key priorities in the transport area.  As Minister for Public Enterprise, I am committed to delivering on the Government's objective in a structured and orderly way with the aim of delivering safe and efficient railway services in a cost effective and competitive manner.</P>
    <P>The railways have shown a steady growth in passenger numbers in recent years with over 8.3 million passengers using the mainline service last year and over 19.5 million using the Dublin suburban services.  I am determined that these passengers should be able to travel in safety on good quality rail services.</P>
    <P>Investment is certainly an essential component, but not the only one.  The successful conclusion of the necessary change and restructuring negotiations, currently under way between Iarnród Éireann unions and management, is also a vital cog in improving the company's efficiency, reducing its costs and generating the internal resources necessary for the renewal of its assets.  The introduction next year of public service contracts will transform the financial relationship between the State and the company.  They will give the company a much more stable medium-term financial framework, while at the same time placing an emphasis on payment for performance.  The company also needs to place much more emphasis on identifying and meeting the needs of its customers. It has to think of itself as the provider of an important public service, balancing this with the need to be increasingly commercial and market driven in its approach.  Above all, safety has to be a paramount consideration in all the company's activities.  A culture of safety needs to be pervade the company from top to bottom.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> Now that I have set that broad context, I want to focus on two particular aspects &mdash; railway safety and investment.  To echo what has been said here and on previous occasions when we debated the Knockcroghery derailment, all the glitzy words, advertising and everything that goes with it are subservient to the need for safety.  The train derailment at Knockcroghery was potentially very serious.  We do not often invoke God in this House, but I thank God it did not turn out to be so.  Equally, no method of transport is wholly safe.  The most perfect system of continuous welded track, with the newest carriages, the best technology in signalling, the most modern level crossings, the most well-kept railway stations and the most excellent personnel are all important in the running of railways.  However, even with all that, one cannot guarantee full safety on any method of transport whether it be train, bus, rail, car or ship.  There are inherent hazards in making a journey, but that has to be allied with CIÉ's very fine record of safety, second in the European league <i>pro rata</i> with population and numbers travelling.</P>
    <P>Before dealing in detail with these two important issues, I want to make it clear that I will not be rushed into decisions because it is politically expedient.  I want to establish the facts clearly and precisely.  I will set out details of the studies which are to be undertaken in both the safety and investment areas which will provide an objective and coherent basis for decision making.</P>
    <P>Deputies contributing to this and other recent debates emphasised the importance of safety in the operation of the railways, and it is appropriate that they should do so.  Safety is a paramount consideration in the provision of rail services, and rail travellers rightly assume that they will arrive safely at their destinations.  Accidents on our rail system involving fatalities or serious injuries are very much the exception.  Indeed we are fortunate in having one of the lowest rail fatality rates in Europe.</P>
    <P>Serious rail accidents are all the more shocking by virtue of their rarity.  They are a reminder that no one can give guarantees of absolute safety on the railways or any transport system.  They also serve as a timely warning against complacency and can provide valuable opportunities to reassess equipment and procedures with a view to minimising future risks to passengers and rail staff.  However, there have been a number of rail accidents in the recent past which have been the cause of some disquiet.  We have been fortunate that the number and extent of casualties have been small &mdash; the last fatalities happened some years ago &mdash; but if circumstances had been different, they could have been more serious.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility for ensuring that our rail services are operated safely, and I wish to inform the House once again of the company's assurance that safety is its main priority.  Securing the safe operation of railways is a primary factor in determining how the company uses the financial and other resources at its disposal, <Col N="549" /> including the considerable level of annual Exchequer support which goes towards the costs of maintaining the rail infrastructure and operating rail services.  Achieving acceptable levels of safety on the railway is a complex task which involves the interaction of a range of factors and affects every facet of the company's operations.  Experience has shown that although investment in new equipment and in the proper maintenance of existing equipment is vital to safety it is only one element in the company's overall safety strategy.  A comprehensive approach is essential to ensure that safety is accepted and pursued as an organic part of railway operations, irrespective of the financial resources available to Iarnród Éireann at any time.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that I had occasion to address the House in recent weeks following two separate passenger train derailments.  We were very fortunate because neither case involved a fatality or serious injury.  I share the concern of all Deputies about the implications of accidents of this kind for the overall safety of the railway system.  I was in regular contact with Iarnród Éireann about those accidents and one positive message I took away with me was the company's acute awareness of the crucial importance of rail safety.  The company considers safety to be a primary objective which it must continue to pursue as an integral part of its everyday business, and not something which depends on external intervention, such as ministerial intervention.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, and without taking away from the continuing efforts being made by the company to identify and address any areas of weakness, I advised the House on 18 November that I considered the time to be ripe for an external review of Iarnród Éireann's rail safety policy and practice. I propose to appoint independent consultants to carry out a strategic review of rail safety. The consultants' brief will require them to consider, by reference to appropriate international benchmarks and local considerations, the adequacy of Iarnród Éireann's existing safety policy, systems, rules and procedures and the company's arrangements for implementing safety rules and procedures on the ground.  They will also consider the adequacy, from a safety view-point, of the existing railway infrastructure and facilities, including track, signalling systems, rolling stock and level crossings.  In short, the consultants will examine all aspects of railway safety &mdash; infrastructure, policy and practice.</P>
    <P>On the basis of their professional judgment, the consultants will be required to provide clear, precise, quantified and objective advice as to whether the overall level of railway safety is adequate.  They will be asked to identify three categories of unreasonable safety risks: urgent, medium-term and long-term.  Their advice will be sought on any additional safety implications which might arise from increased service frequencies or higher speeds on the rail network. They will also be asked to review the role, <Col N="550" /> responsibilities and functions of my Department's railway inspecting officer.</P>
    <P>The aim will be to have the review completed within six months of the date of appointment, provided that this is consistent with meeting the overall requirements of the review.  The consultants will be selected in accordance with EU public procurement rules, which means a minimum notice period of 52 days for possible applicants. If, in the course of the review, the consultants identify any matter which they believe gives rise to safety risks so serious as to require immediate attention they will be required to bring it to my notice in advance of completing their final report. It is imperative that this is done.  The consultants' report will be published.</P>
    <P>Approximately 12 to 18 months after completing the report, the consultants may be required to report on the progress which has been made in implementing their recommendations.  To assist that progress report, the consultants are being asked to ensure that their recommendations are, as far as possible, expressed in concrete terms which can be measured or quantified.</P>

      <P>No. This is a time of transition for Iarnród Éireann.  New investment is being made in infrastructure and rolling stock and new services and service standards are being offered to customers.  Meanwhile, the company is negotiating with its workforce on restructuring proposals necessary to secure its future in a changing environment.  All of these developments have very important implications for the safe operation of rail services and it is vital that progress on safety standards should keep pace with, and not be compromised by, this process of necessary change and development.  While that task remains a responsibility which only Iarnród Éireann can discharge, the external safety review will be of major assistance to the company in its ongoing efforts to enhance the safety and attractiveness of the services it offers its customers.</P>
      <P>I now want to turn to the second theme, rail investment.  It is worth noting that during a period right up to the end of 1980s &mdash; Governments of different hues and persuasions were in office during this time &mdash; financial constraints led to significant under-investment in infrastructural renewal and asset replacement in the railway.  In I993 the investment needs for the entire railway network were estimated at approximately £800 million over a 30 year period.  It was recognised in the Operational Programme for Transport, which covers the period 1994-9, that the railway required an integrated investment and development programme.  This was needed to maintain and improve competitiveness, to sustain existing demand and to create the potential for a shift in demand and modal split towards the railway in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> It is important to note that the first major investment programme in the renewal of the rail network was initiated by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Cowen, and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern.</P>

      <P>The then Taoiseach and Minister for Finance successfully negotiated the first substantial rail renewal programme as part of the 1994-9 Community Support Framework and Operational Programme for Transport.</P>
      <P>Total investment in the mainline rail network over the six years will amount to over £275 million. Priorities for investment were selected in many cases after comprehensive cost benefit analyses had been carried out by CIE and independent consultants appointed by the European Commission.  As a result, the current investment programme is being focused on track renewal, modern signalling systems and rolling stock.  The work being undertaken will result in increased safety, lower operating costs and shorter journey times.  This is a significant level of expenditure by any measure.  The programme represents the best use of available funds.</P>
      <P>It may be helpful to look at the main components of the investment programme.  Total investment on track renewal alone will amount to about £150 million. Two-thirds of this expenditure is being co-financed by the EU and Iarnród Éireann, while the remaining one-third is being funded from Iarnród Éireann's own resources, which includes the annual State subvention.  This work will include extensive replacement of jointed track on timber sleepers with continuous welded rails on concrete sleepers.  This was the nub of the contributions from Deputy Yates and other Deputies.  Deputy Reynolds said that the first initiative undertaken during the revitalisation of East Germany was the construction of the permanent way.  All of the principal lines radiating out of Dublin benefit from this renewal expenditure, including Dublin to Cork, Belfast and Limerick; Portarlington to Galway; Dublin to Sligo; Kildare to Waterford; Athlone to Westport and Ballina; Mallow to Tralee and Dublin to Rosslare.  It will also mean that the poorest quality rails are being replaced.  For example, in 1995 some 60 miles of the network comprised of what are referred to as 95 pound flat bottom rails. These are being removed as a matter or urgency with a view to completing their replacement in the next two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work is also ongoing to replace the outdated mechanical signalling system on mainline rail <Col N="552" /> routes with a modern, cost effective and centralised control system.  Significant work will be done on the Galway, Sligo, Tralee and Waterford routes.  As a result, these lines, as well as those to Cork, Limerick, Wicklow and Dundalk, will be equipped with modern signalling by 1999.  The new enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast was launched on 21 October.  The Commissioner travelled on the train from Belfast to Dundalk where she disembarked in order to view certain projects.  She was very taken with the fine service which is important not only from the physical element of North-South relations but also the psychological element.  The new service provides evidence of the standards which can be achieved to meet passenger demands.  It included upgrading the track, station improvements, improved signalling and rolling stock replacement. While the motion refers specifically to rural areas, in the operation of Iarnród Éireann it is necessary to look at the overall picture.</P>
    <P>In regard to DART there are four further distinct suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area serving Dundalk, Arklow, Maynooth and Kildare.  Together they carry 20 million passengers per annum and will benefit from an investment of almost £40 million.  Much valuable work has been done, but I am conscious that the rail network still has substantial long-term investment requirements.  The current programme is drawing to a close and the investment of more than £275 million by 1999 will be a magnificent contribution to the improvement of the network.  However, much more remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the importance of having the full facts before making important decisions.  We need to have a very clear view of expenditure requirements and of priorities.  We need to consider track renewal, signalling and rolling stock. We must also consider the economic factors such as likely passenger demand.  In recent months I asked CIE to prepare detailed investment plans for the mainline and suburban rail networks in the context of securing EU or other funding in the post-1999 period.  I hope to have its report early in the new year and that will provide the basis for determining the future rail investment programme.  The EU demands figures of an economic return on railway investment, as it did with roads &mdash; I remember debates in this House on county roads, to which all rural Deputies contributed &mdash; and we will make a coherent play for the equivalent of investment in county roads to upgrade our railways.  That matter will be rigorously examined in the context of EU funding after 1999.</P>
    <P>Work is under way in regard to mainline rail investment needs.  My Department has stressed to CIE the need for a comprehensive study of mainline rail investment needs covering track, signalling, rolling stock and stations.  This study will include an examination of overall policy in regard to rolling stock purchase.  That will help determine the appropriate balance between investment in the traditional locomotive hauled trains <Col N="553" /> or in railcars, which are successfully used in other countries.</P>
    <P>While we are in the middle of an extensive modernisation programme, we obviously cannot replace all our existing track and signalling systems overnight.  This means trains will continue to run over older tracks, and it is important that they do so subject to appropriate safeguards and without compromising operational safety.  This is a normal feature of Iarnród Éireann's existing operations.  The tracks in question are subject to regular twice weekly inspections and where necessary remedial work is undertaken as part of the company's overall rail maintenance programme which cost £26 million last year.  I have been assured by the company that there would be no question of allowing trains to operate under conditions which are considered to be unsafe.</P>
    <P>The overall picture must be considered, including systems and procedures, rather than simply the infrastructure.  There is always the danger that as re-equipment proceeds there might be a tendency to rely unduly on hardware to ensure safety, and that would be a great mistake.  Unfortunately, accidents still occur on rail systems more technically developed than our own.  This underlines the importance of an intrinsic safety culture throughout the railway company.  Everybody, and everything that is done, must be guided by considerations of safety.  Otherwise no amount of hardware will prevent accidents happening.  I am anxious that attention to this fundamental, if unglamorous, aspect should continue to underpin Iarnród Éireann's safety policy and practice in the future.</P>
    <P>Railways have served this country well over many years and through difficult times.  In preparation for this debate, over the weekend I brought home many books from the Library and the Department about railways, internal disputes, amalgamations and railway mania, which was experienced in post-famine Ireland.  It was believed that in the successful completion of tracks, railways would be beneficiaries of an economic miracle.  I read extracts from local papers, from the local board of guardians who set out their requirements in terms of a rail service.  They met in conclave and made great demands, requesting a service to many remote areas.</P>
    <P>The story of railways is one of service, constant difficulties and constant need for investment.  One hears about the successful operation of railways in countries such as Canada, but in those countries there are huge populations and trains travel long distances.  Since Ireland is a small country, we have a small population and remote areas must be serviced.  There has been need down the years for rural regeneration and to keep people on the land, hence the need for a proper transport system.  With public service contracts people see where their money is spent.  There must be proper investment in railways, but investment has not matched up with the requirements, except in 1984 when we set up the operational programme for railway investment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> We have a huge economic debt and we must take account of subsidies paid to the holding company, CIE, particularly to Iarnród Éireann.  Following the unanimous declaration that safety is the primary objective, we have an opportunity to set out all those matters in a properly planned programme.  In a public debate on RTE I acknowledged the safety review.  Deputy Yates and I were in convergence on that issue and I welcome his helpful attitude.  Deputy Spring was also helpful in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to continued investment in the mainline rail network to secure its long-term future.  We are also committed to safety, as is evidenced by my decision to proceed with an independent review.  I reiterate the importance of having the facts on investment and safety requirements before making decisions.  I have set out a prudent course of action which involves proper studies of both issues.  I hope this will lead to better decisions and I ask the House to support the approach I have adopted.  I have circulated in the House the terms of reference of the safety study.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates for introducing this motion and the Minister for her excellent amendment which praises the actions of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government which provided investment in this area.</P>
      <P>I am a strong supporter of public transport and believe it is possible to provide an efficient, customer-focused, cost efficient and environmentally friendly public transport system.  The rail system is an integral and essential part of such a system, particularly as we have forced a large section of our population to live in a semi-circle around the capital city.  Arising from that forced population move, there has been bad planning but areas of low density population need services.  We are faced with the conundrum of providing a service on a cost effective basis to areas with limited numbers of people.</P>
      <P>If we are to provide a cost effective, efficient and customer-focused service, we must provide proper infrastructure, a modern track and signalling system and new carriages, locomotives and stations.  If we do not do that either through the private sector or the public sector we will have a less than desirable level of infrastructure to provide the efficient service the paying public will demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period of the last Government, some £275 million of EU and State funding was provided for the development of the rail system. That compared with £28 million in the period of the previous Government, during which time more money was spent on the Lucan bypass than on the entire railroad system.  That new motorway is ineffective.  It is similar to a slow moving car-park. It takes approximately one hour to travel five miles, similar to the rate of travel of the old horse and carriages for which the cobbled streets were designed.  That is the speed at which cars are <Col N="555" /> travelling on the very expensive super motorways we have built.</P>
    <P>An underfunded rail system runs each side of that motorway, but people cannot get on the trains.  We must examine the value of the motorway versus the alternatives.  The southern and western lines that run practically parallel with the Lucan bypass have not been developed to the point where they can be used effectively.  The Minister stated that approximately 20 million passengers use those lines per annum, but they could be used to a far greater extent.  Arising from our planning decisions to locate large sections of our population outside the capital city, there is a huge catchment of commuters who must travel to and from Dublin every day, but our railway lines are not capable of taking them.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department and CIE have prepared a plan to upgrade the Maynooth-Connolly line at a cost of £48 million, much less than the cost of the ineffective Maynooth bypass.  The Maynooth-Connolly line is operating at about half its capacity because of the condition of its single line and the difficulties at Barrow Street. Upgrading that line would allow twice as many passengers to travel quickly, efficiently and cost effectively to and from work in an environmentally friendly manner.  It would also relieve the gridlock on the nearby motorway.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 1,400 miles of railroad in Ireland, 465 miles of which need upgrading. The cost of upgrading the main lines would be approximately £330,000 per mile compared with £6 million per mile of motorway.  We must examine our priorities when allocating money in this area.  Because of the decisions of the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the former Government, there is a large amount of money available for upgrading railways.  We must ensure this is only a first tranche of funding, not a final tranche. I was pleased to hear the Minister announce details of a plan in that regard.</P>
    <P>The wooden sleepers and plated rail track need to be replaced with continuous rail and concrete sleepers.  We also need to replace the scarce rolling stock.  Some new rolling stock has been provided and more is ordered, but I understand we need 100 new carriages and 30 new locomotives to provide a maximum service for the paying public. The total cost of the upgrading identified as necessary, not including branch lines, would be approximately £350 million.  That is a large sum, but it is relatively small compared with what is spent on out roads each year.  The standard of approximately one-third of the existing track is less than the standard required, and this gives rise to speeds as low as 25 or even five miles per hour. It is not possible to provide a cost effective or efficient service in such circumstances.  It is certainly not possible for Iarnród Éireann to provide a customer-focused service.  It is severely handicapped by our collective neglect over many years to provide the funding necessary for infrastructure, signalling and rolling stock on our railways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> It is essential that the Government devises a plan for the future development of our rail system. It must find the money and make the case for the investment of £350 million in that system. The chief executive of CIE, Mr. McDonell, made a strong case for the separation of the roles of service provider and infrastructural provider.  The Government provides roads for others to use. People pay a charge for using roads in the form of car tax but the Government makes the investment. Yet, we expect Iarnród Éireann, the rail transport company, not alone to carry out the transport work but to provide the railroad.  This puts Iarnród Éireann at a huge disadvantage compared to commercial road users such as hauliers and passenger carriers.  Other branches of CIE are at an advantage in comparison to Iarnród Éireann in that regard.</P>
    <P>In looking at future plans for the development of CIE the Minister should include the possibility of providing a separate company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>For the permanent way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a road construction and maintenance company for the provision of the permanent way, which is separate from the service provider that gets passengers from A to B. They are two different functions.  The Government should principally be involved in funding the permanent way.  This case has been made and is worthy of examination.  The chief executive of CIE has a vested interest in hiving off something that is very expensive from his point of view and which does not provide a return.  That said, he has made a cogent case that should be examined in some detail.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the development plan for Iarnród Éireann.  I fully support it and ask her to develop it as soon as possible.  It will assist the Minister and the Government in making the continuing case to the EU for further funding.  The roll on of funding after 1999 will be required to assist with the necessary investment of the £350 million that we can now identify.  From a financial investment point of view we have a dangerous situation given the time lapse between having the money available to invest and using the existing railways because the cost of maintaining old tracks will grow.  The older they become and the more they are used, the higher the cost of maintenance will be.  The faster we can get the investment money in place the better because there will be a compound saving.</P>
      <P>I know the difficulties the Minister has.  By and large, she is tied with the amount of EU funding up to 1999 and cannot make a case for funding within that period.  However, it is important to have the case well prepared in advance of 1999.</P>
      <P>I compliment the staff and management of Iarnród Éireann.  I do not know whether the Minister did because I missed the beginning of her speech.</P>

We are all culpable in that regard and I am not trying to avoid blame.  However, even with these defective tools, the staff and management of CIE have done a very good job in providing public transport.</P>
      <P>Government and Opposition should be at one in ensuring that the best possible case is put together and presented not alone to CIE itself but also to the European Union which is strongly in favour of the development of the rail system.  I know that from my time as a Minister of State in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  The EU will look favourably on viable plans that are prepared and presented to it for funding.</P>
      <P>I do not want to meddle with the current negotiations on the viability plan.  I believe progress is being made on these negotiations, which have my full support and good will.  I hope they can come to a speedy and successful conclusion.  However, for a really effective result to these negotiations it is imperative for the Minister, or the Department on her behalf, to be involved.  I said this when I was a Minster of State, although I was not heeded then and may not be heeded now.  The Minister is the owner and it is virtually impossible for a plan to be prepared, produced and presented without the direct input of the owner.</P>

The Minister should consider that possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to set up the <Col N="558" /> independent consultancy study on aspects of railway safety, which is timely.  I want to disassociate myself, however, from the scaremongering about safety on our railways.  We have a had a few minor accidents at low speeds but our railways have a safety record second to none.  There has been one death on the railways in 14 years compared to 6,000 road deaths in the same period. It is irresponsible for Deputies or anyone else to display pictures of trains with mud on them and claim that accidents are waiting to happen.  That is dangerous stuff and will simply drive paying customers away from rail transport.</P>

It is a long time since something like that was done.  It is a perfect response to this motion and to the speeches that have been made.  In fairness to the Minister, she gazumped the Opposition with this proposal.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has safety as a top priority in all its planning.  For example, the company's ultrasonic examinations of low speed tracks can detect micro-cracks which can be dealt with immediately.  The company will reduce speeds to safe levels given the known condition of tracks. If the tracks deteriorate to a point where they are no longer safe, Iarnród Éireann will not allow trains to run on them.  I welcome the Minister's initiative on safety.  The reports she will receive from it with the plan she is preparing for CIE will strengthen her case to the European Commission for the required, necessary and desirable funding that will give us an efficient, environmentally friendly, customer focused and cost effective rail transport system.</P>

      <P>Five minutes is a short time for a complex issue but I thank the Minister for being here and for the gracious way she met a deputation from Cork East recently led by me and her party colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern.</P>
      <P>I am not lightly asking for a change in the law with regard to the Electricity Supply Board.  It is a company with a proud record which in the past was innovative, but now, especially in Cork east, it is out of control.  If the only answer to our difficulties is a change in the law, the Minister might consider it.</P>
      <P>She promised to meet the ESB to put to it the concerns of our deputation.  The ESB has plans to put a large cable network around Cork harbour but locals want the network to go under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> The company put forward a number of reasons it cannot do that.  It says submarine cables would impose considerable restrictions on the movement of ships in Cork harbour during and after construction.  That is not true and Cork Harbour Commissioners have said so.  It is not true that there will be considerable marine and environmental impact during the large scale trenching operations because a four lane super highway is being built under the River Lee.  The ESB says that submarine cables take between two and four months to repair if they break down.  However, in Ireland and abroad submarine cables of far greater power than those proposed by the company are <i>in situ</i> and work very well.  The ESB says it will also require considerable overhead networks, land based cables and termination stations.  It considers this to be a negative aspect but it proposes even more overhead networks.</P>
    <P>The ESB refers to cost and this is where the Minister can act if she has the will.  It says it will add £20 million overall.  I have received information that this is not true and that the cost of going underneath the harbour would be far less. This morning, I received a communication from a continental company which quoted a figure of less than £3 million.  The ESB has not placed any breakdown of costs before us and has made only one assessment.  The people of Cork East are not being heard by a semi-State company and that is serious.  The Minister has the good intentions of all people at heart.  A meeting held in Cobh last night was attended by over 1,000 people who were very irate, annoyed and upset.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála did not grant an oral hearing in this case which is a major project.  Is the ESB in cahoots with An Bord Pleanála?  As I pointed out, the ESB has lied on a number of occasions and has kept the truth from the people on more than one occasion.  I welcome Deputy Ahern into the House.  He was at last night's meeting and also spoke in support of what I have said.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Stanton and Michael Ahern who led a large deputation to see me last month and I was interested in what they had to say.  However, the motion was incorrectly directed to my office and was meant for the Department of the Environment.  It was too late to be retrieved from the system when this was discovered.</P>
      <P>Decisions to grant or withhold planning permission or to give oral hearings are made by the relevant planning authorities and consequently this issue is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Dempsey. Decisions on the need for new high voltage transmission lines and associated pylons and their location are primarily matters for the board and management of the ESB, and are, therefore, matters in which I have no direct function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their location are the outcome of full environmental impact statements, a consultation process <Col N="560" /> between the ESB, IFA, individual landowners, regulatory and planning authorities and, ultimately, the submission of ESB's proposed power lines to the planning authorities for planning approval.  There is, therefore, in place a democratic process whereby local communities and interested parties can ensure that the full rigours of the planning procedure are adhered to.  It is only on conclusion of this process and following planning approval that new transmission lines are built.</P>
    <P>The transmission reinforcement project in the Cork area is causing concern and I was glad to meet representatives of the area on two occasions since my appointment, one in August when I met them with my colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, in Cork.  Deputies Ahern and Stanton led another delegation to see me, as did many other Deputies from the Cork area, including Deputy Clune. Others have written and contacted me about the matter and I am aware of strong local feelings. They were outlined very coherently by the group which was made up of various representative organisations.</P>
    <P>As I told the group, I do not have the statutory authority to give a direction to the ESB on this matter.  I have, however, spoken to the chairman of the ESB and the chief executive and conveyed to them the depth of local concerns on the issue. I also said that if I were them, I would speak to the local groups concerned about this matter directly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas Cheann-Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  Despite the economic boom, nearly one third of Irish children live in poverty, which is the second highest rate of child poverty in the EU.  There is a need for urgent new measures to deal with child and adult homelessness in Dublin. The Government should hang its head in shame at the obscene spectacle of 12 year old children being turned away from hostels throughout the capital city while we give out the available largesse to those who are already well off.  The plight of homeless children has been ignored in <Col N="561" /> the budget.  Every hostel in Dublin is full and children and adults have been turned away and have to sleep rough.  At least 30 children have difficulty being placed and there are 160 people, perhaps more, sleeping rough on the streets of Dublin every night, a large number of whom have drug related problems, mental health needs and a range of social and family problems which have led to their being homeless.</P>
      <P>This week a survey was conducted in my constituency by Merchant's Quay Project.  It was found that of those sleeping rough, 40 per cent are young women, many of whom are drug addicts.  Specific services are needed urgently to deal with the younger age group.  The statistics are alarming and the number of homeless 18 year olds in Dublin, as shown by Focus Ireland, has increased from 352 in 1994, to 599 in 1995 and to 824 in 1996.  It is clear that if the Government was committed to a just society it would have invested a large sum of money in this problem.  A major one off injection of money should have been provided for the whole area of homelessness to break the cycle before we end up with the social problems that are rampant in major British and European cities.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the homeless initiative which is under way but it is not enough.  We have to provide a statutory backup and further funding and support to enable the many groups working with the homeless to provide a range of services to people living in hostels who need to move on to their own homes, flats and jobs and need counselling to help them.  The only way these organisations will be able to give that support to the homeless is if they receive ongoing funding.  It is uncomfortable and upsetting to walk the streets of Dublin and to see 12 year olds, 18 year olds and older men and women sleeping in doorways. It is clear this is a two nation society with a drift towards social exclusion which was made all the wider by last week's budget.</P>
      <P>It was reckless of the Government to introduce such a payback budget given that there are 3,000 people homeless in our capital city without one single initiative to tackle this problem.  Hostels around the city are chock-a-block with up to 800 homeless people.  These hostels have become culs-de-sac instead of emergency safety nets. There is no provision for a range of voluntary services to take people from these hostels into other options I have outlined, including housing, employment and, ultimately, settlement.</P>
      <P>It is the 12 year olds who will sleep rough on the streets tonight who in their silent miserable way condemn the Government and the budget for having ignored this major issue of homelessness. We need to take action urgently to break the cycle these children are getting into and a major initiative is needed.</P>

      <P>Homelessness represents social exclusion at its most acute.  The Government is <Col N="562" /> committed to tackling homelessness on a number of fronts.  In the housing area, practical steps are being taken to maintain housing provision at high levels and to encourage the efforts of the voluntary sector which makes such an enormous contribution to meeting needs.</P>
      <P>The Housing Act, 1988, provides a wide range of additional powers and responsibilities to housing authorities to enable them to provide an effective response to the accommodation needs of homeless persons.  A range of measures have significantly improved the access of homeless persons to accommodation.  The local authority housing programme, which in recent years has been maintained at a high and consistent level, benefits the homeless in common with other housing needs.  A substantial part of the accommodation provided under the voluntary housing schemes has been for homeless persons.  Recently I announced significant improvements in those schemes which will enable the voluntary sector to increase its output.</P>
      <P>My Department recoups to housing authorities 90 per cent of their expenditure on the accommodation of homeless persons.  The amount recouped to authorities has increased steadily from £902,000 in 1993 to £3.1 million in 1996 and is expected to be about £6 million in 1997.  I am satisfied local authorities are using their powers fully and flexibly to meet the diverse needs of homeless people and to support the voluntary groups working on their behalf.</P>
      <P>The Dublin area with a larger population is the focus of special attention.  An important consideration in a city like Dublin is that homeless people are not by-passed or miss the opportunity to avail of services, particularly in the winter months.</P>
      <P>An after hours referral service on a freephone basis is in operation in the Dublin region in counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow for homeless persons seeking accommodation outside normal working hours.  I understand Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board are working closely together to develop a &ldquo;cold weather&rdquo; strategy to ensure sufficient emergency accommodation will be available when the weather deteriorates and when people are most vulnerable. This is important at present as there has been some pressure on available emergency accommodation due to the increased numbers of asylum seekers in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Recently I approved Dublin Corporation's proposal to buy and refurbish a premises in Marlborough Place in Dublin for use as a hostel.  Work will begin in the early months of 1998 on fitting out the premises but I understand it will be available from early January as extra emergency accommodation should the need arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As important as emergency provision for homelessness is, the longer term strategic response will deliver a range of supports to people in different phases of homelessness.  The Dublin homeless initiative was established in 1996 to secure better co-ordination and delivery of services for the homeless in the Dublin region <Col N="563" /> and to provide a framework for a more co-operative and unified approach by the statutory authorities working with the voluntary sector.  Funding is also available under the initiative to voluntary bodies operating settlement and hostel-based care and support services for homeless people.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State I have visited several of the Dublin hostels and met the voluntary body personnel operating them.  I was impressed by the dedication shown by these personnel and the response to the needs of the homeless people in the Dublin area and elsewhere is very much dependent on the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>While much has been done, we can never be complacent.  I will continue to monitor the situation in conjunction with Dublin Corporation and the Dublin homeless initiative and will take whatever measures are necessary.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter in response to a worrying newspaper article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 7 December 1997 which highlighted the fact that four Derry paedophiles have moved to Cork in an effort to avoid the sex offenders register in the United Kingdom.  The report has caused much concern and worry among parents who now know that convicted paedophiles are living in the community and there is no reassurance to parents that these people are being monitored or kept in check in any way.</P>
      <P>The real worry and fear of parents must be understood.  How can one of their sons or daughters carry on their daily lives with the prospect of at least four sex offenders moving freely and undetected around our city?  This is a nightmare for parents.</P>
      <P>The UK's sex offenders Act which came into force in September last compels sex offenders, whether convicted or released from prison, to notify the police where they are living and if they change address.  As no such system exists here, they have a safe haven where they can avoid the police and walk our streets unknown to us.  This situation must be rectified.  I ask the Minister to proceed with the introduction of a sex offenders register immediately.  Such a register should be made available to the Garda and those working in the area of social welfare, in an effort to address the vulnerability of our children in such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed register will not solve the problem of sex offenders as it addresses only part of the problem &mdash; those who have been convicted &mdash; but it would allay the worry of parents and the <Col N="564" /> community about sex offenders moving from one jurisdiction without the relevant authorities being made so aware.  That there are four reported sex offenders in Cork is extremely serious as these people support one another, thus compounding the problem.  I urge the Minister to proceed immediately with the introduction of a sex offenders register here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call that a sex offenders register be introduced immediately. Among paedophiles, repeat offences run at an estimated rate of 90 per cent to 95 per cent, according to studies conducted in Britain.  It makes a curative approach unrealistic.  Containment and control is the appropriate policy in such circumstances.  It needs to be combined with more effective co-operation among the agencies concerned and a long time preventive effort directed against child abuse which is so often the root cause of such behaviour.  Everybody accepts that, among criminals, paedophiles are in a special category. Usually they are highly manipulative and clever and, often, their offending behaviour intensifies as they grow older.  They are in a peculiarly dangerous category.  A register is urgently needed.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties in dealing with paedophiles is that they do not consider their activities to be wrong.  They believe the rest of us set unfair parameters on their sexual activity.  They do not believe having sex with children is wrong.  Many of them believe it is the right thing to do and that we are wrong to try to stop them.  This makes them especially dangerous and that is why they are highly manipulative in their approach.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Clune said, what we are proposing is not a panacea to prevent all sexual offences against children &mdash; no measure can achieve that &mdash; but it would be a significant step in helping the Garda Síochána to track down or determine the whereabouts of those who may be offending against children and ensure some control.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to recent unconfirmed media reports that paedophiles from Northern Ireland have moved here, we understand from the Garda authorities that they have no evidence there is a particular problem in Cork.  Nevertheless, the situation there is being carefully monitored.  We acknowledge that the level of co-operation and exchange of information between the Garda Síochána and the police forces in the neighbouring jurisdictions is excellent.  The notion that this country has become a safe haven for paedophiles is false and without foundation and I absolutely refute it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister indicated, a discussion paper on sexual offences which is being prepared in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will contain a detailed section on issues raised by the creation of a paedophile register.  Its purpose will not be to take a particular stance on issues raised but to set out a number of related matters <Col N="565" /> which will arise and to facilitate a constructive and informed debate which I hope will lead to an effective and workable solution.  The Minister considers this is the best way to proceed, mainly because of the number and complexity of the issues which the question raises.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the term &ldquo;paedophile&rdquo;.  It is frequently used and, as such, there may be an assumption that we all know what a paedophile is but the law and perception may diverge on the issue.  Under our law governing sexual offences, the age of consent for the purpose of sexual relations is 17 years.  Two 16 year olds involved in a sexual relationship may be in breach of the law but they are not paedophiles.  If what we are talking about is a paedophile rather than a sex offenders' register, new definitions will have to be considered.  That is not to say that those two 16 year olds or at least the male in this hypothetical case would necessarily be included on any sex offenders' register.</P>
    <P>An issue which would have to be addressed in the context of a paedophile register is who should be included.  It can only contain the names of convicted paedophiles but even that would have to be clarified.  It cannot, by definition, contain the names of paedophiles who have not been convicted of a criminal offence, irrespective of how dangerous such people may be.  It may be the case that convicted paedophiles make up a small proportion of the total paedophile population or the overall sex offender population.</P>
    <P>Considerations such as these need to be borne in mind when considering the nature and scope of a paedophile register.  It is likely that an offence-based approach will be required but a decision has to be taken on the types of offences to be deemed to be indicative of paedophilia. There will need to be an examination of whether the persistence of an individual's offending or the likelihood of reoffending ought to be a predeterminant of inclusion in such a register.</P>
    <P>The foregoing merely serves to illustrate the complexities associated with the issues raised by the paedophile register.  The register raises other difficult issues.  For instance, for how long should names remain?  Who should maintain it and who should have access?</P>
    <P>For the reasons outlined, the Minister is convinced that the inclusion of the paedophile register in the discussion paper on sexual offences is the correct course of action because it will facilitate a thorough consideration of the complex issues involved and give interested individuals and groups an opportunity to convey their views.  Work on the discussion paper is at an advanced stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this important matter.  Like anyone else involved in public life for a long number of years, I have been conscious of the serious problem of adult literacy through the individual cases I come across and the heroic work of voluntary <Col N="566" /> organisations which are trying to combat the problem but the recently published report, Education 2000 &mdash; The International Adult Literacy Survey: Results for Ireland, confirmed what I have long suspected, that the scale and extent of the problem is far greater than most people realise.</P>
      <P>At a time when this country is receiving such praise from within and without for its economic successes in recent years and the part played in this by our education system, it should bring us back to earth with a bump to find that, according to the OECD, one-quarter of Irish adults aged between 16 and 64 years have the literacy skills of an average 12 year old.  What is more, the report found that those with the poorest skills are not even aware of their deficiency.  One-quarter of adults were at level one on the scale of literacy and would have difficulty in undertaking such basic but essential tasks as reading the correct dosage of medicine from the information printed on a package.  The report also disclosed that participation in adult education in Ireland was among the lowest in the countries surveyed at less than half the average.</P>
      <P>Adult literacy is a difficult problem with which to deal.  It is often endured in secret, frequently hidden from other family members.  Yet, the consequences for those who have low levels of literacy are enormous, both economic and social. Apart from the obvious disadvantage it presents in terms of employment prospects or training opportunities, those who cannot adequately read or write are cut off from a range of social, recreational and leisure activities.  In addition to being denied the joys of books and newspapers, finding out what is on television or the local cinema becomes a major task, reading a programme at a match an impossibility.  The ability to adequately read and write should be something a civilised society should be able to guarantee.  A society that will not deliver on that guarantee is failing its people.</P>
      <P>Against the background of the scale of the problem highlighted by the OECD, the work being done at national level by AONTAS, the National Adult Literacy Agency and by scores of local bodies such as the Clondalkin Adult Education Centre in my constituency, takes on added importance.  One hundred and forty people use the Clondalkin Adult Education Centre.  I suspect this is only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those doing trojan work in these bodies have been bitterly disappointed at the allocation for the adult literacy and community education budget.  The allocation in the current year was £2.315 million and for 1998 it has been increased by just £70,000.  This is inadequate as it will have to be divided between 100 adult literacy schemes in 38 vocational education committee areas. Grant-in-aid to NALA and four other organisations involved in adult education will be increased by just £91,000, bringing the total available for the five organisations to £400,000.  This is inadequate to deliver the level of services <Col N="567" /> required because of the scale of the need involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science recently announced an allocation of £250 million for investment in technology education. Everybody accepts this is the minimum required but we also need to address the educational needs of the community at a much more basic level.  It is a particular slap in the face to those involved that, at a time of relative plenty, so little should be allocated to their needs.  Neither does it make economic or social sense.  If we do not set about seriously tackling problems such as adult literacy when things are relatively good, what chance will we have of dealing with them when times are less good, as inevitably they will be?</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has an interest in this area and probably fought his corner in the course of the recent Estimates debate but I appeal to him to re-examine the position before the Revised Book of Estimates is published.  The joint demands from ALA and Aontas for a doubling of the adult literacy and community education budget over the next three years from its current level to approximately £4 million is perfectly reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, Deputy Rabbitte is eloquent but, unfortunately on this occasion, his information is out of date.  Of course, I agree with him when he said that an increased allocation of £70,000 &mdash; which was exactly what his Government provided last year &mdash; is totally inadequate.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for adult education, I have been conscious of the scale and extent of the problem of adult literacy.  The fact that it is greater than realised was highlighted by the publication in October of the OECD report, to which Deputy Rabbitte referred.  The position in Ireland compares unfavourably with that in many other developed countries.</P>
      <P>At the same time I have also been conscious of the scarcity of resources which leaves the adult literacy service, as it is operated through the vocational education committees, unable to cater for all who seek literacy tuition.  It is able to cater only minimally for those who are enrolled.  In addition, there is a significant number who are in need of encouragement to come forward for help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an initial response to the OECD report, the Government allocated an additional £250,000 for the adult education service, to be spent by vocational education committees on literacy and basic education for adults in 1997.  I am sure that the vocational education committees are making very good use of this money.  This allocation is additional to the £2.065 million already provided for adult literacy and is intended to increase public <Col N="568" /> awareness of the importance of literacy in the modern world.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware, and if it is not should be, from the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance that an additional £2 million has now been provided for the adult literacy service for 1998, nearly doubling the provision made in respect of that service for 1997.  This means that rather than doubling the budget over three years, as Deputy Rabbitte suggested, we have doubled it in the first year.  I will continue my endeavours to secure further increases in resources to alleviate the overall position.</P>

The outcome of these consultations will have a major impact on the content of the final document.</P>
      <P>Both I and my Department are very aware of the serious implications, social, economic and personal, of the literacy problem for this country.

      <P>The Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, governs the opening hours of retail establishments.  The Act provides for a ban on Sunday trading for most shops but gives the Minister power, by order, to add to the list of exempted businesses or to exempt specified regions from the provisions of the Act. An order made later that year exempted the entire country from the provisions of the Act and effectively removed all restrictions on Sunday trading.  This remains the position.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that concerns expressed about the growth of Sunday trading in recent years might be addressed by reintroducing controls under the 1938 Act.  However, the previous Government obtained legal advice to the effect that distinctions between shops for the purposes of Sunday trading on the basis of type or size would be vulnerable to constitutional challenge. For this reason it took the view, when it included certain provisions on Sunday working in the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, that any difficulties to which the increase in Sunday trading had given rise could, and should, be dealt with as conditions of employment issues.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State at my Department, met representatives of IBEC and ICTU in September last to review the position of trading and working on Sundays in the retail sector.  Following such meetings, he wrote to both parties on 9 October inviting them to open discussions with a view to exploring the possibility of an agreement addressing the issue being entered into between employer and employee representatives of the main players in the sector.</P>
      <P>ICTU responded on 6 November 1997 to the effect that they would be happy to enter into discussions. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, wrote further to the Director General of IBEC on 1 December pressing for an early response to his proposal.</P>
      <P>The positive approach adopted to date by both sides in their discussions with the Minister of State is to be commended.  I am satisfied that the partnership approach, rather than an attempted legislative solution, offers the most realistic prospect of progress on this contentious issue.  I await developments with interest.</P>

      <P>The major determinant of insurance costs is the frequency and costs of claims.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on <i>An Economic Evaluation of Insurance Costs in Ireland</i> provides the policy framework for addressing insurance cost and availability issues.  A number of the report's recommendations were made in the knowledge that, to successfully pursue their implementation, a process of consultation with the social partners, the insurance industry and other interested parties, including other Departments, was necessary.</P>
      <P>In relation to the impact of the insurance cost burden on industry, the report found that small firms pay disproportionately higher insurance premiums than larger companies.  The report recommended that small businesses should establish or join affinity groups to strengthen their collective bargaining power with insurers and that they should seek to improve their risk management procedures through greater awareness of and compliance with health and safety standards. Following these recommendations, a number of special affinity schemes have already been successfully established, such as the affinity scheme for the services and self-employed sector of ISME, which was launched earlier this year.</P>
      <P>In relation to health and safety matters, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report referred to resource inadequacies of the Health and Safety Authority compared to its UK counterpart.  Steps have been taken to strengthen the Health and Safety Authority's resources and the number of inspectors will shortly be increased by the appointment of four additional inspectors.  The Health and Safety Authority continues to pursue a programme of education and training to effect a change in attitudes to health and safety in the workplace.</P>
      <P>A workplace safety group, under the chairmanship of IBEC, with representation from the ICTU, the Health and Safety Authority and the insurance division of my Department has made recommendations broadly in line with the general thrust of the recommendations of the the Deloitte &amp; Touche report in the areas of accident prevention, claims handling and the promotion of a safety culture in the workplace.  The working group is consulting the Irish Insurance Federation with a view to securing recognition for the proposed code of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key element in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report was the recommendation in regard to the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal to deal with insurance compensation claims in a non-adversarial manner.  As a follow-up to this recommendation, <Col N="571" /> a special working group has already made recommendations in relation to the establishment of an occupational injuries mediation service.  These recommendations are being progressed in consultation with the relevant interests. As a second stage of its remit, the group will examine issues surrounding other alternative or complementary systems for delivering personal injury compensation in Ireland that could provide the basis for a more efficient and cost effective delivery system.</P>

      <P>As I informed this House in November, Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to establish a high-level group, representative of interested parties, to consider proposals by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions concerning trade union recognition and the right to bargain.  This group, established last July under the auspices of the Department of the Taioseach, is representative of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance as well as my Department, ICTU, IBEC, IDA-Ireland and Forbairt.  I am represented on the group through my officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of union recognition is clearly a complex one and my officials are giving every assistance in the group to the social partners in their endeavours to arrive at mutually acceptable solutions. The group will report to me by the end of 1997, as well as to the monitoring arrangements <Col N="572" /> for Partnership 2000.  I look forward to receiving its advice.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the concerns which the Deputy has expressed. I am asking the Director of Consumer Affairs and the National Standards Authority of Ireland jointly to review the issue of flammability of clothing in general and to make recommendations on any further steps that might be taken in our efforts to avoid a recurrence of the recent tragedy.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Research and Standards (section 44) (Children's Night-dresses) (Amendment) Order, 1979, prohibits the manufacture, assembly or sale of children's night-dresses unless they comply with the flammability requirements of Irish Standard 148.  This standard also defines children's night-dress in terms of age and measurability and invokes an earlier Standard (I. S. 128 of 1966) which contains provisions on flammability and defines flame resistance ratings and durability.</P>
      <P>The flammability of clothing generally, and children's clothing particularly, is of serious concern to safety enforcement practitioners.  A real difficulty in addressing it is the wide range and styles of clothing and materials, man-made and natural.  It would be a major task to prepare suitable standards to comprehensively cover the full range of apparel.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some manufacturers and retail outlets have begun to attach labels to clothing, especially children's clothing, advising consumers of the flammable nature of materials being used. Voluntary action by the clothing industry in this regard is something I strongly encourage.</P>

    <P>I am fully conscious of the need to ensure the <Col N="576" /> most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities. In this respect, I have spoken to the chief executive officers of both IDA Ireland and Forbairt. I have impressed on them the crucial importance which this Government attaches to making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country.  I am satisfied that this message is fully understood and that the industrial development agencies involved are doing all they can to realise a more balanced regional distribution of jobs.</P>
    <P>The IDA and Forbairt are structured on a regional basis.  In addition, the achievement of a better regional redistribution of jobs across the country requires a strong co-operative approach between the industrial development agencies, the local authorities and infrastructure/service providers, including those of skills training.</P>
    <P>For its part, IDA Ireland is encouraging visiting companies to look at many locations across the country before making decisions on location and is favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way possible, including the higher grant levels as appropriate; with the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations; working closely with local authorities to have quality sites available at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>

      <P>Irish companies trading on the home market face no barriers to trade since the country is a single market with no tariff barriers, uniform technical and other standards and a single currency.  A similar situation obtains within the European Union's Single Market &mdash; the most important market for our exporters &mdash; and will be further consolidated with the introduction in 1999 of a common European currency.  The EU Single Market is now effectively an extended home market for our exporters.  However, exporters can sometimes face non-tariff barriers in the Single Market.  For example, individual member states sometimes fail to implement the principle of mutual recognition of standards, whereby a product which is approved for sale in one member state should be free to circulate throughout the Single Market. Where such difficulties are brought to my Department's attention, they are actively pursued with the member state concerned and-or with the EU Commission.  Examples of barriers faced by Irish companies in the Single Market were given <Col N="577" /> in a 1995 survey which IBEC carried out at the request of the former Department of Tourism and Trade.</P>
      <P>Irish exporters can face an array of tariff and non-tariff barriers on non-EU markets.  Irish companies benefit from the EU's efforts to open markets in third countries through its Common Commercial Policy, which is implemented by the Commission in close co-operation with member states, and especially through its new Market Access Strategy.  Ireland participates actively in the various EU trade fora with a view to ensuring that our economic interests are promoted in the development and implementation of the Common Commercial Policy and that significant barriers to Irish exports are addressed as part of the EU's Market Access Strategy.</P>
      <P>The World Trade Organization is a key instrument of EU policy.  Through a succession of trade &lsquo;rounds&rsquo;, it has succeeded in bringing about a gradual lowering of tariff and non-tariff barriers. It also provides a forum for the resolution of trade disputes.</P>
      <P>Specific problems faced by individual Irish exporters are also pursued bilaterally through diplomatic and other channels.</P>

      <P>Early this year, a professional consultancy study identified the need to increase the staffing complement in the Companies Registration Office (CRO) to 120.  In April, the then Government accepted a recommendation from my Department to this effect. Since the transfer of the office from Dublin Castle to Parnell Square in June of this year, some 30 extra staff have been recruited.  Staff now number 110, the highest number ever serving.</P>
      <P>In addition, the CRO's IT system is being completely replaced.  Work commenced on site last January, and it is expected that the changeover to the new system will be in February next year.  The two principal factors which are being built into the new system are reliability and increased speed of access.</P>
      <P>With its increased staff and improved IT resources, I am satisfied that the CRO will be in a position from the early months of next year to handle its ongoing workload and to offer a much improved service to its clients.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a vast and comprehensive block of health and safety legislation in Ireland which adequately meets the requirements necessary to protect our workforce and which conforms to best international practices.  Measures such as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 General Application Regulations and the 1995 Construction Regulations provide a solid legislative framework by which effective and co-ordinated management of all construction projects can be ensured, and by which health and safety standards can be set.  It is the primary duty of <Col N="579" /> every individual employer to identify and manage the health and safety needs of his or her own business.</P>
    <P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is responsible for the enforcement of all occupational health and safety legislation. The Authority works to a targeted annual work programme and focuses on sectors with high accident rates, in particular, of course, the construction sector.  In 1996 there were over 4,500 formal inspections carried out in the construction sector.  This was the highest figure for any single sector.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady increase in the funding and staff allocated to the Authority since its inception.  In 1990, Exchequer funding amounted to £2.3 million and in 1998 it will amount to £4.7 million.  In addition, Government sanction has been secured to enable the Authority to increase its total staff to 119 with effect from 1 January 1998.  This will represent an increase of 20 per cent in approximately three years and an overall increase of 55 per cent in the last eight years.  In addition, the Authority has recently made a comprehensive submission on their future staffing needs which is being studied by my officials.</P>
    <P>In relation to the adequacy or otherwise of the penalties provided for in relation to breaches of health and safety legislation, the fine provided for on summary conviction &mdash; up to £1,500 &mdash; is the maximum permissible where a case is prosecuted in this way.  The legislation also provides for fines on conviction on indictment for which no maximum monetary amounts are prescribed. Convictions on indictment may also be punishable in certain circumstances by a term of imprisonment of up to two years.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that there is any need to change or amend what is fundamentally good legislation &mdash; legislation which provides effective mechanisms for both prevention of workplace accidents and punishment for breaches of the legislation. What I would like to see, however, is a full commitment from all employers to fulfil both their legal and moral obligations in relation to the health and safety of their workforce.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> Already the Minister for State at my Department with responsibility for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs has secured the agreement of all sections of the drinks trade to implement a code of practice governing the marketing, promotion and sale of alcoholic drink, particularly alcopops, beers, ciders, coolers and spirit pre-mixers which can be particularly appealing to under-age drinkers.  To ensure its successful implementation the Minister of State has appointed an independent arbitration panel to adjudicate on any complaints about breaches of the code.  The code was launched by the Minister of State on 24 November and a copy has been placed in the Library.  Providied the Amsterdam Treaty is approved by referendum, the Minister of State intends to convene a major forum to determine how the enhanced protections contained in the treaty can be translated into a rapid and tangible action programme which will benefit European consumers.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to competition legislation namely the Competition Act, 1991 and the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The 1991 Competition Act prohibits anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position.  Section 4 of the Act prohibits and makes void all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State or in any part of the State.</P>
      <P>Section 5 prohibits the abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The above are the rules of competition as set out in Irish legislation and the Competition Authority was established to implement the provisions of that legislation.  In 1996 competition legislation was strengthened by the passing of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996.  That Act gave the Competition Authority public enforcement functions and provided for the appointment of a <Col N="582" /> director of competition enforcement with appropriate resources in order to give effect to the provisions of competition legislation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 54, 59, 81 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>Any merger invoking a significant element of rationalisation will result in economies of scale and job reductions.  These were among the issues I considered prior to deciding whether to refer the merger to the Competition Authority.  As Deputies are aware, I had discussions with the Avonmore Waterford Group management and trade unions in recent weeks about future employment with a view to seeking to ensure that job losses arising from the merger are kept to the minimum possible.  These contacts are continuing and I have encouraged both sides to approach restructuring on the basis of dialogue and partnership.  I appreciate the constructive approach being adopted by Deputies in the areas affected by closures.</P>
      <P>At my request, Forbairt and other industrial development agencies are working closely with the Avonmore Waterford Group on a range of initiatives designed to address the serious employment issues arising in various areas from the proposed rationalisation.  These initiatives, include the establishment of two task forces, one for the south east and the other for Dublin and the north east, to identify and secure employment replacement projects for areas adversely affected by job losses; provision of enterprise funds by the group and Forbairt to facilitate job creation in new projects; and new group job centres in Dungarvan and Rathfarnham to provide support services, such as retraining, for workers affected by the rationalisation.</P>

      <P>To date in 1997, there were 16 projects announced for the Cork area.  These projects, when fully developed, will create 5,055 jobs which will have a positive impact on employment levels in south-west Cork.</P>
      <P>The year 1997 has been one of the most successful in recent years both in terms of volume and quality of site visits with approximately 70 first time site visits and 56 return site visits by overseas companies to the Cork area.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is very conscious of its responsibility to promote and bring new investors to regional locations and this includes the more remote regions such as south-west Cork.  It is favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way possible, including with higher levels as appropriate; with the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations; and working closely with local authorities to have quality sites available at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
      <P>The number of new greenfield manufacturing projects attracted to Ireland in any year is limited, and the ultimate decision on where to locate lies with the potential investors.  It is important for inward investors to feel that IDA understands their business and needs.  At the same time, realistic efforts are made to influence the choice of location where possible without loss of jobs to the country.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with Cork County Council, the local Chamber of Commerce and FÁS in a determined drive to win additional investment for the county.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the serious concern in Kilkenny city and county at the lack of efforts by the IDA and her Department to provide industrial and manufacturing jobs in the area, particularly in view of the fact that the 650 jobs lost in a company (details supplied) were never fully replaced and in view of the fact that a new industrial site is currently available on the ring road in Kilkenny and other areas appear to receive priority in the allocation of jobs.</Quest>

      <P>The number of overseas jobs in County Kilkenny is disappointing in comparison to other counties.  Despite the best efforts of IDA Ireland to attract significant new overseas investment to the county only one new project was announced for Kilkenny this year. This will potentially employ 150 people at full production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland is very conscious of its responsibility to promote and bring new investors to regional locations.  Investors are encouraged to look at many locations across the country, Kilkenny included, during the process of their decision making.  However, decisions on where to locate are made by potential IDA Ireland clients <Col N="585" /> on the basis of competitive advantage.  The one clear factor which will influence the location of projects is the level of industrial competitiveness an area can offer by way of infrastructure and a positive business environment.</P>
    <P>To enhance the attractiveness of Kilkenny to potential investors, IDA Ireland has purchased the site referred to by the Deputy for development of a new business park in 1998.  Planning permission is currently awaited for this site and when approved will be actively marketed by IDA Ireland for overseas investment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 72 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, FÁS has operated an &ldquo;Action Programme for Women&rdquo; to maximise the participation of women in all its programmes.  FÁS has also been providing courses such as &ldquo;Return to Work&rdquo; and &ldquo;Enterprise Training&rdquo;, which have a high proportion of female participation, particularly among home-makers.</P>
      <P>In 1996, 12,838 women participated in FÁS training programmes, which represents 43,3 per cent of total participation.  In recent years, FÁS has tried to promote and improve flexibility in an effort to maximise the various provisions for training for women.  In a recent example of the initiatives being taken, FÁS has advised me that they are undertaking a pilot programme aimed at developing and testing new ways of delivering training for women.  This particular initiative, which is being piloted under the &ldquo;NOW&rdquo; or new opportunities for women programme, aims to provide locally based training in partnership with community groups.  This training is delivered in a flexible manner to suit the varied needs and circumstances of participants.  The project is currently operating in Clonmel, Tipperary and Athlone.  If successful, FÁS proposes to introduce this approach on a national basis and, by so doing, will allow a large number of women to avail of training in a cost effective manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS is also very conscious of the need for childcare facilities for women returning to work, <Col N="586" /> and contributes over £5 million per annum to community-based childcare provision by way of support for CE projects.  Over 130 CE projects have such a childcare dimension.  Many of these facilities provide community based childcare for women undertaking training or education.</P>
    <P>Through its action programme, FÁS has continually sought more and better ways of meeting women's training and employment needs and the fact the number of women participating on FÁS training programmes as a percentage of total participation is increasing at 43.3 per cent shows that its efforts are bearing fruit.</P>
    <P>A working group chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is now looking at the issue of women's access to labour market opportunities and should report to the Government in mid-1998.  The working group includes social partner representation, including the National Women's Council of Ireland.  The group's recommendations should help the Government plan our strategy for the integration of women into all forms of training and employment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has responsibility for policy in relation to the development of the designated partnership areas.  Notwithstanding that, it is true that 16 out of the 18 current local employment service areas are situated in partnership areas and, in terms of management structure, operate as sub-committees of the main partnership boards.  My Department has been overseeing the development of the local employment service networks.  The bulk of funding for the LES networks does not come from EU sources.</P>
      <P>In general, the LES network is growing and developing in terms of client case-load and the range and quality of work being done.  To date contact has been made with 14,200 people.  A total of 4,822 have been placed in jobs and a further 4,277 are currently active on the general LES case-load system.  I believe this represents a satisfactory rate of placement for a service dealing with the most disadvantaged people, often in unemployment blackspots.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, there is a commitment in Partnership 2000 to expand the LES Service to all partnership areas during the lifetime of the agreement.  In this connection, my officials recently met a delegation from PLANET, the umbrella organisation which represents all the partnership areas, to discuss the further expansion of the LES network during 1998.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware of contacts on this matter between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and between my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and his British counterpart.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at my Department with responsibility for single market matters, Deputy Tom Kitt, has written to Commissioner Mario Monti expressing his deep concern, and that of the Government, at the impact on the functioning of the Internal Market of the current disruption to the free passage of Irish goods at UK ports. He has asked that the Commissioner and his colleagues take all possible steps to ensure that the rules of the Internal Market are respected by all member states.  Minister of State Kitt has also spoken directly to his British opposite number, Lord Simon, to express the Government's deep concern at the obstruction to the free flow of goods.</P>
      <P>The obstruction of the free flow of goods is a fundamental breach of one of the core principles set out in the EU Treaties.  I am satisfied that the British Government is fully aware of its responsibilities in this regard.

      <P>The policy of my Department in the field of intellectual property is to ensure, in conjunction with the Patents Office, that the formulation and implementation of policy for intellectual property protection meets the needs of Irish business and industry, as well as other interests, and to ensure that innovation in industry and commerce is assisted and encouraged by intellectual property policy.  The overall objective is to provide an efficient and effective system of intellectual property protection <Col N="589" /> in Ireland, in the context of our broader obligations in this area under European Union and international law.</P>
      <P>My Department with the Patents Office, plays an active part in the formulation of EU and international law in relation to intellectual property.  I should particularly mention that under Ireland's recent EU Presidency, officers of the Department had a major role in the Community's preparations for the major Diplomatic Conference held under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organisation at Geneva in December 1996 and in leading the Community's interest in the course of that Conference, which resulted in agreement on new treaties in relation to the protection of copyright and of rights in performances and phonograms.</P>
      <P>Major actions in recent times have included the passage of the Patents Act, 1992, and the Trade Marks Act, 1996.  This legislation had as its objective the modernisation of Ireland's systems of patents and trade marks protection, and the attainment of compliance with our obligations in these fields under international and EU law.  The major project of my Department at present in the intellectual property field is the preparation of a new Copyright and Related Rights Bill, which aims to achieve the same results in the field of copyright.  This Bill will be major legislation which is expected to run to approximately 400 sections.  In view of the importance of copyright for industry and commerce in the information age, the preparation of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill is a matter of high priority in the context of my Department as a whole.</P>
      <P>Other forthcoming actions in the field of intellectual property policy are, the ratification of the Madrid Protocol on the registration of international trade marks, which will facilitate Irish trade mark proprietors and brand owners in securing international protection of their marks, and the preparation of modernising legislation in relation to industrial designs.  Work in these areas will advance as quickly as possible, subject to the overriding priority attaching to the preparation of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 76 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The adequate provision of venture capital for growth orientated businesses is a vital ingredient in the development of enterprise in this country. I am glad to note that the supply of venture capital in Ireland has improved significantly over the past five years or so.  I would particularly like to mention in this regard the seed-venture capital measure under the current Operational Programme for Industry under which eight venture capital funds, comprised of both public and private sector finance, have so far been launched and are in the market place, three of which have been launched since 1 September of this year.</P>
      <P>Seed capital is the earliest, and riskiest, stage of the venture capital cycle.  That is why investors are still apprehensive about investing in companies at the seed capital stage and why the enhancement of seed capital supply was prioritised in the Government's action programme.  In this context my Department is currently examining a number of options which, if they come to fruition, will significantly improve the provision of seed capital for early stage business and I would hope to be able to report more fully on these options during 1998.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will no doubt also be aware of the measures announced in this year's budget which will enhance the provision of seed capital and promote the supply of risk capital generally. The reduction in the aggregate amount that can be raised under the business expansion scheme from £1,000,000 to £250,000 will achieve a better targeting of BES relief on smaller companies who continually find it difficult to raise equity finance from other sources.</P>
      <P>In addition the reduction in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent will contribute significantly towards increased investment across the economy, including the development capital needs of the small business sector.  I am, therefore, happy to report the progress made to date in our efforts to increase the supply of capital to emerging business operations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 83 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The latest figures available from FÁS are for the year 1996.  These figures indicate that approximately 30,000 persons, an increase of approximately 15 per cent on the previous year, completed FÁS training courses in that year.  Of this number, approximately 12,500, 41 per cent were on mainstream training courses, for example, specific skills training, focused on employment and employment related skills.  The last follow-up survey, completed in mid-1997, showed that 75 per cent of trainees on such mainstream courses were in employment 18 months later.</P>
      <P>The remaining 17,500 were on training courses from which immediate full time employment was not a primary objective.  These courses included foundation skills, work experience or other support measures.  In certain circumstances, FÁS would consider that progression to a higher skills level may be a more desirable outcome for trainees than immediate placement in low paid employment.  However, approximately 50 per cent of this group were placed at the end of their courses.  Follow up surveys show that approximately 25 per cent of the group progressed onto further FÁS programmes or returned to education.</P>
      <P>While there is always room for improvement in the numbers securing long-term employment, I am satisfied that FÁS is acting in the best interests of its trainees and making every effort to increase the placement rates for participants where appropriate.</P>

      <P>The code of conduct referred to by the Deputy was agreed between the European Apparel and Textile Organisation and the European Trade Union Federation of Textiles, Clothing and Leather.

In agreeing to the code, the parties undertook to work towards a European textile and clothing industry that is productive, internationally competitive and based on the respect of both workers and employers. <Col N="593" /> The code of conduct calls upon the companies and workers of the European Textile and Clothing Industry to comply with the following ILO Conventions:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 78, 85 and 86 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community Employment is the main labour market intervention by the State on behalf of the long-term unemployed.  Its primary objective is to provide those whom the programme is targeted at with a temporary placement where they can update existing skills, develop some new skills and obtain a recent track record of work experience which will enhance their prospects of obtaining a job.  Community employment is not <Col N="595" /> a substitute for work.  Its function is to prepare participants for mainstream jobs.</P>
    <P>The Community Employment programme was given a more targeted focus with effect from 1996 on foot of the recommendations of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment.  The programme now consists of the following two options.  The part-time integration option, which provides 30,000 places, is aimed at long-term unemployed people with reasonable prospects of employment and whose prospects of obtaining mainstream employment would be enhanced by participation on the programme.  This lasts for one year.  Under this option up to 10 per cent of participants can be re-engaged for a second year provided FÁS are satisfied they are key participants on a project or that their prospects of employment would be enhanced by an additional period on the programme.  The part-time job option which provides 10,000 places, is aimed at long-term unemployed people with poor employment prospects.  Under this option participants, who have an annual contract of engagement, can have their contract reviewed for up to three years.</P>
    <P>We must constantly examine the quality and targeting of community employment in the light of our dynamic jobs growth and falling long-term unemployment.  For that reason I have set in train a comprehensive external review of community employment, and I expect to have the conclusions before summer of next year.  Pending this, it would be inappropriate to initiate any change in the current way community employment is structured.</P>
    <P>A commitment to establish a 25,000 place programme paying the going rate for the job is included in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium.  We aim to achieve that commitment by progressively increasing the number of people on the community employment programme who will be paid the rate for the job.</P>
    <P>The community employment programme is under continuous review in the light of the dynamics in the labour market arising from our booming economy.  Against this background the &ldquo;rate for the job&rdquo; initiative will be introduced.  I should add that last week's budget provided for 2,000 additional places on community employment. I assure the Deputy that any further action which I will take in this area will be driven by the need to ensure better opportunities for the long-term unemployed.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission published its Communication on Worker Information and Consultation in November 1995 with a view to developing the information and consultation of workers in EU based companies not already covered by the EU Works Council Directive.</P>
      <P>The Commission launched the first phase of consultations with the EU social partners, who represent trade unions, employers and publicly owned companies, under the Agreement on Social Policy in June of this year.  The Commission has decided to launch the second phase of consultations with the EU social partners, formally requesting the social partners to enter negotiations on a framework agreement on worker information and consultation.  The Commission launched this second phase on 6 November last and the social partners have nine months in which to respond.  If the social partners commence negotiations and reach a framework agreement, the Council of Ministers is empowered to give legal effect to that agreement, if it so decides.</P>
      <P>My approach now is to await the outcome of the developments at EU level that I have already outlined.  However, worker information and consultation in individual companies can assist competitiveness and the development of more positive management and employee relations.  It is important that companies and their employees are enabled to develop information and consultation arrangements which suit their needs. Therefore, I must stress that any legislation in this area, EU or otherwise, should not seek to impose particular models of information and consultation on individual companies.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the enterprise partnership commitments included in Partnership 2000. Basically, these commitments seek to promote partnership at the level of enterprise, but do not seek to impose any one structure or model of such partnership.</P>

      <P>As indicated in reply to previous questions on this matter, my colleague, Deputy Kitt, the Minister with responsibility for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs, met representatives of both IBEC and ICTU in September last to review the position of trading and working on Sundays in the retail sector. Following such meetings, he wrote to both <Col N="597" /> parties on 9 October, inviting them to open discussions with a view to exploring the possibility of an agreement addressing the issue being entered into between employer and employee representatives of the main players in the sector.</P>
      <P>ICTU responded on 6 November 1997 to the effect that it would be happy to enter discussions. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt wrote further to the director general of IBEC on 1 December 1997 pressing for an early response to his proposal. The positive approach adopted to date by both sides in their discussions with Minister Kitt is to be commended.  I am satisfied that the partnership approach, rather than an attempted legislative solution, offers the most realistic prospect of progress on this contentious issue.

      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 was made under the Restrictive Practices Acts to regulate competition in the groceries sector. The order bans the selling, or advertising for sale, of grocery goods below cost with the exception of certain specified goods including perishable foodstuffs such as fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and fish.  It also prohibits such practices as &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;, boycotting and sets out provisions for controls on terms and conditions of supply.  The order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The groceries order was last reviewed in February 1995, after which the then Minister announced his intention to retain the order for a further two years. The order is, among other matters, currently being reviewed by the Competition and Mergers Review Group established in September 1996.

      <P>Such principles are currently enshrined in our competition legislation comprising the Competition Act 1991 and the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996.  The legislation is based by analogy on articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and is the cornerstone of our domestic competition policy.</P>
      <P>The Independent Competition Authority was established under the 1991 Act in order to implement competition legislation.  Initially, its principal function was to adjudicate on agreements and arrangements notified to it by undertakings but since 1996 the authority has a proactive public enforcement function also.  The Director of Competition Enforcement has been appointed with appropriate resources in order to give effect to the public enforcement provisions of the legislation.</P>
      <P>There is currently further work ongoing in this area.  The competition and mergers review group established in September 1996 has the following terms of reference: to review and make recommendations on the mergers legislation in the context of a legislative consolidation; the effectiveness of competition legislation and associated regulations; cultural matters in the context of the 1991 Act and in particular section 4(2) of that Act; and appropriate structures for implementing the above legislation.</P>
      <P>The group may commission detailed sectoral studies as required and will also, in its work, review the evolution of competition policy at EU and global level.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the review group is to make recommendations designed to further improve our competition regime in terms of its legislative provisions and its structures.  The treatment of mergers under competition law and the consolidation and improvement of mergers legislation will be central to this work.</P>
      <P>The group will also review the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996 in terms of their effectiveness, including the strucutures and methods of application.</P>
      <P>The group will also review the position of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, particularly the below cost selling aspects of the order and make appropriate recommendations in this regard for the future.  The group expects to report to me in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my responsibility in this area relates to the Information Society Commission established earlier this year on foot of a recommendation contained in the report of the Information Society Ireland steering committee.</P>
      <P>The commission has been asked to benchmark progress towards achieving the full potential of the information society and to recommend changes in legislation to remove obstacles on the use of information and communication technologies. It will also advise on measures to increase access to information technology, particularly measures in the education area aimed at those groups in society who experience disadvantage. The commission will also monitor the development of the necessary infrastructure into the new millennium.</P>
      <P>It is finalising an interim report which will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, support will be provided to State agencies to allow them to meet the objectives of the information society.  The SMI Working Group on Information Technology is finalising its recommendations on the implications of the information society for Government Departments and offices.  The areas identified by the SMI Working Group on Information Technology regarding the potential for service delivery in a number of areas include: greater use of web sites by Departments and Offices; access to public procurement information electronically; and use of electronic media to process actual business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supports which will be put in place to allow Government Departments and offices to achieve <Col N="601" /> the objectives contained in the Information Society Ireland report and the strategic management initiative will include ongoing investment in infrastructure and new technologies, a more strategic approach to IT project appraisal in order to maximise value for money, improvements to the way in which staff IT skills are acquired and developed within the Civil Service and development of clear guidelines and targets for the transaction of public business.</P>
    <P>It is equally important that all sections of society in all areas of the country have physical access to services and the requisite skills to avail of them.  Through the deployment of technology and the Government's very substantial investment in the Schools IT 2000 programme, I believe we will make real progress in this regard.</P>

      <P>The society in question was registered by the Registrar of Friendly Societies in November 1971 under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893-1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these Acts, there is no function vested in any regulatory authority for the monitoring of the operations of an industrial and provident society.  The onus is on a society to abide by its own registered rules.  I am informed by the registrar that the rules of the society in question provide a mechanism for the resolution of internal disputes.  The rules specify however that disputes shall not be referred to the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  The rules also provide for the registrar to inspect the books of the society and to appoint <Col N="603" /> an inspector to examine its books or to call a special meeting of the society, as provided for in the 1893 Act, on the application of a specified number of members, provided he is satisfied that the application is well-founded.  I understand that no such application has been received by the registrar.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that the member concerned was in contact with the Registry of Friendly Societies earlier this year and was advised to seek professional advice in relation to any impropriety which he thought might be going on within the society.  The member also suggested that the number of members in the society has been reduced below the statutory minimum of seven.  I understand that this matter is being pursued by the registrar, along with the matter of the society's outstanding annual returns.</P>

      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, employers at all places of work have a general duty of care to ensure that the design, provision and maintenance of plant and machinery are, so far as reasonably practicable, safe and without risk to health.</P>
      <P>The existing procedures dealing with the inspection of manual handling equipment are found in the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980.  Under these Acts mechanical handling equipment which is used in places of work such as factories, docks and construction work must be thoroughly examined by a competent person.  The minimum periods between these statutory examinations varies as regards different types of mechanical handling equipment.</P>
      <P>The examination of mechanical handling equipment will, however, be extended to other places of work with the implementation, by December 1998, of Council Directive 95/63/EC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work.  This is an administrative matter rather than a policy issue.  The Health and Safety Authority which deals with the day to day administration of occupational health and safety legislation regularly reviews its enforcement procedures.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the European Union's Common Commercial Policy, decisions in relation to multilateral trade are mostly taken at EU level and involves close co-operation between member states and the EU Commission.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment ensures that Irish interests are taken into account when decisions are reached that affect the external trade policy of the EU.  Through the EU's Common Commercial Policy, and in particular its market access strategy, Irish companies benefit from increased access to non-EU markets.  This is <Col N="605" /> particularly important given Ireland's heavy dependence on exports.</P>
      <P>The European Union's trade strategy is clearly set out in its document <i>The Global Challenge of International Trade: A Market Access Strategy for the European Union,</i> which was presented in February 1996.  The strategy is based on a sharper focus on access by the union, with action being taken both bilaterally and multilaterally.  Priorities for multilateral action include: full implementation and consolidation of the Uruguay Round results; strengthening the World Trade organisation, WTO, <i>inter alia,</i> by encouraging the entry of new members; further market-opening action through the WTO in the areas of financial services, basic telecommunications, maritime transport, rules and disciplines in relation to trade in services, rules of origin, tariff reductions, Government procurement and intellectual property; and, aiming for progress on the &ldquo;new agenda&rdquo; items of trade and investment, trade and competition, trade and environment, trade and labour standards and coherence between trade and monetary-financial policies.  These priorities are being actively pursued through the WTO and in various bilateral contacts with trading partners.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for the administration and enforcement of a broad range of protective labour legislation. The legislation covers such areas as holidays, unfair dismissal, minimum notice, terms of employment, protection of young persons and payment of wages.  Enforcement of the legislation is carried out through routine inspections and the <Col N="606" /> investigation of complaints.  In addition to such activities, various legislative provisions enable my Department to act on behalf of an employee whose employer has failed to honour a decision-determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>My Department also enforces employment regulations orders and registered employment agreements made under the Industrial Relations Acts.  These orders set out minimum pay and conditions in traditionally low-paid or unorganised areas of employment such as clothing, catering, hotels, hairdressing, retail grocery and allied trades and agriculture.  Registered agreements also set out legally binding rates of pay.</P>
      <P>The employment rights information unit of my Department operates an information service to answer inquiries from people about employment rights legislation and to inform people of the rights and obligations of employees and employers under the legislation.  Details of the EROs and REAs may be located on Network 2 Aertel, page 555.  The labour inspectorate, which enforces EROs and REAs, also operates a freephone 1800 275 375 to deal with queries in this area.</P>
      <P>A revised guide to labour law, which updates a previous guide was published by the Department in September, 1997 and is available from the information unit.  The guide provides a summary, in straightforward and non-technical terms, of the main provisions of labour law for which my Department is responsible.  The guide is very useful as a quick reference guide to employers and employees alike in the labour law area.  More detailed explanatory leaflets on individual pieces of labour law are also available from the information unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully conscious of the need to ensure the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities. In this respect, I have spoken to the chief executive officers of both IDA Ireland and Forbairt. I have impressed on them the crucial importance which this Government attaches to making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country.  I am satisfied that this message is fully understood and that the industrial development agencies involved are doing all that they can to realise a more balanced regional distribution of jobs.</P>
      <P>Both the IDA and Forbairt are structured on a regional basis.  In addition, the achievement of a better regional redistribution of jobs across the country requires a strong co-operative approach between the industrial development agencies, the local authorities and infrastructure-service providers, including those of skills training.</P>
      <P>For its part, IDA Ireland is encouraging visiting companies to look at many locations across the country before making decisions on location and is:</P>
      <P>favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way possible, including with higher grant levels as appropriate;</P>
      <P>with the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations and,</P>
      <P>working closely with local authorities to have quality sites available at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
      <P>While it is recognised that final decisions on where to locate geographically rest with overseas investors, based primarily on the competitiveness and general level of attractiveness of individual locations, I am satisfied that present policy is impacting on the regional spread of jobs.  As an example, in November alone I announced industrial investments for Galway, Tralee, Westport, Shannon, Cork and Mullingar.  These will involve the creation of a total of more than 4,000 jobs in the period immediately ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the south-east region there have been eight projects announced by IDA Ireland to <Col N="608" /> date in 1997.  These projects, which are to locate in Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow and South Tipperary, will create more than 1,400 jobs when fully developed.  This will have a positive impact on employment levels in the region.</P>
    <P>In addition, the IDA is developing sites and facilities at Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford.  These will enhance the attractiveness of the south-east region to potential overseas investors. The IDA will actively market these to potential investors to ensure that suitable industries are found for these locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>For 1998, the county enterprise board have been allocated £21.243 million, an increase of £0.092 million on the original 1997 Estimates allocation of £21.151 million.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Small Business and Trade considered a Supplementary Estimate of £1.5 million for the county enterprise boards on 4 December 1997, which is to go before the House for approval today.  The Supplementary Estimate, if approved, will increase the expected outturn for the CEBs in 1997 to £22.651 million.</P>
      <P>In addition to the allocation provided for in subhead G1 of my Department's Vote, it is worth noting that the county enterprise boards have access to a separate line of funding for their activities under measure 4 of sub-programme 1 of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99.  The boards' activities in management development training are co-financed by the ESF and receipts from the European Union are paid out of a suspense account administered by my Department.  Receipts from the European Social Fund are expected to exceed £1 million in 1998, a figure broadly comparable to expenditure in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to understand that expenditure projections for the county enterprise boards over any twelve month period may vary in accordance with the level and maturation for payment of the projects which have already been approved, taken together with the drawdown against those yet to be approved in the year ahead.  Since 1996, it has been the practice for county enterprise boards to consider applications for financial assistance on a phased basis throughout the year.  The stabilisation of this process in the course of 1997 has had the effect of reducing pressure on the 1998 Estimates, while ensuring that there will be adequate provision for a reasonable carryover of newly approved projects into <Col N="609" /> 1999 &mdash; the final year of the Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development.</P>

      <P>I recently met the chairman of the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative, who presented me with a copy of its interim report.  I expressed my appreciation to the chairman and members of the initiative, as well as local community interests, who have given their time, energy and expertise to formulate proposals to facilitate industrial development in north Mayo.  A number of proposals have already been implemented, including: the announcement of some 400 jobs in a number of projects in Mayo since the establishment of the initiative, including 85 jobs in Killala, 100 jobs in Ballina and 170 in Westport.  The chairman of the initiative has <Col N="610" /> applauded IDA Ireland, Forbairt, Mayo County Enterprise Board and Údarás na Gaeltachta for their achievements in securing jobs for the north Mayo area within the short period of four months since I established the initiative; my announcement that FÁS is to support the establishment of an auto-turning centre of excellence in Ballina in conjunction with industry.  The North Mayo Enterprise Initiative regards this as a major boost the long-term job creating prospects of the region; the publication of a high quality brochure setting out the benefits of investing in north Mayo and highlighting the attractiveness of the area; and the completion of a skills analysis of the workforce of Asahi to identify areas where assistance can be provided with career change training, job searching and establishing of new enterprises. The North Mayo Enterprise Initiative has coordinated the work of various bodies, including FÁS, Forbairt, County Enterprise Board, Moy Valley Resources and the Local Employment Service, in maximising their support services to aid the workers being made redundant.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the initiative has informed that its work to date has been extremely rewarding, concentrating the minds of all, not alone on the needs, but also on the resources that are available to help fashion a successful future for the area.  The initiative is continuing to work on the implementation of its proposals in conjunction with State agencies and local community interests, where appropriate.  Intensive efforts are still being made by IDA Ireland to market the Asahi buildings and land for industrial development. There will be no let up in this regard.</P>

In meeting its commitment to adopt a development approach to fostering new and emerging Irish suppliers, the role of Tesco's Irish trade development director is dedicated to increasing the amount of products purchased from Irish producers for both the Irish and wider European markets.</P>

      <P>In recent years, regulation of the insurance industry is mainly driven by developments at EU level in relation to the adoption of insurance directives and their ultimate implementation into domestic law.  Domestic regulation in relation to motor insurance is pursued as part of the overall regulation of non-life insurance undertakings and is also affected by measures adotped at EU level.</P>
      <P>With regard to recent developments, a directive on supervision of insurance undertakings in a group will shortly be adopted as an A point by the Council of Ministers, which will necessitate the implementation of regulations empowering supervisors to scrutinise the balance of group assets and liabilities to ensure that the group's financial performance does not undermine the solvency of individual insurers in the group.  Other work under way at present in Brussels includes discussions on a draft directive on the winding-up of insurers and on a review of the solvency margin which will eventually give rise to the need for Irish legislation.  At present, no other legislation is envisaged in respect of financial supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the transfer earlier this year to the Central Bank of regulatory responsibility for <Col N="612" /> investment intermediaries, my Department has been reviewing the regulatory position of insurance intermediaries.  Any proposal for changes arising from this review will be brought before the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
    <P>In relation to the marketing and selling of life insurance products, draft regulations are at an advanced stage, the object of which is to safeguard the interests of the insurance consumer by requiring increased disclosure and transparency in the sale of these products.  In the medium term, parallel proposals are being drafted which will provide for increased transparency in the sale of non-life insurance products, including motor insurance.</P>

      <P>The 1998 budget contains a number of initiatives designed to enhance the employment prospects of long-term unemployed people.  They include a special tax allowance in the first year of employment of £3,000, plus £1,000 for each child, for persons unemployed for one year or more who take up a job.  The allowance will be tapered down over a three year period; a double tax deduction in respect of wages is being introduced for employers who employ people who are unemployed for one year or more.  This double deduction can last for a period of up to three years provided the former unemployed person is still employed by them; an additional 1,000 places are being made available under the job initiative programme and an additional 1,000 places are being made available under the community employment part-time job initiative.  An additional 5,000 places are being made available under the back to work allowance scheme.  The area enterprise allowance is being extended nationwide and the calculation of family income supplement &mdash; FIS &mdash; will be on a net rather than gross basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these measures, the Government recently approved a full review of the community employment &mdash; CE &mdash; programme.  The review, which is currently at the tendering process stage will be carried out by external consultants.  It will be comprehensive, covering all categories of persons currently eligible to participate in CE and will examine, <i>inter alia,</i> current eligibility criteria, duration of placements, type of placements-training to be offered etc.  In addition to evaluating the success of the community employment programme in achieving its objectives, the review will be expected to comment on whether CE is an appropriate intervention in current labour market <Col N="613" /> conditions in terms of re-integrating the long-term unemployed into sustainable employment.</P>

      <P>The best way to maintain Ireland's position as an attractive investment location is to ensure that we continue to upgrade our competitiveness across all aspects of the business environment.  This involves not just being cost competitive, but also requires a ready supply of skilled labour, efficient and effective public utilities, modern infrastructure, a flexible and responsive education system and a taxation system which rewards enterprise, at both the individual and corporate levels.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 6 November to a question from Deputy Quinn in which I reminded Deputies that responsibility for maintaining the competitive position of the economy cannot be confined to any one Department of State.  In this regard, the Government is committed to ensuring that Ireland's competitiveness as a location for investment is continually upgraded and I draw the Deputy's attention to the range of pro-enterprise measures announced in the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of December 1996, 12,600 people were employed in the Irish clothing sector, compared with 13,700 at the end of December 1995.  This drop in employment is naturally disappointing.  The Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation has recently acknowledged that the clothing sector in Ireland is in a transitional period, coming from a traditional low cost base through to a higher cost economy. This restructuring of the industry is vital in order to have a competitive future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> Job losses arising from restructuring are an inevitable part of the dynamic process of industrial development.  The clothing sector in Ireland mirrors the experience in many other EU countries with the gradual liberalisation of international trade and with commodity products being increasingly produced in low cost countries.</P>
    <P>The key challenge facing the industry is to find the optimum balance between adding value of Irish manufactured garments and sub-contracting the manufacture of certain garments, where Ireland cannot be cost competitive, to lower cost countries.  My Department and the industrial development agencies, in co-operation with the industry, have made concerted efforts to assist the sector to restructure and a number of initiatives have been put in place in recent years.  The most recent strategy agreed for the sector is entitled &ldquo;Securing the Future&rdquo;.  It represents a highly significant and realistic effort to facilitate the process of building strong clothing companies capable of competing on both domestic and international markets, thereby reducing the incidence of company closure and associated job losses.  Many companies have been successful in moving into higher value-added market segments.</P>
    <P>A review of this strategy is currently being undertaken by my Department, Forbairt and the Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation.  This review is intended to give the industry a stronger focus to its competitive drive and update it on the various measures available to assist it in securing a long-term viable future.</P>

      <P>The footwear and leather industry in both Ireland and the EU continues to face severe competition from increasing levels of low cost imports, particularly from Asia.  While the Irish industry suffered a significant decline during the 1970s and 1980s, employment in the sector appears to have recently stabilised.  The most recent CSO statistics available indicate that employment has, in fact, increased from 1,000 at end 1993 to 1,100 at end December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Companies in the footwear sector, in particular, in order to continue to operate successfully in an increasingly open market, have moved away <Col N="615" /> from traditional products into niche markets.  This entailed the development of innovative design, high quality and competitive pricing based on a high rate of efficiency.  Given the continuing intense competition facing the footwear and leather industry, the recent employment trend to more heartening and I am hopeful that the numbers may increase further when a hide processing operation at Clondra, County Longford, which is currently at the &ldquo;start up phase&rdquo;, goes into full production.</P>

The cost savings necessary to achieve these objectives often require short-term job losses but this must be seen in the context of the long-term objective of enhancing employment within a more efficient combined operation.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle is enshrined in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990 which provide for the assessment of pollution damage to waters and for the costs of remedying and abating same to be recoverable from the polluter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Acts make particular provision in relation to: (a) the replacement of fish stocks, (b) the restoration of spawning grounds, (c) the taking of measures to prevent the continuance of the entry or discharge to which the order or notice relates, (d) the removal of polluting matter from waters, (e) the treatment of affected waters so as to mitigate or remedy the effects of the entry or discharge concerned, (f) the making of alternative arrangements for the supply of water for domestic, commercial, industrial, fishery, including fish-farming, agricultural or recreational purposes or the payment of a specified amount to the sanitary authority or other person concerned to defray all or part of the costs of such arrangements, and (g) the making good of any damage to plant or equipment or to any water abstraction or treatment works and any consequential losses <Col N="619" /> incurred by any person by reason of the entry of polluting matter into waters.  Any assessment of the costs to the fishing industry would fall to be made in that context.</P>
    <P>Civil proceedings may also be brought against a polluter by individuals who can show that they have suffered loss as a result of a pollution incident so that it would be difficult to make an assessment of the total cost at this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the genocide that occurred there in 1994, the Government's policy on Rwanda has been to encourage the Rwandan Government to achieve stability and national reconciliation between the opposing Tutsi and Hutu sides.  The Irish Government firmly believes full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms and a policy of inclusiveness for all groups is essential to overcome ethnic divisions and to achieve meaningful progress in building a stable society.  Ireland is working towards this end through its direct contacts with the Rwandan authorities on a bilaterial level and in concert with our partners in the international community.</P>
      <P>The recent escalation of violence in north-west Rwanda, including armed attacks, the forced release of genocide suspects from detention and the killing of civilians reflects the fragility of the situation in the country and underlines the paramount necessity of increasing stability in Rwanda. The achievement of national stability in Rwanda necessitates the bringing of the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide and other human rights violations to justice, as well as safeguarding the rights of returnees, genocide survivors and the country's huge prison population.  It also requires ongoing support from the international donor community in order to help ensure that the Government of Rwanda takes concrete steps towards the implementation of a sustainable, fair and inclusive programme of national reconciliation and economic and social development.</P>
      <P>The objective of the Government's programme of assistance to Rwanda is to help to rebuild a complex society in a way that leads towards national reconciliation and sustainable development for all its people.  The programme is two-fold.  It aims to meet the basic needs of both the returning refugees and the survivors of the genocide in such areas of shelter, water and sanitation. At the same time, we are supporting the rehabilitation of the system of justice which was almost completely destroyed as a result of the conflict. This is essential if Rwandan society is to develop in a fair and equitable way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National reconciliation and reconstruction in Rwanda will facilitate the establishment of an <Col N="620" /> inclusive democratic society in that country with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. We consider that efforts to this end should draw upon the principles of power sharing between Rwanda's Hutu and Tutsi parties which were agreed by them under the 1993 Arusha Accords. We will continue to press the Rwandan authorities on the need for an urgent debate between all parties on the modalities of a transition to democracy in their country.  All parties in Rwanda must realise that political objectives cannot be obtained by using military means.</P>
    <P>The Government is keeping the political and human rights situation in Rwanda under close review, in co-operation with our EU partners.  The EU special envoy to the Great Lakes, Mr. Ajello, intends to explore with the Rwandan authorities, in his forthcoming visit there, how to deepen the dialogue between the EU and Rwanda.  EU heads of mission in Kigali have been asked for their assessment of the security situation in north-west Rwanda and at the borders with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.</P>
    <P>I understand that the reports of increasing violence in Rwanda were also a matter of serious concern to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Robinson, when she visited Rwanda last week.</P>

      <P>The Irish Road Haulage Association is collating the necessary compensation claim documentation for submission to the French authorities through a firm of solicitors especially engaged for that purpose.</P>
      <P>As a result of the early and extensive availability of information in relation to the dispute, Irish hauliers were able to plan effectively to avoid many of the blockades.  Because of this and the widespread use of information technology and mobile communications to assist in finding alternative routes, it is estimated that the number of Irish hauliers affected by the recent blockades was relatively low.  The Irish Road Haulage Association is confident of a satisfactory settlement of all claims without undue delay.</P>

However, following meetings with officials of my Department, the developer agreed to the conditions laid down by the Department and has furnished written confirmation of same.  This removes the grounds for the Department's appeal which will accordingly be withdrawn.  If the developer does not honour his undertakings the matter will be pursued through the courts.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he has taken or intends to take in relation to the disclosure in the EU Court of Auditors report that 61 tonnes of meat exported to the Congo accompanied by a certificate of origin from a non-existent Lucan Chamber of Commerce defrauded the EU of £75,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In preparation for its 1996 report, the EU Court of Auditors examined a number of export refund cases where EU beef was temporarily re-imported into the Community following rejection in Egypt, and made some criticisms of the French and Dutch authorities in this matter.  This exercise was part of a general examination of the standard of EU veterinary and customs checks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one of the cases the court criticised the lack of re-import veterinary checks in Greece and France on 61 tonnes of beef originally shipped from Ireland to Egypt by a French company as part of a consignment of 455 tonnes.  This rejected beef was stored for some time in France before being re-exported to the Congo, an alternative export refund destination.  Temporary re-import <Col N="623" /> in these circumstances while another market is found is not unusual and is specifically permitted by the EU.</P>
    <P>In this case proof was provided to my Department, as paying agency, that the beef was transported, received and stored under customs control during the time it was temporarily reimported into the EU.  Full proof of import and proof of payment has been provided for the Congo which demonstrates the commercial nature of the transaction.  In addition, the operation was specifically verified by the French audit authorities in 1996, following a request from my Department, who found that &lsquo;the resale transactions were financially regular&rsquo;.  Thus, there is no indication that the beef was not marketable and that export refunds were improperly paid.</P>
    <P>As the court did not examine the Department's file on this, export copies of all of the above evidence is being forwarded to them and to the EU Commission for examination.  My Department is also examining and will forward additional French veterinary documents which have now been submitted by the company concerned and which, if validated, would appear to be in conflict with the findings of the report.</P>
    <P>The court also found that a certificate of origin issued against the original consignment had been issued by an unauthorised, not &lsquo;non-existent&rsquo;, chamber of commerce.  Certificates of origin are never submitted to my Department as they are not used to demonstrate eligibility for export refunds or to validate export refunds claims.  This matter is being investigated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has referred the case to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>In 1992 a scheme of compulsory division of commonage prepared by the Land Commission for the commonage in question, at the request of the majority shareholders, was appealed to the Judicial Commissioner of the Land Commission, (High Court), by other shareholders. <Col N="632" /> An interim judgment by the Judicial Commissioner directed that certain matters, including the question of compliance with planning legislation, should be clarified before the case was returned to the Court.  The planning issue was referred to An Bord Pleanála and its decision was delivered to the appellants in 1993. This decision and the other matters identified by the Judicial Commissioner as requiring clarification must be referred back to the Judicial Commissioner for consideration before the original appeal is resolved.  The initiative to finalise the case rests with the shareholders in the commonage.</P>

      <P>The estimated cost of a reduction from 1 January 1998 in the standard rate of corporation tax from 36 per cent to 32 per cent and in the reduced rate from 28 per cent to 24 per cent on the first £50,000 of profits is £8 million in 1998, £105 million in 1999 and £111 million in a full year.  This is slightly higher than the estimated cost of the reductions from 36 per cent and 28 per cent to 25 per cent announced in the budget which is £107 million in a full year.  These changes would have no direct implications for the PRSI yield.</P>

      <P>The position is that, in my financial statement on 3 December, I announced there would be an <Col N="639" /> increase in the farmers' flat rate refund from 3.3 per cent to 3.6 per cent with effect from 1 March 1998.  The cost of the measure is estimated to be £5.3 million in 1998 and £8 million in a full year and it will ensure that, on an overall basis, unregistered farmers will continue to be compensated in full for the VAT on their farming inputs. The cost of a 1 per cent increase in the flat rate would be £26.6 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EU VAT law on the matter, the flat rate is calculated each year on the basis of macroeconomic data for the previous three years.  It should be noted that EU rules specify that the flat rate may not be used to obtain for flat rate farmers refunds greater than the VAT on inputs.  Accordingly, the scheme cannot be used to provide an indirect subsidy to farmers or to provide compensation for other purposes.</P>
      <P>As regards PRSI, I also announced in my financial statement that the PRSI allowance for full rate PRSI contributors, which currently stands at £80 per week, non-cumulative, will be increased to £100 per week with effect from 6 April 1998. The cost of this increase is estimated at £38 million in a full year.</P>

      <Quest>the tax savings, if any, there would be in 1998-99 if the business expansion scheme was scrapped in view of the fact that there is no need for special incentives to business when the economy is booming; and the tax savings in this year if the designated areas scheme was eliminated due to the over heated state of the building industry and if the special allowances for city centre car parks was abolished.</Quest>

      <P>The last full year for which the cost of the business expansion scheme is available is 1996-97 when the cost was £42 million.  Therefore, based on the 1996-97 figure the likely full year saving from the abolition of the BES would be £42 million.  However, the full savings might not arise if investors in the BES were to invest their money in other schemes for which tax relief was still available.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I announced in my recent Budget Statement that from budget day the cumulative amount that can be raised by any one company under the BES was reduced from £1 million to £250,000.  It is estimated that the resultant savings in 1998 will be £10 million and £20 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the designated areas scheme, the 1996 KPMG report on urban renewal commissioned by the Department of the Environment estimated that the cost of the incentives in tax foregone was in the region of £40 million per annum.  This is an average estimate over ten years.  The relevant information available to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of designated area schemes relates to the cost of capital allowances in respect of expenditure on residential and <Col N="640" /> non-residential urban renewal projects, except Custom House Docks and certain Temple Bar projects, and the scheme for designated seaside resorts.  The aggregate cost of these is estimated at £51 million in 1996-97, the latest year for which full estimates are available.</P>
    <P>The current urban renewal scheme ends on 31 July 1998 and the Government has approved a framework for a new urban renewal scheme to come into effect on 1 August 1998.  The estimated Exchequer cost of this new scheme for 1998-99 is unknown at present as the details have not yet been provided for in the taxation code.</P>
    <P>The pilot scheme for designated seaside resorts was due to end on 30 June 1998.  However, I announced in my recent Budget Statement that the scheme was to be extended for one year to 30 June 1999 to facilitate the completion of the pipeline projects.  The cost of this extension is £7 million.  Precise figures are not available on the cost of providing tax relief for multi-storey car-parks but I extended the scheme in the budget for one year on the same basis as the extension for the designated seaside resorts.  The cost is £1 million.</P>
    <P>The extent to which these costs would become savings to the Exchequer in the event of their abolition would depend upon the extent to which investors could invest in other available tax incentives. The introduction of transitional measures to cater for pipeline projects would also affect the extent of savings arising from the termination of any of the schemes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced a restriction of certain capital allowances in the budget.  A ceiling of £25,000 per year is being introduced on the amount of capital allowances which an individual passive investor can claim against non-rental income in respect of expenditure incurred on certain buildings.  It is estimated that these changes will raise £2 million in 1998 and £20 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>Based on the new 20 per cent standard rate of capital gains tax, which applies to company shares, announced in the 1998 budget, it is tentatively estimated that the yield to the Exchequer from the abolition of indexation relief on disposals of shares by individuals could be in the region of £15 million in a full year based on current levels of share disposals which are liable to tax.  The estimate does not take account of any additional yield which would arise on share disposals which are currently not liable to tax because of indexation.  However, should indexation relief be abolished only from a current date, i.e. not retrospectively, <Col N="641" /> the yield would be much less and it would be difficult to give an estimate at this stage.</P>
      <P>Information from corporation tax returns is not recorded in such a way that it would be possible to provide a corresponding estimate of the yield on gains arising from the abolition of indexation relief on the disposal of shares by companies.  To obtain the information it would be necessary to identify the cases and extract the information manually.  Such an exercise could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost. The estimated yield to the Exchequer from the abolition of stock relief would be in the region of £1.5 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the income tax statistics available on farmers do not distinguish between their income from EU sources as opposed to other sources.  In arriving at a figure for taxable income, deductions from gross income must be made, in accordance with the Income Tax Acts, in respect of expenses, capital allowances, stock relief, interest repayments on borrowings, contributions towards medical assurance, retirement annuities and basic personal allowances, or exemption limits, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>In addition, the extent to which farmers are taxable in respect of EU payments depends on the nature of the payments.  Where a payment is a subsidy towards income it will generally be taxable as income.  However, certain payments, while in the nature of income, are specifically exempted from tax by virtue of the Income Tax Acts, e.g. forestry premia are exempt from income tax under section 18 of the Finance Act, 1969.</P>
      <P>Where a payment is made to a farmer in circumstances where it is intended to be an amount to aid the purchase of a capital item it will not be taxable as such but will, generally speaking, reduce the cost of the item for future capital gains tax purposes and for capital allowances purposes, if appropriate.  Payments made for the forfeiture or surrender of rights will generally be liable to capital gains tax.</P>

      <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance, and double rate bands, is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, 1980, which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>As regards dependent children, there is no general tax allowance for children, whether they are children of a marriage or not.  The child additions to the exemption limits are available to parents or guardians at the appropriate income levels. There is a special tax allowance for an incapacitated child, which was increased from £700 to £800 in my recent budget, and this is given to the parent or guardian of the child, irrespective of marital status.  Direct State provision for children is made through the child benefit system administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances. An interdepartmental working group has recently been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report by March 1998.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> As with the Deputy's recent pre-budget similar question, it is vital in interpreting this table that the mechanism for reviewing the family income supplement is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 12 monthly basis: once awarded it will not be reduced or withdrawn until the end of the period, regardless of any upward movement in pay during the period.  Therefore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while adjustments to FIS may not occur until some time later.  FIS thresholds will be increased by £7 per week from next June while the supplement will be assessed on a full net basis, with effect from October 1998.  Income tax and PRSI changes will take effect from 5 April 1998.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in the Roscrea area is the responsibility, in the first instance, of the Mid-Western Health Board.  I understand from the Mid-Western Health Board that the board and St. Anne's, Roscrea, which is the principal mental handicap service provider in the area, has encountered difficulties in both recruiting and retaining speech therapists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists in the services mentioned by the Deputy.  The vacancies in these grades are being advertised and arrangements are being made, where possible, to put in place some element of service provision in the interim by contracting for these services on a sessional basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218, 245 and 249 together.</P>
      <P>The following tables supply the information requested by the Deputy for the period ending 30 September 1997.  I have provided a total of £12 million to address hospital waiting lists in 1998. Of this amount, I am allocating £9 million immediately.  I am currently reviewing the situation in relation to cardiac waiting lists.  As soon as I have completed this task I propose to allocate the remaining £3 million to this and other priority areas.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed the arrangements for application of waiting list funding and I have taken the following initiatives to improve the effectiveness of the system: where applicable, agencies have been notified in their determination of net expenditure for 1998 of the level of funding available to them for waiting list work.  This will give agencies much earlier notice of the money available than in previous years and will enable them to plan their activity accordingly.  Each agency's service plan must now specify targets for waiting list activity during the year.  It will then be the responsibility of the chief executive officer-hospital manager to ensure that the targets are achieved and to take corrective action if necessary as the year proceeds.  Agencies have been instructed to focus increasingly on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer then 12 months in the specialities targeted for attention.</P>
      <P>Where agencies have not already done so, they have requested to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work within the agency and as a contact point with the Department.</P>
      <P>Information relating to persons who have died while awaiting treatment is not collected by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Midland Health Board adopted a rationalisation plan in 1984 which included the establishment of orthopaedics, ENT and ophthalmic specialties in Tullamore General Hospital to cater for the region.  To date the regional specialties in ENT and orthopaedics have been developed.  There is currently a committee reviewing the pathology services in the region and a report is expected in early 1998.  The regional director of cancer services is currently compiling a strategy for cancer services in the Midland Health Board region and his report is also awaited.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not collected on a routine basis by my Department. Accordingly, I have asked the indiviudal hospitals in the Dublin area which provide ENT services to reply directly to the Deputy.  I have provided a total of £12 million to address hospital waiting lists in 1998, £3 million of which will be used to tackle cardiac waiting lists and other priority areas and £19 million towards a number of other principal target specialties including ENT.  Of this £9 million, £4.2 million is being allocated to agencies in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reviewed the arrangements for application of waiting list funding and I have taken the following initiatives to improve the effectiveness of the system.  Where applicable, agencies have been notified in their Determination of Net Expenditure for 1998 of the level of funding available to them for waiting list work.  This will give agencies much earlier notice of the money available than in previous years and will enable them to plan their activity accordingly.  Each agency's service plan must now specify targets for waiting list activity during the year.  It will then be the responsibility of the chief executive officer-hospital manager to ensure that the targets are achieved and to take corrective action if necessary as the year proceeds.  Agencies have been instructed to focus increasingly on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialties targeted for attention. Where agencies have not already done so, they <Col N="652" /> have been requested to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work within their agency and as a contact point with the Department.</P>

      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, which was published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services.

One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees will be to advise the chief executive officer of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.  An allocation of £3 million has been provided in the budget for the development of these services in 1998 and £285,000 of this has been allocated to the Western Health Board.  The question of allocating funds for the provision of additional speech and language therapist posts will be considered by the chief executive officer of the board in consultation with the co-ordinating committee.  The total allocation of additional funds to physical and sensory disability services in 1998 will be £8.4 million when the Estimates provision and capital allocation are taken into account.</P>

      <P>I should explain at the outset that under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987, health boards are entitled to make charges in respect of extended in-patient care. However, I understand that in the majority of cases, the Christmas bonus payments being made by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will, in general, be paid in full directly to qualifying patients.  While all qualifying patients will benefit to the full value of the additional payment there may be some cases where a portion of the payment will be used for the purchase of clothing, presents, etc.  It is understood that deductions will not be made in respect of hospital maintenance charges in most health board areas.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently seeking clarification in respect of the procedures applied by health boards in this area and I will communicate with the Deputy in the matter as soon as I have received the information required.</P>

      <P>The operation of the national primary childhood immunisation programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards, who enter into contracts with general practitioners for the delivery of the service.  Up to the end of 1995, prior to the introduction of this programme, the immunisation scheme was operated by a combination of public health clinics and general practitioners acting independently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the programme is to achieve an uptake level of 95 per cent and so eradicate the diseases in question.  The most recent returns received from the health boards indicate that uptake levels for completed courses of immunisation among children aged 18 months range from 64 per cent to 88 per cent.  My Department is in discussion with the health boards, the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Nurses' Organisation concerning the operation of the programme. I recognise that all of the parties concerned share the objective of achieving the programme's target.  I am confident that this target <Col N="654" /> can be achieved and my Department is keeping under review the question of whether additional measures may be necessary in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234, 236 and 237 together.</P>
      <P>Figures collected by my Department relate to the numbers of people on the in-patient waiting lists of a particular hospital rather than to a patient's place of residence.  It would not therefore be possible to give the Deputy details of the number of people from County Kerry currently on waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The numbers of children on the waiting list in hospitals in the Southern Health Board area for ENT and adults awaiting hip replacements and cardiac surgery at the end of September are as follows: ear, nose and throat procedures 176; hip replacements 178; and cardiac surgery 64.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed the funding arrangements designed to reduce waiting times in the light of the result of the waiting list initiative to date. Arising out of this review the following revised arrangements the operation of the waiting list in 1998 and subsequent years are being introduced: agencies will receive early notice of the level of funding being made available to them which will enable them to plan their activity accordingly. Agencies were informed of their waiting list funding for 1998 in the last few days; my Department will be asking each agency to specify targets for waiting list activity during the year, it will be the responsibility of the chief executive officer-hospital manager to ensure that these targets are achieved and to take corrective action as necessary; there will be an increased focus on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialties targeted for attention; and where agencies have not already done so, my Department has requested them to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy of my continuing commitment to taking all possible steps to reduce waiting lists and waiting times for patients.  Towards this end I am allocating a total of £12 million in 1998 towards the cost of waiting list activity.  I am confident that this money will have a positive impact on waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of additional cardiac surgery facilities is a matter of national importance and <Col N="657" /> one which will require significant capital and revenue investment over the next few years.  The question of the provision of cardiac care services overall is under review at the moment.  However, I hope to be in a position to bring my proposals to Government in this regard in the very near future.  An announcement will then be made on the location of additional cardiac care services.</P>

      <P>The Department is aware of the situation concerning the appointment of an accident and emergency consultant at the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street.  The procedures to be followed in the recruitment of consultant staff are a matter, in the first instance, for the employing authority, in this instance the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals which holds the employment contracts of consultants at the National Childrens Hospital.  In this case, the Department understands that the person appointed to the post holds a valid contract.</P>
      <P>The Department is aware that difficulties have arisen concerning the job specification of the post in question.  However, as the regulation of consultant appointments is the statutory responsibility of Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Department is making arrangements to meet the comhairle, the employing authority and the hospital with a view to resolving any residual difficulties.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I asked the board of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital to consider a phased opening of the new hospital in Tallaght with a view to ensuring that the hospital should open as soon as possible.  I was therefore happy on 27 November last to be in a position to welcome the decision of the board to open the hospital on 21 June 1998.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of additional construction projects were approved earlier this year to enhance the new hospital. These include an expanded out patients department, additional car parking, and private facilities. The design and construction of these projects to a degree which would be compatible with the functioning of a major acute hospital is the main factor governing the decision regarding opening date.</P>
      <P>The hospital is committed to ensuring that there is no diminution in the level of service it provides.  Consequently, until all of the beds at the new hospital are available, 76 beds will be kept open for specific programmes at one of the base sites.  It is likely that the board will decide on the particular services and location for this 76 bed unit later this month.</P>
      <P>It is expected that all of the hospital's services will be located in Tallaght by mid 1999 at the latest. The premises which are to be vacated in June 1998 will be offered for sale once the decision on the location of the 76 bed unit is made.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, my Department, with the Eastern Health Board and the hospitals concerned, is examining the health service needs of the south inner city catchment population following the transfer of the acute hospital services to Tallaght.  I am determined that there will be no deficit in services following the closure of the hospitals transferring to Tallaght.</P>

      <P>The reports received from the agencies in respect of the position at end of October 1997 were set against their unadjusted budgets.  The figures for over-runs, as reported by the agencies at that time, are: Eastern Health Board £1.965 million; Midland Health Board £1.697 million; Mid-Western Health Board £1.456 million; North-Eastern Health Board £2.273 million; North-Western Health Board £1.398 million; South-Eastern Health Board £1.043 million; Southern Health <Col N="661" /> Board £3.641 million; Western Health Board £3.801 million and Acute Dublin Hospitals £8.473 million.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that their reported over spends will be eliminated by a combination of the actions taken by the agencies, the funding obtained in the Health Supplementary Estimate for 1997 and through the provision of additional pay funding channelled through the Department of Finance's Vote 44 in respect of local bargaining agreements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The indicative drug target (IDT) scheme was introduced for general practitioners in the general medical services scheme on 1 January 1993, following the review of the scheme in 1992 by the Department, the health boards, the Irish Medical Organisation, and the Irish College of General Practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of that review, it was agreed by all sides that medicines were not always pre-scribed in the most effective manner and that there was significant potential for an improvement in prescribing practice leading to better patient care and better use of the available resources in the development of general practice. Accordingly, each doctor was encouraged to examine his-her existing prescribing practices with a view to availing of opportunities to make prescribing more effective and less costly for all his-her patients.  To assist in this process, doctors were provided with indicative drug targets, for patients on their panels, which had been constructed <Col N="662" /> on the basis of average prescribing costs weighted by age and sex criteria.</P>
    <P>As an incentive to doctors, the IDT scheme provided that a portion of the savings made would be made available to the individual doctor for practice development projects which received the prior approval of the relevant health board. The balance of the savings made is allocated to the relevant health board for investment in general practice projects within the board's area.</P>
    <P>At every stage during the process of reaching agreement on the IDT scheme and in the subsequent implementation of that agreement, all of the parties to the review mentioned above clearly understood and accepted that it was the duty and obligation of doctors, individually and collectively, to provide the most appropriate management and to optimally utilise the available resources for patient care.  It was and is similarly understood and accepted that the right of the doctor to prescribe for the patient, as he-she considers necessary, remains absolutely in place.</P>
    <P>The report referred to by the Deputy was that of the expert review group, chaired by Professor Michael Murphy, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology, University College, Cork, which conducted a review of the IDT scheme at the request of the Department.  The purpose of the review was to provide an independent evaluation of the effect of the IDT scheme on the quality of patient care with particular reference to changing patterns in prescribing.</P>
    <P>The review group received oral and written submissions from a broad range of interests affected by the scheme including patients, doctors, pharmacists and the pharmaceutical industry.  Intensive analysis was carried out on the prescribing by the 223 general practitioners in the Eastern Health Board region with panels in excess of 500 patients.  To complement the analysis, surveys were also conducted among the selected samples of doctors, pharmacists and patients. The figure mentioned in the question relates to a small postal survey of hospital consultant physicians. However, a main conclusion in the report was that there was no discernible negative effects on the overall quality of prescribing.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied with the success of the indicative drug target scheme.  Most doctors are now achieving more rational and cost-effective prescribing which represents a successful outcome to the scheme put in place as a result of the findings of the review of the GMS mentioned earlier.  The average annual rise in the GMS drug costs has fallen to approximately 6 per cent compared to 10 per cent prior to the inception of the scheme.  The IDT scheme has been under constant review since its inception.  The comprehensive Murphy report provides valuable information on prescribing and its recommendations will inform the development of the scheme in the future.  The group's recommendations in regard to the establishment of an national pharmacoepidemiology database, a linked prescribing morbidity database and the need for pharmacoeconomic <Col N="663" /> evaluation will be considered in the context of the role of a National Pharmacoeconomic Centre at Trinity College-St. James's Hospital which is currently being established under the direction of Professor John Feely, Professor of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.  Other recommedations, particularly those in relation to informing patients of the scheme, will be taken into account in future discussions on the scheme.</P>
    <P>Arising from savings made under the IDT scheme, significant resources have been provided for the development of general practice which, in turn, has resulted in a more comprehensive and better quality service for patients.  It is important to point out that the IDT scheme does not provide the general practitioner with a personal remunerative advantage, rather it provides a means for investment in facilities, equipment and services in his-her practice in the first instance and for other practices in the health board's area. Such investment is to the advantage of all patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the question refers to the proposed revision of the Drinking Water Directive (80/778/EEC) upon which there was political agreement at the Environment Council on 16 October 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal provides for a greater focus on the protection of human health through a rationalisation of parameters covered by the existing directive into those which (i) are health-related or a good indicator of likely health implications and (ii) have Community-wide relevance.  Quality standards have been reviewed in the light of scientific and technical developments since the <Col N="668" /> original Directive was adopted and revised standards or new requirements put forward, where appropriate.  Generally existing standards remain unchanged.  We have a record of overall satisfactory compliance with these, especially in relation to public supplies.</P>
    <P>The most significant change in standards relates to the lead parameter and the position in this regard was outlined in the reply to question No. 268 of 25 November 1997.</P>
    <P>My Department is pursuing a programme of substantial capital investment in upgrading and providing water supply schemes to cater for demands generally and ensure compliance with the quality standards of the drinking water directive. Estimated expenditure on major schemes since 1994 has totalled almost £190 million.  A total of £184.6 million will be available for my Department's water and sewerage investment programme in 1998, an increase of £34 million, or 22 per cent in the 1997 provision for these services. This will facilitate increased activity under the programme in respect of water supply schemes and in addressing inadequacies in rural water programmes.</P>
    <P>A range of measures was introduced by my Department earlier this year to deal with water quality problems in poorly treated or untreated private group and small private supplies. Measures include grant assistance for new group water schemes, the upgrading and taking in charge of existing group schemes and grants to householders to install or upgrade private piped supplies.  Approximately £20 million will be spent on these measures in 1997 and provision has been made for further expenditure in my Department's 1998 Estimates.</P>

This will depend on the level of motor taxation collected in December.</P>

      <P>The most serious road pavement deficiences on our road system are to be found among non-national roads.  The maintenance-improvement of these roads is a matter for local authorities, to be funded from their own resources, supplemented by State grants.  In so far as State grants for the non-national network are concerned, I have honoured the Government's commitment to increase funding for the maintenance and improvement of regional and county roads.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I secured a record amount of almost £204 million for non-national roads grants for 1998, an increase of £31 million or 18 per cent on the original 1997 allocation.  I am satisfied that the present level of funding for non-national roads will result in much improved road pavement conditions for motor vehicles and drivers alike.</P>

    <P>The above figures show that it would cost in the region of £20 million to bring forward budgetary <Col N="674" /> increases in unemployment and pension payments from June to April.  Additional costs would arise if the same changes were extended to all social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Last week's budget, provided for the effective date for paying increases in all social welfare payments to be brought forward to the first week in June.  As such, recipients will benefit from the increased rate of payment for 31 weeks in 1998 as opposed to 29 weeks in 1997.  The increases in the budget were between 4.4 per cent and 4.6 per cent in the case of unemployment payments, and as high as 7.4 per cent in the case of some pensions.</P>
    <P>The full year cost of a 4 per cent increase in child benefit is £16.49 million.  Child benefit increases are effective from September.  The cost in 1998 of a 4 per cent increase is £5.5 million.  In the budget, increases of £1.50 and £3 in child benefit were awarded; these represented increases of 5 per cent and 7.7 per cent of the lower and higher rates of child benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272, 275 and 276 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provided for the extension of class A PRSI to community employment <Col N="675" /> workers.  Class A PRSI provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance system including, for example, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age (contributory) pension, widow's (contributory) pension, treatment (dental and optical) benefits and occupational injuries benefit.  The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.  In the case of persons who qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit, as is the case with the person concerned.  The social welfare secondary benefits, including the Christmas bonus, are payable only with long-term social welfare payments.  Unemployment benefit claimants do not therefore have an entitlement to these benefits.</P>
    <P>Secondary benefits can however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or jobstart etc.  As regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance or mortgage supplements and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>
    <P>While the difficulties faced by CE workers who requalify for unemployment benefit when their period of CE finishes are recognised the Deputies will appreciate that it would not be possible to introduce special concessionary arrangements for such people without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry an extremely high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>
    <P>While the responsibility for the payment of the Christmas bonus to people who are participating on CE schemes and other FÁS training schemes rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it is understood that all current scheme participants are receiving the bonus payment and that the fact that they may be paying class A social insurance contributions does not affect that entitlement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273 and 274 together.</P>
      <P>This year's Christmas bonus was paid last week to 722,000 social welfare recipients in receipt of long-term social welfare payments including disablement pension, death benefit by way of pension, old age (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, widow's and widower's contributory pension, orphan's (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, pre-retirement allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, one parent family payment, payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate and disability allowance.</P>
      <P>The bonus payment amounts to 70 per cent of the person's normal weekly payment subject to a minimum payment of £20.  The cost of this measure is estimated at £41 million.</P>
      <P>The bonus is paid to those who are sick or disabled and in receipt of invalidity pension or disability allowance.  It is not payable to people in receipt of disability benefit.</P>
      <P>The cost of paying the bonus to some 22,000 people in receipt of disability benefit for more than 12 months would be £1.2 million.</P>

      <P>Asylum seekers are not entitled to unemployment assistance or to benefits based on PRSI contributions.  The main entitlement of asylum seekers is to supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) and in November 1997, some 2,400 were in receipt of SWA pyments.  In addition, child benefit was paid to less than 200 families seeking asylum.</P>

      <P>All self-employed persons over 16 years of age with reckonable income or reckonable emoluments of £2,500 or more per <Col N="678" /> annum are insurable as self-employed contributors and are liable for payment of class S social insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>The inspector of taxes collects any PRSI due on the basis of a person's income once it exceeds £2,500.  If a person's income is below this level in a given tax year there is no PRSI liability in that year as the person is not insurable.  Such a person could opt to pay voluntary contributions in that year subject to satisfying the qualifying criteria for paying such contributions.</P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years.  Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.  This is in recognition of the <Col N="679" /> fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing substantial increases in child benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring that child income support is more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents.</P>
      <P>Child benefit remains one of our most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes.  As it is not taxable, and is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment or assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
      <P>In the 1998 budget, which was announced last week, the Deputy will be aware that this policy direction has been continued through further enhancement of the child benefit scheme.  Child benefit will be increased by £1.50 per child per month for the first two children and by £3 per child for the third and subsequent children, thus bringing the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.  A special supplementary payment in respect of twins will be introduced. These measures will take effect from next September and will cost £28.5 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>A claim for a death grant payment in this case was made on 8 August 1997. The contribution condition for death grant requires that at least 26 contributions have been paid since entry to insurance and either 48 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year or an average of at least 26 contributions since entry to insurance.  The claim was disallowed as the deceased person did not satisfy the second of these conditions.</P>

      <P>This area of the Murrough is proposed for designation as a special area of conservation (SAC) under the terms of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S. I. No. 94 of 1997), which transposed the EU Habitats Directive into Irish law.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, as soon as it came to the notice of my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) that works likely to damage the ecology of this area were under way, NPWS wrote to the landowner concerned to the effect that this site was the subject of a designation proposal under the above legislation.  It was pointed out that any attempt to alter or to interfere in any significant way with the natural ecology of the area without prior consultation with NPWS would result in legal measures being taken to have the work discontinued and the site fully restored.  It is understood that the works in question ceased shortly after the issue of that letter and have not commenced since then.</P>
      <P>However, it is clear that damage has occurred to the ecology of the area, and NPWS is working to achieve the restoration of the site to the maximum extent possible.  There have been contacts with the landowners concerned and I expect further discussions to take place in the near future.  A decision on how to proceed will be taken in the light of the outcome of these discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that as part of Ireland's commitment to the implementation of the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, a process is ongoing of designating our most important natural heritage sites as special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  Within these sites, the conservation of the ecological interest must be safeguarded as a priority.  Such protection does not necessarily exclude all other activities on the sites, including activities relating to commercial production based on natural resources.  However, any such activities must be undertaken in a manner which does not adversely affect the ecological interest of the sites, the conservation of which has priority.</P>
      <P>With regard to sites outside of such protected areas, while the conservation of the ecological interest may not have the same priority in such areas, the Government is fully committed, through our participation in the Convention on Biological Diversity and our commitment to sustainable development, to ensuring that the conservation and sustainable use of our natural resources is taken into account in all relevant sectors, including those involved in commercial production.</P>
      <P>This commitment to conservation and sustainable development applies, therefore, not just within protected areas, where it has priority, but throughtout the country.  It is recognised, however, that turning this commitment into practical and effective action will require continued and ongoing initiatives.  The national biodiversity plan will seek to put such initiatives in place.</P>
      <P>The plan will review the state of biological diversity in Ireland and outline the measures which are currently in place for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. However, its main focus will be on setting out strategies and actions to be undertaken for the conservation and sustainable use of such biological diversity in the future.  The plan will examine biodiversity at ecosystem, species and the genetic level and it will cover all ecosystems, terrestrial, freshwater and marine, and all taxonomic groups. It will pay special attention to the need for the integration of the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into all relevant sectors and will consider the main sectors which impact on biodiversity, including agriculture, forestry and the marine resource industry.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to have the national biodiversity plan published during 1998.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that there are many factors to be taken onto consideration when allocating Garda personnel to any centre, provincial or otherwise.  These include vacancies, specific requirements, population ratio, crime ratio, security issues and other matters which contribute to the maintenance of law and order.  One of the primary objectives of the Garda Síochána Corporate Strategy Plan 1993-97 was the formulation of a revised policy for the equitable allocation of gardaí.  The Garda authorities inform me that this policy ensures that Garda resources are allocated to areas in direct proportion to existing policing requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that there are no general rules governing the amount of time a member of An Garda Síochána serves at any one centre.  However, in circumstances <Col N="684" /> where official accommodation is available a member willing to occupy it is required to give an undertaking to reside there for a minimum period of three years.</P>
    <P>Garda management point out that redeployment of members is an integral part of the efficient administration of the force.  They add that transfers, for instance, may be temporary or permanent in nature and are implemented in the best interests of the Garda Síochána.  Movement of Garda personnel will arise for a variety of reasons including the exigencies of the service, promotion and special unforeseen circumstances.</P>

      <P>In deciding cases concerning guardianship, custody of, or access to a child the court must, under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, regard the welfare of the child as the <Col N="686" /> first and paramount consideration.  That important criterion is a matter which falls to be dealt with by the court in the context of all the circumstances of each case.  The Children Bill, 1997, passed by both Houses as of 3 December 1997, contains detailed provisions on safeguarding the interests of children in guardianship etc. proceedings.  Those new provisions, combined with the Act of 1964, represent the law in this area and I have no further proposals for changes at the present time.  The provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, regarding the care and protection of children who are at risk may also be relevant. That legislation is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, came into operation on 1 July 1997 and seeks to implement measures to assist local authorities in dealing with problems such as drug dealing and other forms of anti-social behaviour.  Under section 15 of the Act the Garda Síochána are included as a &ldquo;specified person&rdquo; for the purpose of provision of information to local authorities.  A Garda circular was issued in conjunction with the commencement of the Act outlining its provisions.</P>

      <Col N="687" /> I am advised by the Garda authorities that clarification was sought from the Attorney General on several aspects of the new Act.  The advice of the Attorney General is now to hand and a further circular was issued to the force on 3 December 1997 providing additional guidance on the matter.  It is not policy to comment on the content of Garda circulars.</P>
    <P>I am also advised by the Garda authorities that the Act has only been in operation for a relatively short period and the response of the various agencies involved with it is still being developed.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on violence against women has been assigned to the Minister of State at my Department.</P>
      <P>One of the main recommendations contained in the report, which was published in April 1997, was the establishment of a national steering committee. I can now report that this committee, which comprises representatives from the Departments of Education, Science and, Environment and Local Government, Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda, the State agencies such as the health boards, and the non-governmental organisations working in this area, is under way and will hold its first meeting on 18 December 1997.</P>
      <P>The committee has a very heavy workload to undertake.  The areas of responsibility include the following: develop a publicly funded public awareness campaign; co-ordinate and advise on the distribution of the resources among the eight health board regions; co-ordinate and advise on the ongoing development of policies; oversee and monitor individual agencies' written policies and guidelines; ensure that regional and local structures are established; undertake research and needs assessments nationally; promote inter-agency training; ensure maximum value for money from available resources; develop codes of practice for collecting statistics and monitoring responses, and publish periodical reports.</P>

    <P>So far as other specific recommendations are concerned the Departments of State within whose remit they fall will be responsible for their implementation.

      <P>The position is that the refurbishment of the Garda station has recently been completed.  The placing of a contract for works to the married quarters was delayed due to a need to have the works recosted.  I understand that tenders have recently been invited for refurbishment works to the married quarters and that it is expected that the work will take approximately six weeks to complete.</P>

      <P>In the period 1 January 1994 to 30 November, 1997, 5,505 applications for refugee status were accepted by my Department.  Of these some 4,060 cases are awaiting finalisation and 235 have been recognised as refugees.  These figures include adults and children.</P>
      <P>All adult asylum seekers are issued with ID cards.  Following the reissue of ID cards in October of this year it became apparent that there was a discrepancy between the number of persons who lodged asylum claims and those who turned up to have new ID cards issued to them. The reconciliation of the difference between the two figures is on-going but is a very laborious task and will take some time to complete.</P>

      <P>The precise information sought by the Deputy is not immediately available and it was not possible to extract it from records or to calculate it in the time available. The Deputy may wish to know, however, that there were 36 offenders with addresses in County Mayo committed to Mountjoy Prison between 1 June and 30 November 1997.  Eleven of these prisoners were transferred to Loughan House either on the day of or within a few days of their committal.  The average annual cost of keeping a prisoner in custody in 1996 was approximately £46,140.  The average annual cost for Mountjoy Prison was £46,150 and Loughan House £36,240. These figures do not include any element in respect of capital expenditure or expenditure not connected with the running of the prisons, for example, costs incurred by the probation and welfare service.  The figures, however, include the cost of conducting escorts.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that the application in respect of the person referred to in the question has been formally transmitted by the <Col N="692" /> United Kingdom authorities and is currently under consideration in this jurisdiction.  It must be confirmed that the offences for which he was convicted in the United Kingdom would also constitute offences if committed in this jurisdiction. In this regard, I have been advised that additional information is required and the UK authorities have been requested to forward same as soon as possible.  I, for my part, will only then be in a position to make a decision on the application.</P>
      <P>Assuming this application is consented to by me, the United Kingdom authorities will be advised accordingly.  We will then have to await the consent of the Home Secretary and formal consent of the prisoner to the transfer, there must be three-way prior consent from the sentenced person and from the authorities of both States for a transfer to take place.  On receipt of same, arrangements will be made to apply to the High Court for the necessary warrant authorising his transfer into this jurisdiction and his continued detention.</P>
      <P>These procedures are as required under the Convention and must be adhered to in considering any transfer application.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to say how long it will take for this application to be considered.

      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the public sector and the economy as a whole are fully prepared for the introduction of the Euro.  All Departments, including mine, have prepared a draft Euro changeover plan, for consideration by the Department of Finance, whom the Government has determined will have overall responsibility for co-ordinating Ireland's preparations for the changeover to the Euro.  I <Col N="698" /> understand the Second Edition of the National Changeover Plan is expected to be published shortly.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to a Dáil question on 3 December last, I am monitoring closely the activities of both Bord Fáilte and CERT, the agencies under the aegis of my Department with specific responsibility for the tourism industry, to ensure that they play their part in gearing up the industry for the challenges of EMU.  The agencies will be maintaining close contact with the industry in this context and will be taking every opportunity to keep the industry advised on issues impacting on them in the run up to the EMU.</P>
      <P>So far, there has been no need for me to meet the industry specifically in the matter but, should such a need arise, I will be very happy to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the allocation for sports programmes in my Department's Vote for 1998 inclusive of funding announced in the recent budget.  The 1998 allocation represents an increase of 95 per cent or almost double the provision in the corresponding 1997 allocation. The additional funding will allow my Department to achieve significant progress in the coming year.</P>
      <P>I am obviously very pleased at the 80 per cent increase in the level of funding for the schemes under the sports capital programme which will enable me to increase grant payments to £9 million in 1998 to sports clubs and other voluntary organisations for the provision and upgrading of new and existing sports and recreational facilities.</P>
      <P>In addition to these moneys, my Vote will include provision for the payment of £7 million next year to the GAA.  As my colleague the Minster for Finance announced in his Budget Statement, this will be part of a £20 million grant commitment over the next three years towards the GAA's major redevelopment plans for Croke Park.</P>
      <P>I am also very pleased with the increase of over 20 per cent on the 1997 Estimate provision for current expenditure on sports activities.  This increase will provide improved support for high performance athletes, emerging young sports men and women and the national governing bodies of sport.  It will also allow for the introduction of an anti-doping initiative in sport and the targeting of sports initiatives at young people in identified areas of disadvantage.  This work will be facilitated by the setting up of the Sports Council on a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>Specific targets have been set under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 for improving tourism activity in the shoulder and off-peak seasons.  At the beginning of the programme 70 per cent of visitors came to Ireland during the off-peak season and the aim is to increase this figure to 75 per cent by 1999.  The mid-term target set out in the programme is for 72 per cent of visitors to arrive outside the peak period and I am happy to say that this target was reached during 1996.</P>
      <P>On the product development side, the addition to the range and quality of weather independent facilities in recent years is helping to improve the seasonal profile of the tourism product range.  The assistance which the industry has received under the Tourism Operation Programme has been of considerable benefit in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the marketing side, the overseas tourism marketing initiative, which is a State-industry partnership marketing initiative, promotes Ireland on a year round basis in the key tourism markets of the US, Britain, France and Germany. Many of its campaigns are directed at attracting visitors outside the peak season.  Tourism Brand Ireland is a key part of a new strategic approach to marketing, designed to address major issues such as yield, regional spread and seasonality. The advertising emphasis is on aspects of the Irish holiday experience such as human interaction, culture and historical heritage which are not season-dependent.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Council has been very active in recent years in developing new projects and ideas to extend the tourist season such as the Celtic Flame Music Festival.  In 1997 festival events were held in Dublin, Galway, Cork and Limerick with almost £100,000 committed in funding to continuation and extension of the project in 1998.  This festival is specially aimed at attracting visitors from Britain and Europe in the early part of the year.</P>
      <P>Another initiative to help address the seasonality issue is the re-invigorated national St. Patrick's Festival in Dublin.  I am talking to a number of interested parties in relation to developing a national Millennium celebration which will have a strong seasonality profile.</P>
      <P>The domestic tourism marketing campaign has a particular focus on developing the off-season market and is providing an important boost to the domestic market this year.  Plans for a 1998 promotions campaign are being developed and it is hoped to announce details early in the New Year.</P>

      <P>Recent surveys confirm that the tourism industry suffers from a poor image among potential employees.  A combination of factors have resulted in this perception and efforts by all concerned need to be harnessed to rectify this situation.  The industry in particular acknowledges the need to improve the total employment package to make the sector more attractive to young employees.</P>
      <P>The Irish Hotels Federation has launched its quality employer programme which outlines in detail the industry's willingness to tackle the staffing problems within the sector.  This programme outlines a code of practice for employers, covering all areas of employment, including recruitment and selection of staff, contracts of employment, training and development and career progression.  The programme also addresses problems relating to pay and conditions of employment and seeks to remedy the image of the industry regarding these issues.</P>
      <P>CERT has also introduced a tourism awareness programme which is aimed at secondary schools and is designed to encourage greater interest among school leavers in the tourism industry. Over 5,000 students enrolled on the programme last year which it is hoped will help to dispel the poor image of the industry among school leavers.</P>
      <P>Over the period of the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-99 CERT will invest £75 million in tourism training.  Career opportunities within the industry are also being actively promoted to encourage people to look to their long-term career prospects within the industry.</P>
      <P>Recently a major £20 million investment programme was announced by me as part of the Education Technology Investment Fund launched by my collegue the Minister for Education and Science. This will allow for expansion and upgrading of tourism training facilities to take place at the regional technical colleges in Cork, Tralee, Waterford, Athlone and Tallaght resulting in the provision of 2,000 training places for recruits into the industry.  This development will form part of CERT's strategy in response to concerns about skills shortages in the industry into the new Millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these actions are essential to improve the position of the tourism industry if the sector is to continue to grow and develop.  Beyond the Millennium other sectors of industry will be competing for a smaller pool of recruits and tourism needs to be equally attractive to ensure staff of a <Col N="701" /> high calibre are encouraged to join and stay in the sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 335 to 341, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The mid-term review of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99 was completed last July.  The review was based in the first instance on a comprehensive evaluation prepared by independent consultants appointed by the monitoring committee for the programme.  The evaluation was structured as follows: an assessment of changes in the external environment and their impact on the future strategy, objectives and operation of the programme; a review of each sub-programme under a common set of headings; an assessment of institutional arrangements for integrated local development; an assessment of the existing and proposed performance monitoring system (PMS); and presentation of conclusions and recommendations at programme and sub-programme level.</P>
      <P>The findings of the evaluation were considered by the monitoring committee in April this year, and by the CSF monitoring committee in July and both committees endorsed their conclusions, including the following: notwithstanding changes which had occurred in the wider environment, that the stated objectives in the programme are still relevant and valid; that all existing sub-programmes and measures should continue to the end of the programme; that all of the funding allocated on the basis of these measures would be spent effectively during the lifetime of the programme; that developing and sharing models of best practice continue to be an important feature of this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evaluators recommended that there should be a further review of Sub-Programme 2 in Spring 1998 using full year data, which will be available by then for the first time, from a specially designed, computerised performance monitoring system.  While the precise terms of reference of the review are still being finalised, they will include assessment of the impact on, and effectiveness for, people within the target groups.  As the principal objective of this sub-programme is to counter disadvantage through support for communities which make a collective effort to maximise the development potential of their areas, any analysis of impact will take account of local and regional data.  The review will be informed by complementary research and studies into the <Col N="703" /> consultation, inclusion and participation process, and the linkages, networking and synergy developed under the sub-programme.  The review will be funded from technical assistance which is provided specifically to ensure effective programme evaluation, including the manner in which it targets funding.</P>
    <P>The CSF monitoring committee also decided at the mid-term review to reallocate 1 MECU in ESF funds from within the OP to childcare infrastructure under the human resources OP, and has asked the programme monitoring committee to examine scope for use of existing funds to develop a number of other initiatives, e.g. further progression places for early school leavers.</P>
    <P>The follow-up action required from the mid-term review has already been discussed by the Programme Monitoring Committee, at its meeting on 23 October 1997, and will be closely monitored over the remainder of the programme.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee is very conscious of the importance of the gender equality objective within the programme and the centrality of the promotion of equality in terms of combating social exclusion.  This objective was included in the mid-term review, and will continue to be monitored and discussed regularly by the monitoring committee in the course of the remainder of the programme period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 344 and 351 together.</P>
      <P>Members of my Departnment's psychological service who are deployed in primary schools carry out assessments as the resources of time and personnel allow.  Pupils are referred for assessment mainly by school principals in consultation with their teaching colleagues and with their area psychologist.</P>
      <P>Eligibility to receive help from the psychologist is not confined to pupils in any specific categories. The main reasons for referral to my Department's psychological service are poor academic progress, consideration for placement in a special school or class and behavioural or emotional difficulties. Where learning, emotional or linguistic difficulties are perceived to be more serious, the Department's psychologists refer pupils on to the appropriate agencies of health authorities for further assessment and treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In consultation with school principals and teaching staff, my Department's psychologists <Col N="705" /> give priority to pupils whose difficulties are perceived to be acute, and do not operate a formal waiting list. Such pupils may therefore be seen without undue delay.  In general, the school principal makes the referral to the area psychologist by completing a standard referral form.  The child's parents must be consulted in advance, and their written consent is essential.  Assessments by Department psychologists, including meetings with parents, normally take place in school.  An oral report is given at once to teachers and parents, and a written report follows within a few weeks.</P>
    <P>My Department does not yet provide a psychological service to primary schools in County Westmeath.  Responsibility for the provision of psychological services to children in national schools in the area, including waiting time for assessment, rests with the relevant regional health board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to: the number of children under 16 years who had detention sentences imposed on them in each of the past ten years; the number of places available at each of the detention centres and the annual cost of each centre per detainee, is detailed in the following tables.</P>
      <P>Children are placed in the young offender centres on foot of detention orders made by the courts.  Where it is proposed to impose a custodial sentence, officers of the courts normally contact the centres in advance to confirm the availability of a suitable place.  Instances do arise where, for example, a long-term place is not immediately available in the particular facility nominated by the court.  In such situations the court is advised of the date on which a place in the facility in question will become available.  The court is also advised of available alternative places, for example, vacancies in other centres or available remand places.  In such instances, the court may avail of the alternatives offered, pending the availability of the long-term place.  The management of the centres operate in close consultation with the courts in such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> Precise information on the number of children released due to lack of immediate accommodation in places of detention, is not readily available.  The position regarding availability of accommodation can change on an hourly or daily basis, depending on decisions taken in courts throughout the country on individual cases.</P>
    <P>There is growing pressure on places for offenders in the 14-15 age group.  Proposals to address this issue are being developed in my Department as part of a comprehensive range of measures in the context of the Children Bill, which has been brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  These proposals envisage the development of an extra 24 places for young male offenders in the 14-15 age group and an extra seven places for young female offenders.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that measures already in place, coupled with the developments envisaged under the Children Bill, will bring about a major improvement in the State's capacity to deal with young people coming into conflict with the law.</P>

    <P>*Trinity House is the only secure centre in operation and involves staffing levels and other cost factors related to security and control which are not required in other centres.</P>
    <P>**The relatively high costs involved in these cases reflects the fact that as Reformatory Schools deal with the older more difficult cases, they require more intensive staffing levels than the Industrial Schools.  It is also the case that neither of the reformatory schools enjoy the economies of scale which can be availed of in the Industrial Schools which are both much larger facilities.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of clause 2 (iii) of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, claims for special increases in remuneration may only be processed subject to agreement being reached in relation to changes in structures, work practices, flexibility and change and improved quality of public service.  In the case of nurses in the health sector, payment of special increases was agreed following the conclusion of negotiations between the parties concerned i.e. the Department of Health and Children-Health Services Employers' Agency and four staff organisations representing nurses in the sector.</P>
      <P>Similarly, claims in the nature of special pay increases for other nursing staff, such as, for example, those employed in schools and colleges and other educational institutions also fall to be considered under the terms of clause 2 (iii) of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work . The processing of such claims is a matter for negotiation between the employer and staff representative organisations in the relevant institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A pay claim under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work in respect of staff, including nursing staff, in schools providing special services for children in care is being discussed within the normal pay negotiating machinery.  The most recent discussions relating to this matter took place on 3 December 1997.  No agreement was <Col N="708" /> reached on that occasion and the matter will require further consultation between the parties concerned.  A further meeting between representatives of the management and staff interests is scheduled to take place on 18 December 1997.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Competitiveness and Work provided that a down payment of 1 per cent could be made pending the outcome of the negotiations on the final claim for a special increase.  Payment of the 1 per cent increase has been implemented.  Other general round increases provided for under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work have also been implemented.  However, in relation to the payment of special increases, no further payments may be made in advance of the parties concerned reaching agreement.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's representations in this case.  School discipline matters are the responsibility of individual school authorities and my Department does not normally intervene in decisions made by schools in individual cases. However, my Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in this area.  While the guidelines recognise there is a need for sanctions to register disapproval of unacceptable behaviour, they stress the need for proportionality of response to incidents of misbehaviour and the use of expulsion only as a last resort.  In reaching decisions in individual cases, school authorities have to balance carefully the needs of individual students with their responsibility to the general body of their students.  Arrangements are being made to have the matter raised with the school concerned with a view to ensuring that the boy in question resumes his studies as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I explained in my previous answer on 18 November 1997 that, although the circular makes no reference to career breaks, it was intended that the provisions set out in the circular for early retirement were to be availed of by teachers in current teaching service.  In the case of applicants under strand 3, under which the person referred to by the Deputy applied, the circular specifies that applicants must be in posts which are surplus to requirements.  The person in question is not in a teaching post but is on unpaid leave from her post, being on a career break.  She was consequently notified by my Department on 29 August 1997 that her application was ineligible.</P>

      <P>Anonymous allegations relating to some of the issues raised by the Deputy were brought to my Department's attention in August 1996.  In turn, my Department brought these allegations to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners as the principal allegations then raised fell within the remit of that body.  Subsequently, the allegations were referred to the vocational education committee for investigation and report to the Department.  Some of the allegations in question were also brought to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office which, as the Deputy is aware, has statutory responsibility for the adult of vocational education committee accounts.</P>
      <P>An interim report has been received from the vocational education committee.  As the Deputy's question raises additional issues which were not part of the earlier anonymous allegations, my Department is seeking a further report from the vocational education committee on these matters.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the next school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to allocate additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools. However, the needs of the schools to which Deputies refer will be considered in the context of any future allocation of remedial teacher posts which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years' duration, at approved colleges.  Over 28,000 students benefitted under the initiative in 1995-96 at a cost to the Exchequer of £54.5 million in 1996.  The free fees initiative does not extend to students pursuing part-time or evening courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest available figures in relation to part-time students are those in respect of the 1995-96 academic year when there were some 22,000 part-time <Col N="716" /> students at third level.  In general, students pursuing part-time or evening courses are employed while students pursuing full-time day courses are full-time students.  In this regard, the profile of part-time students considered by the steering committee on the future development of higher education indicated that almost 90 per cent of part-time students were in employment. In this context, tax relief is available, at the standard rate, under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996, for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>

The position is that a student who is not attending a second level school full-time may be admitted to the leaving certificate examination as an external candidate.  While in practice many schools are prepared to provide places for external candidates there is no obligation on a school to accommodate students who are not attending the school.  In this case the student concerned is not attending the school which was his preferred choice as an examination centre and the school apparently was unable to accommodate him.  On his application form the student has selected another centre and my Department will make every effort to ensure that he is accommodated in that centre.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, a revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced in October 1994 on a pilot basis and has since been extended to a large number of nursing schools in association with local higher education institutions.  The programme is funded by the Department of Health and Children, at a cost of some £13 million in 1997.  Successful completion of the three <Col N="718" /> year programme leads to a Diploma in Nursing Studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the continuing education of nurses is that the Department of Health and Children has been engaged in consultations with a number of third level institutions in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which would be open both to nurses who complete the new education and training programme and to nurses who qualified under the traditional model of education and training. The purpose of these programmes is to provide those members of the nursing profession who wish to obtain a post-registration qualification at degree level with an opportunity to do so by means of a one year part-time programme.  The first such programme was offered by Dublin City University earlier this year and I understand Trinity College, Dublin, proposes to offer a similar part-time programme from February 1998. These programmes are provided on a self-financing basis and the nurses involved can claim tax relief on their fees or apply to their relevant health agency for assistance from the funding provided by the Department of Health and Children for the continuing education of registered nurses.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposal of the National University of Ireland, Galway to offer a one year degree programme, on a full-time basis, from January 1998.  The present position is that the Higher Education Authority has discussed the proposed course with the National University of Ireland, Galway, and has asked the university to align its proposal with the approach adopted in the other colleges.</P>

      <P>The recent OECD report on adult literacy in Ireland gives cause for concern.  My Department will be considering the issues raised in this report, but, as an immediate response, I am increasing the provision for adult literacy by £2 million, for 1998.  This is almost a doubling of the 1997 allocation.  I will continue to increase funding in this area as resources become available.</P>
