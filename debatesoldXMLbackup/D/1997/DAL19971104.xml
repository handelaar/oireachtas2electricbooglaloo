      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>whether he has met with the Information Society Commission; if he will set a target for increasing the proportion of Government business conducted with the public which can be conducted electronically; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference of the Information Society Commission, which I discussed at a meeting with the commission's chairperson, encompass both the public and private sectors. The delivery of quality customer service is a cornerstone of the public service change programme under the strategic management initiative. Among the key issues being considered are the methods of service provision, including payment methods, location of contact points, opening hours and delivery times.  It is against this background that the scope for increasing the proportion of Government business with the public that can be conducted electronically is being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The SMI working group on information technology has examined the implications of the information society for the Civil Service and the public service.  The areas identified by the group regarding the potential for service delivery in a number of areas include greater use of websites by Departments and offices to provide information to the public, including data on structures, organisation, functions and services which will be legally required to be published under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997; access to public procurement information electronically through websites and e-mail, including notices of tenders; use of electronic media to process actual business, including taxation returns, planning applications, licence applications, and to communicate with various sectoral economic groups required to regularly submit group-specific information to Government Departments and agencies, for <Col N="386" /> example, motor traders, industrial groups and representative bodies.  However, the whole area of electronic service provision must be approached with caution.  The absence of suitable public standards regarding unique identification and privacy constrains the types of electronically-based services that can currently be provided.</P>
    <P>Legal issues also need to be addressed, including the evidential value of electronically-based transactions in Irish courts.  These legal questions are common to all administrations.  They are beginning to be addressed in other administrations in Europe, and it is likely that EU-wide solutions will emerge over the next few years.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, there are difficulties in setting a target on the lines suggested by the Deputy. The issue of standards and a legal framework are now being examined by the Information Society Commission and I look forward to receiving the advice of the commission in due course.  In the meantime, consideration of how best to exploit the potential of information technology in meeting the needs of their customers and clients in the context of the strategic management initiative is being advanced through the new SMI Implementation Group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the state of work with regard to the evidential value of electronic transactions in courts given that a resolution of this issue is crucial to any serious use of electronic mail for commercial purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has not been tested but the commission is examining precisely how it could be undertaken.  It is looking at what is taking place in other administrations although there has been little movement elsewhere.  The Deputy is correct in saying it is vital.  While much progress has been made on straightforward issues such as Revenue returns, social welfare benefits and compliance with various licences, we must await until the court issue is resolved.</P>
      <P>The taxation of technology information, a &ldquo;bit tax&rdquo;, is a separate issue which is also being examined. Both issues are fundamental to what will happen over the next few years.  The technology companies, the Information Society Commission and the regulatory bodies are anxious for progress on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there is a potential opening for Ireland in being the first country to introduce clear legislation establishing the evidential value of electronic transactions?  This could make us the location for similar work which would have the protection of the courts.  Would he not agree that, in addition to relying on the Information Society Commission to work on this matter, he should direct the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Law Reform Commission or both to prepare draft legislation as a priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there not a problem in that there are no laws governing libel, slander and decency in terms of <Col N="387" /> what may be transmitted by electronic mail and other information disseminated electronically? This area needs legal attention in so far as other media are subject to proper protections yet there are no protections for persons' reputations regarding electronically transmitted material.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in pointing out the opportunities available for the future. Members of the commission and other commercial interests have pointed this out.  I have had discussions since the beginning of September regarding regulatory control to examine whether we could establish it here and lead the way.  Some useful work has been done but I would not wish to overstate that work.  Some private companies have provided useful papers which could be used by the Information Society Commission and the Government.  The Deputy will also be aware of the Forfás report which was presented some time ago.  A report was commissioned by the former Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, which sought to examine aspects of this issue.  That report has been taken on board by officials in the Department of Public Enterprise, Forfás and the Information Society Commission itself.</P>
      <P>In relation to the legal aspects of this issue and the controls which are in place, the Department of Justice is looking at those, particularly in relation to child pornography, and will examine the possibility of introducing legislative demands. Such legislation could also cover areas other than child pornography.</P>
      <P>Informal and formal talks are ongoing in Brussels on precisely how the legal issue can be dealt with.  Some countries have started to take in data on web sites and subsequently sublet the information. They have run into great difficulties because of the legal consequences involved.  I will ask the Department of Justice and the Attorney General to give particular attention to that issue.</P>

      <P>I met the Northern Ireland Minister for Political Development, Mr. Paul Murphy, on 17 October 1997.</P>
      <P>Following our meeting, Minister Murphy and I expressed satisfaction at the successful commencement of the substantive three strand talks and urged all to participate fully and constructively in building the peace for which the vast majority of people yearn.</P>
      <P>Minister Murphy briefed me on the Public Processions Legislation.  I gave my reaction to the legislation in my reply to questions in the House the week before last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss Articles 2 and 3 during his meeting with the Minister for Political Development?  Can he indicate whether or not it was made clear that the position of the current Irish Government and the previous one was that Articles 2 and 3 would be discussed in the negotiations which would provide for balanced constitutional change?  I ask this in light of the subsequent confusion which arose some days later over a remark made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Foreign Affairs subsequently clarified that issue within the talks.  My discussions with the Minister for Political Development ranged over the three strands.  We discussed the progress which had been made to date and what we hope to achieve before Christmas. Through the work of the liaison group and the decommissioning sub-committee, substantial progress has been made.  We are determined to move the process forward as quickly as we can.  There was a very successful meeting in relation to the strand II talks earlier today.  Progress could not be considered to be speedy but the amount of engagement and dialogue, preparation and presentation of papers in the various strands and the discussion arising from them is useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Extremists on all sides are unhappy at the fact that the main players in Northern Ireland, including the British and Irish Governments, are sitting down to reach what, in effect, will be a compromise.  In view of the fragility of the process, it is important that we do not send out signals which could be misread and that not only the Irish Government but all sides in these negotiations be extremely careful about the signals they deliver so as not to strengthen the hands of extremists on any side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  The discussions over the winter will be delicate.  In the context of Northern Ireland people do not at times need signals to react.  We are conscious of this and are careful to present things in a useful light.  There are times when people either correctly or incorrectly interpret issues resulting in the need for clarification.  Very useful bilateral meetings are held on a weekly basis.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs tries to have bilateral meetings with practically everybody thus helping to move things forward, smooth potential difficulties and keep an emphasis on the three strands.  We continue to drive the process forward through our own formal and informal dialogue with as wide a range of people as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government tabled any detailed proposals on how the North-South body or bodies would work in terms of the precise methods of decision making, the extent to which powers of Departments would be handed over to the body and how legal responsibilities would be <Col N="389" /> distributed between Departments, the North-South body and departments in Belfast?  Does the Taoiseach agree this type of detail needs to be addressed over a considerable period and is not something that can be left to the end of the discussions? Will he assure the House that detailed preparatory work is being done on these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I give the Deputy that assurance. Strand two is the main area for possible disagreement. That strand of the talks has been outlined and it will take substantial negotiation to resolve the difficulties to be addressed.  However, a framework has been established to do that. Regarding the East-West presentation, there has already been some very useful dialogue with the British Government and officials.  Today some of my officials met officials of Mr. Blair in a useful session.</P>
      <P>Strand two is more delicate.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already tabled substantial papers, although not as comprehensive as Deputy Bruton mentioned.  Most of the activity and dialogue in which we are engaged among ourselves and with some of the other parties concern strand two in order to see how, in line with the framework and other suggestions that have been made, there can be constructive North-South bodies with substantial powers which can usefully deal with mutually beneficial issues while being sensitive to the difficulties involved.  This is not easy but it is the central part of the negotiations upon which we must focus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that North-South bodies are much more threatening in the eyes of Unionists when spoken about in the abstract than when discussed in practical detail and that much of what these bodies would do in practice would not threaten anybody?  Does the Taoiseach agree it is important that the talks move to detailed discussion so that the fundamentally benign character of these institutions from everyone's point of view can be made evident rather than have the discussion conducted at the level of general principle, as it now is, where there are obvious and irreconcilable differences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of substance in the discussions.  It is true that North-South institutions or bodies with executive or other powers would not be threatening.  It is often the presentation of what they might lead to, and not the bodies, which creates concerns for people. Much of the dialogue has been helpful and constructive. People have been fair and have been prepared to move in the talks, but there is a perception that these are intrinsically linked to some future agenda.  I, along with my officials and a number of Ministers, have been at pains to say that in all of these discussions what we are trying to do is keep within what has already been set down in a number of useful documents since 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> The format of the North-South dimension with executive powers is something on which we are moving and, while I would not agree with everything Mr. Trimble said in his recent speech to his conference, I welcomed the fact that he clearly signalled the role for the nationalist community within new structures was important and that is what we must focus on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach raise as a matter of urgency with Mr. Paul Murphy or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the concerns expressed in two Sunday newspapers about the Robert Hamill case, which also raises questions about an RUC patrol in Portadown whose version of events around that sectarian murder has changed radically from one police statement to the next?  Will he support the call, as I do, for an independent inquiry into the matter?  Does he agree this matter must be faced so that all members of the public in Northern Ireland can have confidence in the police and the course of justice there?  This matter is being raised today at a press conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into the detail of that case but in the normal course of events it will be raised in the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether his statutory responsibilities relating to the reform of the law of the State, pursuant to the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, should be transferred to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in order to place a direct onus on implementing the reports of the Commission on that Minister.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18092/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory functions of the Taoiseach in relation to the Law Reform Commission, as set out in the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, could be described, in general terms, as providing for the Taoiseach to be the conduit for the submission to the Government of matters relevant to the Commission, such as membership, annual reports and work programmes. There are no specific responsibilities on the Taoiseach in reform of the law.  The Taoiseach also has certain statutory functions in staffing matters.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to transfer these functions to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and such a transfer would not in any event have the effect envisaged by the Deputy. The Law Reform Commission is an independent research body whose statutory function is to keep the law under review and to formulate proposals for law reform.  The Government is not and has not ever been bound to act on proposals of the Commission.  That is not to say that the reports of the Commission are ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> Examination by the Commission of aspects of law can provide a very useful backdrop for consideration by administrators and legislators.  An examination of the Commission's annual reports will show that many recommendations of the Commission have been legislated for in recent years.</P>
    <P>Recommendations from the Commission's Report on the Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime contributed to three Acts passed in 1996, namely the Proceeds of Crime Act, the Criminal Assets Bureau Act and the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act.  In 1997 the Bail Act and the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act reflected the work of the Commission, as do Bills at an early stage of preparation on nullity, fraud offences, indexation of fines and civil evidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the work done by the various Law Reform Commissions since 1975.</P>
      <P>In his reply the Taoiseach stated he has no special responsibility for the implementation of law reform and that is exactly my concern.  I put it to him that there does not seem to be anybody in the Taoiseach's office who has responsibility for advancing the process from the publication of the reports to recommendations for legislation.  I put it to him that it would be worth providing that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has responsibility for criminal and civil law reform, will be in a position, by virtue of the statutory instrument, to get on with the work. The Law Reform Commission has provided a solid basis of research &mdash; it has produced some 54 reports and other working papers &mdash; but there is a potential for the good work done by the commission not to be implemented under present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point.  As I stated, the Act provides no legislative basis for this &mdash; I am merely quoting what is in the legislation rather than what the spirit should perhaps be.  The Deputy suggests that if reports are put forward someone should then drive the recommendations further.  In researching the question I noted it had been suggested that there should be a separate criminal law reform commission to follow through on these matters but it was not decided to do that when the suggestion was made a number of years ago, nor was anything else done.  The Deputy will be familiar with the Deloitte Touche report, commissioned some time ago, which is considering the implementation of these issues.  I may raise it in that context with my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Mr. Hederman to see if any issue in that area is worth pursuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach would do that.  If it is his judgment that he will not transfer the totality of his responsibilities to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="392" /> Reform, an official should be appointed with responsibility for following through on the excellent work done by the Law Reform Commission in the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that.  I take the point that under the Act of 1975 it is not a legislative function but I assume that the spirit of the Act is that the matter would be followed up.  At times it is actively done but it is not covered in the law.  I will raise the issue with the appropriate authorities.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in a statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The information is indicative only as statistics are not normally available at less than electoral ward level and because of the evolution in townland boundaries since 1926.  The statement shows that approximately 1,226 townlands have been depopulated in the interim, representing some 6.2 per cent of the total number of 19,779 townlands recorded in 1926.</P>

They pored over some 20,000 townlands to get the information required, which will be valuable in planning terms.</P>

    <P>The population of the province of Connacht in the last census, in 1996, was 433,231 and the corresponding figure in 1926 was 552,907.  That is a substantial reduction but the figure for 1991 was 423,031 so it has stabilised considerably.  In the three Ulster counties the population for 1996 was 234,251, as against 300,091 in 1926.  In 1991 that figure was 232,000.  It showed a slight population increase in 1996.</P>
    <P>Population statistics for individual counties will appear in the Official Report.  If the Deputy so wishes, I will refer to them briefly. Galway County and County Borough had a population of 188,854 in 1996; Leitrim had 25,057, which compares to a 1926 population of 55,907.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Deputy is probably interested in County Mayo whose population was 111,524 in 1996.  In 1926 that figure was 172,690, a reduction <Col N="394" /> of some 60,000.  However, in 1991, the last census before the 1996 one, the population of Mayo was 110,713.  There has been a slight increase in the population of County Mayo since 1991.</P>
    <P>County Roscommon had a population of 51,975 in 1996 compared to 83,556 in 1926. County Sligo had a population of 55,821 in 1996 compared to 71,388 in 1926.  County Cavan had 52,944 in 1996 compared to 82,452 some 70 years earlier.  County Donegal had a population of 129,994 in 1996 compared to 152,508 in 1926 and County Monaghan had a population of 51,313 in 1996 compared to 65,131 in 1926.</P>
    <P>The combined population total for Connacht and Ulster (part of) in 1996 was 667,482.  In 1926 that figure was 852,998, although it has stabilised in recent years.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply.  I acknowledge that considerable research was involved in obtaining the figures, which are important for plans, projections and policies.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that in the 70 years from 1926 to 1996 there was a huge and devastating drop in population in the Connacht and Ulster counties?  Judging by the figures, more than 200,000 people, or 27 per cent of the population, have gone.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned there has been a stabilisation of the population in some counties.  For example, in Mayo there was a marginal increase of 800.  According to the figures, however, some 1,226 townlands that recorded a population presence in 1926 do not have one individual living there now.  Those townlands are effectively dead and do not have a bachelor, a widow, a widower or a young person living in them.</P>
      <P>The stabilisation of the figures masks the fact that within counties people have moved to larger towns such as Galway, Sligo, Westport and Castlebar.  There has been wholesale rural rot, decline and devastation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1926 some 9 per cent of the population in Connacht and part of Ulster lived in towns comprising 1,500 or more people.  In 1996 the figure was 27 per cent, which shows the situation has improved substantially.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's main point concerns the fall in population in Connacht and part of Ulster.  He is correct in saying it has fallen by 200,000 in 70 years, but between the last two censuses of 1991 and 1996 every county in the State, except four, showed increases in population.  The four counties which did not show an increase were Longford, Cork County Borough, Limerick County Borough and Leitrim.  In every other county there was an increase in population between 1991 and 1996.  The Connacht-Ulster figure was 51,293 which increased to 51,313 five years later.  Over the past five years the situation has stabilised. However, the Deputy's point is correct for the 70 year period.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Will the Minister of State agree that EU Structural and Cohesion Funds, which are intended to bridge the gap, have led to a widening gap between the eight Connacht-Ulster counties and the rest of the country, particularly in terms of GDP?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a policy point and I do not accept it.  The population of the State has increased and there is considerable migration from these 1,200 townlands into nearby towns and cities.  They and every other area in the State have availed of Structural Funds.  There are many good examples of the use of Structural Funds in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to the principle of consent.  We have made clear on a number of occasions, most recently in the joint statement issued by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on 15 September last, that consent will be a guiding principle in the present all-party negotiations.  The procedural motion adopted in the plenary of the talks on 24 September and which launched the substantive negotiations supported the views of the two Governments on consent. Sinn Féin voted against the section of that motion which dealt with consent.</P>
      <P>It is important to be aware that acceptance of the principle of consent, however desirable, is not a precondition for participation in the talks.  This principle will be discussed alongside other issues in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>There is a further set of principles &mdash; the six Mitchell principles &mdash; which are also relevant to any discussion of this issue.  One of these principles, as set out in the report of the international body chaired by Senator George Mitchell, requires the parties &ldquo;to agree to abide by the terms of any agreement reached in all-party negotiations and to resort to democratic and exclusively peaceful methods in trying to alter any aspect of that outcome with which they may disagree&rdquo;.  The two Governments and the political parties, including Sinn Féin, have affirmed their commitment to these principles.  The Government expects all parties to honour this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the Governments are committed to consent and that all parties to the talks have signed the Mitchell principles. However, Sinn Féin refused to sign the forum report in early 1995 and in more recent interviews Sinn Féin leaders have spoken about the consent <Col N="396" /> of the Irish people rather than explicitly recognising the need for the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.  Does the Minister accept that as a fair assessment of the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is terribly important that Sinn Féin is part of the talks process.  Sinn Féin voted against the element of the procedural motion which contained a reference to the principle of consent.  The party made a statement setting out its position on the issue, which it sees as being within an all-Ireland context.  This did not prevent the adoption of the motion.</P>
      <P>While Sinn Féin's position on consent differs from that of the other participants, acceptance of an agreed position on consent is not a precondition for participation in the negotiations.  Consent is an issue which will be addressed during the negotiations alongside many other issues on which there is at present no agreement.  Let us not try to anticipate the negotiations.  Instead let us encourage all sides to make the necessary compromises that will be required in the future if a fair, just, honourable and decent settlement is to be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister offering an assurance to the House that the consent of the people of Northern Ireland will be required to any outcome of the talks, irrespective of the reserve position of any persons or parties participating in those talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo; has been mentioned in many places and in all the documentation produced since the beginning of the peace process.  It might be helpful to the Deputy if I outline where the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo; is mentioned.</P>
      <P>In Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement of November 1985 both Governments &ldquo;affirm that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  In the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 the two Governments undertook to apply the principle of self-determination by the people of Ireland on the following basis.  The British Government &ldquo;recognise that it is for the people of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise the right of self-determination on the basis of consent freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland if that is their wish&rdquo;.  The Irish Government accepted that &ldquo;it would be wrong to attempt to impose a united Ireland in the absence of the freely given consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the democratic right of self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with, and subject to the agreement and consent of, a majority of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Joint Framework Document of February 1995 the two Governments say they will apply the <Col N="397" /> principle of self-determination as set out in the Downing Street Declaration.  Again the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland is identified.  On 15 September last in a joint declaration the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach stated that consent will be a guiding principle for them in the negotiations from which no outcome is excluded or predetermined.  There is reference to consent in all the documentation produced since the beginning of the peace process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimates for 1998 have not yet been published but I am confident there will be a significant increase in the 1998 funding for official development assistance.</P>
      <P>The resources available for ODA have increased significantly in recent years.  Between 1992 and this year the budget increased from £40 million to £122 million, a threefold increase. Expressed as a percentage of GNP, the growth has been from 0.16 per cent to 0.31 per cent. Relative to other donors, our aid as a percentage of GNP has increased from less than half the average of all donors in 1992 to a position where it now exceeds the donor average.  The Government is committed to maintaining a steady rate of growth in ODA with a view to reaching 0.45 per cent of GNP by 2002.  This target is an interim step on the way to reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
      <P>The projected increases will enable the Government to pursue the objectives established for Irish aid.  These are to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development in some of the poorest countries of the world; to assist in establishing and maintaining peace in developing countries by fostering democracy, respect for human rights, gender and social equality and protection of the environment; to respond promptly to emergencies and humanitarian disasters, both natural and man-made, as they occur and to support preventive measures so that emergencies may, as far as possible, be avoided and to contribute to building civil society and social solidarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition of the Irish aid programme reflects these principles.  A special programme on human rights has been established and has grown rapidly to approximately £1 million this year.  The list of priority countries for Irish bilateral assistance has been extended to include some of the world's poorest countries with the addition of Mozambique in 1996.  Collaboration with non-governmental organisations has expanded and now accounts for some 15 per cent of the total <Col N="398" /> ODA budget.  Our participation in multilateral assistance is pursued actively and reflects the same principles as those which underpin our bilateral programme.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured the Government is committed to providing adequate resources for the ODA budget and that every effort will be made to ensure that our operational activities are of the highest possible standard.</P>

      <P>I am confident the increase, which will be announced in the Estimates, will be in line with the Government commitment to increase ODA over the period of the Government to 0.45 per cent, with a view to moving in the direction of 0.7 per cent of GNP as recommended by the UN.  I am interested in increasing the democratisation elements of our development assistance programmes.  Democratisation and human rights elements are included in all such programmes and it is intended to increase the democratisation budget in the forthcoming Estimates.

I am glad the Minister is confident the increase will be <i>pro rata</i> and substantial.  I hope it will be consistent <Col N="399" /> with the increases of the past five years.  Did the Minister have an opportunity to review the accounting procedures of non-governmental organisations?  Will she bring reports before the Oireachtas on that matter and will she recommend changes in the accounting procedures?</P>

      <P>In the past year the Department has revised and strengthened its procedures for funding applications from NGOs under the various schemes operated by Irish Aid.  I raised with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the question of legislation to regulate the operation of charities generally.  I am happy that within my Department there is ongoing evaluation and supervision of the funds given to NGOs by the taxpayer, through bilateral programmes.</P>
      <P>Those funds are constantly surpervised.  It is clear the people want proper transparent accountability in respect of all the funds provided by the taxpayer through the overseas budget development to help the poorest of the world.</P>

      <P>The European Commission published its Agenda 2000 communication, and its Opinions on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe which have applied for membership of the European Union, in July 1977.  In its communication the Commission recommended that the Union open accession negotiations with Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, along with Cyprus, which has already received a positive opinion from the Commission. Generally speaking, we consider that the Commission's proposals are well constructed and balanced providing a suitable framework for the conduct of the enlargement process and an objective basis for the opening of accession negotiations.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the conclusions of the Amsterdam European Council, it is for the Luxembourg European Council in December to take the necessary decisions with regard to the management of the Enlargement process, including with which countries the Union should open accession negotiations.  I would expect that the Heads of State and Government will give due weight and consideration to the Commission's proposals.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that not all the difficulties in terms of being off the starting block in the first group, relate to economic preparedness for membership of the European Union and that in the case of at least one applicant State, Slovakia, which might be considered <Col N="400" /> to be economically prepared, the problem is an absence of democratic institutions?  What steps are the Minister and his colleagues in the General Affairs Council taking to improve the situation in Slovakia to include that country in the early group of States to negotiate for membership of the Union?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right that Slovakia does not meet the political criteria of stability of democratic institutions.  None of the candidates fully meet the economic critera for a functioning market economy together with the capacity to take on the <i>acquis communitaire.</i>  The best I can say in relation to Slovakia is that I intervened in the informal gymnic at Mondorf in Luxembourg on 24-25 October.  I suggested in the context of the proposed council, which will address the whole question of enlargement, the question of the first five and one including the second tranche, that the issue of Slovakia be addressed.  As the Deputy said there are problems in Slovakia in relation to the democratisation of institutions.  That is one of the first issues to be addressed in the context of any application or final opinion given on the Slovakian application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Southern Cyprus is linked with Northern Cyprus.  Tragically that island is partitioned. Unfortunately from the point of view of Northern Cyprus it must be seen in the context of how we envisage Turkey where there are a number of problems, more particularly in the area of human rights involving the Kurds.  These issues are being addressed.  It is not possible to take Cyprus as a totality, unfortunately it has to be seen in the context of the Turkish application for membership of the EU.</P>

Does he agree, therefore, that notwithstanding the challenges the proposed enlargement presents for the European Union, it also presents a unique opportunity for peace and stability on the Continent of Europe?  Does he agree that we should favour the expansion and integration of the European Union not merely for self-interest but for the interests of our neighbours in central and eastern Europe?</P>

As the Deputy stated, the inclusion of the countries mentioned during our interchange would be of great benefit to the future peace and stability on the European Continent which has experienced two world wars in the past.  It was to avoid such horror that the ideal of a European community was initiated.  For that reason, we should ensure the European Union expands in the pursuit of a permanent peace on the Continent of Europe.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's position regarding possible changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution in view of the current peace process and particularly in view of remarks made by him on 20 October 1997; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's position on possible changes to Articles 2 and 3 has been set out formally by successive Governments in the Downing Street Declaration of December 1993 and the Joint Framework Document of February 1995, with which the Deputy and the House are familiar.</P>
      <P>In my remarks at the multi-party negotiations on 20 October, in responding in particular to the Ulster Unionist Party, I confirmed this position. On that occasion I stated:</P>
      <P>I am happy to set out again the position of the Irish Government on Articles 2 and 3.  As the negotiations progress, we will discuss proposals for change in the Irish Constitution as part both of balanced constitutional change and of an overall agreement.  This is a shared position with the British Government, as set out formally in the Framework Document.  The achievement of an overall agreement is what we are now about, and all items are of course on the table as of now, including balanced constitutional change, and are open for discussion. The overall agreement, including its balanced constitutional dimension, will of course be put to the people in the referendums at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make one further point, and this again repeats what I said this morning.  The Irish Government is deeply aware of the sincerely held views of the Unionist community on Articles 2 and 3, and we are listening carefully to what is being said to us here by their delegation about these Articles.  But Unionist concerns about Articles 2 and 3 are mirrored <Col N="402" /> by the deep significance of these Articles for the identity of the Nationalist community.  If we are to reach an honourable agreement, both of these realities must be addressed together or, as Seamus Mallon has put it, what is needed are arrangements to ensure &ldquo;equality of allegiance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have no illusion about the complexity and the difficulty of the above challenges, including that of finding a balanced constitutional accommodation. But that is the challenge and that is the responsibility that has been given to all of us.  The Irish Government will not be found wanting in meeting this challenge and this responsibility.</P>
    <P>There can be no mistake, therefore, about the Government's commitment in this area, and this has been made clear to the other parties in the talks.  The Government is ready to discuss with the parties in Northern Ireland their concerns in relation to possible constitutional change in this jurisdiction, including Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    <P>It would in due course be for the Oireachtas to put to the people for their approval any proposed amendments to the Constitution arising in the context of an overall peace settlement in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Was the Minister for Foreign Affairs surprised at the reaction of the Unionists participants in the talks to his earlier remarks in regard to their walkout and does he consider that any attitudes or actions of his led Mr. Maginnis to describe him as having come with a macho and aggressive attitude to the discussions?</P>

      <P>No, I was shocked, perplexed and horrified.  With respect to the Deputy's serious question, there may have been some misunderstanding about what I said.  I had not finished what I intended to say when they walked out.  They walked out on the basis that they said they wanted to reflect on my unfinished statement. When they reflected they quickly came back in the afternoon session when I made my position clear as per the statement I read out to the House.  I am still perplexed as to the reason for their withdrawal, but happily they came back. I had a bilateral meeting previously to that with Mr. Trimble and happily and hopefully I will meet him next week when I will ask for another bilateral meeting with him.  Peace broke out in the peace talks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early at this stage to give an indication as to what the final outcome of the talks will be.  I have no doubt that Séamus Mallon's quotation and its meaning will be discussed at length in the talks.  It is a hoped for outcome of the talks that we talk about the equality of allegiance, but whether it will be enshrined in those terms or in the formula proposed by Mr. Mallon in the final outcome of the talks is another question.</P>

      <P>Given that the questions we are pursuing are in the context of remarks made in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution, that the Minister's clarification of his remarks was to the effect that the Government would pursue a balanced constitutional arrangement in the context of talks which would reach a balanced settlement and bringing Seamus Mallon's reference to equality of allegiance into that discussion <i>vis-a -vis</i> constitutional matters, surely we are entitled to assume we are talking about a constitutional change in the Republic and an equivalent change in British statute which would provide for that equality of allegiance of the people in Northern Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>There is no doubt that Unionists see Articles 2 and 3 in a serious light and they take every opportunity to remind us of their significance in our Constitution.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's <i>imprimatur.</i></P>
      <P>Ireland and our EU partners, including Britain, are committed to increasing co-operation to fight the scourge of illegal drugs and the inter-related problem of international crime.  This priority is reflected in the enhancement of the justice and home affairs provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty, and through close co-ordination of EU policy in the UN and other international fora that have a primary role in the fight against drug trafficking. Co-operation in this area has rightly assumed high priority in the EU's developing partnership and co-operation with the US, with the countries of central and eastern Europe, with Russia, Asia and Latin America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the main frameworks in which Ireland and Britain co-operate in the fight against drug trafficking.  It would be important, in looking at suggestions to further improve such co-operation, perhaps within the framework of any new East-West arrangements agreed under strand III of the multi-party negotiations, to ensure that our efforts are not dissipated, or spread too thinly through being pursued in too many fora.  I am not <Col N="405" /> convinced that Partnership for Peace would necessarily be required as an additional framework.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Does he recognise we often mistakenly say that Ireland did not join NATO in 1949?  In fact, part of Ireland has been part of NATO since 1949.  We must respect that and hope that our neighbours respect we are not part of NATO.</P>
      <P>However, joining Partnership for Peace is a long way from joining NATO.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it peculiar that all the European neutral states, Switzerland and Russia have signed up to Partnership for Peace, yet Tajikistan and Ireland have not?  What is so terrible about Partnership for Peace that we cannot join it and enhance our experience of peacekeeping by learning from that of others?  This would, perhaps, improve relations between North and South and between our two islands, particularly in the area of drugs interdiction.  Is there something wrong with that approach or have I missed something?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure the Deputy has missed anything.  As he is aware, Partnership for Peace is dealt with extensively in the White Paper on foreign policy, &ldquo;Challenges and Opportunities Abroad&rdquo;, which was published in March 1996. This is an excellent reference in the context of foreign policy.  As I understand, a month after its publication the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs discussed Partnership for Peace but the debate fell flat.  This happened when the Government put pressure on us to accept a NATO led Partnership for Peace.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 4.53 of the White Paper states that the Government had decided to explore further the benefits that Ireland might derive from participation in PFP and to determine the contribution Ireland might make to the Partnership against the background of the principles set out later in that Chapter, in paragraph 4.114. A decision on participation in PFP would only be taken by the Government in the light of consultations, including with the relevant committees of the Oireachtas, and such a decision would be subject to a motion on the terms and scope of any participation by Ireland being approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Partnership for Peace does not reflect my views because I regard it as a door opening process to NATO.  Our neutrality is important.  An engagement in a peripheral organisation related to a military alliance is not the basis of our foreign policy.  If the Deputy wants a debate on this matter, we can arrange one so that Members can take a pro-PFP or an anti-PFP stance.  That is what democracy is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's offer of a debate.  We should be able to discuss such matters without engaging in personal insults or <Col N="406" /> describing people as militarists or being opposed to neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that.  We should be mature enough to debate these issues. Does the Minister agree there is no indication that Russia, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden or Finland will become members of NATO?  Will he agree that participating in Partnership for Peace does not indicate a willingness to join NATO?</P>
      <P>Will he further agree in terms of training and what we can bring to and take from the table, that we have more in common with Northern Ireland, Britain, France and our other EU partners than with strife torn Tajikistan?  Why do Ireland and Tajikistan have a similar approach to this issue? I suspect it is because we have not properly debated it and I would welcome an early opportunity to avail of the Minister's offer.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the then Government had a minority in the last Seanad, it was agreed that any discussions on Partnership for Peace would be ratified by both Houses of the Oireachtas, although that is not a constitutional requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting the Deputy made sneering references to Tajikistan, but why is it wrong for Ireland to stand alone?  Why can we not remain outside organisations such as PFP or NATO without having to bow the knee and apologise to others?  Do we not have enough self confidence to present ourselves as an independent sovereign nation with its own view on organisations such as PFP?</P>
      <P>We have immense outlets for the thrust of our foreign policy in other organisations including the United Nations, the OSCE and the EU to which we were quite happy to commit ourselves.  We have made a huge commitment to the United Nations in the context of peace keeping.  We have lost many lives in pursuit of the ideals and aims of that organisation, to which we continue to commit a dignified and decent defence force.</P>
      <P>However this does not preclude a debate on the matter.  Let us go down that road if that is what we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome a debate on that matter.  It is necessary to have a root and branch analysis without rancour and emotion of the role Ireland should play.  As the Minister said, we have a very proud tradition of service in terms of peace keeping and humanitarian issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure, given the Minister's former role as Minister for Defence, he is aware of the views of our Defence Forces on the necessity for Ireland to join Partnership for Peace.  The fact that we have personnel serving in the SFOR mission using NATO hardware does not compromise our neutrality.  Perhaps the Minister's willingness to offer us a debate is an indication that we can have a critical examination of the issue.  During that examination the House should hear the views of <Col N="407" /> the Department of Defence on whether our non-participation in Partnership for Peace would undermine our ability to make our desired contribution to the United Nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to SFOR, as the Deputy said, members of the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána are serving in Bosnia with great honour and fortitude in difficult conditions.  I was there as Minister for Defence shortly before I was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs.  SFOR is working under a United Nations resolution.</P>
      <P>A Minister for Defence would take account of the views of the military authorities.  The present Chief of Staff is a man of great honour and, no doubt, he has a point of view on this matter.  I have not officially addressed the issue with him. However, I am sure the Minister for Defence would listen to anything he might say officially on the participation of the Defence Forces in Partnership for Peace.  Account would have to be taken of that and a policy decision would have to be made.  That is the way the system operates.</P>

      <P>The White Paper from which the Minister quoted was a product of the previous Government.  I congratulate the former Minister for Foreign Affairs on producing it.  I am also proud of the role that Democratic Left played in contributing to it while in Government. However, I am not satisfied that Partnership for Peace is a body which Ireland should join, primarily because Ireland is a member of the EU and our participation in any form of defence arrangements should be within the context of the EU.  We should concentrate on developing our understanding of the debate within Europe on the issue of European defence and security.</P>
      <P>Both NATO and Partnership for Peace are not European constructions.  Deputy Gay Mitchell is entitled to argue his case on Partnership for Peace, but he should also acknowledge that membership of it is seen as a back door to membership of NATO.  It would be worthwhile to debate this issue of defence and security and not see it in terms of a black and white argument for or against neutrality.</P>

I do not believe that Switzerland or any of the four neutral countries have any intention of applying and Russia would not be allowed membership.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be much easier for people like me to understand why we have taken this strong independent position on Partnership for Peace if our opposition was spelt out in a set of principles?  To date, I am not aware that any have been articulated.  For this reason, I would welcome the debate offered by the Minister.</P>

The Deputy has rightly identified that we should not get into argument at this stage but rather conduct a civilised debate on the issue in due course.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that two official level committees which deal with human rights issues have been established this year under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am glad to have this opportunity to reiterate the Government's special commitment to the advocacy and vindication of human rights and, in light of the fact that next year marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, special efforts will be made to emphasise that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first committee, the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights, held its inaugural meeting on 18 February and met again on 17 July.  Meeting approximately quarterly, the committee is mandated to consider all aspects of Ireland's international human rights obligations. It is concerned in particular with ensuring the timely preparation of comprehensive national reports under the various international instruments already ratified and with expediting the legislation necessary for the ratification of additional instruments.  In this regard I am keen <Col N="409" /> to see the United Nations Conventions on Torture and the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination ratified as soon as possible.  The preparatory work for this is under way in the Department concerned.  The committee will play a useful role in expediting these ratifications and as a forum for co-ordination and co-operation between Departments on human rights issues generally.</P>
    <P>The second committee is the Joint Department of Foreign Affairs-NGO Standing Committee on Human Rights.  This committee held its inaugural meeting on 11 June and met again on 17 September. It provides a formal framework for a regular exchange of views between the Department of Foreign Affairs and representatives of the NGO community.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs have found the contribution of Irish NGOs on human rights issues extremely valuable.  The placing of the network of contacts on a more formal footing by establishing this committee was a welcome step and will be of considerable value to me as Minister of State with special responsibility for human rights and the Minister whose commitment to human rights is well known.  The specific designation of human rights among my ministerial responsibilities is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to this area.  It is worth pointing out in this context that all our development assistance programmes, which are also my responsibility, have a human rights and democratisation component.</P>
    <P>The Joint Department of Foreign Affairs-NGO Standing Committee on Human Rights has already had a number of useful discussions and has drawn up an intensive programme of work for itself covering a wide range of topics.  I express my appreciation to the NGO community and independent experts for making their expertise available to us in this new way.</P>
    <P>Ongoing informal contacts on human rights matters between NGOs and the various divisions of my Department continue and have in no sense been replaced or restricted by the establishment of the committee.  They are more intensive than ever and the setting up of the human rights unit in the Department with its co-ordinating role in this area serves to facilitate a valuable two way channel of communication.  To ensure the fullest utilisation of the experience of the broader NGO community we intend to hold an annual NGO forum on human rights to which all interested organisations will be invited.  We propose to hold the first of these in advance of the next annual session of the UN Commission on Human Rights which takes place in March 1998.</P>

      <P>How often does the Minister of State expect the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights to meet and how will it operate?  I understand it last met in July. Will the Department rely to a greater or lesser extent on the advice and inspiration derived from the committee?</P>

      <P>I expect the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights to meet approximately quarterly.  It is mandated to consider all aspects of our international human rights obligations and is concerned in particular with ensuring the timely preparation of comprehensive national reports under the various international instruments already ratified.  We have been informed by the United Nations that the first report under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child will be examined in Geneva in January 1998.  The Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights will co-ordinate preparations for that examination.  Work on the draft of the second report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is well advanced.  A consultation between Government Departments and NGOs on the draft was held in the Department of Foreign Affairs on 28 October.  It is expected that the report will be forwarded to the United Nations in Geneva in the near future.  Ireland's first report under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was completed in November 1996 and work has already begun on the preparation of the second.  As the examining bodies of the United Nations have an extremely heavy work programme it is not expected that either report will be examined before late 1998 or early 1999.</P>
      <P>The establishment of those two committees was an important demonstration of the interest in and commitment to the vindication of human rights in my Department, in particular the establishment of the human rights unit, a very important vehicle for policy development.  The non-governmental community always has been a great contributor to policy formulation on the part of successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  I hope this Government will be very strong on advocating human rights internationally and on compliance with domestic legislation in line with all of our international obligations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 17 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is seriously concerned about the manner of the transition to democratic rule and the ongoing human rights position in Nigeria. This concern was reiterated by us and our European Union partners at the 52nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September last.  On that occasion we continued to express our dissatisfaction at the slow pace of transition to democratic government in Nigeria and the human rights position there.  We also called on the Nigerian authorities to ensure full respect for human rights and the rule of law, including the review of all cases of political prisoners and persons detained without charge.</P>
      <P>These objectives are fundamental to the policy of Government in relation to Nigeria as well as to that of the European Union as agreed by partners at the EU General Affairs Council of 2 June 1997.  The Council did not consider that sufficient progress had been made to warrant the removal of the EU's restrictive measures against Nigeria. The Government fully supports this view and has consistently supported the extension of the EU measures.  The House will recall that, <i>inter alia</i>, these measures include the suspension of development and military co-operation, visa restrictions on members of the Nigerian military or Government and their families, the suspension of all high level visits, an arms embargo and the interruption of sporting contacts.</P>
      <P>In the light of their continued concerns about the position there the Commonwealth Heads of Government, meeting in Edinburgh from 24 to 27 October, decided that Nigeria would remain suspended from the Commonwealth.  They also agreed that if, following 1 October 1998, Nigeria had not completed a credible transition to democratic government, they would consider that country's expulsion from the organisation and the introduction of further restrictive measures.  In addition, the Edinburgh meeting enumerated interim measures such as visa restrictions and arms embargo which could be implemented before that date to encourage greater integrity of the process of transition and respect for human rights in Nigeria.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes the outcome of the Edinburgh Commonwealth meeting as consistent with the efforts of the European Union and other members of the international community to maintain pressure on the Nigerian authorities for early reform of democratic and human rights.  We also welcome the recent decision by the Chairman of the 53rd Session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva to appoint Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee as UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights position in Nigeria, a direct outcome of the Resolution on Nigeria which Ireland and our EU partners successfully co-sponsored for adoption at that 53rd session in Geneva last April at which that post was created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union remains committed to engaging in dialogue with the Nigerian authorities <Col N="412" /> as well as to supporting civil society.  While it remains to be seen whether the Nigerian Government will be receptive to this offer of dialogue, the Government and our European Union partners will continue our efforts to ensure that it remains fully conscious of our serious concerns. The Government will continue to avail of all appropriate opportunities to ensure that the Nigerian authorities are aware of the importance we attach to an early return to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it still the position that Ireland is arguing for stronger sanctions against Nigeria than the majority of our European Union partners? Were we represented by a Minister at the General Affairs Council meeting on 2 October last at which the position in Nigeria was discussed? Is there a Nigerian Ambassador to Ireland currently in the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <P>Strengthening the sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland, and a number of our EU partners, favour the introduction of an oil embargo in furtherance of democracy and human rights in Nigeria.  However, for an oil embargo to be effective it would need to have global support. A unilateral EU oil embargo would not have great impact as it would not include the major markets for Nigerian oil.  That is the reason the Government supports the idea of EU consultations with other states on such an embargo.</P>
      <P>On the question of a trade embargo, in 1995 Irish exports amounted to just over £42 million with imports amounting to £1.4 million.  In 1996, Irish exports amounted to £38.6 million with imports of £1.1 million.  Our biggest exports to Nigeria include edible products and preparations in addition to medical and pharmaceutical products. A total trade embargo would have negative effects on some indigenous exporters but if exceptions were made for essential foods and medicines, that might soften the blow.  Ireland and its EU partners would abide by any decision on an international embargo taken by the UN Security Council, although these do not normally apply retrospectively to pre-existing contracts. Did the Deputy ask about the recall of an Ambassador?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if there is a Nigerian Ambassador in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not.  The Nigerian Ambassador has not returned since she was recalled.  Ireland's Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Brendan McMahon, returned to Lagos for consultations on 12 January 1996 following his recall and that of most EU Ambassadors after the Ogoni executions.  Our Ambassador's return to Lagos facilitated his safeguarding of the interests <Col N="413" /> of Irish nationals there and the making of representations to the Nigerian authorities about the ongoing situation in the country.</P>

      <P>Other than issuing declarations, in terms of taking action against Nigeria, will the Minister of State set out the order of priorities, in terms of taking action against Nigeria, available to the European Union to bring about a change in Nigeria?  Will she also tell the House whether, in her best judgment, there is any indication of hope that democracy might be restored in Nigeria in the foreseeable future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the take-over by the military regime in 1993, concern has been expressed and efforts made at international level at every fora to encourage the restoration of democracy and the protection of human rights in Nigeria.  We have taken appropriate action at all these fora to work with our EU partners, via the UN, to take as many initiatives as are reasonable in the circumstances to keep the pressure on the Nigerian authorities to comply with international global norms.  I outlined in my reply, the various efforts which have been made.  The decision of the Commonwealth Heads of Government at their meeting in Edinburgh to suspend the membership of Nigeria was significant.  They have indicated that if matters do not improve, and I hope they do, they will take further action against Nigeria. Suggestions have been made about Ireland's position on a trade embargo and other sanctions which may be introduced.</P>
      <P>Ireland is doing much bilaterally to help support democracy in Nigeria.  In 1996 it granted a total of £71,000 to projects in Nigeria as part of the Government's support for democratisation and human rights there.  Among the areas funded under this heading were those relating to environmental rights, the Nigerian civil liberties organisation, a publication on the Nigerian prison system, a human rights test case and the rehabilitation of prisoners.  A similar amount has been allocated to relevant human rights projects in 1997.  In addition, over £896,000 was allocated to projects in Nigeria under the Government's NGO co-financing scheme in 1996.  The priority sectors covered under the scheme include primary health care, basic education, water and sanitation, rural development and welfare.  A similar level of NGO co-financing is being provided this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's general point is that in addition to advocacy and declaratory measures about human rights in some African countries, it is most important that Ireland assists them in building up civic societies and helping them to help themselves to have the capacity to behave in ways <Col N="414" /> which respect global norms.  We must support those countries but we should not act in a postcolonial fashion and tell developing and emerging democracies how to behave under international accepted global norms.  We must help them build up their judicial systems and civic organisations. The Government is most interested in doing that, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that the aid transmitted to the countries to which she referred is reaching its intended targets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  All donor governments need to ensure in terms of their efforts to help capacity building in developing countries that the aid they provide does not go, and could not be perceived to be going, to regimes of which they disapprove.  The Government is careful to focus its assistance on projects which are guaranteed to support the NGO community.  These projects are carefully monitored on the ground and evaluated continually to ensure the aid meets the purpose for which it was intended, that is, to help the poorest of the poor and build civic societies in the Third World.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 18 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has carefully examined the Agenda 2000 proposals tabled by the Commission in July which will be subject to lengthy negotiations.  Detailed proposals have yet to be presented on many aspects of the dossier.  My predecessor indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question on 30 September the main elements of the Government's initial approach to the proposals which I will outline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is committed to the process of further enlargement but it will, like other member states, seek to protect and promote its interests and to ensure that the consequences of enlargement apply in a balanced way to existing member <Col N="415" /> states.  The financial framework proposed by the Commission for the period 2000 to 2006 is based on an annual ceiling for Community resources of 1.27 per cent of Community GNP.  The adequacy of this amount remains to be examined in detail in the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Regarding the proposals on the CAP, the Government accepts that European agriculture should become more competitive on world markets and be developed on a sound, stable and sustainable basis.  However, it must be done in a way which fully protects the interests of farmers and rural communities.  In particular, any reductions in market support must be adequately compensated.</P>
    <P>As far as the Structural and Cohesion Funds are concerned, the Government's aim will be to maximise Ireland's receipts in the next funding round.  Any transitional arrangements for Ireland must be adequate in terms of the level and timeframe of funding to address our continuing significant development needs.  Subject to these considerations, the Government regards the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals as representing a clear coherent framework for addressing the challenges which Europe faces in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>With regard to cross-Border aspects, the Anglo-Irish Conference provides a forum in which matters involving North-South co-operation, including those relating to the European Union, can be discussed.  While a specific date and agenda have yet to be agreed, there are proposals to discuss EU related issues at an early Anglo-Irish conference.  In addition, there is ongoing co-operation between the Department of Finance in the South and the Department of Finance and Personnel in the North on the use of Structural Funds in both parts of Ireland.  The General Affairs Council has been given overall responsibility for the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it is discussed at each of its meetings.  Most recently, at the informal meeting of the Council in Luxembourg on 25 and 26 October, I indicated our key concerns and stressed in particular the importance of continuity to the Community's cohesion effort in each member state and region. Aspects of the Agenda 2000 dossier are discussed also at the ECOFIN and Agriculture Councils.</P>
    <P>I and my colleagues will continue to press Ireland's concerns.  In addition, I have contact with my colleagues on a bilateral basis and Agenda 2000 figures prominently in such discussions. I met my Spanish colleague in Madrid on 13 October and I received the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Robin Cook, here yesterday. Given the central role that the UK will play in the negotiations during the first half of next year, the latter meeting was particularly useful and fruitful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU proposes that a GNP budget maximum of 1.27 per cent be observed, and it is likely that guidelines will suggest <Col N="416" /> restricting transfers to both member and applicant States to a maximum of 4 per cent of GNP. There are also challenges arising out of the next period of enlargement.  Does the Minister agree with the view expressed by IBEC that as Northern Ireland is also likely to lose its Objective 1 status, there are solid reasons for the Government and political partners on both sides of the Border to work together and devise a common approach to challenges posed by Agenda 2000?  If he agrees, can he indicate the steps the Government has taken to advance this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>Prime Minister Jospin to express his concern about the impact of the dispute on the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I contacted Commissioner Kinnock's office.  I made him fully aware of the effects of the dispute on Irish trade.  I also stressed to him that he should use his position to ensure the French authorities do everything possible to ensure they meet their obligations under the EU treaties regarding the free movement of goods and people.  Commissioner Kinnock assured me he was monitoring the dispute on an hour by hour basis and would keep in regular contact with me.  He emphasised that he can only directly intervene under Article 30, if the relevant Government does not actively seek a solution.  He said the relevant Government was actively seeking a solution, and this was evident in the limited lifting of blockades and in making information known to those affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wrote and spoke to the Luxembourg Transport Minister, Madame Mady Delvaux, <Col N="418" /> requesting her to convene an emergency meeting of the EU Transport Council to discuss the French dispute.  These contacts were made on Friday last and on Monday.  On Friday last the French dispute was raised at the Committee of Permanent Representatives in Brussels.  A number of member states, including Ireland, made strong statements expressing concern about the violation of the principle of free movement enshrined in the treaties.  As Commissioner Kinnock said, he has the power only to intervene if the domestic government does not do so.  I will continue to monitor the situation closely and exert pressure to bring about an early settlement of the dispute.</P>
    <P>As regards compensation, to which a question referred, I understand Irish claims arising from the previous dispute were only recently submitted to the French authorities through the Irish Road Haulage Association which is utilising a firm of solicitors from Leeds.  On their advice, they have only now submitted their claims.  In hindsight, they were wise because claims for compensation made earlier by other countries have been returned as the information provided was inadequate. The Irish Road Haulage Association submitted very comprehensive claims in recent weeks which I hope will soon be paid.  Because of the care which has been taken to properly document Irish claims, I am confident the French authorities will respond quickly and positively. The experience gained with those claims will assist in preparing any claims arising from the current dispute.</P>
    <P>The staff at the Irish Embassy in Paris will be available to give assistance to drivers in difficulties arising from the dispute.  This will include advice, normal consular services and assistance in cases of emergency.</P>

      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's reply that the extent of her activities to date has been two letters, one written on Friday and the other on Monday, to her French opposite number and a similar correspondence with Commissioner Kinnock?  Does she consider that mere correspondence is wholly inadequate given the proportions of the present difficulties in which hauliers are being asked to take precarious routes risking their £120,000 vehicles while facing the prospect of not having fuel?  Does she agree the response of the British Government whereby the Prime Minister Mr. Blair spent 15 minutes on the telephone to Prime Minister Mr. Jospin this morning would be a more appropriate way to deal with the gravity of this situation?</P>

Will she give an indication of the potential <Col N="419" /> loss to the economy of this continuing dispute? Has she examined possible sanctions that might be imposed by the European Union against France for its failure to maintain free movement of goods and people, which is guaranteed under the EU treaties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's last question, I spoke directly to Commissioner Kinnock about sanctions.  He said if a domestic government makes efforts to intervene or to settle a dispute, which in this case affects free movement which is enshrined in the Treaty of Rome and emphasised in subsequent treaties, neither he nor the EU has the power of sanction. He said he will continue to monitor the dispute on an hour by hour basis.  I doubt if there will be a slip in efforts made by the French Government who also wish to settle the dispute.</P>
      <P>On how many trucks are impounded in France, numbers from the Irish Road Haulage Association, the embassy and our permanent representative vary.  It is, however, a considerable number amounting to several hundred.  The Deputy asked if I had an idea of the financial loss to exporters. The number is considerable and amounts to several hundred.</P>
      <P>The financial loss to exporters varies and depends on what gets through.  However, it amounts to a few million pounds every day. These markets were hard won by Irish firms and if the blockade continues they may be lost.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that approximately 500 Irish trucks are stranded in France?  Two of these trucks were badly damaged during a riot in Lyon last night.  Will the Minister ask the Commissioner to ask the Commission to set up a compensatory fund to pay Irish road hauliers outstanding moneys of approximately £6 million, £1.4 million of which is due to the owners of one lorry who are on the breadline?</P>
      <P>During the previous dispute the Minister's counterpart gave an absolute undertaking that the red tape, for which our French colleagues are famous, would be cut and payment would be made quickly.  Will the Minister agree that the red tape has been increased and that not one penny in compensation arising from the previous blockade has been paid to date?  Given that the treaty is absolute in regard to the free movement of goods and services throughout the EU, the Commission must ensure compensation is paid to those who cannot freely move their goods.</P>

      <P>I agree with the points made by the Deputy about the Irish Road Haulage Association.  It has made great efforts to resolve this matter and has been in constant touch with my office and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Jacob.  It has also been in contact with the hauliers caught in the blockade and has provided a 24 hour service to them.</P>
      <P>On the question of compensation, the Irish Road Haulage Association processed all the compensation claims arising out of the previous French dispute through a Leeds firm of solicitors. Great care was taken to ensure that each claim was properly documented with charts, ferry tickets, fuel receipts etc.  It is important to state that the first 20 claims were submitted only in October.  However, I share the Deputy's concerns about the level of French bureaucracy which, by its nature, will slow up matters.  That is the reason the Irish Road Haulage Association wanted to ensure queries could not be raised about claims.  I will speak with Commissioner Kinnock for a third time this evening and will ask him to look seriously at the compensation claims in addition to the fire brigade action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there was a variety of figures on the number of trucks stranded in France.  What is the considered assessment of her Department on the number of trucks stranded?  Given that the blocking of roads and ports is becoming a habit in French industrial and agricultural disputes, has the Minister formulated proposals to put to a meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers on action which could be taken to prevent the repeated disruption of transport throughout Europe by French national and internal disputes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's estimate of the number of trucks stranded in France is not precise as we are receiving information from many sources &mdash; the Embassy, the permanent representatives, our counterparts in other countries and the Irish Road Haulage Association. The number is several hundred but I will endeavour to get the precise figure.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point that the blocking of ports has become a common feature in French disputes.  I have been considering the need to put forward to the Council of Transport Ministers definite measures which can be taken to deal with this matter.  Notwithstanding the fact that Article 30 of the treaty allows for the free movement of goods and services and includes a caveat on intervention in disputes, it is time to give consideration to an EU directive which will prevent such blockades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> I agree with Deputy Stagg that the owners of single vehicles should be paid compensation first as they are the ones who have been most disadvantaged in financial terms by the blockade.  I told the Commissioner, the President of the Transport Council and my French counterpart that we were having a cross-party debate on the matter today and that everyone was of one mind. I do not see it as a party political issue but one on which we alI want to work to free the trucks so that exports can continue.  I will do everything possible by positive intervention to resolve the matter.  Because we are an island, we are the most disadvantaged country, but I give a commitment that I shall continue to intervene in every way possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, will accompany members of the Irish Road Haulage Association to Brussels next Thursday for a meeting with Commissioner Kinnock.  When I leave the Dáil this evening I will have my third conversation with Commissioner Kinnock and will continue to press to have the problem solved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that £1.4 million is due to single lorry owners arising from the previous claim and I welcome her decision to give priority to that matter.  Will she make strong representations to seek, as a matter of urgency, additional eco points which are required to cross Austria?  The cost of travelling through Italy and Spain is higher, in the order of 15 per cent and 25 per cent respectively, and it is not fair the road haulage section should bear all that cost.  If it is not recoverable, the cost should be spread among all those involved.  I ask the Minister to use her good offices with IBEC and others to that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to raise the matter of eco points and I thank Deputy Stagg for doing so.  Austria has had a derogation for several years whereby the number of heavy duty trucks crossing that country is based on a system of eco points, or payment for passage, so to speak.  We have already used a considerable number of our eco points.  This morning I asked the Department to seek extra eco points to allow a greater number of haulage trucks to use the Austrian route. As the Deputy said, the alternative routes are not as direct and are more costly.</P>
      <P>I will continue to press the matter of compensation. The claims have just been produced.  Single truck owners stand to lose much more and are more likely to go out of business if they are kept waiting for their money.  I will use my influence with IBEC and other bodies in dealing with the matter.</P>

I am in contact with the exporters, the Irish Road Haulage Association and all the relevant parties in the dispute. All my energies and those of my Department are brought to bear on this matter.

In the recent referendum we followed strictly the interpretation of the judgment of some years ago in the <i>ad hoc</i> commission and what was allowed.  Given that we knew from the outset that it was limited, there is an obligation on the Government to provide more extensive information than just an article on a difficult topic. Many more difficult issues will arise in the coming years.  We intend to look at that in the context of the judgment of the courts to see whether there is any way of providing more extensive information through handouts, literature or presentations to the electorate on issues that will arise in respect of amendments to the Constitution.</P>

Within a few days the Ministers of State, Deputies Molloy and Dempsey, and I had a long discussion with those groups.  At that meeting it was stated that it was not necessarily a question of legislative change but a matter of information.  In the judgment of the officers involved in the accidents during that appalling week, all but four related to speed.  At that meeting the groups in question asked the Government to consider a number of suggestions, which I agreed to do.  We agreed to work together to organise a campaign in this area.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The need for this Bill arises from a provision in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 which was passed by the Oireachtas on 19 May 1997 and became law as regards the provision in question three months later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 28 of that Act abolished the common law offences of assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, false imprisonment and kidnapping. In place of these common law offences the Act created new statutory offences which were largely identical with the offences repealed.  Section 2 created an offence of assault in place of the common law offence of common assault, section 3 created an offence of causing harm to another to replace the old offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and section 15 created an offence of false imprisonment to replace the old offences of false imprisonment and kidnapping. <Col N="430" /> For some years past, the practice has been to charge kidnapping as false imprisonment so that kidnapping as a separate offence had more or less become redundant.</P>
    <P>The problem that has arisen is that claims have been made in a number of cases that the abolition of the common law offences by section 28 of the 1997 Act means that prosecutions cannot now be instituted in relation to these offences where they were committed prior to the enactment of the 1997 Act.</P>
    <P>On 2 September 1997 a submission was made by a defence lawyer in an assault case in Kilkenny to the effect that the court had no power to hear the case as the alleged offence took place on 24 May 1997 &mdash; prior to the coming into effect of the 1997 Act &mdash; but the hearing was to take place after the &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; of the offence.</P>
    <P>That case was adjourned to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to make submissions.  During that adjournment period the defendant, on 30 September, sought and obtained an injunction from Mr. Justice Moriarity in the High Court restraining the judge from hearing the case until the point had been decided by the High Court. That application is now before the High Court awaiting a hearing date.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday last, 29 October, the Special Criminal Court decided that, as a result of the provisions of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, it did not have jurisdiction to decide whether the accused in question was guilty or not guilty of the offence of false imprisonment. The accused was convicted of other offences for which he received a substantial prison term.  The following day, Thursday, 30 October, Mr. Justice Morris, sitting in the High Court as a judge of the Central Criminal Court hearing a case of murder and false imprisonment, decided that the jury could consider the offence of false imprisonment. The accused was convicted.  Mr. Justice Morris made it clear that he was not making a definitive judgment on the issue.  That afternoon, Thursday, 30 October, Mr. Justice Carney in the High Court gave leave to an accused remanded in custody awaiting trial before the Special Criminal Court on a charge of false imprisonment to apply for a <i>habeas corpus</i> order.  That application was returnable for last Friday, 31 October, when it was adjourned on consent to enable the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions to be made parties.  On Friday, 31 October, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness sitting as a judge of the Central Criminal Court hearing a case of attempted rape and false imprisonment, ruled that a charge of false imprisonment could not be considered by a jury.  Like Mr. Justice Morris she made it clear that she was not giving a definitive judgment on the issue.  Those decisions have introduced uncertainty into an important area of the law.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that section 28 of the 1997 Act has the effect claimed in those cases.  If the Legislature had intended that acts which were clearly criminal under the law as it then applied should <Col N="431" /> not now be prosecuted if they were committed before section 28 came into effect, I suggest that the Legislature would have said so plainly.  It seems the clear intention was that criminal behaviour occurring before the 1997 Act would continue to be prosecuted under the old law and that similar behaviour occurring after the 1997 Act would be prosecuted under the replacement offences provided by the Act, which offences, as I indicated, are largely identical to the offences abolished.  I should mention that for some years past it has been the practice to abolish common law offences in the terms of section 28 and no questions were asked.</P>
    <P>One way of dealing with the problem would have been to await the resolution of the matter by the superior courts and bring forward legislation only if that became necessary as a result of the judgment of the court.  However, in view of the challenges that have been and continue to be mounted to section 28, there is an urgent need to bring certainty into the matter.  Also, the large number of common assault cases standing adjourned in the District Court and the likelihood of more cases seeking adjournments and judicial review are threatening severe administrative problems.  In all the circumstances, the Government has decided to bring forward this Bill urgently to rectify the matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill takes the form of an amendment to the Interpretation Act, 1937.  It is closely modelled on section 21 of that Act.  It provides simply in section 1(2) that where a common law offence is abolished, abrogated or repealed by a statute, proceedings for the offence may be instituted, continued or maintained in respect of the offence as if the offence had not been abolished or repealed. The provision applies, that is subsection (3), whether the common law offence is abolished before or after the enactment of the Bill.  The effect is that where these offences have been committed before the abolition of the common law offence proceedings can be instituted under the law as it applied at the relevant time and, where similar offences are committed after the abolition of the common law offence, proceedings will be taken under the new law now applying, in this case the provisions of the 1997 Act which I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 1 provides, in effect, that abolition of a common law offence will not affect anything done under the previous law and shall not affect pending proceedings.  To avoid any implication that the legislation might be an unconstitutional interference in ongoing proceedings, subsection (4) provides that if the section would, but for subsection (4), conflict with the constitutional rights of any person, the section will be subject to such limitations as are necessary to secure that it does not so conflict but shall otherwise be of full force or effect.</P>
    <P>Deputies will no doubt notice that section 1, in paragraphs (a) (b) and (c) of subsection (1) and in subsection (2), refers not alone to proceedings <Col N="432" /> in respect of the abolished offences but to proceedings for any other offences as well.  The reason for this is simple.  It has been suggested there are other offences in which an abolished common law offence is an ingredient and the abolition of the common law offence might make difficulties for the prosecution of the other offence on the ground that one of the ingredients of that offence has been done away with.  While I do not agree with that argument I thought it better to put the matter beyond doubt by ensuring the abolition of the common law offences will have no effect on any other offences.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, subsection (3) applies the section to common law offences abolished before the enactment of the Bill.  Thus, it applies to the common law offences abolished by section 28 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997.  Deputies may wonder whether this makes the Bill objectionable on the grounds of retrospectivity. The important point here is that the Bill does not make acts criminal which were not criminal at the time they were committed &mdash; that would clearly be forbidden as retrospective legislation by Article 15.5 of the Constitution.  The actions to which the Bill refers were all clearly criminal under the law at the time they were committed. What the Bill does is to enable prosecutions to be mounted in relation to clearly criminal actions, actions that if committed now are still criminal, having regard to the provisions of the 1997 Act.  I am advised and agree that this is quite acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a necessary measure to bring certainty into an important area of the criminal law and to avoid severe administrative problems developing in our courts.  I hope that Deputies will agree that in the circumstances in which we find ourselves it is right and proper to proceed with expedition as the Government proposes.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> There is a certain amount of substance in the point made by Deputy Joe Higgins on the Order of Business about the short timespan between the publication of the Bill and the taking thereof.  I appreciate there are exigencies in this case.  Although we knew of the intent of the amending legislation, we did not get the Bill until late this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised on a number of counts that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has chosen the course of action of introducing emergency amending legislation.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment during the first week in October.  I pointed out that on Tuesday, 30 September, Mr. Justice Moriarty in the High Court ordered the Director of Public Prosecutions not to go ahead with an assault case against a Kilkenny man pending a judicial review. The defendant's solicitor argued in his submission to the court that the charge of unlawful assault was &ldquo;no longer known to law&rdquo; because he contended that the common law offence of assault and battery had been abolished by section 28(1) <Col N="433" /> of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act.  This section came into effect on 19 August 1997, since the Minister was appointed to office. It is worth making the point that the proposal in question was also acting on the recommendation of a 1994 Law Reform Commission report which suggested the need for recodification of the law on assault.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter on the Adjournment because of a concern that hundreds and perhaps thousands of serious assaults on innocent victims could not now proceed because of the legal and legislative vacuum thus created.  I argued that effectively an amnesty seemed to have been given to the perpetrators of serious assault charges.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter some days earlier on the Order of Business and was told by the Taoiseach that the matter was before the courts.  In his reply to the Adjournment debate the Minister adopted the same approach when he said:</P>
    <P>The case is awaiting a full hearing in the High Court.  The Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions have consulted counsel in the context of considering the issues arising.  The charges against the accused relating to breaches of sections 4 and 6 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 have been adjourned indefinitely by the District Court.  I am sure Deputy Higgins and other Deputies will appreciate that, as the matter of the assault charge is now awaiting judicial review in the High Court to determine the issues involved, it would not be proper for me to make any further comment for the moment on the case or the issues.</P>
    <P>Now there is a U-turn and the House is being asked to plug the loopholes and escape hatches allegedly created by bringing forward this measure.  The Minister has more or less acknowledged that last week's judgment by Mr. Justice Barr in the Lacey kidnapping case is the instrument which brought about the change of heart. There is no doubt that it was extremely fortunate that the convicted person had been charged with a firearms offence as well as kidnapping otherwise he would have walked free because of section 28(1) of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>The wording of the Act and particularly section 28 is quite clear.  Section 28 states:</P>
    <P>(1) The following common law offences are hereby abolished</P>
    <P>(a) assault and battery</P>
    <P>(b) assault occasioning actual bodily harm</P>
    <P>(c) kidnapping, and</P>
    <P>(d) false imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The two issues involved are the wording and the intention of the Oireachtas.  The crucial word is &ldquo;hereby&rdquo;.  It was clearly intended by the Legislature that the offences in question were to be abolished as and from the date of the coming into <Col N="434" /> force of the Bill, 19 August 1997.  It would have been better to have had the matter further and conclusively tested by the courts.</P>
    <P>It could be validly and cogently argued that just as any new law cannot take effect retrospectively, the corollary that the old law remains in effect up to the date of the new law is equally valid.  For example, when new drink driving legislation is introduced people who commit offences under the old Act are dealt with under that Act for some time later even though it has been abolished.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been wrongly advised.  When I raised the matter on the Adjournment it was my intention not that the matter would be amended in the House but that it could be expedited and further tested and determined by the courts. Effectively, it represents another U-turn.  There have already been two or three U-turns on zero tolerance with the result that we are not sure where it now stands.  The spate of murders, stabbings and assaults continues unabated.</P>
    <P>There was another U-turn on the Courts Service Bill.  When it was announced by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, on 29 April last, the Minister savaged it as being unnecessary and a &ldquo;stripping&rdquo; of the powers and functions of the Minister and the Department of Justice, yet the Minister published the same Bill this week.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too critical &mdash; all I am asking for is a consistency of approach.  This is not the first time amending legislation has had to be introduced on foot of court decisions.  The first legislation introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Owen, was an amendment to the Incest Act, 1908.  In 1995, Judge Carney ruled that incest cases had to be held fully <i>in camera.</i>  I am sure there will be other such cases.</P>
    <P>It may have been better to have the matter further tested in court.  I accept what the Minister said about the need to obtain certainty at the earliest possible stage.  He is probably also anxious about other imminent cases which will be the subject of judicial decisions and criticism by the bench.  On behalf of my party, I support this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief as I have already indicated I do not intend to oppose this Bill.  It is important that when difficulties arise in the courts, as on this occasion, the Oireachtas clear up the matter as soon as is feasible. While I appreciate the Minister's belief that the matter could still be resolved in the courts, it is important not to take that chance, particularly in view of the pending legal action in the High Court.  I have tabled an amendment to the Bill for discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Section 1 (2), as currently worded, seems to require proof of the offence having been committed prior to the date of the abolition of the common law offences.  This proof would be required before proceedings could be instituted. Obviously, this is not what is intended by the Minister and I would welcome his comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> Clearly, this legislation is a fire brigade response to a situation which has arisen in the courts.  There is chaos in the District Court on foot of the High Court finding that District Court clerks responsible for issuing summonses in District Court cases were not validly appointed by the Minister.  Consequently, the summonses are invalid.  Given that the Minister has declared his confidence of winning the case before the High Court tomorrow, I am surprised he has not introduced similar emergency legislation to deal with the serious problem in the District Court, rather than appealing to the Supreme Court, which is the only option open to the State.</P>
    <P>This issue dates back to similar emergency legislation which had to be introduced in the mid-1980s under a previous Fine Gael-Labour Government, dealing with procedures for issuing District Court summonses.  The time has come for a long and thorough review of criminal procedures, rather than relying on the finger in the dyke approach which we have all adopted up to now.  It is time we dispensed with amending amendments of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.  Other countries have dedicated criminal law reform commissions.  Given the fact that our Law Reform Commission concentrates almost exclusively on civil law, I ask the Minister to consider the need for a similar institution in this country.</P>

      <P>I thank those who have contributed to this debate and Deputy Higgins and Deputy Shorthall for indicating their parties will not oppose this legislation.  The Bill became necessary as a result of a wrong interpretation given to section 28 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997.  However, the issue involved is awaiting determination in a number of cases in the High Court and this has lead to the adjournment of a large number of assault cases in the District Court.  We could have waited until the issue had been settled definitively by the courts, but if the issue came before the Supreme Court it could take some time.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, more cases could be adjourned and more applications for judicial review made.  Having considered the matter fully, the Government felt that, on balance, it could not afford to wait and this legislation should be introduced and processed quickly.  This short Bill has been carefully modelled on the provisions of the Interpretation Act, 1937.  It will bring certainty to this area of the law in which recent problems have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Kilkenny case arose it was necessary to consider carefully the issues involved and to establish if legislation was the appropriate response.  There was a belief that it might come up for resolution as a matter of priority.  After the matter was fully considered, in consultation with the Attorney General, I decided that the proper way to proceed was to introduce amending legislation. It is nonsensical, therefore, to allege this <Col N="436" /> is a U-turn.  The Government and I have acted responsibly in seeking to close off a serious loophole which may exist in criminal law.  It was the Government of which Deputy Jim Higgins was a member which introduced this legislation and rushed it through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>My interpretation, which is also that of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is the correct one.  As a responsible person, I could not take the risk of that interpretation being wrong.  It is my duty to ensure certainty in this area of the law and to ensure there is no room for people to escape justice.</P>
      <P>I reject allegations that I am doing a U-turn on zero tolerance and the Court Services Bill.  I have repeated my position on these matters <i>ad nauseam</i> and I have no intention of delaying the House by discussing them again tonight.  The establishment of a court service was a commitment given by my party in its election manifesto and subsequently confirmed in the programme for Government.  I have defined and redefined the concept of zero tolerance.  The only issue with which people are concerned is whether the streets and homes of this country will be safer following this Government's term of office.  Through the implementation of policies I have propagated, I believe they will be.</P>
      <P>This legislation is indicative and reflective of a Government which is not prepared to take chances with criminal law.  It is proof that we take the implementation of criminal law and the closing off of loopholes where they arise extremely seriously.  Unfortunately, judging by the mistakes which were, perhaps, unwittingly made, the previous Government did not take the situation as seriously as we are.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), line 25, before &ldquo;committed&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;alleged to have been&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the inaccuracy of the wording in this section will mean we will have to further amend this legislation in a few weeks or months.  There is possible ambiguity in the timing of alleged offences.  I suggest we insert &ldquo;alleged to have been&rdquo; in this section so that any potential loophole is closed off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for tabling this amendment.  While I appreciate her intention, it must be opposed.  I consulted the <Col N="437" /> draftsman who informed me that it would not be in accordance with normal drafting practice to insert the words &ldquo;alleged to have been&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;committed&rdquo; in line 25.  It would have been the same thing, for example, if the Deputy had suggested inserting the word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; in line 25.</P>
      <P>Legislation commonly mentions proceedings in respect of an offence, not proceedings in respect of an alleged offence.  For example, section 21 of the Interpretation Act, 1937, which was closely following in framing section 1 of this Bill, states that &ldquo;any legal proceedings . in respect of any . offence against .. a statute so repealed may be instituted .&rdquo;. It does not state any alleged offence or offences alleged to be against the statute. I am satisfied the amendment should not be accepted as it would not be in accordance with good drafting practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that there is no requirement to include the word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo;.  However, we should insert &ldquo;alleged to have been&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;committed&rdquo; because it relates to the timing of the alleged offence.  The Minister said it would not be normal to do this.  However, it is not normal to introduce emergency legislation.  This section could be open to challenge in that there could be a requirement to prove the offence was committed prior to the abolishment of common law offences.  I am worried that we could be back here in a few months' time further amending this legislation.  There is the potential to exploit the ambiguity in this section by challenging the legislation. I suggest inserting this phrase to ensure we are not exposed to such a challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister must take expert advice from draftspeople who have a great deal of experience in drafting Bills. However, they are the same people who have caused us to have to rush through this Bill to put something right.  I am unhappy that normal drafting practice has been given as the reason for refusing to accept this amendment.  We must examine whether that is a sufficient explanation. Will the Minister explain further his problems with the amendment?</P>
      <P>I have difficulties with this Bill which were articulated by Deputy Joe Higgins earlier.  It is being rushed through unnecessarily without giving all Deputies an opportunity to debate it. There are more than three parties in the House and it is important to give space to different views.  Rushing Bills through the House is likely to create further problems.  I respect Deputy Shortall's attempts to improve the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister alluded to the constitutional aspect of the Bill.  I have concerns about whether the Bill is acceptable under the terms of the Constitution. Will the Minister comment on that in more detail?  There is a retrospective approach in the Bill and there are dangers in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> I understand the Minister has genuine concerns about delaying this matter.  However, rushing this Bill, which none of us saw until midday today, without any chance for reflection or deliberation is not how this House should conduct its business. The Minister needs to clarify his position on this amendment, which I presume has been put forward in good faith, and the constitutional aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I do not want to be combative about the Bill, which I somewhat reluctantly support.  As I said, it would have been better to test it in the courts if that process could have been expedited, notwithstanding the fact there are further cases on the courts' conveyor belt which could give rise to difficulties next week or the week after.</P>
      <P>It is not a case of who did or said what.  This Bill was enacted by the previous Government.  It went through the normal legislative process of publication and Second Stage, was thoroughly vetted on Committee and Report Stages, went through Final Stage, was passed by the Seanad and was signed by the President without demur. Few pieces of legislation have received such public acclaim as it did, on the basis that it mainly set out to tackle the new and high profile crime of syringe attacks.  The order was signed by the present Minister on 19 August 1997.  That is not the point.</P>
      <P>The net point in relation to this amendment is that if we are talking about the need for certainty, which the Minister heavily emphasised as the reason for rushing the Bill through the House, while nothing might be gained from inserting the word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo;, it is certain that nothing would be lost by so doing.  Why is the Minister being so dogged and intransigent in his refusal to accept the amendment?</P>
      <P>If inserting the word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; will in no way dilute the intent or content of the Bill, the Minister would be well advised to accept this reasonable amendment which does not in any way lessen the gravity of an offence.  I cannot see why the Minister would not accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is offered.  There does not seem to be very strong legal advice against accepting it.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accept the amendment because by so doing he would not in any way mitigate the wording of the Bill and would head off further possible challenges.  As Deputy McManus said, the people who are advising on the Bill are presumably those who advised on the soundness of the original legislation.  Why can the Minister not come down on the side of caution and accept the amendment?</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I wish to object again to the Government's proposal to enact this legislation in an emergency fashion.  The minimum right which any elected Member of the Dáil should have is the democratic right to examine legislative proposals which will affect people's <Col N="439" /> lives, whether it is the lives and rights of victims of crime or those who are accused of crimes but are presumed to be innocent until found guilty. Deputies have the right to be briefed on the legal aspects of a Bill by legal experts so that a proper debate can take place and any dangers can be rooted out.</P>
      <P>It would have cost the Government nothing to give at least two weeks for a proper debate on this issue.

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Will the Minister elaborate on section 1(4) which I find alarming? It refers to the constitutional rights which might be affected by this proposed legalisation.  Which constitutional rights does the Minister envisage might be infringed by these proposals?  What other rights might be infringed?  Has this been thought out?  Without having had the opportunity to properly debate and discuss this Bill I intend to vote against it in protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>An offence is either committed or not.  If an offence was not committed this legislation will not affect that; if an offence was committed and if the courts rule that the offences abolished by the 1997 Act cannot be proceeded with if they occurred before the coming into law of that Act, such an offence will be caught by this Bill.  It would be irrelevant to insert the words &ldquo;alleged to have been&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;committed&rdquo; because if the offence was not committed it is not affected by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indictments usually charge the offence or offences as having been committed on a certain date or dates.  If the offence was not committed before the appropriate date the section does not apply to it.  In those circumstances to insert the words &ldquo;alleged to have been committed&rdquo; would be superfluous.  There should be no difficulty in establishing whether or not an offence was or was <Col N="440" /> not committed before a certain date.  I hope this helps to clarify the situation regarding whether or not there is a need to have the words &ldquo;alleged to have been committed&rdquo; included.</P>
    <P>Turning to the criticisms by Deputies McManus and Joe Higgins regarding the Bill being rushed through and the constitutionality of the legislation, section 1(4) is inserted to avoid any implication that the legislation might be an unconstitutional interference in ongoing proceedings. Subsection (4) provides that if section 1 would, but for subsection (4) as inserted, conflict with the constitutional rights of any person, the section will be subject to such limitations as are necessary to ensure that it does not so conflict but shall otherwise be of full force or effect.  The subsection is inserted to ensure that an individual's constitutional rights are maintained and that there would be no misunderstanding or implication to the effect that the legislation might be an unconstitutional interference with ongoing proceedings.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) applies the section to common law offences abolished before the enactment of the Bill.  It therefore applies to the common law offences abolished by section 28 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997.  The Bill cannot be criticised on the basis of its retrospectivity. It does not make acts or offences criminal which were not criminal at the time they were committed.  That would be in breach of Article 15.5. of the Constitution.  The actions to which this legislation relates were criminal acts at the time they were committed.  The Bill merely enables prosecutions to be mounted in relation to purely criminal actions if that becomes necessary in the light of subsequent court decisions.  For example, actions committed at this point in time are still criminal having regard to the provisions of the 1997 Act which put those offences on a statutory footing.  I have no doubt that this course is the correct one and I am confident it will stand up anywhere.  I am satisfied with regard to the constitutionality of the legislation in so far as anybody can be satisfied regarding the constitutionality of any legislation, given that interpretation is ultimately a matter for the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the criticism that the Bill is being rushed through unnecessarily.  If it were the case that, in the coming weeks and months, offences were thrown out by the courts pending, for example, the decision of the High Court in the Mullins case, Deputies on the Opposition benches would rightly round on me on the basis that I saw the risk and took the gamble.  I have seen the risk and am not prepared to take the gamble.  I wish to ensure that the criminal law is tightened in this important area and that any possible loophole which may exist is closed off.</P>
    <P>It would be more prudent and perhaps easier if I had the luxury to await the judgment of the High Court and any appeal in the Mullins case. However, I have a duty to citizens to ensure that if offences were committed at common law prior <Col N="441" /> to the coming into force of this Act and which were abolished, those who perpetrated them or were responsible for them will face the courts and, if convicted, be punished in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>This legislation should not be opposed by any Deputy.  I agree that it is desirable and necessary where possible to ensure that Deputies are circulated with legislation in such a way that they have the opportunity to consider it and make worthwhile contributions.  However, unfortunately I am not in a position to do that in this instance.  It is not the first time this has happened, though I accept it is unusual and even undesirable that legislation should be passed in this fashion.</P>
    <P>Alone of the Members in the House, I was present when the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, was rushed through because a general election was pending and the then Government wanted the legislation on the Statute Book.  I could do little about that and I accept that I and the other Opposition spokespersons did not have the opportunity we would have liked to debate the legislation.  I understand why Deputies consider it undesirable that legislation should be rushed through.  However, this legislation is different.  It is designed to close off a possible loophole and to ensure that there will be certainty in the criminal law regarding the offences concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question as to whether section 1(4) conflicts with a person's constitutional rights.  Should that be the case, limitations will be applied.  Will the Minister confirm that this is an unusual section to insert in a Bill? This seems to be either self evident or else an indication that he has concerns that there is a conflict with a person's constitutional rights.  If that is the case perhaps he would elaborate on where it might arise.  Would it mean the Bill would not have the desired effect?  What are the limitations?</P>

      <P>That is not the reason I advanced for not accepting the amendment.  I have dealt with the matter in some detail and there is nothing to gain by going further with it.  I appreciate the Deputy's motivation in tabling the amendment, which is well-intentioned, but I must stand by the argument I made which is the correct one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the insertion of section 1 (4) and the constitutionality of the Bill, the Mullins case is awaiting judicial review in the High Court and there is also a pending case of <i>habeas corpus.</i>  It will be for the courts to decide the extent to which this legislation will have a bearing on these cases.  While I would not <Col N="442" /> wish to offer an opinion, the courts may hold that, because proceedings were pending, this legislation cannot affect them.  If the courts decide, on a proper interpretation of section 28 of the 1997 Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, that it does not prevent prosecutions continuing in relation to the common law offences abolished that will be the end of the matter and this legislation was not required in the first instance.  If the courts decide the other way this legislation will be in place and there will be certainty in the law.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cases concerned, section 1 (4) seeks to demonstrate that the Bill does not seek to interfere with the constitutional rights of any person.  It reads:</P>
    <P>If, because of any or all of its provisions, this section would, but for the provisions of this subsection, conflict with the constitutional rights of any person, the provisions of this section shall be subject to such limitations as are necessary to secure that they do not so conflict, but shall otherwise be of full force and effect.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope this helps to resolve the dilemma in which Deputy McManus finds herself.</P>

      <P>In page 79, line 37, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;continue to&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove an ambiguity in the Bill as it stands.  As the provision in question, section 2 (4)(b)(vii) of the Age of Majority Act, 1985, ceased to apply in 1986 it cannot <Col N="443" /> cease to again apply if it no longer applies. For that reason the provision, as worded at present, does not express existing law as it applies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment relates to section 7 of the Bill.  That section consolidates the provisions of section 112 of the Finance Act, 1986, which provided for the application of the Age of Majority Act, 1985, to certain taxation statutes.  To apply the provisions of the Age of Majority Act, 1985, to tax law section 112 of the Finance Act, 1986, provided for the formal cesser of the provision in the Age of Majority Act, 1985, which had prevented such application, namely, section 2 (4)(b)(vii) of that Act.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is proposing in relation to this formal cesser that the words &ldquo;shall cease to apply&rdquo; in section 7 (1) of this Bill be replaced with the words &ldquo;shall continue to cease to apply&rdquo;.  His concern appears to be that as section 2 (4) (b) (vii) of the Age of Majority Act, 1985, ceased to apply in 1986 when the underlying legislation was enacted it cannot cease to apply again if it no longer applies.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with the Deputy's proposal is that it seems to suggest this is in some way new legislation.  That is not the case.  This Bill consolidates existing law.  Section 7, as drafted, faithfully replicates the form of the underlying legislation, namely, section 112 of the Finance Act, 1986. Legislation is always current and should be read as such.  Accordingly the phrase &ldquo;shall cease to apply&rdquo; has equal effect in 1997.  I do not propose, therefore, to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 97, line 39, to delete &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We debated this phrase at some length on Committee Stage.  The expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; is used widely in sections 73 and 830.  The Minister's explanation to the joint committee was not entirely satisfactory in that he offered no clear reason for the difference in terminology, nor is it clear there is as much strength in the argument that the terms have a different meaning.  It was for that reason I retabled this amendment in the hope that he would be prepared to re-examine it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's intention is to achieve uniformity of expression in the Bill by substituting the term &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern <Col N="444" /> Ireland&rdquo; for &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; wherever it occurs.  The Deputy makes the point that the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; is used more widely in the Bill.</P>
      <P>While one would tend to agree with Deputy Ferris that we should strive for as much consistency as possible &mdash; as I stated in the course of our joint committee deliberations &mdash; the fact remains that there may well be cogent reasons for the Oireachtas in the past having used slightly different versions to describe what might seem at first sight to be the same thing.  Therefore, we should be very careful in making changes to this Bill lest we inadvertently make a substantive change to the underlying law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris seeks to amend section 29 which modifies the charge to capital gains tax in the case of gains arising to resident or ordinarily resident individuals, not domiciled in the State, from the disposal of assets situated outside the State and the United Kingdom.  I am informed that the parliamentary draftsman's office has indicated that replacing the expression &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; with that of &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; could result in a slight change in the meaning of the underlying legislation.  For example, what would be the status of the United Kingdom's areas of the Continental Shelf or even the territorial seas of the United Kingdom?  In this connection I refer Deputy Ferris to section 276 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act, 1992, the United Kingdom equivalent of our Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, where the territorial sea of the United Kingdom is deemed for all purposes of the taxation of chargeable gains to be part of the United Kingdom.  In the light of this provision it is certainly arguable that using the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; in Irish legislation rather than that of &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; in some instances may have the effect of excluding such areas, thereby changing the existing law.</P>

      <P>I still agree with the Minister's position enunciated on Committee Stage.  If we wanted to call things by their constitutionally correct name, it would be in addition to &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; that we would include &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo;.  Regardless of our political positions, I understand the recognised term is &ldquo;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister is being rightly prudent in this respect because, to change the underlying terminology designating territory in a Taxes Consolidation Bill, in which the issues of domicile could be a dominant factor &mdash; even though one cannot point to a specific case in the Bill where such difficulty could arise if Deputy Ferris's amendment were accepted &mdash; it is not worth taking the risk for the sake of neatness of drafting.</P>

      <P>On the basis of research into this terminology I consider the term &ldquo;country&rdquo; is not the appropriate one and should be substituted with the word &ldquo;territory&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has fairly strong views on this also.  Nonetheless, he should have had an opportunity to examine the reason for my tabling this amendment and, hopefully, will have changed his mind.</P>

      <P>These amendments relating to sections 200, 487, 826 and 828 are to be discussed together.  Their purpose is to achieve uniformity of expression in the Bill by substituting the expression &ldquo;territory&rdquo; for references to &ldquo;state&rdquo; or &ldquo;country&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While it is always desirable to achieve uniformity of expression in legislation, the fact is that sections 200, 487, 826 and 828 of this Bill have faithfully replicated the underlying legislation. Hence, in some cases the word &ldquo;country&rdquo; is used while in others &ldquo;state&rdquo; is used.  Deputy Ferris now proposes that the word &ldquo;territory&rdquo; be substituted for the words &ldquo;country&rdquo; and &ldquo;state&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The point may be made that the word &ldquo;territory&rdquo; is used elsewhere in the Bill and is an appropriate term to cover all jurisdictions. However, that is not sufficient reason for accepting the amendment.  For example, the word &ldquo;country&rdquo; can mean a geographical area or one under a particular political jurisdiction, while the word &ldquo;state&rdquo; clearly means an area under a particular political jurisdiction.  On the other hand, the word &ldquo;territory&rdquo; can be construed as having a much wider meaning than either &ldquo;state&rdquo; or &ldquo;country&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is ample precedent for a reference to &ldquo;state&rdquo; when referring to other countries, such as <Col N="446" /> in Article 29.3 of the Constitution which contains the phrase &ldquo;in its relations with other States&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Moreover, if we take the amendments proposed to lines 16 and 17 of page 1,132 of this Bill which deal with the negotiation of double taxation treaties with foreign states, I am of the firm view that the existing references to &ldquo;state&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign state&rdquo; should remain.  For example, a &ldquo;Head of State&rdquo;, in the context of &ldquo;the Head of a foreign State&rdquo; has an international currency.  The alternative &ldquo;Head of a foreign territory&rdquo; would at best be a somewhat awkward construction and, at worst, open to question.</P>
    <P>However desirable it may be to achieve consistency in this Bill, to accept these amendments could run the risk of making a substantive change to the underlying law.  We cannot take the risk of undermining the status of the Bill as a consolidation measure.  Changes of the nature being sought by Deputy Ferris would be best pursued by way of substantive change to the law through the vehicle of the annual Finance Bill.  Accordingly, I cannot accept them.</P>

      <P>In page 1167, line 14, after &ldquo;oath&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or affirmation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to remove the ambiguity in the Bill and to achieve adaptation of existing law and practice by making express provision for an affirmation which, in the case of a conscientious objection, is the legal alternative to the oath.  The Minister's objections to these amendments on Committee Stage pose two serious difficulties.  He relies on the Interpretation Act which states that &ldquo;oath includes affirmation&rdquo; - paragraph 20 of the Schedule refers. However, this applies only in the case of persons for the time being allowed by law to affirm instead of swearing.  Such permission is given in relation to legal proceedings by the Oaths Act, 1888, but there is no such permission for the purpose of tax administration not involving legal proceedings to which the Oaths Act, 1888, does not expressly apply.  This can be verified in the 1990 report of the Law Reform Commission on oaths and affirmations &mdash; pages ten to 12 refer.  The second difficulty with the Minister's argument is that while &ldquo;oath&rdquo; and &ldquo;swear&rdquo; are covered by the Interpretation Act, &ldquo;oath&rdquo; and &ldquo;swears&rdquo; are not and there is no reference in the Act to cognate the words being construed accordingly.  The alternative amendment referring to the Oaths Act is also designed to address this problem as an alternative approach and is based on section 18(2) of the Juries Act, 1976.  We submitted the legal arguments to the Minister so that he would have an opportunity to understand the reasoning behind the amendments.  I hope he will be in a position to accept them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>The Deputy's intention is to remove ambiguity and inconsistency from the Bill by making express provision for an affirmation which, in the case of conscientious objection to taking an oath, is the legal alternative to an oath. I indicated in select committee that the Interpretation Act, 1937, already makes express provision for the term &ldquo;oath&rdquo; to include &ldquo;affirmation&rdquo; and for the term &ldquo;swear&rdquo; to include &ldquo;affirm&rdquo; in every Act of the Oireachtas.  The provisions of the Interpretation Act, 1937, apply in the case of persons for the time being allowed by law to affirm instead of swearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy makes the point, of which I was not aware during the select committee debate, <Col N="448" /> that the provision which allows a person to affirm instead of swearing is the Oaths Act, 1888, and that the permission given in that Act applies only for the purposes of legal proceedings.  The result is that the provisions of the tax code which do not involve legal proceedings but which provide for the swearing of an oath are not covered by the Oaths Act, 1888.  Accordingly, in such cases it is not permissible to affirm or declare and a person must swear.  This is not an acceptable position and I propose to rectify matters at the most opportune time.  However, the gap in our tax legislation identified by the Deputy is not one with which we can deal in the course of consolidation. Deputy Ferris identified a lacuna in the law and substantive legislation will be required to put it right.  To accept this amendment would be to accept a substantive change to the underlying law. Accordingly, I oppose it.  However, I assure the House that I will examine this issue in the context of the Finance Bill with a view to rectifying the matter.  In the context of tax generally there may be similar defects in some of our other tax codes and I need to consider this aspect of the matter also.  I thank Deputy Ferris for identifying this lacuna in the law.  I cannot accept his amendment now because it would make a substantive change to the Consolidation Act but, in the context of the next Finance Bill, I will so do.  This error may also arise in another branch of tax legislation.</P>

      <P>These amendments, two in my name and two in the name of Deputy Ferris, are related and are to be discussed together.  The amendments propose to insert a definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; into sections 1030 and 1031 of the Bill.  Section 1030 consolidates the provisions of section 72 of the Finance Act, 1997, which deals with the capital gains tax treatment of disposals of assets made on foot of separation orders or foreign divorces.  Section 1031 consolidates the provisions of section 71 of the Finance Act, 1997, which deals with the capital gains tax treatment of disposals of assets made on foot of divorce orders granted by the Irish courts.  In the Finance Act, 1997, measures were designed to bring into the corpus of fiscal law the provisions of section 52 of the Family Law Act, 1995 and section 35 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  However, the definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; in section 2(2)(c) of each of those Acts, necessary for those provisions to have effect, was not copied in the Finance Act, 1997 measures.  The amendments are designed to rectify those omissions.  As my amendments achieve the goal sought by Deputy Ferris's amendments, I ask the House to agree to my amendments.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposes to replace the reference to &ldquo;a felony or misdemeanour&rdquo; in section 1070 with a reference to &ldquo;an offence&rdquo;.  It is prompted by section 3 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997.  Section 3(1) of that Act provides for the abolition of all distinctions between felony and misdemeanour while section 3(2) establishes that on all matters on which a distinction had previously been made between felony and misdemeanour, the law and practice in relation to all offences will be that applicable at the commencement of the Act in relation to misdemeanours.</P>
      <P>I oppose the amendment for two reasons.  First, it is inappropriate because the Criminal Law Act, 1997, did not come into operation until 22 July 1997, while the provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Bill will effectively operate from 6 April 1997.  The amendment, if accepted, would therefore operate on a retrospective basis for a period in which there would have been distinctions between felonies and misdemeanours.  As such the amendment would make a substantive change in the underlying law.</P>
      <P>Second, the Criminal Law Act, 1997, did not abolish the concept of &ldquo;felony&rdquo; and &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo;<i>per se.</i>  The Act abolished all distinctions between the two concepts and further provided that where there was previously a distinction made between felony and misdemeanour, including in the mode of trial, the law and practice in relation to all offences will be that appropriate to a misdemeanour.  In light of the wording of the Criminal Law Act, 1997, it is too simplistic to take the approach that &ldquo;felonies&rdquo; and &ldquo;misdemeanours&rdquo; have been abolished.  In the circumstances the amendment could have the unintended result of changing the current law and thereby possibly having an adverse effect on current efforts to bring criminal proceedings in the area of tax evasion.  I oppose the amendment for these reasons.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to achieve the adaptation of existing law and practice by taking into account the enactment of the Criminal Law Act, 1997, and consequent abolition of &ldquo;felony&rdquo; and &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo;. These categories were abolished by section 3 of that Act which was enacted on 22 April, 1997.  It is now the law, having commenced on 22 July 1997.  Reference to &ldquo;felony&rdquo; or &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo; in existing law would appropriately be to &ldquo;an offence&rdquo;.  The amendment reflects existing law.  In any case it is wrong to refer in a Bill to categories of offences which have been abolished.  The amendment involves no change in the intended scope of the section.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister on this matter.  It is dangerous in a consolidation Bill to change terminology which could be subsequently subjected to legal challenge.  We have the recent example of the effect of the Houses of the Oireachtas attempting to abolish common law <Col N="451" /> offences.  Fortuitously, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda Síochána simultaneously charged the kidnappers of Mr. Lacey with firearms offences.  Otherwise, the gentleman involved would have walked free.  We should be careful in a consolidation Bill about importing new terminology or material.  However, if on reflection the Minister feels there is merit in Deputy Ferris's argument, as was the case in a previous amendment, a commitment to study it and deal with it in the context of the 1998 Finance Bill would be a prudent way to approach it.</P>

    <P>Deputy Ferris's amendment No. 50 arises as a consequence of our agreement on Committee Stage to an amendment to change the reference in section 862 to Secretary of the Department of the Department of Finance to Secretary General <Col N="452" /> of the Department of Finance.  That amendment was necessary because of the enactment of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, which changed the title of heads of Departments from Secretary to Secretary General.  The Public Service Management Act, 1997, commenced on 1 September 1997, whereas the Taxes Consolidation Bill has an effective commencement date of 6 April 1997.  Hence, it is necessary to retain the reference to Secretary of the Department of Finance in the period from the commencement of the Taxes Consolidation Bill to 31 August 1997. Deputy Ferris's amendment No. 50 achieves this objective.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we also agreed to amendments moved by Deputy Ferris to change references in section 667 of the Bill to University College, Dublin and University College, Cork to the National University of Ireland, Dublin and the National University of Ireland, Cork, respectively. The amendments arose as a consequence of the Universities Act, 1997, which changed the title of various educational institutions.  The Universities Act, 1997, commenced on 16 June 1997, whereas the Taxes Consolidation Bill has an effective commencement date of 6 April 1997. Hence, it is necessary to retain the references to University College, Dublin and University College, Cork in the period from the commencement of the Taxes Consolidation Bill to 15 June 1997. Amendment No. 51 in Deputy Ferris's name achieves this objective.  I ask the House to agree to amendments Nos. 48 to 51, inclusive.</P>

      <P>I have a problem with the logic of amendments Nos. 48 and 49.  It appears every time there is a change of Administration, the titles of Ministers and Departments also change. While it appears at face value that something modern is being done in bringing the terminology up to date with the last change of Government in June, there is nothing to say that the title of the Department of Health will not change again quickly.  For example, there is a very strong case for calling the Department of Health the Department of Health and Social Services, as it is called in the United Kingdom, rather than the Department of Health and Children.  While &ldquo;Department of Health and Children&rdquo; describes many of the functions of that Department and Minister in those areas, it is within the wider remit of that Department to look after social services.  The consolidation Bill, as the Minister said on Second Stage, is a job for a generation.  It is not something that we will return to year after year.  The last such Bill was in 1967.</P>

    <P>It would be better if this Bill's terminology stood the test of time in respect of Ministers and their titles and this should be done in the definitions section, where the Minister of Health could be defined as the Minister who, from time to time, carried out the functions of the Minister of <Col N="453" /> Health or any other Minister carrying out these functions.  That is a better approach, because what looks up-to-date now could be changed by a new Taoiseach or the present one in six months or three and a half years for reasons of modernity, to give the impression of activity when none is taking place or for the sake of public relations.  We would then have a consolidation Bill that is no more permanent than this.</P>
    <P>There are descriptions of Departments which do not change that much, no matter what tricking is done with their titles by a Minister.  I do not intend to call for a division on this amendment, but the Minister should have stuck to the position he adopted on Committee Stage.  He could have accommodated Deputy Ferris's view and the desire to call Departments by names in current usage.  It would be better to have an addendum to the definitions rather than the amendments now proposed.</P>

      <P>I understand Deputy Noonan's point but I tabled this amendment to achieve adaptation of the existing law and practice by taking account of the new terminology under the Public Service Management Act, 1997, which took effect on 1 September 1997, Statutory Instrument 339/97.  I tabled this amendment for that reason and because it is consequential on the acceptance of Committee Stage amendment No. 110.  I am pleased the Minister has accepted this amendment because it is a more fundamental issue than the changing of Minister's titles due to the Public Service Management Act.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 48 and 49 relate to Deputy Noonan's point and amendments Nos. 50 and 51 relate to Deputy Ferris's comments on the title of the Secretary of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has a point regarding the names of Departments.  He is right in thinking that possibly in the lifetime of this Administration someone will think of a good reason to change Department names.  The Department of Finance would have had its name changed a long time ago but for the fact that it is the only Department referred to in the Constitution, which states that the Minister responsible for the Department of Finance can do certain things.</P>
      <P>We were advised that, in regard to Department functions, the latest names were the best ones to use in the consolidation Bill.  The difficulty with approaching this matter in the definitions section of the Bill is that as different Governments come to power, they change the functions of various Departments.  We accepted the advice offered to us on name changes but there is legitimacy in Deputy Noonan's view.</P>
      <P>I have explained that I am accepting Deputy Ferris's amendments relating to the title of the Secretary of the Department of Finance because of the starting dates of the consolidation Bill and the Public Service Management Act.</P>

    <Title>Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the record and achievements of Aer Rianta in Shannon's success.  It is a focal point for the development of industry and tourism in the midwest.  It is important that Aer Rianta's work in Shannon be recognised.  When the Minister hands authority over to Aer Rianta, the property in Shannon will become liable for county rates to Clare County Council, which, it is estimated, could realise over £1 million in rates.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Government recognises the work Clare County Council has been doing in developing the infrastructure around the airport. When revenues accrue to the council from the airport rates, this money should not be deducted from the council through another mechanism.  We experienced this when Moneypoint was valued and rates were levied on it.  An amount was deducted from the rate support grant to Clare which caused much concern.  I will deal with this on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The prospect of the abolition of duty-free facilities in the airports will have an impact on job opportunities in all airports.  There has been a reluctance to face this inevitable fact, but there are also special cases to be made.  It is important to highlight the advantages of duty-free facilities in airports.  That successful operation should be continued, as it has created jobs as well as generating revenue for the airports to develop facilities for passengers.  It is important to emphasise the need to find a mechanism within EU rules and regulations to continue to provide duty free facilities at airports in the coming years.</P>
      <P>Sections 14 and 15 refer to the transfer of properties from the Minister to Aer Rianta.  The Minister will be aware some of the properties adjacent to Shannon Airport are holdings of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd.  The procedures to put in place customs free zones, which are complex and involve several ministries, have meant that, by and large, the customs free zone and the industrial estates connected to Shannon have been operated by the Industrial Development Authority and by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd., the agency for the mid-west region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the hand over of properties the Minister should take into account the importance of placing the properties being used for industrial purposes under the control and management of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd., otherwise that company may end up negotiating with another State agency for land in <Col N="456" /> the ownership of the Minister.  It is important to get a clear indication of which lands will be given to Aer Rianta and the Industrial Development Authority so the industrial development promotion and customs free activities which have been taking place there over a number of years may continue.</P>
    <P>Section 29, which I do not particularly like, allows the chief executive of the company to be removed from office by the board.  A chief executive might run into difficulties with the board because of personalities, etc.  Members of the board may vote the chief executive out of office, which is undesirable.  A mechanism for appeal should be included in section 29 where the chief executive, who might be removed at the whim of some members of the board, could go to the Minister for a final decision in the event of a dispute. The chief executive should be an <i>ex officio</i> member of the board of the new authority because in matters of airport management and development he or she is central.  I cannot see a situation where the chief executive would be outside the board and would be called in on occasions to discuss important issues.  On Committee Stage I will seek to ensure environmental issues are covered and that airports, such as Shannon, could link up with other international airports, which is not provided for.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation which will underpin the work done in Shannon.  At a time when there is a lack of confidence in Shannon, it should restore the confidence of the people of the region in the airport, its future and its prospects for creating more employment and opportunity.  The legislation and the resulting financial developments should underpin Shannon as a major centre for development, employment and tourism creation in the long term.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the legislation, I will have more to say on Committee Stage.  I would like Aer Rianta to decentralise its offices from Dublin to provide clerical work in the regions.  We have always followed a strong policy of regionalisation and I hope the authority will look at creating further employment opportunities by decentralising some of the administrative offices to places such as Shannon and perhaps Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997.  I remind the House that this legislation is almost a generation overdue.  Be that as it may, it is better late than never.  The Bill contains 64 sections, all or most of which are acceptable.  It provides for the setting up of Aer Rianta as a commercial State body, which is a step in the right direction.  I hope it will enable Aer Rianta to expand and develop to its maximum capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The threat to duty free income from sales at our airports and throughout Europe could mean disaster.  Aer Rianta earned over £100 million from this valuable business last year.  What will substitute for the loss of this considerable sum of money to Aer Rianta if this threat is acted on? <Col N="457" /> As outlined by Deputy Broughan, it is evident the Taoiseach was led up the garden path and had the wool pulled over his eyes when he meekly accepted this legislation in Brussels in 1992.  I call on him to proceed to Brussels immediately to urge his counterparts in the EU to readdress this anomalous legislation passed in 1992.  This matter must be readdressed in Brussels and I urge the Taoiseach to have the retrograde legislation changed to ensure a continuation of duty free services at airports throughout the EU.</P>
    <P>I dislike the move afoot to play down the importance of regional airports and to centralise the lion's share of funding in Dublin Airport.  While Dublin is the capital city and deserves what its airport gets, other regional airports must also get their share of the national cake.  If the Celtic Tiger continues in its stride, Aer Rianta might consider extending its service to the sunny south-west and build an airport in Bantry to cater for tourism, mariculture and the other industries which would emerge from its siting in this region.  Parts of my constituency in south-west Cork are over 120 miles from the nearest airport, that is, Cork city. Furthermore, we have had no railway system since the late 1950s.</P>
    <P>I would like to ascertain why Aer Lingus discontinued flights from Dublin to the Canary Islands.  We must now rely on Futura, a Canary Islands airline, to fly at least 1,000 people to the Canaries each weekend.  Before the Celtic Tiger is caged, the Minister should see fit to establish an airport in south-west Cork, an area larger than several counties which is far away from the major airports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to commit adequate resources to tackling the factors contributing to the rapid deterioration in Dublin's traffic conditions.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Yates, Richard Bruton and Clune.</P>
      <P>It is no exaggeration to say that traffic in Dublin is a nightmare.  That nightmare is worse today than it was a year ago and unless radical and effective action is taken the situation will continue to deteriorate rapidly and in a year's time it will be even worse, the gridlock even thicker, than it is today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from personal experience that a journey through the city centre which can be accomplished in 20 minutes on foot will take up to half an hour by car at most times of the day and could take even longer by public transport, <Col N="458" /> except in the cases where the DART can be used. The problem for public transport is exacerbated by virtue that we now have much more commonly a phenomenon which I used to see in the days of my youth when I regularly took the No. 19 bus, the banana route where the buses come in bunches.  That happens now to an even greater degree because the bunching of public transport is an inevitable result of the kind of gridlock which is now common on the roads in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. during weekdays there is virtually no lull or valley period in city centre traffic.  Very soon that congestion will extend from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. Even on Saturday city centre traffic is very heavy.  The days when Dublin commuters could come into the city on Saturday to shop with some comfort are gone. Whether they come by car or public transport they find similar delays on Saturday to those during the week.</P>
    <P>A simple single event like the Horse Show or a major concert can disrupt traffic in the city for hours before and after the event.  Last Friday a fire in the city centre caused a monumental snarlup of traffic, the effect of which spread in all directions, as far as the outer edges of the city.  I know what I am talking about as I was travelling through the city centre.  With two hours in hand I thought it would be possible to travel from Sally's Bridge on the canal to my office in Kildare House and still arrive at RTE in time to keep an appointment.  However, when I hit the traffic at Sally's Bridge I forgot any notion of coming into the centre of the city and proceeded directly to RTE.  It took me an hour and a half to make that journey.</P>
    <P>Like many others I drive from my home to Leinster House, a distance of 35 miles, on most days of the week.  Up to a year ago that journey normally took one hour.  With each passing month the journey time is becoming longer.  It is impossible to rely on doing it in less than an hour and a quarter at almost any time of the day.  At the same time, that journey takes me less time than is required by many commuters who live much closer to the city than I do.  Commuters who live on the northern edge of the city anywhere from Malahide or Howth in or those who live in the Killiney area &mdash; many of them are friends of mine &mdash; need as much time to make that journey as I do to travel from Kildare to Dublin, except for those who are fortunate enough to live near the DART line and who have a much more predictable and reliable service.  With the exception of commuters who live within reach of the DART line or near the terminal point of a quality bus corridor, commuting involves long periods of waiting, crowded vehicles, slow progress, frequent disruption and uncertain and unpredictable journey times.  I doubt if many commuters in Dublin can predict with certainty how long it will take to travel from their home to their place of work whether they travel by private car or by bus. The only people who can give any kind of reliable indication of how long a journey will take are <Col N="459" /> those who have the good fortune to be able to take the DART.</P>
    <P>Rail commuters find themselves dogged by frequent delays, breakdowns, inadequate capacity and sometimes the disappearance of trains from the system.  That is another day's work and it would require a full day's debate in the House. All this conspires to make commuting and travelling around Dublin a much more stressful business than it needs to be.  There are times on the rail system when timetables, even on the Arrow which is the newest part of the system, seem like works of fiction.  Commuters whose journey takes them from one point on the edge of the city to another point on the edge of the city are forced by the way the public transport system is organised to join the throng heading for the centre of the city even though their only concern when they get there is to get out of it as quickly as they possibly can.  It is an important point as that group of commuters is increasing in numbers.  Given the new housing developments taking place at a rapid pace on the perimeter of the city the number of these commuters will continue to increase, as will the number of commuters heading for city centre destinations.  Unless there is a fundamental reorganisation of the provision of public transport in Dublin all those people will have to go to the centre of the city and a big proportion of them will have to find their way out of the city centre again instead of going a direct route around the perimeter of the city.</P>
    <P>The situation is deteriorating rapidly and there is no prospect of effective relief in sight even though the principal elements of a solution are well known and have been very well thought out. The Dublin Transportation Initiative was launched in 1986.  This turned out to be the most comprehensive, detailed, longest and least productive process of public consultation and decision-making this country has ever seen.  What have we got to show for 11 years of study, consultation and debate of Dublin's transport problems? We have two or three quality bus corridors, a few bus lanes &mdash; I will refer to these later &mdash; and precious little else except the most short-sighted decision ever seen in the history of public transport in Dublin taken last July when the Government effectively killed off the Luas.  Fianna Fáil has been in Government for eight of the 11 years since the DTI was initiated.  During that period it has made no key decision on the integration of traffic management and planning in Dublin but it has on at least two occasions backed off the implementation of measures which would have brought about a substantial improvement.</P>
    <P>The first such occasion was the decision in 1987 to scrap the remaining recommendations of the Dublin Rail rapid transit study when the DART between Howth and Bray had been completed. The second such occasion was in July when the Minister for Public Enterprise foolishly persuaded an ill advised Government to back away from the Luas project at a crucial moment and to <Col N="460" /> effectively scrap it for the foreseeable future. That must surely be one of the most short-sighted and mischievous decisions ever taken by Fianna Fáil.  I lay responsibility at Fianna Fáil's door.  The Progressive Democrats are in Government but I am sure they counted for nothing in this, particularly since the departure of their guru in chief in his usual cloud of self-righteousness.  This was the single most ill advised decision, the one most pregnant with all kinds of difficulties for Dublin commuters, which has ever been taken.  It effectively rules out European Union aid for the Luas project under the current Community Support Framework.  The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, effectively admitted that in a recent radio interview when she said that funding might be forthcoming under the new framework to be put in place post-1999.  That is very disingenuous of the Minister.  I remind her of the old saying that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  The bird we now have in the hand, the current Community Support Framework, is much plumper than the birds that will be in the bush after 1999.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not immediately reverse her utterly irresponsible decision to carry out yet another study of the underground option, with terms of reference that seem expressly designed to produce further delay, a future Government, of whatever stripe, will have the most extreme difficulty in securing and providing funding for improvements in mass transit facilities, which our capital city so urgently requires.  It will have the greatest difficulty in putting together a system that will meet the needs of the thousands of people who live in Tallaght, along the Luas route between Tallaght and the city centre, in Sandyford and Dundrum and between those areas and the city centre, not to speak of the burgeoning population that would be served by the Ballymun line when that is finally built.  The decision by the Government in July of this year puts off until lá philib an chleite, the day when any of those people will have a decent, reliable public transport system that will carry them around their native city.</P>
    <P>The damage does not end there.  There is much more the Minister, unaccountably, never even thought of.  She hinted that EU money not spent on Luas can be made available for other transport systems in Dublin, but that is pie in the sky.  CIE has a series of projects for the improvement of commuter rail services in the Dublin region.  We know what needs to be done on the Maynooth to Connolly Station service, the northern line, the line linking Heuston to Connolly stations, and the signalling system and track between the northern side of Connolly Station and Barrack Street, all of which are very useful projects of a kind that would substantially increase the carrying capacity of the Dublin commuter rail service.  It would, however, be idle to pretend, as the Minister seems to do &mdash; I do not like to say this but we are talking about reality &mdash; that those projects could be finalised, agreed and carried through between the spring of 1998 when the EU Commission <Col N="461" /> will finally declare that the Minister has killed Luas and the end of the year 2000 when, at the latest, funding under the current CSF must be expended.</P>
    <P>Those are all worthwhile projects, largely outside the current Community Support Framework, but not one of them could be put out to contract, agreed with the Commission and constructed by the end of the year 2000.  For the Minister for Public Enterprise to pretend there is a stock of such projects waiting to be financed by money that does not go towards Luas is pure pretence.</P>
    <P>Apart from averting the damage which the Minister seems hell bent on inflicting on the Dublin commuter system with her shilly-shallying about Luas, a great many other areas need attention. With or without Luas, this city will need a major investment in park and ride facilities, for which there is no provision.  A token provision is built into the CSF provision for Luas but no capital funding is provided for.  The other problems were well illustrated during the first Operation Freeflow, inspired by Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach before Christmas last year.  The programme to provide 11 quality bus corridors by the end of this year must be not only proceeded with but accelerated.  A further quality bus corridor, from Tallaght to the city centre, was to be announced last week but the announcement was cancelled at almost no notice and the people of Tallaght want to know the reason.</P>
    <P>Where quality bus corridors are not feasible, the operation of bus lanes must be more effective. They should be clear throughout the working day for exclusive use by public transport and taxis. That is blindingly obvious to anybody driving through the city during the day.  How many times do we hear AA Roadwatch on RTE state in the morning that traffic along the north quays is seriously disrupted by one car illegally parked? Current rules about on-street parking must be more rigidly enforced.  It must be recognised that in some parts of the city on-street parking, limited as it is, is still a serious hindrance to the flow of traffic, particularly public transport.</P>
    <P>The experience of Operation Freeflow is very instructive.  It required a major effort of co-ordination and co-operation on the part of Dublin Corporation, the Garda Síochána, Bus Átha Cliath, Iarnród Éireann and the DTO.  The effort was so great that it flagged at the slightest impression that political pressure had been relaxed to any noticeable extent.  The lesson is clear.  We need a traffic authority in Dublin with the statutory powers and the budget to ensure the proper co-ordination and implementation of an integrated traffic management system.  Without the statutory powers and the added clout of a budget, the enterprise would be doomed to failure. The current DTO, well-intentioned as it is, is doomed to frustration and futility as long as it does not have the instruments required to draw up and implement an integrated traffic management system.  That was evident not long ago when a technical problem arose on the route of Luas. <Col N="462" /> The DTO could do nothing except ask the people who contributed to a decision to get together, talk to each other and come up with a solution.</P>
    <P>That is not what the people of Dublin believe the DTO is there for, it is not what the DTO wants to be there for and it is not what the gentleman at the head of the DTO would wish to be there for.  The DTO needs powers, clearly defined functions, a budget and to be able to tell other agencies what to do, when to do it and how to do it.  We need a body with powers drawn from Dublin Corporation, the other Dublin local authorities, where appropriate, and perhaps other agencies as well as the Garda Síochána to provide a framework within which enlightened investment in public transport facilities can finally begin to offer residents and commuters in Dublin the service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse everything my colleague, Deputy Dukes, has said.  The Fine Gael Party attaches the highest political priority to the problem of gridlock of traffic in our capital city.  The deteriorating position is unacceptable to commuters, shoppers, tourists and everybody who uses the city.  I will commence where Deputy Dukes ended, on the question of a Dublin traffic authority.  It is clear Operation Freeflow worked when 100 gardaí dealt with the issue, but those gardaí have to deal with murder and other serious crime.  We need a Dublin traffic authority with the necessary traffic corps that has similar powers to those of the Garda.  Dublin Corporation works a computerised traffic management and traffic lights system, but it is not fully synchronised with the other three local authorities in the city.  An integrated approach is needed.  We do not yet have integrated ticketing between bus and rail, between the Arrow, Dart and the buses.  Those who plan Dublin's traffic should be directly involved in establishing the bus and rail timetables and integrated ticketing.</P>
      <P>Statutory corporations have a right to dig up our roads causing enormous disruption.  At the stroke of a pen an instruction could be given by a Dublin traffic authority that all such works be done at night.  The Department of Public Enterprise, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the traffic warden service need to be integrated in such an authority.</P>
      <P>It is clear from DTI studies and traffic studies across the world that where there is an average loading of 1.37 persons in a car, public transport is the ultimate solution to the gridlock.  Deputy Dukes referred to the DTI report published in 1991 which indicated that 11 quality bus corridors would be put in place.  Today we have three bus corridors, which is wholly unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Luas project &mdash; in respect of two vital corridors, Tallaght to the city centre and Dundrum to the city centre &mdash; is the subject of a further study on whether it should be underground or overground.  The most analysed project in the history of public transport, Luas, is subject to a further study.  I challenge the Government to <Col N="463" /> state whether there is a hidden agenda and a deliberate deferral of the Luas project, because of the disruption that will occur during construction, which is expected to continue for three years. That must be clarified because the EU money will be jeopardised after the present tranche expires.</P>
    <P>Simple things can be done in public transport. At peak hours people have to queue and stand cheek by jowl on the DART.  That there is not adequate rolling stock for increased capacity for that line is incredible.  The same applies to the Arrow service where more rolling stock could be put in place.  Where there is quality public transport, up to half the people will commute by public transport whereas only a quarter will do so if public transport is not adequate.</P>
    <P>We need to deregulate our taxi service and to examine the question of road pricing which is probably the most controversial area.  Between 1991 and 1996 the number of cars increased by one-third in the greater Dublin area.  Should the same tariff per hour apply to those who park before 9 a.m., taking up a car space all day, and to those who park from 10.30 a.m.?</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry during the past two and a half years I saw how civil servants and others were paid expenses.  To claim expenses they had to have a car and take up car space in the Department's carpark.  There was a clear disincentive to car pooling despite the obvious benefits for four or five using the same car.</P>
    <P>There is a need to support cycling.  Some 5 per cent of commuters cycle but this could be increased to 10 per cent.  If 6,000 cars were taken out of the system it would allow for 8,000 cyclists &mdash; ten bicycles to every car space &mdash; and relieve traffic congestion.  There is a mixture of public transport and road pricing techniques which can be put in place.  There is also the question of infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The motion condemns the Government for its failure to commit adequate resources.  There is already a menu of infrastructural works to be done &mdash; the port tunnel costing £80 million, the Luas project costing £220 million, the eastern bypass proposal has been resurrected again and it will be linked to the C ring road.  These are questions that must be dealt with through local democracy but it seems clear that an eastern bypass route of some description must be put back on the agenda.</P>
    <P>Dublin is the only capital city in Europe that does not have a rail link to its national airport.  It is incredible that if one wants to get from Tralee, Galway or wherever to the airport it cannot be done by rail.</P>
    <P>There is also the simple matter of traffic management. Under the regulations a skip parked in a clearway cannot be removed because it is not a mechanically propelled vehicle.  That is bizarre. Freight and heavy goods vehicles need to make their deliveries between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. In <Col N="464" /> other capital cities there are freight parks on the outer C-ring route whereby heavy freight is disassembled and all local deliveries done during the day must be of less than three and a half tonne consignments.</P>
    <P>I am not a Dublin Deputy but I have some responsibility for the overall transport policy of the Fine Gael Party.  This matter deserves the highest possible priority.  This cannot be given by a Minister or spokesperson for Public Enterprise or the Environment, it must be given by the Taoiseach setting up a ministerial task force leading to the establishment of a Dublin traffic authority. People are suffering from serious Government neglect, inaction and lack of concerted co-ordinated action.  Dublin commuters do not see any real prospect of a solution.  At best Government measures are <i>ad hoc</i> and singular in approach. This will be one of the key political issues in Dublin and we in Fine Gael are determined to put forward constructive solutions in terms of new structures to deal with it, a comprehensive approach to implementing it and the necessary resources to ensure we can deal effectively with our massive congestion, particularly at peak hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lack of understanding by the two Ministers opposite who have responsibility for tackling Dublin's traffic problems.  They do not understand the cost of the congestion is £500 million per year.  In layman's terms that is £1,500 for every home in the city.  That is a massive burden being shouldered by families in the city of Dublin.  It is almost the same amount as many are paying in their tax bills and there is no sense of urgency on the opposite benches.  The Government, like a rabbit before the headlights of an oncoming car, is frozen and unwilling to move in any direction.  It will not be the two Ministers - they are birds of passage and will be gone in time &mdash; but Dublin commuters who will be frozen before the headlights.  The Dubliners of today and tomorrow will suffer as a result of the Government's prevarication.</P>
      <P>The worst decision was to review the Luas project. As Deputy Dukes and others have said, this has been the most analysed project in the city and has been pulled and dragged it in every direction. The only consequence of the review is that we will sacrifice the opportunity of getting funding. In a recent interview with Deputy Alan Dukes the mask slipped when the Minister for Public Enterprise admitted she hoped the Luas would go ahead following the completion of the review. We have moved from having a project, a design and a commitment of funds, to the hope of a Minister that the Luas project might some day come to fruition.</P>
      <P>We have witnessed Operation Freeflow slide back.  It is no longer the effective programme it was when first instituted.  That is through lack of commitment, resources and a willingness to ensure it works.  The taxi protest last week was a vivid illustration of Fianna Fáil's attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> In Opposition Fianna Fáil cynically stoked up the expectations of the taxi lobby in Dublin by claiming its attitude would be dramatically different when in Government.  That is why the taxi men took to the streets.  Prior to the last election many of them happily drove around with slogans stating &ldquo;people first&rdquo; fluttering from the tops of their cabs and the names of their favourite Fianna Fáil Deputies on their bonnets.  Fianna Fáil built up an expectation that it would treat taxi drivers differently and Dubliners must now carry the can for that cynical approach.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is happy to run with the hare and course with the hound every time there is a crisis and it is trying to do likewise in the case of Luas. The time has long passed for further studies and prevarication in this area.  We need decisions and an action plan.  I strongly support the suggestion of the two previous speakers that the Dublin transport authority, which Fianna Fáil abolished in 1987, should be re-established.  A great opportunity was missed for that authority to put in place a coherent plan to tackle Dublin's transport problems.  A new deal for Dublin will not come from the present occupants of the Custom House or Clare Street.  A Dublin transport authority is necessary.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus was not properly supported in the past.  It carries 90 per cent of passengers who use public transport in Dublin.  Only 10 per cent is carried by the various rail options.  A total of 2p per passenger is available from the public coffers to support the development of a coherent public bus transport service.  That contrasts dramatically with the 70p per passenger available on the DART and the approximate £8 per passenger available on mainline rail.</P>
    <P>There has been a consistent failure to recognise the need to invest in an efficient and effective public bus transport system in our capital city. Dublin Bus is not geared to service the quality bus corridors which are slowly coming on stream. It needs a new deal which can be forged by a Dublin transport authority.  That deal must include adequate rolling stock and buses for peak times.  It must put in place a system of integrated ticketing and electronic bus timetables.  This can be done only with the provision of the necessary funds.  It cannot be done with the existing resources of Dublin Bus.  The Government must make a conscious decision to invest in this area and make it work.  It has not indicated it will do that and we will pay the price.  The only resource we have to make public transport attractive is being starved of resources at a time when it should be given a new deal.  That new deal should involve more than additional public funding.  Public funding was provided in the past and passenger numbers decreased.  Investment must include a contract to grow passengers.</P>
    <P>Umpteen things could be done if a creative Dublin transport authority existed.  A scheme could be introduced whereby those committed to car pooling would have access to city parking in preference to others.  Multiple lane roads could <Col N="466" /> be used to take incoming traffic in the mornings and outgoing traffic in the evenings.  Many new initiatives could be adopted if a Dublin transport authority with the necessary power, initiative, commitment and single mindedness were set up. We will not see any single mindedness from the Ministers currently occupying positions of responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a Cork Deputy who lives in Dublin three days a week.  People are frustrated with the traffic build-up in the city.  One of today's newspapers carried a report from <i>Fortune</i> magazine which stated that Dublin is the best city in Europe in which to do business, but traffic congestion continues to go unchecked.  Operation Freeflow had a tremendous impact last December and could be continued all year round for a budget of approximately £8 million.  Motorists contribute £1.6 billion to the Exchequer.  The Automobile Association stated it would cost the Exchequer a half a penny for every pound collected to do this.</P>
      <P>Dublin's ratio of people to cars is 3:18, the second least car populated city in a survey of 14 EU capitals.  This is not evident from the daily congestion on the streets.  The removal of through traffic and port traffic from the city centre, with proper management of the remaining traffic, would go a long way towards solving traffic congestion. Dubliners drive because of the absence of a good alternative system to get them to work on time.  People would gladly leave their cars at home if an efficient, effective and reliable public transport system operated.  We are still awaiting the outcome of the Luas project.  I also support the re-establishment of the Dublin transport authority.  There are many ways in which we could improve traffic conditions in Dublin.  Parkand-ride systems, car pooling and the imposition of parking levies would go a long way towards improving the congestion.</P>
      <P>We must also consider the impact of such congestion on the environment.  Suspended particles, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds contribute to air pollution.  Allowable pollution levels were exceeded in some parts of Dublin last year.  We signed up to the Rio Conference and the Minister will visit Kyoto next December to account for Ireland's reduction in pollution emissions into the atmosphere.  I hope we will not be sitting in traffic gridlocks while he is in Kyoto.  I urge the Minister to examine the problem of traffic congestion, particularly as we are approaching the busiest month of the year in terms of traffic.  Operation Freeflow should be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" />&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, recognising that measures to ease traffic congestion in Dublin should be implemented within the framework of the integrated transportation strategy for the Greater Dublin Area as set out in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, welcomes the commitment of the Government to implementation of the DTI Strategy and, in particular:</P>
    <P>notes that the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 provides for investment of in excess of £600 million in transport infrastructure in Dublin;</P>
    <P>supports the Government's commitment to provide a light rail system for Dublin, within the framework of the Operational Programme, consisting initially of a Tallaght-City Centre-Dundrum line;</P>
    <P>welcomes the planning work in progress on extension of light rail to Ballymun and Sandyford;</P>
    <P>notes that implementation of the DART extensions to Greystones and Malahide, acquisition of additional DART rolling stock, construction of new DART and suburban rail stations and implementation of quality bus corridors is proceeding as quickly as possible consistent with the need for adequate public consultation and compliance with relevant tendering and contract procedures;</P>
    <P>supports the Government's commitment to provide key additional road infrastructure for Dublin, in particular, the Southern Cross and South-Eastern Motorways, to complete the Dublin C-ring, and an access route to Dublin Port;</P>
    <P>endorses the policy of promoting better use of road space in Dublin through implementation of a range of traffic management measures and intensified enforcement of traffic regulations; and</P>
    <P>notes that the Dublin Transportation Office will shortly begin a formal review of the DTI strategy to update the strategy and renew its impetus.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Traffic congestion has serious economic and environmental consequences of which the Government is aware.  We experience this most acutely in the Dublin area, where the Dublin Transportation Office has estimated the economic costs of traffic congestion is approximately £500 million each year.  It is right that the House should assess the present position in Dublin and the adequacy of our efforts to promote sustainable transport for the capital.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus that these efforts, to be successful, must involve adequate investment in new facilities and infrastructure, effective measures to manage traffic demand in Dublin, <Col N="468" /> parking restraint, enforcement and reallocation of road space and good institutional arrangements to carry forward this integrated approach to transport management in Dublin.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, the prescription for better transport management set out in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative is a valid and sound one.  That approach was carefully developed between 1991 and 1995 on the basis of active contributions from all major players involved and widespread public consultation.  It has also been supported by successive Governments. This debate should not put in question the thrust of the DTI analysis, bearing in mind that the DTI strategy will be reviewed and updated by the Dublin Transportation Office.  It is also positive that the Dublin Transportation Office has been established to co-ordinate and drive the DTI strategy and a major programme of supporting investment is being implemented under the Operational Programme for Transport.</P>
    <P>On the problematic side, rapid growth in the economy, while beneficial in many other respects, has created greatly increased demand for transport in Dublin.  This is demonstrated in a dramatic increase in car ownership in the Dublin area from 275 cars per 1,000 head of population in 1991 to 357 per 1,000 in 1996; an unprecedented increase in shipments through Dublin Port from 7.7 million tonnes in 1991 to 14.5 million tonnes in 1996; and a big increase in passenger numbers through Dublin Airport from 5.5 million in 1991 to 9.1 million in 1996.  Each of those elements has added additional traffic to the city street network.</P>
    <P>The need to consult democratically on key infrastructural proposals and to deal with environmental, business and property concerns is also leading to some delays in implementing the DTI.  Those delays may be frustrating in terms of progressing the DTI strategy, but they are an essential part of implementing major physical changes in a democratic society.</P>
    <P>It is superficial and opportunistic to suggest, as the motion before us does, that traffic congestion has suddenly emerged as an issue since the recent general election when this Government took office.  Traffic congestion in Dublin has been a long-standing and deep seated problem.  It calls for a serious, comprehensive and multi-agency approach to give to Dublin the sustainable mobility it requires.  That is what the Government is determined to deliver.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to the DTI strategy.  The final report of the DTI estimated that it would cost more than £1,280 million to implement its recommendations. It recognised, however, that only part of this would be physically capable of implementation within the present decade.  The DTI process significantly assisted the case for EU funding of transport investment in Dublin.  The Operational Programme for Transport envisages expenditure in excess of £600 million to <Col N="469" /> implement the DTI's recommendations within its funding period.</P>
    <P>Promotion of sustainable transport is at the core of the DTI.  This includes the development of a high quality, efficient public transport system and a reduction in the dominance of the private car in Dublin transport arrangements.  The DTI proposed a number of measures including a significant improvement in public transport services, selected new road construction, traffic management measures and effective compliance with, and enforcement of, traffic and parking laws.  I want to assure the House that I intend, along with my other ministerial colleagues concerned, to press ahead with implementation of the DTI strategy.</P>
    <P>Regarding specific elements of the strategy, I want to deal with public transport.  A great deal of important work is in progress to improve Dublin's public transportation network.  A key element of the DTl's public transport strategy is an on-street light rail system for the capital city. The Government is committed to the provision of the core network recommended in the DTI report which includes a line from Tallaght via the city centre to Dundrum and Sandyford and a line from the city centre to Ballymun.  Our programme for Government includes a commitment to re-energise the Dublin light rail project, including the extension to Sandyford and study the option of putting Luas underground in the city centre.</P>
    <P>Some commentators and Members opposite have chosen to view the decision to examine the feasibility of an underground LRT option for the city centre as an attempt to abandon the light rail project altogether, but nothing could be further from the truth.  The Government remains fully committed to the project, but is anxious that issues raised in relation to the passenger capacity of the proposed system and the potential disruption to traffic, during construction and when in operation, are independently addressed in the underground study.  There is simply too much at stake for the city of Dublin to justify taking a decision one way or the other until the underground option has been thoroughly evaluated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister publish the results on the disruption to traffic while tunnelling for an underground system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is therefore vitally important that the underground study be clearly seen to be a fully independent and objective comparative study of the on-street and underground options that settles this matter once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International consultants, W. S. Atkins, have been appointed to carry out the underground study which will address the many valid and reasonable questions and concerns which have been raised about the on-street proposals and which have not been adequately addressed, despite repeated calls for this to be done.  The study will involve a comparative evaluation of <Col N="470" /> both on-street and underground options for the city centre and will take into consideration suggestions made by interested commentators, some of whom would be well known to Deputy Dukes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>What does that mean?  Are there no thinkers on the Government side?  Fianna Fáil has no thinkers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In this regard, the consultants are providing an opportunity for interested persons and groups to outline their views on issues relevant to the study.  The consultants are expected to present their findings to the Minister for Public Enterprise by the end of April next. With regard to the proposed Ballymun light rail line, the CIE light rail project team has identified strategic options for the route between the city centre and Ballymun.  Further work to provide additional information on these options is now being carried out.  However, the light rail project team's efforts will be concentrated to the north of the inner city pending completion of the underground study.  The project team hopes to be in a position to initiate the public consultation process in late spring next year when it will be able to take account of the conclusions of the underground study.  Planning and design of the proposed extension of the Dundrum line to Sandyford is well in hand and the public consultation process is under way.</P>
      <P>The light rail project is only one element of the public transport strategy recommended by DTI. Other important work is under way on a number of fronts to improve Dublin's public transportation network.  This includes the Quality Bus Corridor Initiative &mdash; four quality bus corridors for Blanchardstown, north Clondalkin, Finglas and Lucan are in place and early completion of the QBC network is a priority for Bus Átha Cliath, the local authorities and Dublin Transportation Office.  In the suburban rail development programme, a major DART investment programme has commenced including extensions to Greystones and Malahide, the acquisition of new rolling stock and improvement of existing, and development of new stations.  The fruits of this investment can already be seen.  Work on the upgrading of track between Bray and Greystones has commenced and preparatory work in respect of electrification of the lines to Greystones and Malahide is well advanced.  The Minister for Public Enterprise recently opened the new Clontarf Road DART station and detailed plans for an additional DART station at Barrow Street have also been developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of public transport infrastructure must also be matched by the quality of the service to the customer.  Even modest investment in this area can provide very important improvements for public transport users.  Better passenger information is an important priority.  Almost £1 million has been provided in 1997 to replace the obsolete public address system for the DART and Dublin <Col N="471" /> suburban rail network as well as the implementation of the first phase of a state of the art electronic passenger information system.  This system has already been installed at some of the busiest DART stations and will be expanded to other stations in the near future.</P>
    <P>Major road development, on a selective basis, is also critical to managing Dublin transport and contributing to the implementation of DTI.  I want to see rapid progress towards completion of the C-Ring motorway.  I am pleased to note that work on the Southern Cross route will commence next spring and that the motorway scheme and environmental impact statement for the south-eastern motorway have been submitted to my Department.  On this point, the House may be assured that we will deal with the motorway scheme and the EIS as quickly as possible, while fully respecting the need to adhere to the spirit and the letter of the different statutory procedures. In the same way, I am also concerned to advance the planning of the port access tunnel. These major improvements are vital for the improved road capacity which they will bring in themselves and because they will substantially complete the major road network around the city area.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies that we also need shorter term management measures to combat traffic congestion while the delivery of these major new infrastructural projects is awaited.  Measures to control congestion for the next number of years include, as already stated, continuous improvement of the bus service in quantity and quality to make it an attractive alternative to car travel; improvement of traffic management for all modes of travel; and the removal of the impediments to the use of the bicycle as a mode of transport. There is potential to double the number of cyclists with the provision of adequate safe cycle facilities.  This would result in the reduction of car trips in the peak hour by about 6,000.</P>
    <P>Each of these areas is being actively pursued. In addition, a director of traffic has been appointed for Dublin city to bring greater concentration and efficiency to traffic administration and to implement a strong enforcement policy. Operation Freeflow, launched in December 1996, demonstrated what could be done with a co-ordinated approach to traffic management.  I am glad the previous Government took up the suggestions made by myself and Deputy Eoin Ryan in November last and eventually implemented them in December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>A change of travel mode from car to bus, rail, cycling and walking just one day per week would reduce traffic in the peak hour by 20 per cent.  The formation of car pools can reduce the vehicle mileage of the car pool group by up to 80 per cent.  We must continue to raise public awareness and to encourage and support <Col N="473" /> attitude changes so as to reduce dependence on the private car through these different measures.</P>
      <P>A recent European Commission Green Paper observed that &ldquo;increasing transport delays have brought down travel speeds in a number of major European cities to levels which prevailed in the age of horse drawn carts&rdquo;.  There is a consensus that many present transport trends are unsustainable and that new and more integrated approaches are needed to avert the many negative impacts of urban traffic.  The DTI strategy has been designed as an innovative and integrated transport strategy for the Dublin region.  It is being supported by all key public sector agencies, as well as by the local authorities and bodies concerned with the commercial and environmental well-being of the city.</P>
      <P>The task of delivering sustainable transport for Dublin is not an easy one.  Experience elsewhere confirms that urban transport problems are among the most intractable for politicians and administrators to solve.  However, the future quality of life of our citizens demands that we apply ourselves actively to this challenge.  The Government is determined that we succeed in this important task.</P>
      <P>Opposition Deputies said we need a statutory body with powers, such as a transportation authority, which would have its own budget.  Whenever there is a problem, Fine Gael seems to resolve it by setting up another quango or nondemocratic organisation.</P>

      <P>One cause of this problem is the huge increase in car ownership.  The Minister said there were approximately 250 to 357 cars per 1,000 of the population.  Dublin is the shopping, business and administrative centre for up to 1.4 million people. Other causes are a lack of resources and limited local democracy.  I note Fine Gael includes the word &ldquo;resources&rdquo; in its motion.  This city has been systematically starved of resources by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for 75 years.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil is an anti-Dublin party.  In the 1970s a major public transport plan for this city was rubbished by successive Governments, most of which were led by Fianna Fáil. <Col N="475" /> They refused to give Dublin the necessary resources.  When the DART was being built, people sniped and sneered at its cost.  However, it has been hugely successful.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to use the money generated by the Celtic tiger to resolve the traffic problems in Dublin.  Additional resources should be given to the light rail project so that there is a public transport system in every part of the city.</P>
      <P>The second problem is the system of local government which is dominated by bureaucrats. For decades a dead hand was placed on our city by people who were not elected and who, only recently, were given a seven year appointment. They were aided by the mandarins in the Department of the Environment and they prevented the necessary steps being taken to resolve the traffic problems in our city.  It is no wonder our traffic is gridlocked and that we have belatedly appointed the Dublin Transportation Office and a director of traffic.</P>
      <P>Five or six years ago when I joined Dublin City Council, with my colleagues in the Labour Party, including Deputy Quinn, I put forward a proposal for an integrated cycleway network.  This would have required the extension of a few streets. People risk their lives if they want to cycle from Coolock to Rathmines or from Chapelizod to Ringsend.  I also have a bicycle which I use from time to time.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is little opportunity to use it.  During the next local and general elections the Labour Party will propose to free our capital city from the bureaucrats and non-elected people and to make it independent by electing a mayor who will do something about its problems.</P>
      <P>When the Dublin Transportation Initiative was set up, there was insufficient consultation, although it states in its report that it consulted various interests.  People in Raheny, for example, were sent letters asking them to attend a meeting in Coolock about Coolock's problems and vice versa.  However, it refused to consult people on a wider basis.  I agree with the general objectives outlined in the report but we should have a more dynamic approach.  It is incumbent on the Government to look at the fundamental reasons the Dublin Transportation Initiative was set up. I appeal to the Dublin born Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to address these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key elements in the DTI report was the area of land use, particularly the decline of the city centre in the early 1990s.  I am glad some of the initiatives taken over the past four or five years are, at long last, beginning to restore some <Col N="476" /> life to the city centre.  Dublin City Council has a proposal to restore O'Connell Street to some of its former glory and to energise the surrounding districts, particularly on the west side, in the new Harp plan.  It is incumbent on us with the development of the Dublin C-ring, which borders my constituency, to take an integrated planning approach to the development of the city on which a proper modern transport programme could be based.</P>
    <P>When the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, announced a review of the Luas project to examine an underground option I was sympathetic to her approach.  I had asked the previous Minister, Deputy Dukes, and others to consider re-examining the underground option.  Most Dubliners felt the construction programme could have resulted in a nightmare of total gridlock.  I applauded the Minister for having the courage to review the decision.  Some of the concerns which the former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, raised in relation to the capacity of Luas also needed to be investigated. Many Dubliners also feel that the visual appearance of Luas might adversely affect our city.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, given how the review has progressed, I wonder if the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is serious about it or whether she intends to dither to a point when we could lose the EU Structural Funds.  My colleague, Deputy Stagg, is deeply concerned, from his contacts in Europe and elsewhere, that we could be in serious danger of losing the existing tranche of Structural Funds allocated to the light rail project if it is delayed much longer.</P>
    <P>Some people have questioned the extent to which the Minister is reviewing the project, in that she seems to be restricting it to the same routes and examining the underground option in a very narrow context.  As I said, I have some sympathy for her, which she acknowledged a few months ago, but she will have to increase the pace of the review so that we do not lose the entire light rail project, which would be a disaster.</P>
    <P>On the northside of the city the Ballymun and airport line should have been a priority from the start.  The Minister acknowledged that, with Dublin Airport beginning to challenge Manchester Airport as the central air hub of these islands north of London, it is incumbent on us to have a modern rail based transport system.  The Minister should give serious consideration to the Aer Rianta proposal to provide a link to the DART network, which would protect the green belt area in the north of the city.  It would also link Donaghmede in my constituency to the airport at a relatively cheap cost.  The bottom line is that we should proceed with the light rail project as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We have talked about all the U-turns made by this Government.  Before the general election many commercial interests in Dublin, such as the Chamber of Commerce and the City Centre Business Association, met the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and asked him to take urgent action on <Col N="477" /> the light rail project and the whole public transport system.  He, above all people, must be aware of the basic arguments and should be able to bring forward a plan before Christmas whereby we could proceed with the public inquiry early next year and then build the light rail system. That would ensure we do not lose the available funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, referred to quality bus corridors, which are essential for the development of a sensible transport policy for our capital city.  The development of those corridors has been incredibly slow.  The Minister mentioned there are four at present, one of which runs through Coolock in my constituency to Clare Hall on the Malahide Road.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a difference in this regard between the north side of the city and the west and south sides.  For example, there are very few quality bus shelters in areas such as Coolock, despite campaigns by public representatives from all parties, including myself, the local development council and other bodies over the years. Everything we were promised in the DTI report is still a mirage as far as quality bus corridors are concerned on the northside.  We were promised, for example, real time information.  It seems a joke was played on us by some of the bureaucrats who drew up this document.</P>
    <P>I support the bus priority measures.  I compliment my city council on the development of the SCAT system which is expected to be extended to 200 junctions.  It has prevented total gridlock and has kept the main north-south and east-west routes of the city moving over the last four or five years.  The city council must be complimented on proceeding with the development of that system in very straitened financial circumstances.  The EU drive project would also fully use information technology in the control of traffic.</P>
    <P>CIÉ had plans for a central bus depot, which was to be located in the subsequently revitalised Temple Bar district.  However, the basic idea of the plan was a valuable one which should be developed.  In recent years our planners in the city council and others allowed all the bus shelters in the city centre to be removed up until two years ago.  All the famous shelters in which people could wait on rainy days such as today were removed and one now sees bus drivers looking out at bedraggled waiting passengers.  The city council has reversed this somewhat but there still seems to be a view that the appearance of the city in this regard is more important than providing people with some comfort.  I do not see the logic of that.  Why can we not provide decent waiting spaces for bus passengers?</P>
    <P>As I said, the DART system has been a brilliant success.  I am very unhappy, however, with the failure by Iarnród Éireann and CIÉ to provide proper facilities for disabled passengers and parents with children.  This is an old chestnut in Dublin North East where six or seven DART stations are located, almost all of which are absolute torture for such passengers.  Kilbarrack station is currently <Col N="478" /> being rebuilt but still does not seem to have the facilities needed by people who have difficulties in movement.  That area must be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>One of the central traffic problems in the city has been the number of vehicles above the weight of three tonnes which often clog up our streets. Radical proposals have been made with regard to this problem and, until the tunnel is built, with regard to the unloading of ships, which will allow vehicles to exit quickly along the quays on the north or south side.  That tends to be a major problem.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Council and the three county councils have a poor record on the park and ride issue.  Three years ago firm proposals were received on my side of the city in connection with Dublin Corporation, Fingal County Council and the Garda preventing access by heavy vehicles to suburban housing estates.  An agreement was in place up to a number of years ago but, unfortunately, nothing happened.  I understand that the delay lies with Fingal County Council who is fearful it will be left to deal with the consequences of placing park and ride facilities on the edge of the city.  It is regrettable that local government has not proceeded because these facilities would enable members of the public to park their vehicles and travel to the city centre on public transport.</P>
    <P>Our city has been starved of investment.  There have been continuous delays with many of the projects pursued by the county councils over the years.  For example, I understand that a Fianna Fáil Minister promised 25 years ago that the Grange Road, which is to be the extension of the M50 and the N32, would be built.  It is not now expected to be completed until late 1998.  The Coombe relief road has not been built, nor have many of the proposed bridges for the city.</P>
    <P>The roads and streets budget for the city confirms that, in terms of funding, a pittance has been provided, despite the fact that it is the biggest population centre in the country, comprising approximately 48 of the Deputies in this House.  We always appear to get the rough end of the stick and we are fed up with this.  It is a rotten situation for which the two conservative parties have been responsible.</P>
    <P>There at last appears to be broad based agreement on the new port access tunnel from Santry to East Wall.  Some of the residents in northside estates, such as Marino and Santry, are still anxious about the project.  However, the changes made by the city council in consultation with the engineers and the residents are beginning to make it viable.  It needs to be completed as soon as possible.  If a similar project is provided for the southside, the C-Ring will have been completed, which will allow a channel for bringing traffic out of the city.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to traffic management. Progress has been made in recent years under the DTI and the new director of traffic with regard to the establishment of environmental traffic cells <Col N="479" /> to keep out rat running traffic.  My city council is systematically making traffic calming proposals to each of its 12 wards.  The quality and finish of the work in some of the more deprived areas of the northside has been very poor compared with the work in some of the southside estates.  This irritates the public who believes that the same standard should be applied.</P>
    <P>The question of responsibility for Operation Freeflow continues to be vague.  The Minister for the Environment tried to take responsibility, as did Deputy John Bruton.  However, the proposals were made by the Labour Party in Dublin Corporation. Five years ago the party proposed that the corporation take over traffic management for Dublin from the Garda Síochána.  Nothing was done about it until the city manager, John Fitzgerald, decided to implement it.  I commend him on his appointment.  He came from South Dublin County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>He was in Dublin City Council for a long time and has begun to implement some of the key elements of Labour Party policy on traffic management, which is to be welcomed. Motor cycle gardaí are doing a good job in moving traffic, but there is a general lack of responsibility in this area.  For example, there is gridlock on Harcourt Street most weekday evenings for approximately 45 minutes as a huge working population travels home northwards in cars because they consider there is no efficient public transport to many parts of the northside.  Traffic control powers should be returned to enhanced democratic local government bodies who would have responsibility for all aspects of traffic management, including wardens, traffic police, vehicle removal and creating new by-laws to deal with situations, such as the double and treble parking on some city centre streets by two, three and five tonne vehicles.</P>
      <P>A complete overhaul of traffic management is required.  In this regard, I welcome the decision of the corporation to finally and belatedly, at the instigation of councillors, consider the removal of traffic meters and to move towards a more efficient system of road and street pricing.  The new director of traffic, Mr. Keegan, is responsible to the city manager.  He has a huge area of responsibility here.  I expect him to take a much more dynamic role over all aspects of traffic management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been problems with finishing works on traffic calming.  The public is opposed to ramps and there is much opposition to the development of a quality bus corridor on the Malahide Road and the cycleway network on the Clontarf Road. There appears to have been a strong ideology on the part of traffic engineers in favour of traffic flow which has meant them opposing simple measures such as pedestrian crossings.  They <Col N="480" /> should read the relevant points of the final report of the DTI where the rights of pedestrians and cyclists are also critical.</P>
    <P>There has been a long campaign over the past five or six years in response to the demands for a cycleway network.  At long last we have provided a fair number of parking facilities for bicycles. Over the last four to five years we have erected approximately 80 to 100 bicycle parking places. There were only three or four in 1991.  We could have had an integrated cycleway network.  For example, some of the German cities, such as Dusseldorf and Munich, have efficient cycleway networks enabling cyclists to cycle safely throughout the city centre without serious risk.  There is no reason they could not have been introduced to Dublin.  The failure to create them is a consequence of the two fundamental causes of our problems: lack of resources and the lack of dynamic local government.</P>

      <P>The Howth peninsula in my constituency is one of the most wonderful amenities in the city.  William Butler Yates took Maud Gonne to Howth Head for walks during their romantic attachment.  Many other couples, including our fathers and mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers, great grandfathers and great grandmothers, have done likewise during the decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Howlin, directed Fingal County Council, which had been dragging its feet on the issue, to make a special amenity area order for part of the peninsula, the coastal band from Sutton around by Red Rock and the Bailey to East Mountain.  As Members are aware, until 1987 Howth came within the functional area of Dublin Corporation which maintained all the walkways in good condition. <Col N="481" /> Fingal County Council has not shown the same devotion to this task.</P>
    <P>A number of developers have cast a greedy eye on the peninsula.  In Sutton rights of way by Carrickbrack Road near Red Rock which have been used by the public for centuries have been unilaterally blocked off.  As this amenity is important to all Dubliners, not just the 15,000 to 20,000 who live in the immediate vicinity, the Minister should insist on Fingal County Council implementing immediately the special amenity area order. Much of the preparatory work, including the drawing up of maps, has been done by wonderful local groups such as Howth-Sutton 2000 which has led the campaign to save Howth.</P>
    <P>Howth village has been developed as an important tourist centre.  In this context there is a need to preserve the wilderness areas of East Mountain, which is under threat, and West Mountain.  There are however developers who believe the peninsula can be developed in the way Killiney or Cap Ferrat in France have been developed.</P>
    <P>Fingal County Council should carry out its duties and implement immediately the special amenity area order for the peninsula.  Bull Island and its wonderful flora and fauna are the subject of such an order.  Most sensible people believe that Howth peninsula should be preserved forever.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, regrets that he is unable to be present and has asked me to reply on his behalf.</P>
      <P>A planning authority may make a special amenity area order, SAAO, under section 42 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, declaring a specified area to be an area of special amenity by reason of its outstanding beauty, special recreational value or the need for nature conservation.  Such an order may state the planning authority's objectives in relation to the preservation or enhancement of the character or special features of the area, including objectives for the prevention or limitation of development in the area.  The making of an SAAO is a reserved function.</P>
      <P>When a planning authority makes an SAAO it must publish in a newspaper circulating in its area its decision to make the order, indicating the area to which the order relates, where the order may be viewed with any relevant maps and specifying the period, not less than one month, during which objections may be made against the making of the order.</P>
      <P>All SAAOs require confirmation by the Minister. Every confirmation order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House within 21 sitting days the order shall be annulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> The Minister may direct a planning authority to make an SAAO for a particular area within its functional area.  The Minister's direction may specify objectives to be included by the planning authority in the SAAO.</P>
    <P>There are two areas in respect of which SAAOs have been made, a section of the Liffey Valley between Lucan and Leixlip and the north Bull Island in Dublin Bay.  Fingal County Council was directed on 3 October 1996 by the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, to make an SAAO for part of Howth peninsula.  It is a matter for Fingal County Council to draw up the order and in so doing it may include additional areas if it considers that they warrant the protection of an SAAO by reason of their outstanding natural beauty or special recreational value.  I understand work is progressing on the preparation of the SAAO and that a draft of the order will be completed before the end of April 1998.  Given that, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the SAAO will be submitted in due course for confirmation by the Minister it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on it.</P>
    <P>The existing law in relation to special amenity area orders seems to be fair and balanced.  While there are no plans to change it, any suggestions put forward for change can be considered within the context of the review of planning law which the Minister has initiated.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Ba mhaith liomsa mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a phlé.</P>
      <P>This is a serious matter for many parents and teenagers.  I tabled a parliamentary question on 15 October to which I received a long reply in which the Minister outlined the current position but failed to mention his plans, as I had asked him to do.  I am sure in his absence his deputy, able though he is, will do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the cost of abolishing the assessment of the benefit of board and lodging for unemployment assistance purposes is estimated to be in the region of £20 million in a full year.  It is unacceptable to give that kind of figure in reply to a parliamentary question.  I have no doubt the Minister will not cite a counter-balancing cost in replying this evening.  What is the cost to the State of 18-year olds going into flats, receiving full unemployment assistance, who may or may not receive anything up to £40 weekly by way of rent subsidy?  Will the Minister communicate with me, through his officials, on that estimated cost to the State?  There is no point in quoting a figure of £20 million as the cost of abolishing the board and lodgings allowance if full account is not taken of its counter balancing costs already.  If a sum of £40 a week was given to everybody claiming unemployment assistance, ensuring they remained at home, guaranteeing <Col N="483" /> the continuance of family values while avoiding the many undesirable consequences of young people living alone in flats &mdash; it could well prove to be a net asset to the State.</P>
    <P>Since we allow people of 18 years of age to marry, to drive cars, encourage them to vote &mdash; although it is not really opportune to refer to this in the wake of the recent presidential election when much dissatisfaction was expressed about Thursday having been polling day &mdash; when it comes to student employment schemes is it not wrong that their parents, who may be barely above the eligible income limit for third-level grants, are further discriminated against.  It is these people we should look after.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will express some concrete plan in replying rather than merely retail what happens at present and what its abolition would cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the unavoidable absence of my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  I am sure Deputy Browne will accept me as a suitable replacement on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Unemployment assistance is a means-tested payment to unemployed people between the ages of 18 and 66 not entitled to insurance-based unemployment benefit.  Payments are means-tested to ensure the limited resources available are directed at those most in need.  In assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have together with the value of any capital or property.  In addition, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant, such as that of board and lodging in the family home, is assessed.</P>
      <P>The students' summer jobs scheme provides income support for less well off third-level students unable to obtain work during the summer months who are disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance.  Entitlement to the scheme is dependent on students satisfying a means test similar to that applicable in the case of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The assessment of free board and lodging has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception and has survived all changes of Government, including the three year tenure in office by a centre left Government.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity between applicants in different family circumstances, for example, between applicants whose parents are employed and those dependent on social welfare payments.  Otherwise, people living in affluent circumstances would become entitled to the same level of assistance as those with limited means or none at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing the benefit of board and lodging, account is taken of the combined amount of parental income, less tax, PRSI, superannuation and the cost of housing, the first £95 or £105 being <Col N="484" /> disregarded dependent on whether the household is a one or two parent family respectively.  Any social welfare payments the parents may be receiving are also disregarded, the balance being divided equally among the non-earning members of the household, including both parents. However, the maximum assessment for any claimant is limited to 17 per cent of total parental income.</P>
    <P>A number of improvements have been effected over recent years in the assessment of the benefit of board and lodging.  For instance, in 1991 provision was made for the introduction of a minimum weekly payment of £5 for claimants whose only means were assessed from board and lodging, which minimum payment has been progressively increased to £25 weekly.  It should also be noted that, where the combined net parental income does not exceed £19,698 per annum, a claimant is entitled to at least the minimum £25 weekly payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Browne has said already, according to the figures available to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the cost of abolishing the assessment of the benefit of board and lodging for unemployment assistance purposes is estimated at a net figure of £20 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I will pass on the Deputy's request to the Minister. I will also ask him to furnish the estimated saving involved through more young people remaining at home not being paid the full rate of unemployment assistance or a subsidy for renting apartments.  Frankly, that is probably impossible to estimate since it would be based on an estimate of how many young people would remain at home.  Indeed it is probably in the realm of fantasy.</P>
    <P>The question of implementing any further improvements in the board and lodging allowance will have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of existing priorities and available resources.</P>

      <P>The findings of the ASTI survey are very disturbing, showing that more than one in eight schools has had the tragic experience of having one of its pupils commit suicide.  It also shows that children are at risk and have committed suicide at extraordinarily young ages, onequarter having been aged 14 and under, long before the pressures of the examination system <Col N="485" /> could have played a part.  It further underlines the types of pressures there are on young people today and the need for an adequate response, both in the provision of pastoral care and psychological services to address this problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education should follow up the findings of this ASTI survey with more indepth research to ascertain the lessons to be learned from these sad experiences.  He will see from this survey that it does not go into the background of any of the cases in question.  If we are beginning to see the growth of suicide among young people in our schools it behoves him to engage in serious research on its causes and ascertain any lessons to be learned therefrom.</P>
      <P>The teachers in this survey mention substance abuse, sexual abuse and bullying as some of the possible factors underlying emotional distress.  I know this is an extremely complex area but there may well be lessons to be learned on the adequacy of existing life-skill programmes in our schools.  For example, are such programmes being designated adequate time within the overall curriculum? Within the second-level curriculum I understand there is as yet no obligation on schools to provide such programmes at all.  Is the style of such programmes as exists getting through to pupils in images they can appreciate?</P>
      <P>This survey also reveals clear deficiencies in schools' capacity to mount effective preventive strategies.  They have difficulty in resourcing pastoral care to the level they would like.  Indeed the Minister will note statements emanating from the ASTI indicating that it is extremely difficult to obtain professional help, for example, psychological services, for which there are long waiting periods. Equally, the pressure of teaching on the pastoral care team renders it difficult for them to resource the type of requisite service to provide support for young people in emotional distress.</P>
      <P>It is also clear there is no coherent response programme to help schools cope properly with the trauma to pupils, teachers and parents alike after such tragic occurrences.  Indeed the ASTI is to be commended on developing guidelines for schools.  There is an urgent need, however, for the Minister for Education and Science to develop and resource a proper strategy for dealing with this problem at both the preventative and response stages.  The current resources for pastoral care and psychological support in the schools need to be greatly supplemented if this problem is to be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton and the House for allowing me to make a brief intervention. The problem of suicide among young people has been growing over the past 20 years. The current position is that more young men die as a result of suicide than in road traffic accidents. The ASTI report is one of a number of reports presented to the National Task Force on Suicide. The deliberations of the task force were completed in April of this year and I urge the Minister for Health and Children to immediately <Col N="486" /> release the report to allow public debate on its findings.  It is important that we examine and implement the report's recommendations because there is an urgent need for intervention in this area.  The establishment of suitable prevention programmes, which have been successful in other countries and can be adapted to Irish society, is essential.  I urge the Minister to ensure the early publication of the report of the task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for raising this serious issue for debate.  Earlier today my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and I welcomed the publication of the survey of school principals conducted by the ASTI on the incidence of suicide in schools.  The sudden death of any school pupil is a cause of deep sadness to myself and to the officials in my Department.  For some time now, we have been surveying the research available on suicide and examining the implications for the educational system.</P>
      <P>Recent Irish research, conducted by Dr. Michael Kelleher in 1996, has shown that suicide is now the second most common cause of death, after road traffic accidents, among Irish males between the ages of 15 and 24.  It should be emphasised, however, that while suicide has increased markedly, particularly among males, it is still, statistically, a rare event.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children has established a National Task Force on Suicide, to which Deputy Neville made reference, and a National Suicide Research Bureau which will continue to monitor research findings.  My Department has co-operated with both of these bodies.  I understand that the report of the task force is at an advanced stage of preparation and will shortly be published.  I will communicate Deputy Neville's request that it should be published immediately on its completion.  My Department will closely examine the implications of its recommendations.</P>
      <P>Current available research indicates that one of the major causes of suicide is illness, particularly depressive illness, with socio-economic factors also contributing.  The psychiatric services provided by the health boards, and by voluntary agencies under their aegis, have the main responsibility for counselling people at risk of suicide, their families and the families of those who, tragically, have committed suicide. However, the ASTI survey, which I welcome, has provided helpful additional information regarding the pain and stress caused by the suicide of one student to all those in the school concerned, whether students or teachers.</P>
      <P>If schools are to respond effectively to distressing events such as suicide, it is necessary that they should be places in which it is possible for those affected to express their feelings and emotions and to be supported in doing so.  I believe my Department has a significant role to play in supporting schools in matters of suicide prevention and post-traumatic intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> In the aftermath of a traumatic event, such as a suicide in a school, support may be provided by the pastoral care system, the guidance counselling service in the school and the psychological service of the Department of Education and Science.  I am concerned that as much advice and support as possible should be available from my Department for schools which have suffered any traumatic event such as suicide.</P>
    <P>Programmes of in-career development in bereavement counselling for teachers and guidance counsellors are supported by my Department as requested.  There is a standing joint committee of my Department and of the National Centre for Guidance in Education to monitor provision of guidance.  The psychological service of my Department has procedures in place in relation to incidents of suicide.  Concern about students who are considered to be at risk of suicide should be notified to the psychological service which will then liaise with its colleagues in the clinical services.  If, tragically, a student should die, the relevant area psychologist is available to meet teaching staff and students and to offer advice to management on appropriate responses by the school.  This support is available immediately and is provided in liaison with the local health board.</P>
    <P>I realise that the psychologists working in schools have a heavy case load.  For this and other reasons we announced earlier this year our intention to establish a national educational psychological service.  The planning group for this service, which is representative of all the partners in education, has begun its work.  The aim is to ensure that, eventually, psychological services will be readily available to all young people in schools as well as to those who have dropped out of school early.  The terms of reference of the planning group include an examination of the links between educational and health services which will be necessary to ensure comprehensive psychological services.  This development will facilitate support for schools which are trying to respond to traumatic events such as suicide.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the role that the educational system has in the prevention of suicide. The available evidence seems to indicate that specific &ldquo;anti-suicide&rdquo; programmes can be counter-productive. However, surveys cited by Dr. Michael Kelleher show that the education system can help to resolve some of the real problems <Col N="488" /> encountered by those who eventually, and unfortunately, commit suicide.  The provision, accessibility and quality of formal education is a key element in providing the kind of environment necessary to reduce significantly the incidence of suicidal behaviour.  Those most likely to become early school leavers seem to be particularly at risk.  They should be identified early and efforts made to keep them in school for as long as is feasible.  This is already central to my Department's policy.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the fact that male students seem to be particularly at risk may be explained by a reluctance to express their feelings and to seek counselling.  It is my Department's policy that boys' schooling should be broadened, where necessary, to encompass emotional as well as intellectual development.  Relevant programmes are being promoted in the context of the implementation of the Department's policy on gender equity.</P>
    <P>Surveys of effective suicide prevention programmes in other countries show that the same principles have been used as those which apply in accident prevention programmes.  One of these principles highlights the need to help young people to alter behaviour that puts them at risk. My Department's substance misuse prevention programme also emphasises the development of self-esteem which can be a crucial factor in the prevention of suicide.  These programmes are to be incorporated in the social, personal and health education curricula and syllabi being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for both primary and post-primary schools.  We will give careful consideration to ways in which these social, personal and health education programmes will be introduced so that every school can have, as a key objective, the promotion of good mental health.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that, at my instigation, the Department of Education and Science recently provided the funding for a survey, in conjunction with the National Youth Council of Ireland, to assess the attitudes of our young people across a broad range of social issues.  I firmly believe that this survey when complete will provide invaluable information to further inform my Department's policies in relation to the problems and issues facing our young people as instanced by the young people themselves.</P>

      <P>The Government views the current impasse in the Middle Eastern Peace Process with great concern. The decision of the Israeli Government to extend settlements in East Jerusalem last February, combined with the failure to adhere to previously agreed redeployment deadlines, has considerably eroded the confidence that is essential to maintain momentum in the process.  The carrying out in July and September of two terrorist attacks with severe loss of life &mdash; which the Irish Government has unreservedly condemned &mdash; and the subsequent punitive measure carried out by the Israeli Government have also contributed to the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has actively supported efforts to achieve necessary reforms within the United Nations system so that it can more effectively face the complex and difficult challenges in the coming millennium. In particular we believe that reform and revitalisation is required to ensure a more effective realisation by the organisation of the major objectives of the UN Charter, namely to secure international peace and security and to promote the economic and social development of all member states.</P>
      <P>Since taking up office in January 1997, the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has shown a strong commitment to reform and reorganisation within the UN system.  In July 1997 he presented a detailed report to the General Assembly on possible reform measures to strengthen and renew the UN effort.  This report is currently under discussion at the 52nd Session of the General Assembly in New York.</P>
      <P>Most of the measures proposed by the Secretary-General conform to our own ideas on reforms required within the UN Organisation. For example Ireland had earlier proposed that the UN peacekeeping role be reviewed in the light of recent experience and measures taken to strengthen it.  We welcome the fact that the Secretary-General intends to improve the capacity of the UN for early deployment and rapid reaction by its peacekeeping missions to crises which threaten international peace.</P>
      <P>Within the reform debate at the United Nations, under the recent Irish Presidency, the EU elaborated a substantial set of proposals aimed at revitalising the activities and function of the UN in the area of economic and social development, with particular emphasis on the needs of poorer developing countries.  I am pleased to note that many of these proposals were endorsed by the UN Secretary-General.</P>
      <P>In view of this, Ireland gave full political endorsement to the Secretary-General's reform report in its statement in the General Debate at the UN General Assembly in September.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy indicates in his question, the reform of the Security Council is another issue that requires to be addressed.  The Government fully supports the view that the composition of the Security Council needs to be enlarged to take account of the wider membership of the United Nations which comprises 185 member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have proposed, in negotiations on this question, that a small increase in both permanent and non-permanent members should be agreed, taking into account both the need for greater representivity and the potential economic and political contribution of member states.  We believe that any enlargement of the Security Council should ensure that it is effective in its decision <Col N="491" /> making and more representative of the general membership.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 57 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The common foreign and security policy of the European Union (CFSP) is based on Title V of the Maastricht Treaty.  The objectives of the policy as defined in the Treaty are:</P>
      <P>&mdash; to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests, and independence of the Union;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to strengthen the security of the Union and its member states in all ways;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to preserve peace and strengthen international security, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter as well as the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and the objectives of the Paris Charter;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to promote international co-operation;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> I do not propose here to address specific foreign policy issues which have been discussed in the framework of the CFSP since they will have been the subject of statements already made in this House, but I would point out that all the member states of the European Union have agreed to the objectives which I have stated.  All share a common interest in ensuring that in responding to international developments the Union is able to act in a timely, coherent, and effective manner.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty provided that the Common Foreign and Security Policy provisions would be reviewed at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  As a result of this review, the Amsterdam Treaty which was signed on 2 October this year incorporates certain changes in the CFSP.  I outlined these changes in some detail in my statement to the Dáil on 16 October on the Amsterdam Treaty.  I said then &ldquo;. the years since the Maastricht Treaty have demonstrated that while the threat of East/West and global conflict has drastically receded, new challenges have emerged in international affairs &mdash; as intractable and complex conflicts in the Balkans and Africa have demonstrated.  In consequence the essential aim of the review undertaken by the Intergovernmental Conference was to create a more coherent and visible foreign policy which would:</P>
    <P>&mdash; reflect the importance of the EU on the international stage and maximize its contribution to international peace and security;</P>
    <P>&mdash; respond to the concern of its citizens that the EU could and should be making a greater contribution in this regard, commensurate with its very considerable economic capacity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The principles which I have just outlined will continue to apply and will guide the future development of the CFSP.</P>

      <P>One of the services which the Department of Foreign Affairs provides is information and advice to people planning to travel to other countries and to people in the travel business about possible threats to safety or health.  The most common reasons people are advised to take special care or not to travel to particular countries or regions are political or civil unrest, natural disasters and disease epidemics.  The main sources of the Department's information about developments in other countries are Irish Embassies and Consulates.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 37, 43, 44, 48, 49 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I record my deep sense of shock at the reports of the tragic events involving the massacres of innocent civilians, particularly women and children, over the recent months in Algeria.  I am also particularly concerned at the recent media disclosures of torture and murder of detainees by Algerian Government agents in clear violation of the fundamental freedom and human rights of <Col N="494" /> these victims.  I have also noted the reports about procedural irregularities in the recent elections.</P>
    <P>Despite the assertions by the Algerian Government that what is happening in their country is its concern and not that of the international community, we cannot accept that view.  It is incumbent on all members of the international community, whether in the UN or in other fora to make known their concerns on human rights issues.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, these events are part of an ongoing civil war in that country.  Ireland, with our European Union partners, has been monitoring the situation very closely.  Following the General Affairs Council of 15 September a declaration was issued which expressed concern at the massacres and the hope that the local elections which took place last week would initiate a process to overcome the instability and internal strife.  The Foreign Ministers of the European Union returned to this issue at subsequent meetings and have authorised the Presidency to convey our concerns to the Algerian Foreign Minister who will be visiting Luxembourg in the near future.  With my colleagues in the Foreign Affairs Council we are at the disposal of the protagonists should they wish us to facilitate a political solution to this crisis.</P>
    <P>I confirm our continuing solidarity with the Algerian people in this dark hour of their history. I condemn outright all forms of terrorism, whatever the source, and I strongly encourage the Algerian Government to pursue political dialogue with all the democratic forces in that country in as inclusive a framework as possible.  I also emphasise most strongly the great importance that I attach to the issue of fundamental freedoms and human rights in this context.</P>
    <P>I have conveyed my concerns to the Algerian authorities, and I am actively considering what further action the Government can take to help bring about a cessation of violence in Algeria.</P>

      <P>Ireland, with partners in the European Union, welcomes Slovakia's aspiration to Union membership, and is concerned that every effort continues to be made to assist it to achieve that goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Commission's enlargement proposals, which are currently under active consideration, a reinformed accession strategy would be put in place to enable all the applicant countries to meet eventually the criteria for membership. It is envisaged that this strategy would operate through individually tailored accession partnerships. These would be drawn up by the Commission in co-operation with each applicant state. <Col N="495" /> They would target for priority action, according to an agreed timetable, those areas identified in the Commission's opinions as requiring attention and would mobilise, within one framework, all the resources available to the Community for assisting the applicants to prepare for accession. In the case of Slovakia, the accession partnership could help provide focused and concentrated support towards the further integration of its democratic institutions to the political life of the country.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomes the Commission's proposals. A final decision on these matters will be taken by the Union at the European Council in Luxembourg in December.  Ireland's approach on that occasion will be based on the concern to ensure that the enlargement of the Union is managed as an inclusive process and that effective arrangements are put in place to provide concrete assistance where it is most needed in each of the applicant countries to help them to meet the Copenhagen criteria for Union membership.</P>

      <P>On 30 October 1997, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mo Mowlam, published the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill. This Bill will have the effect of extending the life of the Emergency Provisions Act for two years beyond its current expiry date in August next year.  The Bill also proposes removing the internment provisions of the EPA, and will provide for the audio recording of interrogations of persons suspected of terrorist offences.  It will also amend the schedule of offences attached to the Act to increase the number of offences which may be &ldquo;certified out&rdquo; from trial in the Diplock Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also on 30 October, the Home Secretary announced the British Government's intention to present new proposals to replace both the Emergency Provisions Act and the Prevention of Terrorism Act with permanent United Kingdomwide counter-terrorism legislation.  A joint Home Office-Northern Ireland Office consultation paper containing these proposals will be published early in the new year.  I welcome the proposed formal abolition of internment, which will have an important symbolic value to the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  I also welcome the proposals for the audio recording of <Col N="497" /> interrogations and for amending the schedule of the EPA.  These are steps which have been advocated by successive Irish Governments, and they will serve to build confidence and underpin the peace process.  I also welcome the ending of exclusion orders under the PTA by the British Home Secretary.</P>
    <P>I regret it is proposed to extend the EPA for a further two years from next August.  In the context of the consultation paper to which I referred and within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, the Government will continue to make known our concerns about the operation of both the PTA and EPA to the British authorities.  We continue to favour the earliest possible dismantling of such emergency provisions.</P>
    <P>In regard to reform of the RUC, I understand that a draft Bill on policing is currently being finalised.  As the British authorities have made clear, it will however focus primarily on changes to the tripartite management structure of policing, that is the relationship between the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the Police Authority for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The fundamental issues relating to the lack of Nationalist confidence in the RUC remain to be addressed in the context of the current talks process. A future police service in Northern Ireland must reflect the community it serves both in its composition and ethos.  In particular, it must accord equal esteem to the Nationalist and Unionist identities.  The Government will pursue these objectives within the talks in dialogue with the British Government and the parties.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of Schedule 5 of the British Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, which relates to Port and Border Control, passengers arriving in or leaving Britain or Northern Ireland can be required to complete a landing or an embarkation card for an examining officer.  This provision applies only to travel within the common travel area and accordingly affects principally persons, of any nationality, travelling between Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government has frequently expressed its concerns regarding the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  We are particularly concerned at those provisions of the PTA, including that relating to disembarkation cards, whose application appears to target the Irish community in Britain or persons travelling between the two islands.  We have urged the British authorities to ensure that these provisions do not impact in a general and undiscriminating manner on the Irish community and Irish or other people travelling between these islands.  Complaints brought to our notice concerning instances of the use of these powers are also raised with the British authorities through the Embassy in London.</P>
      <P>Last week, the British Home Secretary announced that proposals to replace the PTA and EPA with permanent UK wide counter-terrorism legislation will be presented early next year.  I understand that the question of disembarkation cards will be examined as part of the review of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to raise at all appropriate opportunities the concerns which the Deputy and others have expressed in relation to this aspect of the Prevention of Terrorism Act with a view to bringing to an end a practice that has a disproportionate impact of Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>I do not have any plans to raise this matter in the General Affairs Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for co-operation in areas of public order, including combating football hooliganism, rests with Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs.  At EU level these matters are dealt with by the Council in its Justice and Home Affairs formation.  For example, on 9 June 1997 the Council adopted a resolution on preventing and restraining football hooliganism through the exchange of experience, exclusion from stadiums and media policy.  Consideration of the utility of <Col N="499" /> particular measures such as that suggested by the Deputy should be part of an evaluation of how best to address different aspects of the problem as a whole.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Schengen Agreement and the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK mean that passports and other documents are no longer required for travel between many EU countries.  Denying travel documents to particular individuals would therefore not appear to be an effective means of controlling their movements.</P>
    <P>I am advised that, except in the case of a passport obtained fraudulently, I do not have the power to withdraw Irish passports when they are issued; only in rare circumstances may I refuse passport facilities to an Irish citizen.  As matters stand at present I am, therefore, not in a position to prevent an Irish football supporter from travelling to an international match abroad by denying him or her a passport.  It would not be appropriate for me to take the kind of initiative in the General Affairs Council suggested by the Deputy unless I was in a position to put it into practice.</P>

The objective of this process of continuous re-evaluation of our approach is to ensure that Irish Aid continues to respond well to the changing circumstances of developing countries.</P>
      <P>The resources available for Official Development Assistance (ODA) have increased significantly in recent years.  Between 1992 and this year, the budget has increased from £40 million to £122 million - a three-fold increase.  Expressed as a percentage of GNP, the growth has been from 0.16 per cent to 0.31 per cent.  Relative to other donors, the Irish performance as a percentage of GNP has increased from less than half the average of all donors in 1992 to a position of now exceeding the donor average.  The Government is committed to maintaining a rapid rate of growth of ODA with a view to reaching 0.45 per cent of GNP by the year 2002, as an interim step on the way to reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as soon as possible therafter.</P>
      <P>Apart from the obvious consequence of permitting the ODA programme to increase in size, the budgetary expansion has facilitated qualitative change and improvement in our approach. As was indicated in some detail in the Department's Strategic Management Statement, <i>Pursuing Ireland's External Interests,</i> the underlying strategy has been to recognise that the purpose of external assistance is to support local development processes within developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practical terms, this means that donors, including Ireland, are increasingly expected to combine their efforts in support of coherent development programmes targeted on overall economic and social sectors.  Assistance is provided for measures to support the quality of life <Col N="501" /> and productivity of poor people, for example through the provision of basic education, primary health care and clean drinking water.  The methods employed are kept as basic as possible, in line with locally available expertise and resources.  The work is done by local people and institutions with support from donor countries.</P>
    <P>The new approach outlined above is in contrast to an earlier one which involved donors concentrating resources on individual projects.  That approach often produced apparently impressive results when projects were viewed in isolation but it sometimes happened that the individual projects did not add up to a coherent overall programme. In addition, developing countries often did not have the financial or administrative resources to maintain projects that had been set up by donors on a &ldquo;no expense spared&rdquo; basis.</P>
    <P>Irish Aid is playing a leading role in these efforts to reorientate international aid with a view to making it more effective, especially in the priority countries for our bilateral assistance.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed both to continuing to expand the ODA programme and to searching continuously for qualitative improvements in our operational approach, on the basis just indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my public statement in response to the publication of the Bill, it represents a significant development in that it provides for the implementation of the recommendations of the North Review.  I welcomed in particular the fact that sporting events have been clearly excluded from the proposed extension of the Commission's remit to consider other expression of cultural identity.</P>
      <P>The Bill is now open for public debate and I am sure that it will generate a variety of views and proposals.  As the Deputy is aware, successive Governments have put forward views and proposals on the parades issues to the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  The views of the Government at the time were also made known directly to the Independent Review of Parades and Marches when it carried out its consultation exercise, the report of which forms the basis for the Parades Bill.  Both Governments remain in ongoing consultation on this issue through the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of aspects of the Bill about which we continue to convey our views and proposals to the British authorities.  The exemption of sporting events from the extension of the Commission's <Col N="502" /> remit to cover &ldquo;other expressions of cultural identity&rdquo; was critically important. However, the Government remains to be convinced about the need for this general extension. It has given rise to widespread concerns within the Nationalist community.  The North report presented a clear and focused attempt to strike a balance between the rights of those who wish to march and the rights of the community through which they seek to march.  That focus and that balance should be maintained as the essenital purpose of the Parades Commission.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, we welcome the moves to establish on a statutory basis the Parades Commission with determining powers.  Our views and proposals are intended to offer constructive comments on how best the operation of the commission can encourage the confidence of both communities in the fairness and impartiality of its operations.</P>
    <P>No matter how exemplary its behaviour and judgments, the success of the Parades Commission in helping to resolve the parades issue will depend on the actions and intentions of those most directly involved in contentious parades and on the determination of the authorities to uphold the rule of law.</P>
    <P>With goodwill and a commitment to reaching an agreed accommodation on contentious parades, Northern Ireland can be spared further repetitions of the trauma that has accompanied the marching season in recent years.  Of overriding importance is the need to ensure the rule of law is seen at all times to prevail.  The Government believes that avoiding another contentious marching season can best be done through local dialogue and agreement, based on mutual respect and the mutual accommodation of the respective rights and heritage of both traditions.  I hope that the Parades Commission can make a real and meaningful contribution to that end.</P>

      <P>My Department has not been in contact with the United States authorities on the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Cassini spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral on 15 October on a six-seven year interplanetary journey to Saturn to conduct a four-year study of that planet.  Public protests in the United States preceded the launch because of the use of plutonium to power the mission.  There were fears that either an accident at the launch or an inadvertent re-entry of the spacecraft to the earth's orbit might release plutonium with incalculable <Col N="503" /> consequences for human health and the environment. In view of the importance which Ireland attaches to nuclear safety issues, as set out most recently in the statement made by my predecessor to the 52nd session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, these worries were well understood in this country also.</P>
    <P>I understand that the US authorities, specifically NASA, sought to address these fears by providing information to the public.  This material addressed, <i>inter alia,</i> the technical reasons plutonium fuel rather than solar energy was required to power the Cassini mission and the basis for NASA's confidence that neither an accident at launch nor the inadvertent re-entry of the spacecraft to the earth's orbit would occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 52, 89, and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the lack of human rights in East Timor.  This concern was expressed by my predecessor in his address to the 52nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September.  Furthermore, earlier this year, at the meeting in Geneva of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Ireland cosponsored the resolution which was passed on <Col N="504" /> the &ldquo;Situation on Human Rights in East Timor&rdquo; and which, <i>inter alia</i>, calls upon the Government of Indonesia to take the necessary measures to ensure full respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of East Timor.</P>
    <P>As the House will know, the policy of the Irish Government in relation to East Timor is based in the EU Common Position on East Timor which was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 25 June 1996.  In accordance with the Common Position, Ireland actively supports international efforts both to promote respect for human rights, and to bring a just and peaceful solution to the East Timor question which fully respects the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people.</P>
    <P>In this context, Ireland has welcomed the appointment by the United Nations Secretary General of Mr. Jamsheed Marker as his Special Envoy on East Timor and stands ready to support any initiative taken by the Secretary-General on East Timor which may be considered as feasible and appropriate.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of a UN presence, we have actively supported the establishment of a branch of the UN Human Rights Committee in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.  However, the agreement of the Indonesian Government for the establishment of such an office has not been forthcoming.  It is clear, too, that the Indonesian Government is also opposed to the establishment of any UN office in East Timor.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to ensure the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into law following the decision of the British Government to do so in view of the fact that this decision will make Ireland the only EU member of the Council of Europe not to incorporate the convention into domestic law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18104/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government attaches great importance to Ireland's adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights.  In Ireland the rights guaranteed under the convention are either expressly protected by the fundamental rights provisions of the Constitution, as strengthened by the Courts' interpretation of the doctrine of unenumerated personal rights, or are to be found in other provisions of domestic legislation.</P>
      <P>The question of incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law has been looked at on a number of occasions. This issue was most recently examined by the Constitution Review Group in its report of May 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group did not favour the direct incorporation of the convention; it instead considered that it would be preferable to draw on the <Col N="505" /> convention, and other international human rights conventions, to build on and improve the existing fundamental rights provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>While there are no plans at present to incorporate the European Convention into domestic law, the Government will keep the matter under active review, in the light of the prevailing circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>After some 15 months of discussion over procedural matters and decommissioning substantive political negotiations were launched in Belfast on 24 September.  The negotiations take place within three separate strands: Strand 1 covers relationships within Northern Ireland, Strand 2 relationships within the island of Ireland, and Strand 3 relationships between the British and Irish Governments.  All three strands are to proceed in parallel.  The scheduling of meetings and procedural matters are dealt with by a Business Committee.</P>
      <P>At the same time as launching the substantive three-stranded negotiations, an Independent International Commission on the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons was established. A sub-committee of plenary was also established to liaise with the body, with a separate sub-committee to consider confidence-building measures.</P>
      <P>While the participants are required by the rules of procedure to treat the detail of the negotiations as a matter of confidence, I can outline the following broad development to date.</P>
      <P>The participants agreed to begin substantive negotiations with an initial consideration of each item on the agendas for Strands 1 and 2.  This initial round of discussions is due to be completed by mid-November.</P>
      <P>Strand One negotiations involve the British Government and the Northern Ireland political parties under the chairmanship of the British Government.  The Irish Government is not a participant in Strand One.  To date the participants have discussed principles and requirements, constitutional issues and new institutions.</P>
      <P>Negotiations in Strand Two involve the two Governments and the Northern Ireland political parties and are chaired by Senator Mitchell, assisted by former Finnish Prime Minister, Harri Holkeri, and retired Canadian General, John de Chastelain.  To date, the participants have discussed principles and requirements, constitutional issues and new institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strand Three negotiations involve the two Governments who are required to hold liaison meetings with the parties.  The two Governments circulated a joint consultation paper to the political <Col N="506" /> parties and have invited the parties to put forward their views on this.</P>
    <P>The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning is chaired by General de Chastelain and includes also a Finnish member, Brigadier Tauno Nieminen, and an American, Donald Johnson.  It operates from offices in Dublin and Belfast.  The Commission has presented an interim draft report to the two Governments on possible schemes for decommissioning and will be briefing the political parties on the progress in their work over the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>The Sub-Committee on Decommissioning is likely to meet later this month to consider the interim report of the Independent Commission. The Sub-Committee on Confidence-Building Measures is also likely to meet again soon to consider its confidence-building measures agenda.</P>
    <P>A plenary meeting to review progress across the three strands is likely to be held in early December.</P>

      <P>To date, the EU and its members states have signed Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with Tunisia, Israel and Morocco.  These were signed in July 1995, November 1995 and February 1996 respectively.  An Interim Association Agreement between the European Community and the Palestinian Authority was signed in December 1996.  Major progress was made recently in negotiations with Jordan.  Previous difficulties regarding the possible adjustment of tariff quotas for certain agricultural produce have been resolved and negotiations on the agreement are now complete.</P>
      <P>Negotiations with Egypt are ongoing.  Technical discussions take place on a regular basis and I hope that negotiations can be brought to a successful conclusion at the earliest possible date. Negotiations with Lebanon are continuing smoothly and are now close to conclusion.  A negotiating mandate for an agreement with Algeria was approved by Council in June 1996 and the draft text of an agreement was circulated in May 1997.  Discussions will continue on the basis of this draft, although the current situation in Algeria has made progress somewhat limited. Exploratory talks between the EU and Syria have taken place on the subject of an eventual agreement. It is expected that a negotiating mandate will be finalised with the Commission by the end of this year.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> Ireland supports the conclusion of the Euro-Mediterranean agreements with each of the partners concerned in the interests of economic relations generally and in the wider context of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and the Middle East Peace Process.  We will continue to monitor the situation &mdash; in consultation with our EU partners - with this in view.  We are also conscious of the need to make progress in the completion of bilateral agreements with the Mediterranean partners with a view to the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area by 2010, as foreseen in the Barcelona Declaration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The opening of accession negotiations with the new democracies in central and eastern Europe, with Cyprus, will mark a new and decisive phase in the historic project of creating a United <Col N="509" /> Europe, united on the basis of shared democratic principles, respect for minorities and for human rights, and with economic opportunity and social justice for all.  Ireland is committed to enlargement, on the basis shared by all our partners, that it is an historic opportunity for peace, stability and prosperity in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Luxembourg European Council will take a series of key decisions with regard to the management of the enlargement process, including the applicants with which the EU should open accession negotiations; practical arrangements for the initial phase of negotiations and the reinforcement of the Union's pre-accession strategy.  We believe that the arrangements for the management of the enlargement process should entail equality of treatment between the applicants in accordance with the criteria laid down by the Copenhagen European Council, should aim to sustain the inclusive, evolving and dynamic nature of the process and maintain the momentum towards accession on the part of all applicants.</P>
      <P>With regard to the timeframe for the enlargement process, we envisage that accession negotiations will, in accordance with the conclusions of the Amsterdam European Council, open as soon as possible after December 1997.  We share the Commission's general approach that negotiations should be conducted with each applicant on its own merits.  We would envisage, therefore, that in the case of each applicant for EU membership, the pace and date of conclusion of negotiations will be governed by the progress achieved by each candidate in adopting the <i>acquis communitaire.</i></P>
      <P>It is essential in the enlargement process to preserve what the Union has achieved thus far including the very features which have made it so attractive to applicant countries.  This includes the Union's structural and cohesion policies.  Ireland is, therefore, among the member states which insist that the future finanical framework of the Union must continue to provide for adequate structural and cohesion funding for the less developed member states and regions within the existing Union.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Commission's Agency 2000 proposals, a budgetary framework for the period 2000 to 2006 is being negotiated.  The challenge which Ireland faces during that period in relation to structural and cohesion funding derives principally from the movement of our economic performance towards the Community average rather than from the prospect of new member states acceding during the period.  In this regard, the Government will strongly argue that adequate transitional arrangements must be made for member states or regions which overshoot the GDP eligibility criterion for Objective 1 funding.  The Government's priority will be to ensure that any such transitional arrangements fully address our continuing significant development needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of the Convention on the Safety of <Col N="511" /> United Nations and Associated Personnel reflects the widespread concern felt at the growing number of deaths and injuries resulting from deliberate attacks against United Nations and associated personnel.  Attacks against, or other mistreatment of, personnel who act on behalf of the United Nations are unjustifiable and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The current international position is that the convention is not yet in force and will not enter into force until 30 days after the deposit with the Secretary-General of the instruments of ratification, acceptance or accession in respect of 22 countries.  As of 31 October 1997, 43 states had signed the convention and 14 states were parties to the convention.</P>
    <P>From an examination of the convention, it will be necessary to enact appropriate domestic legislative measures to give effect to the provisions of the convention.  While the enactment of the required legislation is not the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs, I assure the House that there will be no delay on the Department's part in taking the appropriate steps to lodge Ireland's instrument of accession when the legislation is in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The promotion of Ireland's economic interests abroad is a matter of the highest priority for the Department of Foreign Affairs and its diplomatic and consular missions.  I intend to keep the activity of our embassies under review to ensure that it is focused in the most effective manner to advance these interests.</P>
      <P>Considering the importance of foreign trade for the future of the Irish economy, a key objective of our diplomatic missions is to contribute to the development of a just and stable international order which will be conducive to the growth of trade and investment.  In addition, Ireland, through its Permanent Representation in Geneva, is involved in the work of the World Trade Organisation and its promotion of global trade liberalisation on the basis of agreed rules and safeguards.  The European Union provides a crucially important framework for Ireland's future development, including its economic development.  Ireland's Permanent Representation to the European Union is particularly active in contributing to the process of European integration and in defending Ireland's economic interests at European Union level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the bilateral level, the work of our embassies in contributing to Ireland's larger objective of building friendly relations with other nations provides the essential basis for developing business <Col N="512" /> and investment.  Irish Ambassadors report regularly on economic developments in their countries of accreditation, as well as representing Ireland's position to the Government of those countries.</P>
    <P>At the operational level, the embassies co-operate closely with the State agencies in promoting specific economic interests.  In recent years, efforts have been made to establish a more significant Irish presence in major world centres by bringing Irish diplomatic and other representatives together under one roof to constitute an &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo;.  This has already been done formally in New York and Tokyo and I remain committed to this approach wherever feasible.  Last month, I attended the official opening of the new Ireland House in Madrid.  In a number of other capitals, representatives of An Bord Tráchtála are based in the Irish Embassy and work closely with the Ambassador.</P>

      <P>The convention agreed at Oslo in September represents a major breakthrough in international efforts to rid the world of one category of indeiscriminate and inhumane weapons &mdash; anti-personnel landmines.  It enjoyed the support of more than 100 participating delegations, including in particular the mine affected countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America.</P>
      <P>As my predecessor reported in a reply to a similar question on the 30 September, a number of significant states including Russia, Japan, China, India and Pakistan and two of our partners in the European Union, Greece and Finland, did not, despite our best efforts, participate in the conference in Oslo.  While the United States did participate, its delegation declared that it was not in a position to forego the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines for the foreseeable future.  The vast majority of participating states at Oslo including Ireland would not agree to an exception which would have compromised the fundamental global approach we were pursuing, and would have defeated the goal of a total ban which we set out to achieve.</P>
      <P>Since Oslo there have been a number of developments. Greece has announced that it will sign the Convention in Ottawa.  Japan and Russia have stated that they will sign when the conditions are right.  I welcome these announcements and I hope that there will be more announcements in the weeks leading up to the signing ceremony in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to sign the convention in Ottawa in December, where I will be examining <Col N="513" /> with other Foreign Ministers the ways in which we can promote the universalisation of this convention, in particular the early accession of those states that are not yet ready to sign but whose adherence to this convention would be of significance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>As my predecessor stated in reply to a similar question from Deputy Rabbitte on 30 September 1997, the question of institutional reform in the EU was considered by the Intergovernmental Conference which concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam in June this year.  The outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference in this area and indeed the overall result of the Intergovernmental Conference was highly satisfactory from the Irish point of view.</P>
      <P>In the area of institutional reform, Ireland shared the concern of other member states to preserve the broad balance within and between the European Union's institutions which has been essential to the success of the Union.  In particular, Ireland attached priority to maintaining the right to nominate a full member of the European Commission.  We continue to believe it is central to the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Commission and of the Union's institutions as a whole that each member state is entitled to nominate a full member.  I am very pleased that this priority was realised and I would echo my predecessor in paying tribute to the previous Government, of which Deputy Rabbitte was a member, for its efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>A Protocol to the Treaty provides for a review, at least one year before the membership of the European Union exceeds 20 member states, of the composition and functions of the Union's institutions.  However, the outcome of such a future review is not prejudged, and there has been no decision to limit the size of the Commission to any definite number of Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In addition, the larger member states agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference to give up their right to nominate a second Commissioner at the time of the next enlargement of the Union, provided that, by that date, the weighting of the votes in the Council has been modified, whether by reweighting of the votes or by dual majority, in a manner acceptable to all member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remains committed, in line with its commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, to protecting the interests of Ireland as a smaller member state in any future <Col N="514" /> negotiations on institutional issues, not only with our own benefit in mind but also with the objective of maintaining the cohesion, balance and effectiveness of the Union as a whole.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>My policy, and that of the Government, is to encourage and facilitate the most equitable regional distribution of jobs throughout the country. Accordingly, I have asked IDA Ireland and Forbairt to ensure that this policy is actively pursued across all regions, including the west.  I think that the result of this proactive approach is being reflected in several recent project announcements made by me, with the west faring particularly well.</P>
      <P>During the last couple of months alone, I have been pleased to make several project announcements in the western region.  These will bring a total of 303 new jobs to the west.</P>
      <P>&mdash; The new Lionbridge Technologies project, which will create 100 jobs in a software and hardware testing facility in Ballina, is a significant development in the attraction of overseas investment to the western region.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Transitions Optical Ltd.  is creating 75 new jobs in Tuam with the expansion of its European photochromic plastic spectacle lenses manufacturing facility.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Tente Limited, a subsidiary of one of Europe's leading manufacturers of castors and wheels, is adding 43 new jobs at its Ballymote facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" />&mdash; I was particularly pleased to be able to announce that Carrowkeel Seafoods Ltd. was expanding its operation at Killala and creating 85 new jobs in the process.  In the light of the Asahi closedown, such new employment opportunities are welcome news for that area.</P>
    <P>Both agencies are very conscious of their responsibility to promote new investment in regional locations and are devoting considerable resources and energy to this task.  For its part IDA Ireland is encouraging visiting companies to look at many locations across the country before making decisions on location and is</P>
    <P>&mdash; favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way possible, including with higher grant levels as appropriate</P>
    <P>&mdash; with the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations</P>
    <P>&mdash; working closely with local authorities to have quality sites available at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, however, it must be recognised that, where overseas investment is concerned, the decision on where to locate rests solely with overseas investors, based primarily on the competitiveness and general level of attractiveness of individual locations.</P>

      <P>The county enterprise boards are co-funded by the Exchequer and the European Union under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99, overall responsibility for which lies with my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  Other local development initiatives such as the Partnership Companies and the Leader groups are the responsibility of my colleagues the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, respectively.  My colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, chairs the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development, which has a mandate to, <i>inter alia</i>, develop a comprehensive Government strategy on local development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 35 city and county enterprise boards providing finance, training and other business supports to micro-enterprises throughout the country.  Since their establishment in September <Col N="518" /> 1993, the boards have assisted more than 7,250 projects and helped create more than 8,600 full-time job equivalents (to end 1996) at a grant cost per job of less than £4,000.</P>
    <P>Since assuming office as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in July 1997, I have taken a keen interest in the progress of the county enterprise boards.  While I am satisfied with the progress of the boards to date, I am at present considering the strategic positioning of the CEBs having regard to their function as one of the development agencies responsible to my Department.</P>

The action programme identifies seven key priorities for action in this area.  These priorities include, <i>inter alia,</i> the implementation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  Training and employment is the area which is of particular relevance to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and, in this context, the three main priorities for my Department during 1998 are as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash; To make arrangements with the Department of Health for the transfer of certain responsibilities to my Department relating to the training and employment of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>A first time application for a work permit (not an extension as stated in the question) was received by my Department in September and was refused on 3 October 1997.</P>
      <P>Work permit policy is based on the need to ensure that job opportunities which arise in the State are, as far as possible, reserved for Irish or EEA (European Economic Area) nationals. Work permits are not granted unless the employer can show that, despite all reasonable efforts having been made, there are no suitably qualified Irish or EEA nationals available for the position in question.  In addition we must also now have regard to the employment requirements of the growing legally resident non-EEA Muslim community in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I should point out that, according to our records, the company concerned currently has five permits in respect of the Ballyhaunis plant and has, to date, been issued with a total of 27 work permits in respect of &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; slaughtermen by my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 72, 75, 76, 77 and 78 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> Fully up-to-date figures are not available on eel stocks in the north-western lakes, so it is not possible to say to what extent their numbers have declined.  However, I am aware of the concerns about present levels of fishing for eels with long-lines and the need to regulate this activity.  I have asked the Marine Institute to develop proposals for an integrated conservation and development strategy for the eel fishery, and a preliminary report will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>Current scientific advice on the state of European eel stocks points to serious concerns for the continued survival of the species.  Eels depend on a common spawning stock and artificial propagation has not been made possible in spite of extensive experimental work.  The international scientific working group on eels recommends that the &ldquo;precautionary principle&rdquo; should apply, and that exploitation should not increase above current levels unless complemented by stock enhancement programmes.</P>
    <P>In a judgment of the Circuit Court in March 1997, it was held that a ministerial authorisation was not required to fish for eels using longlines, contrary to the apparent intention of the Fisheries Acts and the previous management and licensing practice of the Department and the regional fisheries boards.  The practical result has been that anyone is entitled to a licence from the local fisheries board and fish unrestricted.  This has led to a demonstrable increase in longlining activity this year with consequent risks for stocks.</P>
    <P>I have met the Western Regional Fisheries Board in recent weeks to hear their particular concerns.  I have asked the Central Fisheries Board as a matter of urgency to co-ordinate the input of the regional fisheries boards and to advise on the statutory changes required arising out of the recent court decision.  I intend to progress the necessary primary legislation without delay in light of the advice of the boards.  I am also conscious of a possible risk to other stocks such as salmon, trout and pike, and I will ensure that these species are also covered by any measures introduced to regulate longlining.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, it is the case that the powers of the regional boards in this matter are limited: a board must issue a licence to anyone who applies for it.  The board may nominate the individuals who may fish under the licence, to restrict their number, but no restriction can be imposed on the number of people who may separately apply for licences.  In addition to progressing the legislative amendments required to address the anomaly I am reviewing the scope for the immediate introduction of provisions to tackle the problem without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation of the disused copper mines at Avoca is highly complex.  The submission made by the Neighbourhood of Whitebridge (NOW) Group is very helpful and highlights various concerns including drainage problems and site rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>My Department has met the NOW Group on a number of occasions and has arranged for various safety related works to be carried out in the area which have addressed some of their concerns. However, my responsibilities under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1955 in relation to disused mines are mainly concerned with the making safe (i. e. the fencing in and covering over) of old and abandoned mine shafts and openings where State minerals had been worked.  There is, therefore, a limit to the amount and type of works that I can undertake.  I understand that other extensive physical works have been undertaken in the area by Wicklow County Council in some cases with the assistance of FÁS.  I understand also that the residents themselves have carried out some works.  Problems associated with drainage from the mine lands are matters which are being kept under continuous review and my Department will continue to liaise with Wicklow County Council and FÁS to assist where it can, and with various local representative groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is further complicated by the fact that much of the mine lands in question are owned by St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd., which has been in receivership for some time now. <Col N="523" /> However, I am taking steps to see that the company is dissolved so that the lands may revert to the State.  This will facilitate the leasing part of these lands to Avoca Holdings Heritage Ltd., a private company.  This company has secured permission for a mining heritage centre on a site at Whitebridge and this proposal will involve significant development of the lands which concern the Neighbourhood of Whitebridge group.</P>

      <P>It is my position that all legitimate salmon interests, including commercial netsmen, will benefit from the survival and recovery of salmon stocks, which are the underlying objectives of the new conservation measures.  The Government's salmon strategies are designed to secure the future of all legitimate salmon interests, including commercial netsmen.  The question of financial compensation for the introduction of those enhanced management strategies, which are of themselves designed to maximise the returns from the salmon fishery, is not under consideration. In that context there are no plans to introduce a buy out scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet had the opportunity for bilateral meetings with my fellow Foreign Ministers of Greece and Turkey.  However, I and my officials routinely have contact with diplomatic and official representatives of both Greece and Turkey and the issue of Cyprus has been frequently raised on these occasions.</P>
      <P>Ireland's interest in seeing a political solution to the Cyprus question is clear and well understood, both by Greece and Turkey, as well as by the UN and the wider international community. It follows from our longstanding contribution to the peacekeeping mission of the United Nations in Cyprus and our support for the ongoing efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General in his good offices mission to seek a lasting political settlement between both communities on the island.</P>
      <P>The prospect of the accession of Cyprus to the European Union has provided both the incentive and the opportunity for a renewed effort to find a solution to the Cyprus question.  Since January 1996, the EU Presidency has appointed a special representative for Cyprus with the objective of seeking to closely monitor and facilitate efforts of the international community and the UN to encourage direct negotiations between the leadership of the two communities.  Under our Presidency, Ambassador Kester Heaslip was appointed to this role and he has continued to act as Presidency special representative for Cyprus during the Dutch and Luxembourg Presidencies.</P>
      <P>Both the Presidency special representative and the Commission have undertaken an active programme of visits to Cyprus to meet the political leadership of the two communities and with a cross-section of representatives from the social and economic sectors.  They have sought to provide accurate and detailed information during these contacts on the implications and potential benefits of EU membership for both communities, and in particular for the Turkish Cypriot community.</P>
      <P>The political message which the EU has sought to convey to the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides is that they have everything to gain and nothing to lose from the accession of a united Cyprus to the European Union.  Membership of the Union will provide not only clear benefits in economic development, but also safeguards on security and on respect for the rights of both communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following international efforts to encourage moves towards a political settlement, a process of direct talks between President Clerides and Mr. <Col N="527" /> Denktash has been initiated under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General, and his special adviser on Cyprus, Mr. Diego Cordovez.  Ireland and her EU partners have welcomed this initiative.  The first set of talks took place in July this year in New York and were followed by a second session in Switzerland in August.  During this second session Mr. Denktash stated that he was unwilling to continue negotiations on the draft outline of a settlement unless the EU suspended its decision to open accession negotiations with Cyprus in 1998.  The EU Council of Ministers in September rejected any linkage between the direct talks process and accession negotiations and confirmed that the latter would proceed as planned.</P>
    <P>At present the UN Secretary-General's special adviser is in contact with both parties with the objective of continuing the direct talks process in 1998, following completion of presidential elections in Cyprus.</P>
    <P>We remain fully supportive of UN efforts to maintain the direct talks process.  We will also continue to call upon all interested parties, including Greece and Turkey, to play a positive and constructive role to support UN efforts to achieve a political settlement.  In particular, we will also continue to urge the leadership of both communities in Cyprus to fully and seriously avail of this opportunity to secure for all the people of Cyprus a comprehensive and peaceful solution to the Cyprus question.</P>

      <P>I am personally committed to ensuring that, within my area of responsibility, meeting the requirements of people with disabilities continues to be accorded a high priority by service providers.  It is their responsibility to develop and implement relevant initiatives and improvements. They are aware of the need to work towards maximising the accessibility and responsiveness of their facilities and services to customers with disabilities according as suitable opportunities and resources allow.</P>
      <P>While my Department's work covers a wide range of activities, it is clear that the principal concerns of people with disabilities relate to the question of improving the accessibility and user friendliness of the public transport system.  In this regard, I am advised that current priorities within the CIE Group for 1998 include the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.&nbsp; the introduction in Dublin, on an experimental basis, of a number of large-capacity low-floor buses to complement a similar test already under way in Cork;</P>
      <P>2.&nbsp; further progress on the implementation of Iarnród Éireann's ongoing programme of improvements on trains and at railway stations aimed at catering more adequately for wheelchair users and other customers with disabilities; and</P>
      <P>3.&nbsp; further developments in the three CIE operating subsidiaries in relation to disability awareness training and consultation with user groups representative of customers with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an interdepartmental task force operating under the aegis of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is drawing up an action plan for consideration by the Government, based on the wide-ranging recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. I expect that the outcome of that process will provide a basis for determining the extent to which additional relevant initiatives within the area coverd by my remit can be undertaken in 1998 and in the years immediately following.</P>

      <P>The total cost of the INPC's investment programme at the Whitegate refinery which was undertaken between 1993 and 1996 was £45.2 million.  £37.2 million of this was financed by the <Col N="531" /> INPCF through its income from the sale of petroleum products while the balance of £8 million was financed by a joint venture partner in relation to a combined heat and power plant installed at the refinery.</P>
      <P>During 1996, the average impact of INPC's selling prices on final selling prices was 0.7p per litre on petrol, gasoil and diesel.  The current impact is 0.2p per litre and the reduction is partly due to the benefits of the investment programme in reducing costs at Whitegate refinery.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review &mdash; Implementation Plan, 1996-98 provided for special studies to be carried out on the Air Corps and the Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1996, the efficiency audit group engaged Price Waterhouse Management Consultants to <Col N="533" /> conduct the special studies into the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  The consultants subsequently furnished a preliminary draft report to the EAG. Amongst other things the draft report highlighted those issues which required to be studied in greater detail and indentified a number of new issues which required examination.</P>
    <P>As a consequence, and rather than publishing a report which identified problems requiring further attention it was decided that the consultants should be asked to address these problems in their report.  In this way, the study will be as comprehensive and well grounded as possible, and the resulting report will produce a definitive blueprint for the development of these services in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The consultants are due to report to the efficiency audit group by mid-December 1997.  It is my intention to publish this report at the earliest possible juncture.</P>

Apart from the growing of a very small acreage of genetically modified sugar beet, which was licensed on an experimental basis, there have been no other instances where such products have been approved for use in Irish farming.</P>
      <P>While genetically modified organisms have been applied extensively in the production of food and food ingredients in some countries, their use is still the subject of ongoing research.  Pending the outcome of this, it would be premature to take a decision on their long-term use in agriculture in Ireland.</P>

It is inevitable that such requirements, which are now enshrined in EU law, will give rise to additional costs.  However, these costs must be set against the need on the part of the industry to have in place procedures for handling this material which meet the needs of consumers and which allow continued access by Ireland to a wide range of markets.</P>

    <P>In my statement on the Exchequer returns for the end-September quarter, I indicated that net current supply services expenditure could exceed the budget target by about £115 million, reflecting increased provision for hepatitis C payments, higher pay costs associated with the nurses' settlement, Army deafness settlements, together with some pressures on other Departmental spending including increased expenditure on anti-cime initiatives, and after taking into account significantly higher levels of PRSI receipts than originally projected.  I also indicated that their overruns may be partially offset by savings which may emerge in the last quarter.</P>
    <P>My Department is monitoring closely the position on all the Votes in consultation with Departments. It is too early, however, to give a precise view on the extent of the additional funding requirements.  Full details of the Votes, specific subheads and the amounts involved will be available as and when Supplementary Estimates are submitted to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I intend to submit the 1998 Abridged Estimates Volume to the Dáil shortly and to include in it the forecast 1997 outturn for each Vote and subhead. These forecast figures will be best estimates and <Col N="550" /> subject to revision in the light of later information.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might refer to my reply to him of 16 October 1997 to a similar question in this matter.  Since the completion of the Inny drainage scheme in 1968 maintenance works were carried out in the area on three occasions by the</P>
      <P>Office of Public Works i.e in 1976, 1980 and 1991-92. Clearly these works did not in any way conflict with the conservation status of Glen lake as the latter was designated as a special protection area in 1995.  The maintenance operations carried out in 1997 were routine and did not vary significantly from previous works.  Initial survey information has confirmed that there is no change in outfall control level to the Glen lake area.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works and the National Parks and Widlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, are working together to draw up an agreed management scheme for the future of the area.  This will resolve any areas of conflict, should they arise, between the two Departments' statutory responsibilities and the method by which they can be resolved.</P>

      <P>The attached schedule sets out the total deductions in respect of income tax, employee's PRSI and levies, where appropriate, as requested.  I would draw to the Deputy's attention that the tax treatment of a widowed person in the year of bereavement is at least as favourable as that of a married couple with the married allowance and double rate bands continuing to apply.  In the year following bereavement, and thereafter, widowed persons are treated more favourably than a single person.  The personal tax free allowance for a widowed person currently stands at £3,400 as compared to £2,900 for a single person.  An</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total Income Tax, Employees' PRSI and Levies Deductions (a) <Col N="552" /> additional allowance of £2,400 is available to a widowed person who has dependent children. This means that the personal allowances of a widowed parent are £5,800, the same level as the basic allowance for a married couple.</P>
    <P>Specific recognition is provided for the special difficulties faced by widowed parents in the years immediately following bereavement, through a special transitional allowance of £1,500 for the first tax year following bereavement, £1,000 for the second and £500 for the third.</P>
    <P>It is true that widowed persons receive the single person's tax band of £9,000, i.e. the amount of income after deduction of tax free allowances which is taxed at 26 per cent, while the married couple's tax band is £19,800.  However, in this regard it must also be borne in mind that the married couple's allowance and band are given in respect of two adults.  As the Deputy will be aware, a person in receipt of a social welfare widow/er's pension is exempt from the health and employment and training levies on all his-her income.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the current arrangements for the taxation of widowed persons.  The tax position of widowed persons, along with other taxpayers, will be considered in the context of preparations for the forthcoming budget.</P>

    <P>It is vital in interpreting this table that the mechanism for reviewing the family income supplement is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 12 monthly basis: once awarded it will not be <Col N="553" /> reduced or withdrawn until the end of the period, regardless of any upward movement in pay during that period.  Therefore, gross income from employment can increase insignificantly during the course of a year while adjustments to FIS may not occur until some time later.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that, in order to improve the return from work to families with children, there is a commitment in Partnership 2000 to reform the family income supplement during the lifetime of the Partnership, by adjusting the method of calculation from a gross income to a net income basis.  As the first element in honouring this commitment, the family income supplement has been calculated, since June, on a basis net of PRSI and the health and employment levies.</P>

      <P>My Department, as an employer, is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for people with disabilities, which includes ensuring that people with disabilities who are capable of effective performance in the jobs to which they aspire are not disadvantaged by reason of having a disability.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, my Department produced and circulated a code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service. The code of practice covers issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation, equipment, safety and evacuation procedures.</P>
      <P>The ideas for the code of practice were developed in conjunction with the Civil Service unions, the relevant voluntary bodies and in consultation with staff with disabilties.  I have arranged for a copy of the code of practice to be sent separately to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the code of practice is monitored by a committee chaired by my Department. The committee is representative of staff and management.  A number of workshops to help raise awareness of disability issues were organised earlier this year by my Department for staff in personnel sections and further workshops are being planned.</P>
      <P>In the context of the strategic management initiative in the Civil Service, equality issues, including issues relating to the employment of people with disabilities, are currently being examined by a committee set up specifically for this purpose.  My Department is represented on the committee.  In addition, my Department is represented on the interdepartmental task force on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
      <P>My Department is also preparing a human resource management policy which will commit itself to the preparation of a charter on equality issues within the Department and will restate the Department's commitment to the code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service.</P>

Residence issues, where they arise, are dealt with as part of an individual's overall taxation treatment and consequently it is not possible to readily identify cases where a residence issue may also have been a factor.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank acted as Agent of the Minister for Finance in the administration of exchange controls <Col N="558" /> in the period 1979-92.  Authority to process a wide range of transactions were, in turn, delegated by the Central Bank to authorised dealers, approved agents and certain other financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Apart from prosecution, a number of other sanctions were available to the Central Bank to deal with irregularities, principally, the withdrawal of an exchange control permission already granted, the reversal of transactions which had already taken place and the refusal to grant permissions where the application appeared to result from a previously unapproved transaction.  All these sanctions were used in instances where they were deemed appropriate.  It is not possible for the Central Bank to quantify the number of cases involved since they were not enumerated as they occurred.  There were no prosecutions for the period 1979-92.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank was requested to undertake specific investigations in relation to possible breaches of exchange controls in relation to the following three reports: (1) the final report of the Investigation into the Affairs of Siúicre Éireann cpt and Related Companies under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990; (2) the final report of the Investigation into the ownership of Chestvale Limited and Hoddle Limited, under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990; and (3) the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments).</P>
      <P>The findings of the Central Bank in these cases were referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his consideration.  In respect of (1) and (2) above, I am advised that there were no prosecutions.  The position in regard to item (3) above is that the Central Bank response was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions on Friday 31 October 1997 and is being considered by him.</P>
      <P>The Exchange Control Act 1954 provided that the Customs Acts applied to anything prohibited to be imported or exported under the provisions of the 1954 Act.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that while definitive records are not available back to 1979, there were numerous minor breaches of exchange controls which were detected and settled locally, under the powers statutorily available to the Commissioners.  For example, where currency notes were seized by the Customs authorities, cases could have been settled by retention from the amount seized of a compromise penalty in lieu of legal proceedings. A number of more serious breaches were also subject to settlement with the Revenue Commissioners in lieu of legal proceedings.  In addition, records show that two prosecutions were taken under the Customs Acts between 1979 and 1992 in relation to exchange control breaches and that convictions were obtained in both cases.</P>

    <P>*Up to 1985, acute beds in St. Brendan's Hospital, Grangegorman were provided on a needs-led basis.  Consequently, it is not possible to indicate the exact number of acute beds provided in 1980 and 1985.  However, the total number of beds in the hospital in those years was 990 (1980) and 870 (1985).</P>
    <P>**Due to an error in the information supplied in relation to the South-Eastern Health Board in response to a question by the Deputy on 14 October 1997, the number of acute psychiatric beds provided in that health board area in 1997 was incorrectly stated in that reply.</P>
    <P>I will write to the Deputy separately on this issue.</P>

      <P>Discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital concerning service and staffing issues relevant to the new hospital at Tallaght.  While a post of consultant paediatrician has been included by the hospital in their consultant staffing proposals, the Department has not yet received a completed application for this post.  It has been indicated that sympathetic consideration will be given to such an application.  However, as the regulation of appointments of consultant medical staff is the statutory responsibility of Comhairle na nOspidéal, final approval will be a matter for An Comhairle.</P>

However, part of the recent pay agreement for this grade, made under clause 2 (iii) &mdash; annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> , includes a condition that no additional environmental health officers will be employed in excess of the approved complement of 277, whole-time equivalent, between the date of the agreement and the end of 1999.

      <P>The primary purpose of the financial assistance provided to persons with a disability, for the purchase or adaptation of motorised transport, is to enable them to travel to work and earn a living. The person, referred to by the Deputy, for whom the grant was being sought was not earning a living but attending school, and therefore ineligible for assistance under the scheme.  It should be noted, however, that the Department of Education provides assistance towards the cost of transport to school where the individual is unable to avail of the normal school transport service.  In addition, the Midland Health Board was advised by my Department that, in this instance, it could consider making a financial contribution towards the transport costs associated with attendance at the Central Remedial Clinic and hospital appointments in Dublin.  Where there is a particular hardship involved it is open to the person's family to apply to the Midland Health Board for a supplementary welfare allowance.  Other reliefs for people with a disability are available from the Revenue Commissioners which assist with the purchase and running costs of motorised transport for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198, 199, 200 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is in discussion with the Irish Nurses' Organisation and the Irish Medical Organisation concerning the operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme.  I recognise that all of the parties concerned share the objective of achieving the programme's target of an uptake level of 95 per cent among the child population.  I am confident that a solution to the difficulties currently being experiened will soon be reached and the uptake targets achieved.  Up to the end of 1995, the immunisation scheme was operated by a combination of public health clinics and general practitioners acting independently.  It was difficult, therefore, to obtain accurate vaccination uptake figures.  However, since the beginning of 1996, the immunisation programme has been delivered by general practitioners acting under contract to health boards.  The information available to my Department does not support the Deputy's contention that there has been a fall in the uptake of immunisation since the new programme was introduced.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the contract between health boards and general practitioners for the delivery of the primary childhood immunisation programme, health boards may make special arrangements where the uptake of immunisation among particular groups or in geographical areas is unacceptably low.  This could include the holding of special clinics if the health board deemed such a measure appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1994 the Minister for Health signed an Agreement on Working Arrangements for the Co-ordination of InterCountry Adoption with the Romanian Committee for Adoption.  This committee was dissolved earlier this year and a new committee established in Romania.</P>
      <P>In July of this year the new Romanian Committee for Adoption forwarded a new draft agreement to the Adoption Board.  No advance notification was received in writing or otherwise from the Romanian committee of its intention to withdraw from the original agreement.  Paragraph 11 of the 1994 agreement states that either party may terminate the agreement by giving three months notice in writing to the other party of this intention and that such termination will not affect the completion of adoptions already in progress. It would appear that the Romanian authorities have suspended all adoptions of Romanian children by Irish couples pending the signing of the new agreement.</P>
      <P>The new draft agreement was examined by both my Department and the Adoption Board and it was agreed that a number of minor amendments should be proposed.  My Department wrote to the Romanian Government in mid September 1997, enclosing a draft of the proposed amendments. The Romanian Secretary of State for Adoptions acknowledged receipt of the proposed amendments on 24 September 1997 and confirmed that they will be examined at the next meeting of the Romanian Committee for Adoption.</P>
      <P>My Department last week received a request from the Romanian Committee for Adoptions for clarification of certain aspects of our adoption laws concerning the establishment of the Adoption Board.  The information sought has been provided to the Romanians.  I am hopeful that a new agreement will be concluded in the near future and if any undue delay occurs, I will pursue the matter through the offices of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I would also like to point out that I recently met an official of the Romanian Department of Child Protection and I stressed the urgency of a speedy resolution of the issue.</P>

The Midland Health Board has been allocated a total of £400,713 in 1997 for its waiting list work, including hip replacements.

      <P>There are only two areas in which funding arrangements for voluntary bodies have been raised recently.  The National Council on Ageing and Older People has just published a report The Years Ahead Report: A Review of the Implementation of its Recommendations.  The review referred to certain difficulties that voluntary organisations, involved in providing care for older people, were experiencing arising from the method of funding by statutory bodies.  The findings of the review are being examined by my Department with a view to addressing difficulties which may arise in relation to funding arrangements.</P>
      <P>I am aware that initially some of the groups which were due to receive funding from the task force on drugs expressed reservations about the procedures concerning the draw down of funds. However, following meetings with the task force these difficulties have I understand been resolved.  I am not aware of any other formal complaints from agencies to my Department.

      <P>The relocation of Temple Street Hospital to the Mater Hospital campus has been under consideration for some time by the religious orders who own the two hospitals concerned.  My Department supports the transfer of Temple Street Hospital to the Mater campus because of the need to improve the quality of paediatric hospital accommodation and the potential benefits to both hospitals of shared infrastructural support and complementary clinical services.</P>
      <P>While there is agreement in principle between the two orders to the proposed move, there are a number of issues still to be worked out which will have an impact on the phasing of the development. My Department is currently in discussion with representatives of the hospitals in order to progress this matter.  It is generally accepted that in view of the logistical and planning issues involved, the move to the Mater Hospital site would take a number of years to complete. However, in the interim, it is vital that existing services for children on the north side of the city are maintained to a high standard.  For this reason, my Department recently approved the establishment of a project team for the refurbishment of Temple Street Hospital's accident and emergency department and the provision of a 20 bedded ward.  Work is well advanced on the planning of this development.  The Deputy will wish to know that in recent months I have also approved the following funding for the Children's Hospital, Temple Street: capital grant for the purchase of priority equipment: £410,000; hi-tech initiative: £77,000; waiting list initiative: £40,000.</P>
      <P>My Department has not received any proposals for the development of paediatric facilities at Beaumont Hospital.  However, the provision of the above funding and the development plans which have been drawn up are evidence of my Department's commitment to the enhancement of paediatric services on the north side of Dublin.</P>

      <P>The United Kingdom Transplant Support Service Authority is responsible for the central management and co-ordination of the lung, heart-lung transplant waiting list in Britain.  Information supplied by the UKTSSA indicates that 11 residents from the Republic of Ireland are on the active waiting list for heart-lung transplantation.  In addition four patients are classified as being on the suspended waiting list, either because they are not available for transplant at this time or because they are not well enough to undergo an operation.  The following, as requested, is a breakdown of the current waiting list by health board area, as reported to the UKTSSA: Eastern Health Board seven; Western Health Board two; South-Eastern Health Board one; and North-Western Health Board one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the number of Irish residents currently on the waiting list for lung transplant by health board area is reported as follows: Eastern Health Board five; Southern Health Board three; <Col N="573" /> Western Health Board one; North Western Health Board one; and Mid-Western Health Board one.  The waiting time for patients on the active waiting list can vary for a number of reasons, including the availability and suitability at a given time of sufficient organs.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the ongoing development of services for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>In relation to services to persons with a mental handicap, ongoing development will be in line with the needs outlined in the assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001.  This includes residential facilities for those with mental handicap and autism.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities which was published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of these services.  Priority areas for development are respite care, day care and home supports.  I am not in a position to say what funding will be available in 1998 for any particular service. However, I am fully committed to the further development of services for people with disabilities in the context of additional funding available in 1998.</P>

    <P>I have approved funding of £475,000 to the Eastern Health Board towards the purchase of a CT scanner for St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown. This new equipment will serve to enhance the level of service to patients at St. Columcille's Hospital and is an indication of the Government's commitment to the continued <Col N="574" /> development of acute hospital services in the region.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has also submitted proposals to my Department for the further development of the radiology department and a new day services department at St. Columcille's Hospital.  The submission is being examined within my Department, in consultation with the Eastern Health Board.</P>

The question of the provision of cardiac care services overall is under review at the moment.  An announcement will be made on the location of additional cardiac care services when this review is complete.</P>
      <P>Waiting list figures for each specialty, including cardiac surgery are returned to my Department by all acute hospitals at the end of each quarter. At the end of September 1997 there were 1,581 patients, adults and children, on the national cardiac surgery list.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that I have recently approved a sum of £1.7 million under the 1997 waiting list initiative, specifically for cardiac surgery patients.  I am confident that this will impact positively on the cardiac surgery waiting list.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of consultant surgeons and anaesthetists and the population of the Midland Health Board area is set out below.  This excludes the specialist surgeons, of which there are five in Tullamore General Hospital &mdash; three orthopaedic surgeons and two ENT surgeons.</P>
      <P>In relation to the data on ratios sought by the Deputy, it is very difficult to make valid comparisons between regions.  Even if populations were similar between regions, there are significant differences in case complexity, age and health needs. It is, therefore, inadvisable to make comparisons of staffing ratios and workload between hospitals or regions without significant qualifications to the data presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to surgical procedures, the number of in-patients discharged from the specialty of general surgery in each of the Midland Health Board's acute general hospitals is set out below for the period 1992 to 1996.  In addition, it is <Col N="577" /> important to take account of the growing number of day cases in each hospital.  The number of surgical day cases is also included below for the same period.</P>
    <P>With regard to staffing and developments in the Longford-Westmeath area, the Deputy will be aware that Phase 2A of the development at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital has now been completed.  The Midland Health Board estimates <Col N="578" /> that it will require an additional 80 staff, including consultants, to make the new developments fully operational.  I am considering how best to commisson these facilities in the context of available funding for 1998.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that my Department has recently commenced a review of medical manpower needs in the health services.  This is being carried out in conjunction with the relevant professional bodies.</P>

      <P>I am aware that in the Western Health Board area the waiting period for the reporting of results of cervical smear tests is in excess of the recommended interval of one month.  Under the cancer strategy, approval has been given to the Western Health Board for the appointment of a cytoscreener.  I understand from the Western Health Board that interviews have been held.  The interview board made a recommendation and this is currently being processed.  The board has also appointed a temporary cytoscreener to clear the backlog and reduce the delay in providing results.</P>

To date no decision has been received from the Commission.

Since then Offaly County Council's applications for 1998 under the EU co-financed scheme have been received and include a proposal in respect of Kishawanny bridge on the R402.</P>
      <P>Applications from local authorities for these grants are currently being examined in my Department; decisions on funding will depend on compliance with strict EU eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from local authorities and the funds available relative to demands for the scheme in 1998.  It will be appropriate to consider the priority of a joint initiative by Offaly and Kildare County Councils to upgrade the R402 when grant applications for 1998 are also received from Kildare County Council, which has yet to make its submission to my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 244 together.</P>
      <P>The main outcomes of the Earth Summit, Rio de Janeiro, June 1992, were: the Rio Declaration; Agenda 21 &mdash; a framework programme for the pursuit of sustainable development worldwide; framework convention on climate change; convention on biological diversity; and convention on desertification.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 Ireland has, in pursuit of the commitments entered into at the Earth Summit, adopted a widely based approach to the implementation of Agenda 21 and towards the promotion and achievement of sustainable development. This approach is reflected in a range of national plans/statements, notably the National Development Plan, 1994-99 and the National Sustainable Development Strategy published in April 1997.  The momentum towards fuller integration of environmental considerations into other policies, as a mechanism for sustainable development, has intensified at many levels &mdash; institutional, regulatory, consultative and sectoral and is now a key component of Government policy and an integral consideration in Ireland's economic development.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ireland has ratified and is implementing the climate change, biological diversity and desertification conventions and has also joined the global environmental facility to which it is contributing £1.64 million over four years.</P>
      <P>In line with the Rio outcomes, Ireland has increased its overseas development assistance (ODA) expenditure from £40 million &mdash; 0.16 per cent of GNP in 1992 to £122 million &mdash; a projected 0.3 per cent of GNP in 1997.  The Government is committed to making steady progress towards the UN target figure of 0.7 per cent of GNP and, specifically, to having Irish aid reach 0.45 per cent of GNP by 2002.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation's proposals for the Dublin Bay project, comprising four contracts for the collection and treatment of wastewater, together with the treatment and disposal of sludge, are currently proceeding through the pre-construction stages.  The project will ensure that Dublin fully complies with the requirements of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive and other water quality requirements, such as the Bathing Water Directive. This will include ensuring that the present practice of disposal of sludge at sea is discontinued.</P>
      <P>Two contracts, relating to wastewater treatment and the disposal after treatment of sludge, are currently the subject of public procurement through competitive design and build operate tenders.  The proposals for the disposal of sludge that are finally approved will be required to have regard to the principles underlying my Department's sludge strategy.  The other two contracts, comprising a major pumping station at Sutton and a submarine pipeline, are also at an advanced stage of planning with the objective of discontinuing the discharge of untreated sewage at the nose of Howth, and instead conveying it to the treatment plant at Ringsend.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Dublin Bay project, other major projects are under construction or being planned for the collection and conveyance of wastewater to Ringsend.  A new collection system in the Dún Laoghaire area, stretching from Bulloch Harbour to the West Pier pumping station at Dún Laoghaire, has been under construction and is now nearing completion.  Dublin Corporation's preliminary report for upgrading the collection system in the North Dublin area including the North Fringe interceptor sewer has been approved recently.</P>

      <P>It is not clear that a switch from the use of aluminium cans to steel cans by the beverage industry would have an adverse effect on the recycling rate achieved in relation to aluminium cans or a significant adverse effect on the environment. A recent major study on the environmental impacts of packaging and packaging waste indicates that, in general, the differences in this regard between packaging options for beverages are relatively small and that substantial improvement in terms of environmental protection would not be easy to achieve by switching from one system to another.  This is one of the conclusions of the study entitled Eco-balances for Policy-making in the Domain of Packaging and Packaging Waste carried out by consultants for the European Commission.</P>

      <P>Disabled person's grants are payable by housing authorities in accordance with the terms of the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs) Grants Regulations, 1993.  These regulations do not impose a ceiling on the amount a housing authority may pay in respect of a disabled person's grant other than to specify that the grant shall not exceed: the approved cost of the works in the case of a rented local authority house, and two thirds of the approved cost of the works in any other case.</P>
      <P>The regulations provide for recoupment by my Department of 50 per cent of the cost of each disabled person's grant paid by a housing authority, subjecty to a maximum which was last increased to £4,000 in respect of works commenced on or after 1 March 1993.  In practice, housing authorities generally limit the grant they pay to twice the maximum recoupment available from my Department.  Therefore, the effective ceiling generally for the disabled person's grant was last increased to £8,000 with effect from 1 March 1993.  The increase in the house building cost index from that date to 1 October 1997 was 15.5 per cent and a corresponding increase in grant levels would cost about £1.25 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>Electoral and referendum law provides that the date and times of a poll at an election or referendum shall be appointed by order of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  In making an order appointing polling day, the Minister is <Col N="592" /> required to have regard to statutory requirements in relation to the minimum period between the date of the making of the order and polling day, and in the case of presidential and Dáil elections, to the period set out in the Constitution within which such elections must be held.  Regard must also be had to practical considerations such as the period of time which elapses between the close of nominations and polling day.</P>
      <P>Four different days &mdash; Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday &mdash; have been appointed as polling day at elections or referenda in the past. There is no indication that the appointment of different days as polling days at different elections or referenda causes confusion to the electorate.</P>
      <P>In 1984, the views of the different religious on the question of Sunday voting was sought.  The Catholic Church and the Jewish Community indicated that they would have no difficulty with Sunday voting.  The Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church and the General Committee of the Methodist Church were generally opposed to Sunday voting.  The smaller churches were not consulted at that time.</P>
      <P>Under existing law, any day of the week may be appointed as polling day.  I have no proposals to amend electoral law to restrict the choice of day or days which may be appointed as polling day.</P>

      <P>Under the new arrangements for the assessment of earnings from employment for unemployment assistance purposes, which came into force in November 1996, an unemployed person who works up to three days a week, may, subject to the level of his or her earnings, qualify for the full rate of UA for that week, including payment in respect of the days in the week on which the person worked. The improved arrangements provide that earnings are assessed at 60 per cent.  In addition, persons without children are allowed a £10 disregard for each day worked, while the balance of earnings are assessed at 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>The previous arrangements, which have now been replaced, provided that payment was only made in respect of the days in the week on which the person was unemployed, less one-sixth of their weekly means for each day of unemployment. Claimants were allowed to earn up to £15 above the appropriate daily rate of UA before being assessed with means.  However, no payment was made in respect of days of employment, irrespective of the level of daily earnings.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new arrangements has served two purposes.  Firstly, it ensures that claimants have an incentive to work at all levels of earnings, even where the level of pay is less than the rate of UA.  Secondly, the new arrangements make it easier for people to see clearly for themselves just how much better off they will be if they take up part-time or casual employment as opposed to claiming UA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the new arrangements were introduced, it was envisaged that some 10,500 casual workers would benefit financially &mdash; the impact on net income varying according to family size, number of days worked and level of earnings.  The total cost to the Exchequer is estimated at £1.6 million in a full year.  Provision was also made to guarantee the existing entitlements of recipients, so as <Col N="596" /> to ensure that no one would be worse off arising from the new arrangements.</P>

Under that scheme, a person who may have exceptional heating costs due to ill-health or infirmity may qualify for a heating allowance.

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy refers to the position of self-employed people who were over age 56 on the extension of social insurance to the self-employed in April 1988.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension. They may be covered for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions subject, of course, to satisfying the normal qualifying criteria.</P>
    <P>However, self-employed people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56, could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  In this year's Social Welfare Act provision was made that self-employed contributors who entered insurance in 1988, but were already over the age of 56 at that time and who had previously paid social insurance contributions as an employee would now be able to receive a refund of the pensions element of their self-employed social insurance provided that they do not qualify for an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving such a refund.</P>
    <P>Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years' contributions or becoming voluntary contributors after age 66 in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension would be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>We will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible.  I have asked my Department to examine the general issue relating to the self-employed group aged over 56 in April 1988.  As any proposals would have a major cost implication they would fall to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>Any person resident in the State can, of course, qualify for an old age non-contributory pension which is payable subject to a means test.</P>

      <Quest>if he will amend the guidelines governing the social welfare means test to ensure that income accruing from capital on deposit reflects the actual income in view of the current situation which bears no resemblance to actual returns for money on deposit.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17669/97]</QRef>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The means tests used in determining entitlement to all social assistance payments include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments which the applicant may have.  As there are about 480,000 people in receipt of social assistance payments it would not be feasible to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments as this would necessitate frequent reviews of the entitlement of a very significant number of recipients whenever rates fluctuated.  Accordingly, a notional value is ascribed to the capital owned.</P>
      <P>Over the years different methods of assessing the value of capital have been applied to the various social assistance schemes.  However, more recently the process of standardising the assessment of capital across the different social assistance schemes has been initiated, so as to improve the equity of the system.  The introduction of disability allowance scheme in October 1996 and the one-parent family payment scheme in January 1997 presented the opportunity to commence this process.  Under the new assessment provisions, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent of the capital value and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1997 provided for a further extension of the revised capital assessment provisions to the old age non-contributory pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, orphan's non-contributory pension, carer's allowance and pre-retirement allowance schemes, with effect from mid October 1997.</P>
      <P>The revised capital assessment provisions are of benefit to the majority of social assistance recipients who have capital.  For example, a single old age pensioner can now have capital of up to £6,160 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension &mdash; an increase of £3,173 on the previous arrangements.  A married couple can have capital of up to £12,320 and still qualify for the maximum pension &mdash; an increase of £6,345.  A single pensioner can have up to £35,575 and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension, while a married couple can have up to £71,146 before losing entitlement to the pension.</P>
      <P>In addition, the effective assessment rates of capital have been lowered for most recipients with capital.  For example, under the former arrangements the effective assessment rate for all levels of capital for old age non-contributory pension purposes was approximately 10 per cent in the case of single people and 5 per cent for a married couple.  Under the new procedures, capital of up to £20,000 is now assessed progressively up to the rate of 6.75 per cent in the case of a single pensioner and up to a rate of 3 per cent in the case of a married pensioner couple.  As only about 2 per cent of single old age pensioners and 4 per cent of married pensioners have capital in excess of £20,000, the new arrangements therefore, have improved the income position of the vast majority of old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> The question of extending the new capital assessment procedures to the other social assistance schemes, i.e., unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, is being examined in a budgetary context, in the light of the available resources and other priorities.</P>

      <P>Assuming that there is no other income earned by either couple, the net weekly income in the case of the long-term UA claimant would amount to £160.30, while that of the UB claimant would amount to £133.90. The difference in net income is accounted for by the fact that where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. This does not apply in the case of short-term payments such as unemployment benefit.  The difference is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>In so far as the social welfare secondary benefits of Christmas bonus, butter vouchers and free fuel allowance are concerned, these are payable only to recipients of long-term social welfare payments. As regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance or mortgage supplements and the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.  Secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or Jobstart etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Social Welfare Act, 1996 provided for the extension of Class A PRSI to community employment workers. Class A PRSI provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social <Col N="600" /> insurance system including, for example, employment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age contributory pension, widow's contributory pension, treatment, dental and optical, benefits and occupational injuries benefit.  The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other Class A workers.</P>
    <P>In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit, their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The introduction of special concessionary arrangements for former CE workers would have both legislative and cost implications and I am keeping this issue under review.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme is payable to persons in receipt of long-term social welfare payments who satisfy a means condition and who are living alone or only with certain categories of persons.  Under the means condition there is a limit on the amount of income which a person can have in addition to their pension and still qualify for the allowance.  The income limit was £5 per week up to October 1995, £10 per week from October 1995 and is currently £15 per week effective from October 1996.  The person concerned is in receipt of a private pension of around £30 per week in addition to his social welfare pension and is, therefore, not entitled to a fuel allowance under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance paid was last increased in October 1985.  In 1988, the national fuel scheme was amalgamated with the urban fuel scheme to form one single fuel scheme.  The rate of allowance in payment has remained at £5 per week.</P>
      <P>The smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week, was introduced in October 1990, to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin and Cork to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas. The rate of the allowance has not been increased since its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fuel and light component of the Consumer Price Index published by the Central Statistics Office rose by 7.1 per cent between August 1985 and August 1997.  Increasing the allowance by this <Col N="603" /> amount for the 1998 fuel season would cost £2.6 million.</P>
    <P>Increases in the rate of payment of fuel allowances should not be viewed in isolation from the general increases in basic social welfare payments. Over the years, basic payments have been increased by more than the rate of inflation and the Government has agreed that the real income position of those dependent of social welfare will be protected and enhanced.  In addition, the Government has also agreed that the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare will be implemented before the end of Partnership 2000 in the case of those payments which are not already at or above the minimum recommended rates.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 50 per cent in the last five years from £29.5 million in 1990 to £44.35 million in 1996.  A sum of £46.7 million has been set aside in the estimates for the scheme this year. In view of the financial implications, any increase in the rate of payment can only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 280 and 285 together.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19, who are in full-time education or who have a disability.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the special difficulties faced by parents in the more exceptional circumstances of the birth of triplets, quadruplets etc., child benefit is payable at double the normal monthly rate for each such child, so long as at least three of the children remain qualified.  In addition, a grant of £300 is payable on the birth of triplets, while a grant of £400 is payable on the birth of quadruplets or more.</P>
      <P>While the birth of twins is a much more common occurrence than the birth of triplets etc., the particular problems associated with rearing twins have also been acknowledged under the child benefit scheme.  A grant of £500 is paid on the birth of twins and an additional grant of £500 is payable when the twins reach the age of four years and again at 12 years.</P>
      <P>There are at present an estimated 12,500 sets of twins for whom child benefit is payable at the normal monthly rate.  The estimated additional cost of paying child benefit double rate in respect of twins would be of the order of £9.6 million.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to protecting and enhancing the role of the family in Irish Society.  In that context, one of my priorities is the continued development of child benefit as a key support for every child in the State.  The question of introducing specific measures in respect of twins will be examined in the light of overall budgetary priorities.</P>

      <Quest>the three priority areas for action in his Department for 1998, in view of the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, page 18, People with Disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitments contained in page 18 of the Action Programme for the Millennium referred to by the Deputy relate to the implementation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and, specifically, for the overhaul of the means by which the State supports the incomes of people with disabilities.  There are a number of other commitments contained in the programme relating to people with disabilities for which I have responsibility, including commitments to progressively relax the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit and that the value of the carer's allowance will be increased in real terms.  In addition, <Col N="605" /> Partnership 2000 contains a commitment that the minimum rates of payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare will be implemented by 1999.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to making progress on all of the commitments outlined above, and I am currently examining these in the context of formulating proposals for inclusion in the 1998 budget.</P>
      <P>Of the 402 recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, 60 are relevant to my Department. The main recommendations of relevance are as follows:</P>
      <P>(1) the establishment of a non-means tested payment to compensate for loss of income due to an incapacity for full-time work, or work to full potential to be known as a &ldquo;Disability Pension&rdquo;. This payment would replace the existing disability allowance.  Invalidity pension and blind person's pension and would be extended to cover people with disabilities who are living in part-time residential settings;</P>
      <P>(2) the achievement of the payment rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare as a matter of priority;</P>
      <P>(3) changes in the financial supports available to carers, including an extension of the carer's allowance on a means-tested basis to all carers and payment of higher rates to people caring for more than one person; and</P>
      <P>(4) the transfer of administration of the domiciliary care allowance and motorised transport grants schemes from the health boards to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Significant steps have already been taken towards improving the position of people with disabilities. For instance, the Commission found that there was no unified system of State income support for people with disabilities, with the provision of income support being fragmented and lacking co-ordination. However, the take-over of the disabled person's maintenance allowance by my Department in October 1996 means that all of the main weekly income support payments for people with disabilities are now provided for by a single Department.  All of these income support payments have a statutory basis and, accordingly, they all apply national standards and provide a legal entitlement to payment where the claimant fulfils the relevant conditions.</P>
      <P>This year's Social Welfare Act provided for the introduction of a new sickness allowance scheme for people who are incapable of work and not entitled to disability benefit or not permanently incapacitated.  Taken together, these two measures mean that there is in place a comprehensive system of income support for people who are sick and people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, this year's Social Welfare Act provided for the introduction of a comprehensive package of measures to further assist people with disabilities, including as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> (a) special increases in social welfare rates over and above the rate of inflation, which bring invalidity pension up to the target rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare; and disability allowance, blind person's pension and disability benefit up from 95 per cent to 98 per cent of the CSW rate;</P>
    <P>(b) a new part-payment of disability allowance for those in part-time residential care;</P>
    <P>(c) an additional payment of 50 per cent to recipients of carer's allowance providing care to more than one person, and</P>
    <P>(d) 1,000 places have been reserved under the back-to-work allowance scheme for a pilot scheme for people with disabilities, to facilitate their integration into mainstream employment.</P>
    <P>In addition, last week I announced a substantial investment of cash to assist people with disabilities. A total of £4.825 million extra is being made available to assist community and voluntary organisations working with people with disabilities and older people to cover a range of equipment necessary to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities, including accessible buses, motorised wheelchairs, training equipment, information systems, deaf aids, computers and special beds and hoists.</P>
    <P>A further £50,000 is being made available to the Irish Council for People with Disabilities for computer equipment for their 30 county networks. The equipment will substantially improve communications between the national office and the local networks and will also be used in the training programmes the council will provide under the Horizon project for which EU funding has been secured.</P>
    <P>This package of grants is being financed from savings in the 1997 Estimate of my Department. The equipment that the voluntary organisations will be able to provide with this money will create real independence for many people in need and will dramatically improve the quality of their lives.  In all, 11,000 people with disabilities will benefit from the package and the funding will greatly enhance their opportunities to achieve independent living and community integration.</P>
    <P>I am currently examining what further improvements can be made in the services provided by my Department for people with disabilities having regard to the commitments contained in the Action Programme for the Millennium and Partnership 2000 and the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back-to-work allowance scheme is to provide a financial incentive to long-term unemployed people to encourage them to return to work.  The scheme has a limited number of places and it is targeted at people who need a financial incentive to return to the workforce.  It is a requirement of the scheme that an applicant must apply for the allowance prior to taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned took up employment on 24 May 1997 but did not apply for the allowance until 30 September 1997.  His application was refused on the grounds that his claim was late and that he was in a position to return to the workforce without the need for the financial incentive which the scheme provides.</P>
      <P>Information on the scheme is widely available at all the Department's local offices and at many community information outlets.  It has been widely advertised and publicised, in the media. The Department's job facilitators are actively involved in promoting the scheme among the unemployed and with the various other agencies involved.</P>

      <P>The introduction of Class A PRSI for community employment workers commencing such employment on or after 6 April 1996, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996.

      <P>In the case of the person concerned, he finished working on a community employment scheme on 5 April 1996 and claimed unemployment assistance from 8 April 1996 until 4 May 1996.

      <P>I would not fully accept the criticism in the report of the mid-term evaluation of the Operational Programme for Tourism, given the efforts made by the National Cultural Institutions and the Heritage Service of my Department in marketing their facilities. However, I do agree that, as part of the wider objective to attract foreign tourists to Ireland, more needs to be done internationally to market our facilities.  Accordingly my Department intends to allocate funding in 1998 and 1999 to a new initiative, presently in the course of being finalised, for the marketing internationally of cultural and heritage attractions in the context of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-9.</P>

      <P>Glen Lough was designated in accordance with the Council Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (79/409/EEC) as a special protection area (SPA) for birds under Statutory Instrument No. 284 of 1995.  It also receives protection under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 which transposed into Irish law the provisions of Council Directive No. 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department has a statutory responsibility to protect the conservation values which resulted in the designation of Glen Lough as an SPA.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) has a statutory responsibility to maintain all <Col N="611" /> drainage channels resulting from arterial drainage schemes, including the Inny catchment drainage scheme, where Glen Lough is located.  While there can be potential for conflict between the obligations imposed by the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act and the statutory obligations to conserve wildlife and their habitats, the obligations are not necessarily imcompatible.  I understand that the Office of Public Works has confirmed that the recent works carried out at Glen Lough were routine drainage maintenance works, similar to those carried out by it on three previous occasions in 1976, 1980 and 1991-92.</P>
    <P>Discussions are taking place between officials of the NPWS and the Office of Public Works in relation to the recent drainage works at Glen Lough and the drawing up of an agreed management scheme for the site to ensure that conservation and drainage requirements are both accommodated.</P>

      <P>Since the launch of the Grand Canal corridor study in July 1994 a task force was established to oversee the implementation of improvements along the canal system.  A regeneration officer has been appointed to, <i>inter alia</i>, liaise with local community groups.  This has resulted in a number of community employment schemes being established in the Clondalkin and Ballyfermot areas to carry out improvements to the canal system.  Furthermore, a community sponsored barge restoration scheme is being undertaken in the Clondalkin area with the support of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Closer to the city, a number of lock gates have been replaced on the system and the Buckingham Sea Lock at Ringsend has been automated.  Safety chains have been installed in all lock chambers <Col N="612" /> in the Dublin area.  Charlotte Quay and the area around the Sea Locks at Ringsend Dock was hardlandscaped and additional moorings were installed at Grand Canal Quay.  Jetties have been built at Mespil Road and Portobello, and 70 mooring bollards have been provided in the Dublin area.  A clean-out of the system has been undertaken in certain areas and the Dublin Port and Docks Board have kindly dredged outside the Sea Locks at Ringsend.  The fish stocking programme continues and fishing stands have been installed at specific locations on the system.  Tree planting has been carried out and a major planting programme along the system will be undertaken in the next few months.</P>
    <P>The cost of undertaking canal refurbishment works in the Dublin area last year amounted to some £0.6 million and the Deputy may be assured that every effort will be made to continue with canal improvement works as funding permits.</P>

      <P>The grant assistance of £1.1 million which has been approved, in principle, for the development of the Blanchardstown Arts Centre, was approved under the cultural development incentives scheme (CDIS) which my Department is administering under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99.  I am also aware that it is proposed to develop a library and council offices on an adjoining site and that both projects are being designed in an integrated way by Fingal County Council.  However, in order for the project promoters to avail of the grant assistance offered under the CDIS they must be able to satisfy me that the centre can be fully completed in 1999.  It is essential, therefore, that the project proceeds to the construction phase as soon as possible.  While progress to date has been relatively slow, I have recently agreed a timetable for the development of the Arts Centre project which, if achieved, will see the site works for the project being undertaken later this month, and the project completed within the timeframe of the operational programme.  Responsibility for the library and council office elements of the overall project rest with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and Fingal County Council respectively.</P>

      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I am conscious of the need to maintain and enhance the existing character and attractiveness of the Grand Canal at this location. In the past year, two community employment schemes have been established to upgrade the Grand Canal in the Clondalkin and Ballyfermot <Col N="614" /> areas.  These schemes employ some 30 people and they are aimed at enhancing the public amenity aspect of the canal by landscaping works, including tree planting.  At present a survey is being undertaken to identify species suitable for planting on this section of the canal.</P>
      <P>Whilst there are no capital works scheduled for this section of the canal, a maintenance contract is in place for grass cutting and the removal of light litter.  In addition, a contract was placed again this year for the cutting of weed from the canal bed.  My Department is also considering a proposal from Dublin Corporation to install a cycle path along the stretch of the canal from the third to the eighth lock.</P>
      <P>There is active community interest in the enhancement and development of the canal as an urban amenity and officials from my Department remain in close contact with the various community groups to consider how best this can be achieved.  In July of this year a canal community festival was successfully held in the area.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that disability is placed on the agenda of every Government Department and public body.  In this regard, the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities will constitute the foundation on which the Government's future policy on disability will be based.  The implementation of many of the report's recommendations would impinge on all Government Departments to some degree and an interdepartmental task force is currently preparing a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the report.</P>
      <P>It is in the context of the implementation of the report's recommendations, based on the plan of action as approved by the Government, that I would envisage, in the main, the advancing of disability issues in the various Government Departments and public bodies.  The task force is expected to present an interim plan to Government shortly and it is my intention to have the final plan of action completed as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been assigned responsibility for monitoring achievement of the quota in the public service and this matter will be pursued with determination in the coming months.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with special responsibility for Equality and Disabilities, Ms Mary Wallace has already been in contact with Government Ministers concerning the achievement of <Col N="615" /> the 3 per cent quota for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has written to Government Ministers seeking to progress the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. She has also met with a number of Ministers whose areas of responsibility are of particular relevance to the lives of people with disabilities with a view to developing effective cross-departmental working mechanisms.  An indication of the success of this approach is that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in conjunction with her, recently announced funding of £4,325,000 towards capital grants which will directly benefit people with physical and sensory disabilities and voluntary agencies.  This funding will enhance the opportunities for people with disabilities to achieve independent living and community integration.</P>

      <P>Under the Explosives Act, 1875 a licence is required to be issued by my Department for the importation of fireworks.  It is <Col N="623" /> a long-standing policy that such licences are only issued for organised fireworks displays conducted by competent, professional operators.</P>
      <P>Despite this restriction, fireworks are imported illegally into the State, particularly in the Hallowe'en period.  Much of what comes in is of dubious quality.  The Garda authorities are aware of the problems that can arise at this time of year, and a number of measures are taken to counteract the problem.  These include: the allocation of additional resources to deal with the fireworks problem; attention to known trouble areas; liaison with other services; alerting the public to the dangers surrounding the improper use of fireworks.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Garda in recent years have been successful in confiscating substantial amounts of illegally imported fireworks.  Prior to Hallowe'en this year, the Garda with the assistance of the customs and excise personnel, made considerable seizures of these fireworks, including one in north Dublin with an estimated street value in excess of £500,000.</P>

As they did not have such permits they were refused leave to land.</P>
    <P>Questions regarding the issue of work permits are matters for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>In so far as the granting of leave to land is concerned the position is, as I have said already, that the statutory conditions which must be met are set out in the various orders made under the Aliens Act, 1935.  Once persons satisfy immigration officers that they meet those conditions, leave to land is granted including to those coming here as au pairs and intending to follow courses of study.</P>
    <P>Three Estonians have been refused leave to land since 1 January 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 337, 339 and 340 together.</P>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware that primary responsibility for the administration of the Cohesion Funds, the Operational Programme for Transport and the Operational Programme for Environmental Services rests with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Infrastructural investment under these programmes reflect Government and EU priorities in both the transport and environmental services areas and are aimed at supporting all sectors of the economy including tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 the monitoring committee for the operational programme for tourism asked its independent external evaluator, in separate exercises, to <Col N="629" /> examine the links between investment under the tourism operational programme and infrastructural investment under the transport operational programme and the environmental services operational programme.  In both cases the external evaluator reported that there was overall coherence and co-ordination between the operational programmes.  In the case of transport, the external evaluator concluded that support for Irish tourism under the operational programme for transport was generally satisfactory and in the case of environmental services, the overall conclusion was that investments were being directed in a way which enhanced and protected the tourist environment.</P>
    <P>These external evaluator reports were also forwarded to monitoring committees for the transport and environmental services operational programmes and to the relevant consultants engaged to undertake the mid-term evaluations of those operational programmes.</P>
    <P>In furtherance of co-ordination in these areas, my Department is represented on the monitoring committees of these operational programmes. Similarly, a representative of the Department of the Environment and Local Government attends the monitoring committee for the tourism operational programme.</P>
    <P>Specifically in relation to the identification and prioritisation of key tourism roads, I take it that the Deputy is referring to the non-national roads programme under the transport operational programme. In this regard I understand that the Department of the Environment and Local Government has instructed local authorities to consult with Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development to ensure that priority non-national tourism roads are identified and included in submissions for assistance made to the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>Arising from concern about the possible impact of increasing tourist numbers and consequent congestion in certain tourist locations in Ireland and conscious of a recommendation in the mid-term evaluation of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, the monitoring committee for the OP decided at its meeting in May 1997 that the external evaluator for the programme should commence a research phase of a possible new tourism and environment initiative. The purpose of the research was to assist in the formulation of an appropriate policy response and co-ordination mechanism whereby the development of Irish tourism in an environmentally <Col N="630" /> sustainable manner can be ensured for the future; and to develop a framework for the implementation of an initiative on a pilot basis to include recommendations on the appropriate administrative mechanisms and the type of activities which might be funded.</P>
      <P>In July 1997 the monitoring committee for the Community Support Framework for Ireland, in the context of its review of all CSF operational programmes and recognising the importance of this issue, decided that 3 MECU European Regional Development Fund funding should be earmarked from within the Tourism Operational Programme to address on a pilot basis congestion issues in areas of high tourist demand.</P>
      <P>At its meeting this month, the Tourism OP monitoring committee will consider the research from its external evaluator and decide how, in light of the CSF monitoring committee decision, the tourism and the environment pilot project might proceed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 353, 372 and 425 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced in October 1994 on a pilot basis and has since been extended to some 27 schools of nursing in association with local higher education institutions.  The programme is funded by the Department of Health, at a cost of some £13 million in 1997. Accordingly, the question of student fees does not arise.  Successful completion of the three year <Col N="635" /> programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health has been engaged in consultations with a number of third level institutions in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which would be open both to nurses who complete the new education and training programme and to nurses who qualified under the traditional model of education and training.  The purpose of these programmes is to provide those members of the nursing profession who wish to obtain a post-registration qualification at degree level with an opportunity to do so by means of a one year part-time programme. The first such programme was offered by Dublin City University earlier this year and I understand that Trinity College Dublin proposes to offer a similar part-time programme from February 1998.  Being part-time programmes, the nurses involved are entitled to claim tax relief on their course fees.</P>
    <P>The National University of Ireland, Galway is proposing to offer a one year degree programme, on a full-time basis, from January 1998.  The present position is that the Higher Education Authority has discussed the proposed course with the National University of Ireland, Galway and has asked the university to align its proposal with the approach adopted in the other colleges.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible students, who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years' duration, at approved third level institutions.</P>
      <P>Repeat students and students who are pursuing a second period of undergraduate study at the same level do not, in general, come within the definition of an eligible student.  This condition may be waived in exceptional circumstances, such as cases of certified serious illness.</P>
      <P>I understand that the student in question had already commenced a science degree course in the National University of Ireland Dublin which he withdrew from during the second year of the course.  Accordingly, the student in question would generally not be eligible for free tuition fees in respect of the first two years of his new course at Trinity College Dublin.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of the number of pupils from Dublin 8, Dublin 12 and Dublin 6W availing of his Department's psychological service; if he will give details of the number for each school; and if he will give details of the average waiting time for an appointment in this regard.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 and 357 together.</P>
      <P>The details requested in the two questions relate to assessments and diagnoses made by members of my Department's psychological service. In addition, pupils in the named areas may also be assessed and diagnosed by remedial teachers, guidance counsellors, vocational education committee psychologists and health board psychologists.</P>
      <P>Work with individual pupils is only one part of the work in schools of my Department's psychological service.  A major objective is to develop a preventive approach towards the management of developmental difficulties in children.  In addressing those difficulties which are experienced by some pupils, indirect or group approaches can represent the most effective use of resources. Some school principals opt for such approaches in preference to individual assessment work with pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the psychologists engage in advisory work which is of benefit to all pupils, for example, advice on the management of behavioural difficulties, gathering of data in relation to the granting of concessionary teaching posts, advice on provision for guidance and remedial education in post-primary schools, help with the introduction of special programmes of <Col N="637" /> personal, social and health education, help with the implementation of the recommendations in psychological reports.</P>
    <P>In the post-primary sector, pupils who are referred directly to the area psychologists can normally be seen within two to three weeks.  The primary psychologists do not keep waiting lists. Each school is contacted regularly and a time <Col N="638" /> allocation for the current school term is negotiated. Psychologists try to ensure that each school receives some service each term but, depending on current needs, some schools will have more time allocated than others in any particular year.  In consultation with the psychologist, each school principal prioritises those pupils who are to be seen individually.  Referrals deemed to be urgent will be dealt with in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Post-primary schools &mdash; number of pupils seen individually in schools</P>
    <P>Note 1.  All secondary schools in Dublin 6W, 8 and 12 are assigned to psychologists from the Department of Education.  Vocational schools have their own psychological services.</P>
    <P>Note 2.  GLD stands for General Learning Difficulty; SLD stands for Specific Learning Difficulty.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of the average number of hours per week that pupils attending primary and secondary school in Dublin 8, Dublin 12 and Dublin 6W have access to a remedial teacher; and if he will give details of the number for each school.</Quest>

      <P>Of the 55 primary schools in the Dublin 6, 8 and 12 areas, 47 schools have a remedial teacher service.</P>
      <P>Some of the schools in question have more than one remedial teacher post.  In other cases, a remedial teacher is shared between a number of schools.  A total of 47 remedial teachers are in place and each delivers 28.3 hours service per week.</P>
      <P>The number of hours remedial tuition received by individual pupils will vary depending on their level of need and the number of children requiring the service at any given time.  Where the service is shared by a number of schools, the division of the remedial teacher's time is determined by agreement between the schools involved.  The authorities of second level schools may appoint remedial teachers within their approved teacher quotas.  My Department does not have detailed information in relation to the school authorities which have done so.</P>
      <P>Ex-quota remedial teachers in second level schools are required to devote at least 12 hours and not more than 15 hours per week to recognised remedial education work which would involve work with class groups of not more than 16 pupils, with small &ldquo;withdrawal&rdquo; groups and on an individual basis; approximately three hours per week to testing and diagnosis, contact with parents and acting as a resource person for other teachers who may be concerned with pupils receiving remedial education; the balance of weekly teaching hours to ordinary classroom teaching.</P>
      <P>Details of the primary and second level schools in the areas mentioned by the Deputy which have a remedial service, are as follows:</P>
      <P>The following primary schools in the areas referred to by the Deputy have the services of a remedial teacher</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the school transport scheme, eligibility is determined by the distance from the pupil's home to the nearest appropriate school.  This distance is measured by Bus Éireann, taking the shortest traversable route.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann recently examined the matter and have advised my Department that the pupil in question resides 2.6 miles from his appropriate post-primary centre.  As this is less than the required distance of three miles, he is not deemed eligible for transport under the post-primary school transport scheme.</P>
      <P>However, my Department would be prepared to consider allowing this pupil avail of concessionary transport, at £37 per term.  Concessionary tickets are issued subject to there being accommodation available after all fully eligible pupils have been catered for, and provided no extra State cost is incurred.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 and 361 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1997 the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the <Col N="642" /> demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am not in a position to allocate additional home-school-community liaison co-ordinators or teacher counsellors to primary schools.</P>
    <P>I reassure the Deputy, however, that I have asked my Department's inspectorate to investigate the needs of the emotionally disturbed children referred to by him as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>As a rule primary school transport routes are planned so that no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point.  Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way to convenient pick-up points along the main route.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of Goirt Móir national school on 30 September 1996 was 14 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal only for the current school year, similar to the staffing level at the school for the 1996-97 school year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are 103 one teacher primary schools with ten or more pupils in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> The school mentioned by the Deputy is included in this number.</P>
    <P>Since there are no teaching posts available to me from the 1997-98 demographic dividend for allocation to these schools, I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to one teacher schools.</P>

      <P>Pupils from the Ballacolla area reside in the Ballinakill catchment area and are eligible for transport to the post-primary school in their own area.  Those pupils from the Ballacolla area who reside in the Ballinakill catchment area and attend St. Fergal's, are eligible for catchment boundary transport to Rathdowney.</P>
      <P>A special arrangement was made in 1991, whereby existing pupils from the Ballacolla area were allowed full transport to Rathdowney.  This involved a temporary revision of the catchment boundary with the agreement of my Department and the schools involved.  However, this applied for a nominated list of 23 pupils only, and excluded younger members of the families concerned.</P>
      <P>This arrangement ceased at the end of the 1995-96 school year, when the last of these pupils completed their post-primary education at Rathdowney.  I regret, therefore, that it is not possible to reintroduce this arrangement, as it would constitute an encroachment into another post-primary catchment area.</P>

A steering committee, representative of the partners in education, the Garda, the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has been established to oversee the initiative.</P>
      <P>Educational resource materials were pilottested in a group of 26 primary schools, in urban and rural areas, during the school year 1995-6. The pilot-testing was accompanied by a special inservice training programme for the teaching staffs concerned.  The dissemination of materials and the associated inservice training are now being extended to the schools in the 13 priority areas identified in the first report of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs.</P>
      <P>A national project officer for the programme has been appointed and the materials and associated inservice training will be available to primary schools generally during the 1998-9 school year.</P>

Allied to the question of need is an assessment of the viability of the proposed school into the future.</P>
      <P>Practical support for gaelscoileanna is demonstrated through the payment of increased capitation grants for pupils in these schools, allowing a more favourable pupil teacher ratio compared with ordinary schools, and paying allowances to teachers who teach through Irish.  Furthermore, my Department provides increased refund of rental of accommodation costs and grants 100 per cent of the cost of site acquisition and the provision of new buildings or extensions/renovations to existing buildings for gaelscoileanna.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that the Commission on School Accommodation Needs is at present examining the most appropriate criteria for the recognition and resourcing of national schools, including all-Irish schools.

      <P>The Gaelscoil authorities have identified a site which is owned by Cobh Urban District Council and have requested my Department to purchase this site in order to construct a new school building thereon.  Before agreeing to proceed with this option, however, there is an onus on my Department to establish whether there is surplus existing school accommodation which could be made available for use by the Gaelscoil.  This possibility is being actively pursued at present.  My Department is in contact with Cobh Urban District Council on this matter.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.</P>
      <P>These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.

      <P>The current position is that all voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme with 200 pupils or more and all primary schools with 195 pupils or more receive financial assistance, in the form of capitation grants, towards the cost of both caretaking and clerical services.  The cost in 1997 of this assistance will amount to £4.8 million in the secondary sector and £4.9 million <Col N="651" /> in the primary area.  In addition the 1978 scheme for the provision of clerical assistance to certain secondary and primary schools will cost £2.9 million for secondary schools and £3.3 million for primary schools this year.</P>
      <P>The additional cost of extending the scheme of capitation grants to provide secretarial and caretaking services to all schools in the secondary sector would amount to £0.2 million while the additional cost in the case of all primary schools would amount to £6.06 million.</P>

      <P>My Department provides capitation grants towards the day to day running costs of primary schools.  The standard rate of grant currently stands at £45 per pupil.  The position is that the State grant is being supplemented by a local contribution.  Traditionally, at least 25 per cent of the capitation grant had to be paid.  Since 1995, however, this local contribution has been frozen at a rate of £10 per pupil, or £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The State is obliged under the Constitution to provide for free primary education and to ensure that such education is available to children.  This is achieved through the partnership between State and local community which is expressed in the State grant combined with the local contribution. In this context, I do not view the local contribution towards the education of children as a questionable practice.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the funding of primary education will continue to receive a clear priority in the allocation of resources in line with the commitment given in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <P>From the beginning of the school year 1994-95, in accordance with the then existing Programme for Economic and Social Progress, provision was made for a six year cycle of post-primary education.  In addition to the normal junior cycle, this allowed for a three year senior cycle, to include the transition year programme which is now available to all second level schools.</P>
      <P>The existing three-year junior cycle curriculum offers a broad range of subjects which affords schools ample flexibility to develop pupils' abilities consistent with each school's own range of subject options and pupil needs.  However, within the context of a six year cycle of post-primary education for all, a four-year junior cycle option would preclude access to a transition year programme or, where TYP is not offered, the repeat of the second year of a leaving certificate programme. The mission statement of the transition year programme, which was followed by 24,298 pupils in 501 schools in 1996-97, is to provide education for maturity by promoting the personal, social, educational and vocational development of pupils.  It enables them to experience new subjects-curricular areas, some of which they may not have been able to study in the junior cycle.  It also prepares them to take a two year leaving certificate programme in one of its three orientations viz.  established leaving certificate, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied, according to their abilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the junior cycle curriculum with its wide choice of 25 subjects and the transition <Col N="653" /> year programme which enables each school to design its own individual programme, both give schools appropriate flexibility in developing their pupils.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 386, 411 and 414 together.</P>
      <P>I announced on 18 July last that my objective is to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third level system of university and technological education.  I further stated that the diversity of institutions and separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained so as to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements.</P>
      <P>I also announced that I agreed with the need to change the title of regional technical colleges, incorporating the common feature &ldquo;Institute of Technology&rdquo; as recommended in the report of the high level group on the technological sector. The exact details of the title changes will, of course, be subject to further consultation.</P>
      <P>A consultation process is now under way and I hope, following the conclusion of this process, to publish legislation as early as possible next year which will provide for the co-ordinated development of the technological sector, in a coherent fashion, and enhance its contribution to national and regional development.</P>
      <P>I am giving this matter priority but, pending the conclusion of the consultative process, I cannot be more precise about the timing of the publication of the legislation.</P>

      <P>There are a number of students who are not attending school because they have been expelled or otherwise excluded from school.</P>
      <P>The selection and enrolment of pupils in primary and secondary schools is, in the first instance, the responsibility of individual school managerial authorities.</P>
      <P>Under the rules for national schools, no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
      <P>At second level, the managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.  My Department has issued &ldquo;Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline&rdquo; together with &ldquo;A Suggested Code of Behaviour and Discipline&rdquo; to all schools.  These guidelines stress both the need for proportionality of response to incidents of misbehaviour and the use of expulsion only as a last resort.  Circumstances will vary from school to school, and it is only those initimately involved with a particular school who can draw up the details of a code of discipline appropriate to that school.</P>
      <P>It is open to parents who experience school placement difficulties to seek assistance from my Department in securing an alternative school placement through the involvement of the Inspectorate in a consultative process with school authorities.  My Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils with special needs in order to identify the most appropriate provision for such students.</P>
      <P>Programmes such as youth encounter projects and Youthreach are designed to cater for pupils whose needs can best be dealt with outside of the mainstream school system.</P>
      <P>Proposals aimed at addressing the issues relating to pupil exclusions and school attendance are under consideration within my Department at present, and will be addressed further in the context of forthcoming legislation.</P>

      <P>The breaking the cycle pilot project was launched in response to detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.</P>
      <P>Among the key issues raised by the studies was a concern that under the previous selection criteria, the disadvantaged areas scheme did not have due regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage. It was recommended that the criteria used in selecting schools for support be amended to better reflect educational disadvantage as manifested in rural as well as urban settings.  It was also recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre, which was charged with devising the selection criteria and selecting schools for inclusion in the project, concluded that the project should have an urban and a rural focus.</P>
      <P>It recommended that the urban element of the scheme should focus on schools in the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  In the case of the rural schools, it recommended that the focus should be on all schools with fewer than five teachers.</P>
      <P>A total of 33 urban schools and 123 rural schools have been selected to participate in the breaking the cycle pilot project.</P>
      <P>The ERC has been commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of both dimensions of the pilot project.

      <P>The Department of Education established a schools psychological service for second-level schools in the autumn of 1965.  All schools in this sector have a psychologist assigned to them, regardless of whether they have disadvantaged status or not.  Psychological advice to pupils, parents and teachers is provided as time and resources allow.</P>
      <P>A pilot project, staffed by four psychologists, to develop a psychological service for primary schools commenced in 1990, and a further ten psychologists were appointed in 1995 in order to allow for the expansion of the Department of Education's psychological service to primary schools.  As staffing did not permit the provision of a service to all national schools, it was decided to assign these psychologists, as a matter of priority, to national schoools serving disadvantaged areas in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick. In addition, national schools in the original pilot project in West Tallaght-Clondalkin and South Tipperary continue to have access to the psychological service.</P>
      <P>It is my policy that the schools psychological service at both levels will be expanded so that all pupils shall have access to it.  This will proceed on a phased basis as resources permit.  I have established a planning group for the national educational psychological service, and this will report to me in early 1998.</P>

      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium recognises that disability is one of the most important issues facing Ireland today.  In keeping with this view, the Government has attached key importance to the implementation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
      <P>To ensure progress in this area, a monitoring committee comprising representatives of Government Departments, the social partners, organisations representing people with disabilities, their families and carers and service providers, is monitoring implementation of the commission's recommendations.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental group is also in place to assist the work of the monitoring committee.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will make a full and positive contribution to the work of these groups in pursuing the objectives of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of my own Department's role, the priority focus will be on: ensuring the availability <Col N="659" /> of special educational support services to all children with special needs, as far as possible in their own local areas; ensuring that such services facilitate the maximum possible level of integration of special needs children into mainstream schools, while at the same time providing the necessary supports for children for whom placement in special dedicated facilities is the more appropriate response and on ensuring access to special support services for all such children, including where necessary the provision of special transport arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the entire spectrum of special needs provision to ensure that all available resources are targeted to maximum effect.</P>

As under 15 year olds fall outside the remit of the Youthreach programme, my Department was not in a position to approve this project which was proposed by the Town of Bray Vocational Education Committee.  The position was explained in a recent letter to the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>This letter also referred to a new initiative to cater for the needs of young people at risk in the eight to 15 year age group.

They are currently availing of concessionary fare-paying facilities from a pick-up point 2.2 miles from their home.  Unfortunately, this family would not benefit from the alternative service, as the bus does not travel along their road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>An evaluation of the vocational training opportunities scheme carried out by consultants some years ago identified a number of shortcomings in the adult education system that could have an adverse effect on the VTOS.  These included the limited availability of the guidance and counselling service dealing with vocational and educational issues for adults in general and, more specifically, for unemployed adults and those dependent on social welfare incomes.</P>
      <P>Among the recommendations of the report was that there should be a more widespread availability of pre-VTOS provision, including information and guidance activities.</P>
      <P>The present position is that a number of VTOS centres are using their pay budgets to pay guidance and counselling personnel as part of VTOS staffing.  Others draw on the services of a guidance counsellor from a local vocational education committee school.  Where VTOS forms part of a vocational school's provision, participants are able to draw on the services of the resident regular school guidance counsellor.</P>
      <P>Over the years since the establishment of VTOS in 1989, VTOS co-ordinators have gained guidance and counselling skills on the job as they have had to deal with a wide range of participants' personal, social and academic issues.  Many have taken part-time extra-mural courses in guidance and counselling on their own initiative.</P>
      <P>The National Centre for Guidance in education and the national co-ordinator of VTOS are currently engaged in preliminary discussions with a view to providing enhanced guidance training for VTOS personnel.  The centre also plans to issue a handbook on guidance for adults with particular reference to VTOS students.</P>
      <P>As part of the mid-term review of the use of European Union Structural Funds, a new measure for guidance counselling and psychological services for Youthreach and traveller training centres will be available in 1998.</P>
      <P>These provisions are supplemented by initiatives on the part of such national and local employment support services as FÁS, the area-based partnerships and the local employment service.</P>
      <P>The availability of guidance services in the adult education sector generally and the need for an enhanced and co-ordinated provision will be one of the issues to be dealt with in the forthcoming Green Paper on adult education.</P>

      <P>As part of my ongoing review of the higher education grants scheme, I am considering the administration of the scheme which was identified as being fragmented, cumbersome and very confusing for grant applicants, in the report of the advisory committee on third level student support, chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitléir, which was published in February, 1995.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee identified overlaps and duplication with up to 70 different organisations involved in the administration of the grant schemes.  It also found that payments were too frequently delayed and that students were often disadvantaged by various administrative problems in the system.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the current administration of the student support schemes must be improved.</P>
      <P>Apart from reservations about the need for a new body I have an open mind as to what the best and most appropriate options are for a new centralised system.  A joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has begun an examination of various options and the possible role of that Department in any new system.  I expect to have a report and recommendations in the matter towards the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="664" /> When I have the report I will give it full consideration with a view to having any recommendations for improved and more efficient and effective administrative arrangements implemented as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department will consider a proposal from students affected by the sudden closure of Advanced Technology College, Dublin for a tax allowance to counteract the personal losses of between £2,000 and £3,000 in fees suffered by students through no fault of their own or to offer a similar credit to encourage the pursuit of a course at another college.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that the majority of students affected by the closure of Advanced Technology College have been facilitated to continue their studies on courses offered by Griffith College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The question of tax allowances is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I would point out that tax relief is available at the standard rate, on fees paid to private colleges in accordance with the provisions contained in section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995 and section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996. Under these provisions students can avail of tax relief at the standard rate on tuition fees paid in respect of full-time and part-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in such colleges, provided that both the college and the course satisfy Codes of Standards and are approved by the Minister for Education.  The courses offered by the Advanced Technology College were not approved under the relevant tax relief provisions.</P>
      <P>I also advise the Deputy that my Department is currently examining the various options available with a view to introducing legislation at the earliest opportunity to protect students and their parents against the collapse of private colleges.</P>

      <P>There are inevitably differences between the funding requirements of the various institutions in the technological sector.  Cost per student comparisons between colleges can be misleading particularly if a simple arithmetic approach of dividing total expenditure by student numbers is adopted.  The cost per student between colleges can be affected by a number of factors including the spread and nature of the courses, the relative balance between part-time and full-time students, the balance between laboratory and non-laboratory based activity, the level of provision for apprentices, undergraduates and post-graduates and the level and scope of participation in special EU programmes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 413, 416 and 417 together.</P>
      <P>In July 1996 the Government approved in principle the recommendations in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector.  In relation to the south east region the report recommended an increase in student places in what was then the Regional Technical College, Waterford, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title to Regional Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>Since the report of the steering committee was published the number of full time students in the college has increased to over 4,700.  Earlier this year the college was redesignated as the Waterford Institute of Technology.  New degree level courses in the areas of computing, financial services and administration have also been approved.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been put in place to carry through the process leading to the delegation of authority to the Institute to make awards, within a national qualifications framework.  This process is being carried out by a review team chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly which has begun its work and visited Waterford Institute of Technology as part of the process.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also note the vital work undertaken at sub-degree level by the Institute and the contribution being made by these graduates to economic development in the region and country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Institute has submitted to my Department a framework for its development and this is the subject of ongoing discussions with officers of the Institute.  An increase in degree level provision has been agreed for the 1997-98 academic session by my Department in the context of meeting the identified higher education needs of the southeast region.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1997 a non-refundable deposit was payable by students accepting a place in a regional technical college.  Credit for this deposit was only allowed where a student deferred entry to the course in question.  From 1997 no such deposit is required.</P>
      <P>Arrangements relating to deposits were a matter for the Central Applications Office in consultation with the colleges.  Following inquiries however, I understand that the student in question paid a non-refundable deposit when accepting a college place in 1994.  He subsequently deferred his entry to college to 1995 but did not take up his place or seek a further deferral.  In these circumstances the deposit is forfeited by the student.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the offer to pay for the extra service cannot be taken up as there is no provision in the scheme for such an arrangement. Such a provision would result in the level of service provided for pupils being dependent on their ability to pay.  This would be inequitable, and in conflict with the aims of the scheme.</P>

    <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.  The programme specifically states that one teacher <Col N="670" /> schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
    <P>I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying appropriate ways to fulfil this commitment.</P>

      <Quest>the funding, if any, which was provided for education and training for autistic children and people in County Limerick for each of the years from 1995 to date in 1997.</Quest>

      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services.  The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case.</P>
      <P>In some cases, children with mild features of autism are educated in ordinary schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial or resource teachers.  Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools, including schools catering for children with mental handicap and schools for children with emotional-behavioural disorders.</P>
      <P>The following special educational supports are provided at present in County Limerick: one special school for children with mild mental handicap; one special school for children with moderate mental handicap; four special classes for children with severe/profound mental handicap; six special classes for children with mild mental handicap in mainstream national schools; one special class for children with emotional disturbance in a mainstream school; 67 remedial teachers providing a service to 122 national schools, and two resource teachers providing a service to seven national schools.</P>
      <P>Because of the range of special needs, including autism, which are provided for under the above services, I am not in a position to indicate to the Deputy the proportion of overall funding provided for autistic children in County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated to the House that my Department is now commencing a review of the operation of a pilot programme of special education services for children with autism which was first introduced in Dublin and Ennis for the 199596 school year.  My Department will be consulting with the Irish Society for Autism as part of this process.  The review, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year, will provide a basis for the development of future responses to the educational needs of children with autism.</P>
