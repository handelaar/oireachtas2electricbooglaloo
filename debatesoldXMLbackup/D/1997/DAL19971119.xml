    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 4b on a Supplementary Order Paper, motion re Leave to introduce Supplementary Estimates [Votes 20, 31 and 41] and, subject to the agree ment of No. 4b, to take Supplementary Estimates in the following order: [Votes 31, 41 and 20]; No. 11, Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 1997, Second Stage (resumed); and No. 1, Turf Development Bill, 1997, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: No. 4b on the Supplementary Order Paper shall be decided without debate and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; and subject to the agreement of No. 4b, each Supplementary Estimate shall be moved and debated separately and the following arrangements shall apply in each case.  (i) The debate in each case shall not exceed one hour and at the conclusion of the debate on Vote 20 the three motions shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair, and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; (ii) The opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State, of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, and of each other Member called upon, shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; and (iii) A Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes in each case. <Col N="3" /> Private Members' Business shall be No. 21 &mdash; motion re.  Crime Policy (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two proposals to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 4b agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with this. However, before agreeing to it, I want to ask the Taoiseach whether he has made a firm decision as to when we will discuss the Estimates for next year.  In particular, will they include the result of the Government's mid-term review of the Structural Funds with particular reference to the need, in that context, to allocate funds to remedy the dangerous situation that exists on our rail network?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated last week that once the Estimates had been published, which they were last Wednesday, I would have no difficulty with the Whips agreeing to an early date on which to debate the Estimates.  All matters included in the Estimates will be debated and Members are free to raise any issues appertaining to the Estimates in the normal course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House unduly but will the Taoiseach not agree that it is meaningless to discuss the Estimates without knowing the result of the mid-term review of the Structural Funds?  Potentially, that will involve the reallocation of funds from one purpose to another.  Has the Government yet made a decision on the mid-term review of the Structural Funds and, in that context, has it looked at the situation in regard to rail travel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the issue of rail travel, there are resources for transport in the Structural Funds, as the Deputy knows.  No particular changes were made in the light of events that arose in the last two weeks.  I am sure that is what the Deputy is referring to.  As I understand it, the mid-term review of the Structural Funds was completed some months ago.  I will arrange for the Deputy to receive a briefing on that if he so wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government's decision on that matter be published before we discuss the Estimates?  Otherwise, the Estimates debate will not be meaningful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case.  Structural Fund allocations in each year are included on the backing basis in the various Estimates, so the Estimates will stand on their own.  As regards the mid-term review, I will ask the Department of Finance to give the Deputy any information he requires.  The mid-term review work has been completed so there is no difficulty in providing that information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended raising questions on the Order of Business in respect of the Estimates. However, in deference to the procedures, I will agree to this item on the understanding that on the general Order of Business I will be able to pursue the questions that have been initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I hope the remaining matters will be resolved and finalised this week.  That will allow the Minister for the Environment to complete the draft legislation.  He should have it next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the precise arrangements for debating the Estimates next week?  Will provision be made to ask questions on the same basis as the question and answer session on Committee Stage?  Will we be able to discuss the mid-term review of the Structural Funds which is an integral part of the Estimates, particularly the public capital programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated there should be an early debate on the Estimates, although I was not aware of a request to allow questions.  I understand the Whips are discussing the issue tonight.  We did not have a question and answer session on the Estimates in the House, although that did happen at the committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government taking a neutral stance on whether the Estimates will be debated at the committees or in the House?  If they are debated at the committees, which means a question and answer session, can the Taoiseach confirm that questions relating to the mid-term review will be admissible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem in principle with a general debate on the Estimates in the House.  It has been the practice for the past few years that the Estimates were debated here at <Col N="5" /> Christmas time and then went to the committees for a question and answer session.  That was a satisfactory system because it often took a day to get through the Estimates for one Department.  I see no reason Members cannot raise issues relating to the mid-term review during the general debate on the Estimates to which the Minister for Finance can reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Instructions are now being given to local authorities, such as South Dublin County Council, to prepare tender documents for various bypasses because the money for Luas is being abandoned in the mid-term review.  The Kinne-gad bypass has also been brought forward by informal, not written, instructions from the Department of the Environment.  Can we ask questions about these issues and get comprehensive and clear answers from the Minister for Finance?  I do not want the Minister to choose which questions he wishes to answer and which he wants to ignore at the end of a long and comprehensive debate, which is the format on offer from the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have answers to that at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have changed the system for debating the Estimates.  What is on offer is the system which has been there for a number of years.  People can still ask questions at committees and get detailed answers from Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not change our minds in the same way as this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect about Luas.  It has not been abandoned from the mid-term review.  I recall from Cabinet discussions that more money will be provided next year for Luas than there will be for planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought information from the Taoiseach on a number of occasions about when local elections will be held.  The Taoiseach has indicated a number of times that no decision has yet been made on whether they will be held next year.  I understand the Taoiseach made a speech in Dún Laoghaire recently where he indicated they would not take place next year. When does he intend to introduce legislation before the House to defer the local elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A formal decision has not yet been made on this matter.  I answered Deputy John Bruton's question earlier about the Bill on election funding.  I understand that other issues relating to the Department of the Environment, including local elections, will be dealt with in that Bill.</P>

Given that there has not been a debate on the report of the Inspector for Mental Hospitals for some years even though I understand it is an annual report, can the Taoiseach advance the publication of that Bill at least so that we can discuss more fully the issue of mental health?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £63,187,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment in the year ending 31 December 1997 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission and for payment of certain grants, subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid and for the payment of certain grants under cash-limited schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been a difficult year for farming and the funds proposed in the Supplementary Estimate will be used to support farm incomes and protect public and animal health.  Following fairly detailed negotiations, the European Commission <Col N="10" /> has given approval to a national system of agrimonetary compensation and a sum of £24.5 million is proposed under subhead J.6 for this purpose.  This will be financed entirely by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>This aid will be payable to producers who suffered losses arising from the November 1996 and January 1997 green pound revaluations and is broken down as follows: £15 million for the beef sector, £6.4 million for the dairy sector, up to £1.6 million for the cereals sector and £0.30 million for the sugar beet sector.  I need not remind Deputies of the difficulty experienced by cereal producers this year and the problems with the harvest.  The balance of £1.2 million will be used to relieve some exceptional cases of hardship for cereal and other crop growers.  The details will depend on the results of assessments under way and an appropriate transfer will be made from the agrimonetary subhead to the usual subhead for such measures, subhead J.2.</P>
    <P>In the structural area my aim has been to support existing commitments to on-farm investment.  Since 1994 the number of farmers completing work under the various farm investment schemes has been high.  This has been helped by attractive rates of grant, relative stability in farm prices and low interest rates.</P>
    <P>This year the level of completion has been maintained.  As part of the mid-term review of Structural Funds, an additional £28 million was allocated to farm investment schemes, which is available over the remaining years &mdash; 1998 and 1999 &mdash; of the current round of Structural Funds. In view of the significant level of ongoing investment by farmers, I am proposing an exceptional allocation of £15 million, which will be funded entirely from the Exchequer, to ensure that payment is made for all works completed in accordance with specification.  In addition to assisting the farming sector, these works protect the environment.</P>
    <P>I also propose to bring forward £9 million in headage payments under subhead M.4 which were initially to be paid next year.  This has, of course, had the effect of depressing the allocation set out in the recently published 1998 Abridged Estimates for my Department.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on disease control and eradication is an important area for my Department and I propose allocating £19 million to measures to combat brucellosis and BSE and for the disposal of meat and bonemeal produced prior to the introduction of even more stringent controls earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The issue of brucellosis has become one of major concern over the last year, not least the deteriorating disease position and the implications that this may have for trading purposes. Although we continue to have brucellosis black-spots, only four counties &mdash; Donegal, Leitrim, Louth and Carlow &mdash; have been brucellosis-free this year.  It is, therefore, fair to say that brucellosis is a nationwide problem which demands concerted and urgent national action.  This is <Col N="11" /> especially true when one considers the consequences for our export trade in agricultural products.</P>
    <P>The substantial increases in expenditure in 1997 on compensation payments to farmers under the disease eradication schemes is directly attributable to the dramatic increase in the brucellosis incidence since 1996.  The deteriorating position has been given major consideration by my Department and over the summer months was the subject of detailed discussions with the farming and veterinary bodies at the Animal Health Forum.  A number of interim measures have been put in place to address the problem.  These include milk ring testing on a monthly as opposed to the previous quarterly basis; the implementation of an intensive contiguous blood testing regime, coupled with detailed epidemiological investigations by departmental veterinary inspectors; the maintenance of a rigorous depopulation programme incorporating the early removal of reactors and an awareness and education programme.  It will also shortly be a legal requirement for all eligible animals sold through marts and from farm to farm to have been blood tested within the preceding 12 months.  The brucellosis compensation regime has been revamped.  In an effort to afford herd owners the opportunity to confidently buy pre-movement tested stock, the ICOS and their marts are running special catalogued blood tested sales.  The position will continue to be closely monitored.  If there is further deterioration I may have no alternative but to introduce further measures, including the tightening up of the pre-movement test requirement.</P>
    <P>The financial effects of the increase in BSE cases in Ireland which took place during the latter part of 1996 are also reflected in the shortfall of more than £5 million in the 1997 allocation for general disease control and eradication.  My Department arranged during the year for the disposal of stocks of meat and bonemeal which had built up from the existing scheme of depopulation and destruction of herds in which a case of BSE occurred.  The costs of this disposal are also reflected in the Supplementary Estimate of £8 million.  As the operation will take place close to the year end, I have also made a contingency provision in the 1998 Estimates for this purpose.</P>
    <P>A sum of £500,000 is provided in the Supplementary Estimate for the provision of a ferry service.  I am very pleased that service is working well and is well supported by the farming community.  I take this opportunity to ask the general agriculture industry, particularly the co-operatives, to support the ferry service.  Taxpayers' money was used to put initial seed capital into the project to get the service off the ground. Given the size of the agriculture industry, it would be a shame if the service was not well supported.</P>
    <P>Receipts from veterinary inspection fees show a significant decrease against the Estimate <Col N="12" /> because of a slow down in the level of live cattle exports.  The estimated savings of £0.5 million under subhead J.4 arise from start-up which has taken longer than anticipated and reflects claim amounts requested to date from local authorities to grant assist them in implementing the Control of Horses Act, 1996.  The implementation of this Act is extremely important, as was highlighted recently.  As well as implementing the control measures in the Act, the Department has supported a specific project in Cherry Orchard which will be helpful to that community.  It is a positive measure which will be operated in tandem with the control measures.</P>
    <P>In marketing and processing, the £400,000 proposed for subhead M.12 arises because FEOGA marketing and processing awards are made by regulation in ecu.  Some exchange losses are unavoidable over time arising from currency fluctuations between dates of payment to beneficiaries and receipt of funds from the Commission. The amount being provided this year is in respect of projects approved in the 1990-3 period, which are now completed.</P>
    <P>Teagasc has substantial bank borrowings accumulated over a number of years, currently in the order of £3 million.  The organisation is experiencing serious difficulties in attempting to balance its budget for 1997.  Since these difficulties emerged earlier this year, my Department has been maintaining strong pressure on the organisation to achieve a balanced budget, but despite remedial action the indications at this stage are that a deficit will result.  Teagasc will also have significant difficulties in balancing its budget next year.  In addition, Teagasc has significant ongoing capital investment commitments in the research and advisory area which add to the financial pressure on the organisation.</P>
    <P>Teagasc has identified major capital investment needs in the training area.  As a research and training organisation, Teagasc needs to consider modern systems of communication and of giving the best possible advice and education, particularly to younger farmers.  There is a network of Teagasc centres and agricultural colleges throughout the country.  It behoves Teagasc, as the national training and advisory body, to ensure modern informatics and telematics are used to the greatest possible extent to give the most up to date international information to our intelligent and ambitious farmers who will have to work in an internationally competitive environment in the future.</P>
    <P>An additional provision of £4 million is proposed under the losses subhead, L.2. The 1997 Estimates included a standard amount of £500,000.  The total losses are made up of disallowances of £2.4 million on the clearance of the guarantee accounts for 1993, a residual £0.8 million in respect of beef stock losses in the 1992 clearance and £2.4 million disallowed in respect of late payment of premia.  While it is encouraging to note the penalties are not on the scale of past beef fines and that Ireland's performance has <Col N="13" /> improved in absolute and relative terms, from the point of view of the taxpayer no penalties are acceptable.  Great efforts have been made and continue to be made to improve the protection of Union moneys managed by my Department.</P>
    <P>Since l996 the annual FEOGA account forwarded to the European Commission has been independently audited and a high level review group is in place to ensure all audit recommendations are implemented.  Yesterday on national radio I was delighted to hear a member of the EU Court of Auditors &mdash; a former Member of this House &mdash; commend named members of the Department of Agriculture and Food for their extraordinary competence in this area.</P>
    <P>A net supplementary of £3.289 million is being sought under my Department's l997 administrative budget.  This increase relates primarily to increased costs in overtime, travel, post and telephones, legal claims, accommodation and payments to temporary veterinary inspectors.  The increase in overtime, travel and payments to temporary veterinary inspectors is due in the main to increased activity at export meat plants.  There has been an increase of 12 per cent in slaughtering for cattle and beef compared to this time last year.  For EU accounts accreditation purposes we are required to rotate our staff at meat plants. This, with the deployment of staff for BSE control purposes at the Border to prevent the illegal importation of cattle and beef products from Northern Ireland, has led to increased costs for staff overtime and travel.</P>
    <P>The increase in post and telephone costs has resulted from the increase in the number of schemes, such as area aid and beef premiums, which has led to additional payments to farmers. There has been increased usage of mobile telephones and fax machines.  I do not know how people managed without mobile telephones until now.  Deputy Sheehan and I must operate without them in the peninsular areas of west Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The sooner the better we are linked to the national grid because we want to make ourselves heard.  The Department's commitments under the charter of rights for farmers led to an increase in our accommodation costs.  The improvement in staff accommodation in local offices is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past year has been difficult for some sectors of farming.  Prices for our main agricultural products have remained relatively stable.  The strong Irish pound in the earlier part of the year, which led to a number of green pound revaluations, contributed to some pressure on prices. Against this background, since coming to office in June I have sought to ensure EU and national supports take account of the need to maintain farm incomes.  I have also had to provide additional resources for animal disease eradication measures.  I am determined to complement the additional compensation provided with the <Col N="14" /> necessary policy changes to reduce animal disease levels and thereby protect the trading capacity of our industry and the livelihood of farmers.  I have provided additional resources for on-farm investment.  This is in line with the policy objective that Irish agriculture must become more competitive as we face further CAP reform and a more liberal world trading environment.</P>
    <P>I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would vote against the Estimate if I thought it would put pressure on the Minister to pay the headage cheques and the cow suckler grants owed to farmers since 31 October. However, I am realistic enough to know I would not be successful and many people are waiting for their cheques.  I am not happy with the manner in which the Department deals with headage cheques, nor with the Government's record on many agriculture issues since it took up office. Many promises have been broken since 6 June.</P>
      <P>We do not provide installation aid for young farmers or operate a grants scheme for the control of pollution.  This is the first time in many years farmers are not entitled to grants for farm buildings.  The mix up in the issue of headage grants to farmers is very contentious.  The Minister of State made a statement in the House yesterday.  While I find no fault with what he said, I do not believe it.  If the Minister has to conduct matters in the way the EU seems to have instructed him to do, 25,000 farmers will not be paid their headage payments by Christmas because, even if they worked 24 hours a day, it would be physically impossible for his officials to process the 25,000 maps that have to be validated between now and Christmas.  The only thing the Minister can do is get Brussels to allow him to pay the remaining farmers over the next seven or eight days on the basis of their 1996 dairy aid applications and make the clawback next spring. The Minister has 40 per cent of their money already.  People are infuriated.  I was at the mart in Tuam last Monday and I have never seen such bitterness, not particularly against the Minister but because people are not getting the money they were told they would get.  A political decision must be made quickly by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are again having problems with brucellosis. I accept what the Minister said.  I lived through this problem some years ago.  There is no dirtier disease.  BSE brought us to our knees, but nothing will bring a farming community to its knees like the contagious aspect of brucellosis.  Four counties have had huge outbreaks.  Many other counties, including my own, that have not had outbreaks for a number of years are suffering outbreaks this year.  Some farmers tell me that the decision to de-stock farms has not been taken quickly enough by veterinary officers.  That should be expedited.  Pre-movement testing takes time.  It is bad enough that we are tagged with the problem of BSE but if, in addition, we lose our <Col N="15" /> brucellosis free status it will be difficult to sell our meat and cattle anywhere.  If we are not to lose the brucellosis free status, the number of restricted herds must be fewer than 300.  If my information is right, we are within three of that number, with about 297 herds restricted.  If that is the case, we are in great danger.</P>
    <P>As a backbencher in the last Government I spent many hours consulting with people in the rendering industry.  Currently, we hear not a whimper from them.  Perhaps the Minister has a magic wand that solved their problems.  I was told that if the Government did not do something for them there would be cattle lying at the side of the road.  I told them at the time that no Government would give them a direct subsidy, which is what they were looking for, but that where the rendering trade was in a position to remove special risks material &mdash; the back bones and heads of dead and worn out animals &mdash; and have them delivered to the rendering industry, State aid should be provided to upgrade their premises.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify what has happened in that regard because that is a very important matter, particularly from an environmental point of view.</P>
    <P>The £24 million for agrimonetary compensation and weather damage measures is extremely important.  Regardless of what the papers say, this is not money for jam.  Any farmer who gets some of this money richly deserves it. The matter has been kicked around for a long time.  I cannot understand why we had to wait until now.  Those cheques should be put in the post tomorrow, now that clearance has been given.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's views on the roll-on/roll-off ferry and I am fully behind him.  Today we are talking about £0.5 million, but I understand it cost £1 million.  That is a vote of confidence in free trade.  Some carriers who believed they should never carry an animal are thinking about doing so now that there is competition.  On behalf of Fine Gael I call on the vested interests to ensure that they use the service.  It will be competition for the other carriers and, as time goes on, there will be no shortage of carriers.  It was because they thought they were the only fish in the pond that Pandoro decided to do what they did.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed with efforts to restore the live cattle trade to Cairo.  Earlier in the year there seemed to be no trouble.  Now there is trouble; otherwise the trade would have started.  What I cannot elicit from anybody is why the Egyptians can buy cattle from other countries but do not want to buy ours.  For some reason, they will not deal with us.  I understand that there is to be a debate in the Dáil soon on agricultural matters.  I would like the Minister to take that opportunity to outline in detail why it is that we cannot open that trade.  Whatever about cattle prices last year, small to medium-sized cattle got a very poor trade at the mart in Tuam on Monday.  We badly need an export outlet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> I note that there is a Supplementary Estimate of £0.5 million for Teagasc which is experiencing huge financial problems.  There was a subhead of £200,000 for private agricultural colleges last year which it was proposed to include this year. According to sources within the private agricultural college circle that was reduced to half with the intention to pay the other half later this year. Will that commitment be given, as some of our agricultural colleges have huge maintenance problems?  Some of them are in extremely bad condition <i>vis-a-vis</i> wiring, lighting, etc.  I am sure that is well documented in the Department. Before matters go too far the Minister should ensure that even that low level of maintenance is made available again.  I do not know whether Teagasc is trying to hijack the money, but let me make a strong plea on behalf of the private agricultural colleges that they should get their £200,000.</P>
    <P>We welcome the fact that the various subheads are going through at this stage, but we are sick and tired of what is happening in the context of headage and suckler cow payments.  If there is anything the Minister can do in the next week or ten days, it would be welcome.  There is no point in saying the cheques will be delivered by Christmas because we are on the countdown to Christmas now.  Some people will not get what is due to them until next January or February, and that is not good enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Supplementary Estimate for £64 million for the Agriculture and Food Vote.  It is important for agriculture, our largest industry, and I compliment the Minister on bringing it to the House.</P>
      <P>An additional £7 million is needed for bovine TB and brucellosis eradication.  A few years ago Ireland was a brucellosis free country because the eradication programme had been a success.  With the increase in the number of reactors there is a danger of losing brucellosis free status.  I am pleased with the measures the Minister has announced.</P>
      <P>Those involved in the eradication scheme must play a part to ensure Ireland becomes brucellosis free as soon as possible.  There has been and will continue to be substantial investment in it but we must ensure value for money.  It has been necessary for the Competition Authority to visit a number of major veterinary practices recently as part of an investigation into the scale of TB test fees charged by the veterinarians.  The level of fees has been a bone of contention for farmers. The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> suggested recently that the majority of veterinary practices affiliated to the IVU have been charging fees substantially in excess of those they receive from the Department for State work.  I look forward to a ruling from the Competition Authority on this issue as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also necessary to provide an extra £5.26 million for BSE compensation.  This disease has come to light in relatively recent times and if it is <Col N="17" /> to be addressed it requires a radical approach at EU level.  We must strive to make Ireland a BSE free area.  The disease must be eliminated and nothing less will satisfy our customers at home and abroad.  It will not be sufficient from the customer's point of view to rely on <i>post mortem</i> testing for BSE.  Ireland depends on the live export trade and we must be able to guarantee our foreign customers that all the live cattle exported are BSE free.  The measures being considered in foreign markets to extract the specified risk materials from animals is welcome.  However, it is only a short-term solution.  The only satisfactory solution is a test which may be carried out on live cattle before they are sent to the factory or are exported.  Some say that such a test is not possible but many things which were not considered possible ten years ago are taken for granted today.  I hope such a test will be automatic in years to come.  Not only will this satisfy our customers but it will open many new foreign markets for live exports, which will in turn bring competition to the meat factories in Ireland which have had it their own way in recent times.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £0.5 million to support the continuation of the live export trade.  The Government believes in the importance of the live trade to create competition in the beef market.  It is not a coincidence that the trade has started again since Fianna Fáil returned to Government and Deputy Walsh was appointed Minister.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to provide an additional £8 million to deal with the urgent measures to dispose of certain specified risk materials.  The original estimate for this item was £2 million.  We should not forget the mess created in the spring by the announcement with regard to the disposal of specified risk materials without ensuring adequate facilities were in place for the safe disposal of animal carcases.  This lack of planning almost brought the industry to a standstill last spring.  Above all I was horrified at the public health hazard in many parts of the country which followed directly from this lack of planning.  On 10 March I was sickened to see 13 dead cattle and two dead sheep dumped on a road near Kyletalisha dump outside Portlaoise.  The animals were there for over two weeks.  Such dumping happened in many counties at that time and those who dumped animals should have been identified and prosecuted.  Those with political responsibility were equally responsible through having created the situation.</P>
    <P>Through the Department of Agriculture and Food the taxpayer is contributing an additional £8 million to deal with this and related matters. Farmers must pay £9 per animal when they take cattle to a meat factory as their contribution to the scheme.  The factories should also make a large contribution to deal with the matter.  The Department should examine the possibility of licensing a second company to deal with the specified risk materials.  It is a matter of concern that one company should have a monopoly in this <Col N="18" /> regard.  A company in the south of the country should be licensed as this would help alleviate transport difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is a sum of £24.5 million made available to deal with weather damage and other matters.  Where severe damage has been caused by the weather support should be available. While driving to Dublin this morning I noticed a field of barley in County Kildare that had not yet been cut.  It will not be harvested at this stage. That crop has been lost due to the weather conditions and such losses are numerous throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the introduction of the European single currency.  Part of this Supplementary Estimate addresses green pound revaluations. They will not arise with the single currency and it will help bring about price stability.  Despite the recent publicity about payments to farmers and our booming economy, we must ask why so many people are leaving the land.  It is the only sector of the economy which people are leaving and there are implications for rural development.  The far away hills are not as green as some people think.  This is a priority for the Government.  I support the measures the Minister has announced and I urge the House to show its support for agriculture by supporting this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be too hard on the Minister but I may have to say a few unkind things.  Agriculture seems to be under attack from other sections of society.  After a very difficult year, what with the weather and the live export difficulties, the farming community expected the Government to stand by it.  If I had my way I would oppose this Supplementary Estimate.  The Estimates for next year propose a cut of £35 million or 9 per cent at a difficult time for farmers.</P>
      <P>I am not a farmer, having been born and reared in a town, but I come from an agricultural area and I represent small farmers in the west.  Reading the comment on the Court of Auditors report one would imagine all farmers were getting large subsidies.  One would not see a bullock in the west; the people are hardly able to feed themselves never mind the bullocks.  There are very few large farms in County Mayo.  Most of the farmers have poor quality land and find it difficult to make a living.  It was appalling last week to learn that the Minister could not retain this year's level of spending for next year but lost £35 million.  It is not acceptable and I hope that the Minister will be able to bring forward a Supplementary Estimate to make up the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is for the small farmers.  The large farmers are well able to look after themselves because they run big businesses and make large <Col N="19" /> profits, although they have also had a difficult year.  However, the reduction in headage payments must be condemned.  It was a proven supplement to farmers' income, one on which they depended &mdash; no matter how bad things were at least they got a headage payment.  The public, in particular the farmers, has lost confidence in politicians in Government and Opposition.  They were promised that headage payments would be made by 31 October.  They do not care about digitilization.  I do not blame the staff who work in difficult circumstances.  The Minister, Deputy Yates, spent £4 million to modernise the Department's offices in Castlebar through the installation of computers, etc.</P>
    <P>We are going backwards instead of moving forward.  Most payments had been made by this time last year.  Most farmers will not get this year's payments until next February or March despite the Minister's statement that they will be issued over the next three weeks.  Deputy Connaughton suggested yesterday that the payments should be made in regard to all area aid forms and if there are problems, the payments can be clawed back next year.  It is wrong to hold cheques.  Farmers depend on them to pay back those to whom they owe money.  The Minister should make the payments based on last year's area aid forms, starting tomorrow.  I hope the Minister will not implement the Kearney report on a piecemeal basis. Headage payments will be reduced next year and I hope farmers on contributory pensions will not be excluded from receiving headage payments.  A ceiling of £3,000 will then be implemented which will have to be fought to the bitter end.</P>
    <P>The media believes farmers have a pot of gold, but as soon as agriculture debates begin in the House, journalists leave the press gallery.  The only reference to agriculture in today's newspapers was the auditor's report from the European Union, which was bad news.  There was no reference to the poor farmers who did not get their headage payments or who have gone through difficult times because of the weather and problems with cattle exports.  Farmers take much of the blame because they are perceived to always complain, even when times are good, and that is why the public does not have sympathy for them.</P>
    <P>They are being attacked from all sides, including Brussels and Fianna Fáil.  The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and the Taoiseach signalled in recent months that the farming community would have to tighten its belt.  The strongest signal was sent out last week when the Minister was not able to convince the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues on the Book of Estimates.  He will lose £35 million in the budget at a time when agriculture is on its knees.  I remember the Ministers, Deputies Walsh and Cowen, making wonderfully elegant speeches in Buswell's Hotel in front of thousands of farmers.  They had all the answers and told farmers about the many payments they would receive.  I was disappointed Fine Gael did <Col N="20" /> not get back into Government but as a rural Deputy I believed farmers would be in for a bonanza.  That has not been the case and they cannot even get what they are due.  The Government has let them down on its promises, especially the commitment on headage payments, as has the Minister by not taking on the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Ring's comments and highlight the extreme concern in the farming community about the soundings from Government.  The Minister has the interest of farmers at heart but he is not able to convince the anti-farmer lobby within the Government.  Shock waves were sent out following the publication of the Book of Estimates &mdash; a cutback of £26 million on headage payments next year &mdash; and by the Minister for Finance's statement that consumers must be protected and farmers will have to take less for their produce.  They cannot take less because they are selling under cost.  The majority of farmers would much prefer to get a decent return for their produce than a cheque in the post.  However, it is EU policy to bring prices down to world price levels and farmers are complying with that.  They are selling below cost and as a result compensation must come into play.</P>
      <P>Thousands of farmers have been driven off the land and have had to seek alternative enterprises. They had the courage to provide the same standards for their families as those in the PAYE sector.  They found alternative jobs with local authorities and factories while their wives looked after the farm.  They were only just able to get by because the farm was still an added cost. However, compensation payments helped to allay the cost.  The Minister referred to means testing such farmers for compensation.  This is eviction by stealth.  He has got them off the land and will now take it from them.  We thought the days of evictions were over but recently a widow and her family were thrown on the roadside by a financial institution.</P>
      <P>People are moving into my constituency, buying land and planting it.  Afforestation is wide-spread and is backed by Government and EU policy.  It will have a downgrading effect on rural Ireland as families are driven into towns.  Life in rural Ireland is gradually being eroded and this policy comes from Brussels.  It is not good for Ireland and will have a serious knock-on effect. Will the Minister stand up to the bureaucrats pushing this policy which is supported by many of his ministerial colleagues, particularly the Minister for Finance who has the key to unlocking the funding that will help to sustain small farmers?  Farmers are decent, honest people seeking nothing more than to provide their families with the same standard of living as employees in the PAYE sector.  I am sick of the media referring to the millions flowing to farmers.  That is not the case and any money which has been received has been well spent and invested to improve farms and prevent pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> I draw the Minister's attention to an anomaly. The control of farmyard pollution scheme has been terminated.  At the same time farmers are being forced to take on the REPS to improve their farms to protect the environment.  Many cannot avail of REPS because the control of farmyard pollution grants are not available to them.  Not only are they losing the REPS, which provides a substantial grant from Brussels, but they cannot get the grant to make the necessary farmyard developments to house their stock over the winter months.  Will the Minister examine this anomaly and correct it?  Will he stand up to the anti-farmer lobby in Government which is glaringly against rural Ireland and small traditional family farms which have an important role to play in society?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from the same constituency as the Minister, I have no doubt he is aware of the serious implications for our agriculture industry, particularly in Cork South West.  While he is doing his best he will have to make a super-human effort if he is to hold the fort as far as the agriculture industry is concerned.  The Minister must lobby the EU at all discussions on agriculture to ensure there is no undermining of farm grants.  There will be opposition but he has the muscle and should have the clout to deliver to farmers the promises made in his election manifesto, on behalf of his party, earlier in the year. The Minister must take off the kid gloves, tackle the problem and be assisted by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, to ensure the goods are delivered to the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>We have some of the finest agricultural products in the world.  We have the distinction of having the best beef in the world yet we are not able to get that message across.  The Government must tackle this problem at source.  The Minister must make it clear that the millions of pounds we are getting for our farmers is utilised to the best extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are the only island nation in the European Union.  For that reason I urge the Minister to ask for preferential treatment at every agriculture discussion in Europe to ensure the maximum benefits are payable to our farmers.  I need not remind the Minister of the frustration in the industry.  In the Minister's constituency and throughout the western seaboard farmers in disadvantaged areas are frustrated as a result of the long delay in payment of suckler, headage and beef premium grants.  For some unknown reason the digitalisation of area aid maps is creating a huge difficulty in the Department of Agriculture and Food in this modern age, when computers can check everything from A to Z. It would be different if it had been the stroke of a pen or if calculations had to be done mentally.  In this day and age there is no reason for this frustration as far as area aid applications are concerned.  As regards getting through to the area aid office to hear when Mr. X or Mr. Y's case will be dealt <Col N="22" /> with, one could be telephoning until the cows come home.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and the frivolous objections which have arisen in the area aid office.  This should not result in a bleak Christmas for the unfortunate farmers in his constituency and throughout the west and south west.  The Minister is well aware they are relying on the cheque in the post from the headage grant to buy the Christmas dinner.  I urge him to clear the way immediately for the payment of headage, beef premium and suckler cow grants to all outstanding applicants, and thereby restore confidence and goodwill among farmers.</P>
      <P>I impress on the Minister the necessity to restore the farm installation aid grant.  I had experience of being with the Minister on several occasions at the presentation of certificates to 2,000 highly trained young farmers in Cork this year.  There was an air of frustration and despondency among them when they heard the majority of them would not qualify for the farm installation aid grant of £5,600.  Did the Minister consult Teagasc and, if so, is he aware of the serious fall off in applications from young farmers to take up courses in agriculture in 1998?  There is a serious drop in the number of applicants who are contemplating training in farming.  There is disillusionment among farmers and if the Minister wishes to restore confidence in young farmers he should restore the farm installation aid grant.  I am amazed he does not have more clout at the Cabinet table when we are told about the Celtic tiger&mdash;</P>

He must also restore the farm improvement grant and the farm pollution grants.  We cannot have a progressive REPs scheme unless farmers are given an opportunity to combat pollution in the farmyard.  How has the situation changed so much in the past six months given that he said, if returned as Minister, he would ensure those grants were restored before Christmas?  Christmas is fast approaching and no decision has been made.  The Minister must act before it is too late to ensure farmers can play their primary role in generating income for future generations.  The Minister should make his presence felt and honour the promises he made when he campaigned with me in south-west Cork.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister who was successful yesterday at the Council of Ministers' meeting in Brussels at which the Agenda 2000 proposals were further discussed.  Farmers are delighted that we have someone like Deputy Walsh in office.  We did well in the negotiations on the MacSharry proposals because our commissioner was involved.  I have no doubt that under the leadership of the Taoiseach and the Minister the position of farmers will be protected in the Agenda 2000 package. What is being said is soul destroying and causing disillusionment among the agricultural community.  There will be changes which may be for the better.  The Government is committed to the retention of full compensation payments in areas where adjustments will be required.</P>
      <P>The question of enlargement of the European Union is being looked at.  To date, the additional countries which have joined have not caused destructive economic problems for this country. The membership of the proposed new member states which are similar in size may benefit us. The World Trade Organisation negotiations will, however, cause greater difficulties for us than in the past.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about the shortage of killing capacity in the pigmeat industry, particularly in the north-east.  Proposals were advanced &mdash; the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Deasy had an input &mdash; to develop a modern pig processing industry which has grown to the point where capacity has increased from a figure of 2.2 million to four million pigs.  However, there is still a shortage of capacity.  To alleviate the problem I encourage processors who have received substantial grant-aid under this Administration to expand their facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the size of the multiples in the retail sector there is a need for large-scale operations. Up to 60,000 pigs per week are being killed in huge plants in Denmark and 40,000 in some parts <Col N="24" /> of the United Kingdom.  This is the trend in the industry.  Up to 10,000 pigs per week are being killed in some of our modern facilities.  Processors should be encouraged to expand their facilities to alleviate the difficulties caused for producers.  To avoid fragmentation existing plants should be expanded rather than new ones provided.  We have moved from the point where we had 38 plants to where we now have four or five modern plants which are doing well.  This has been to the benefit of the industry which has made progress. I want this to continue as it has led to the creation of employment and economic development in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank colleagues for their contributions to the debate on the Supplementary Estimate in which they were responsible and supportive.  An additional £64 million is being sought to provide further assistance to the farming community. Agriculture is our primary industry and we wish to assist it in every way possible.  Total exports amount to approximately £5 billion annually.  As there are virtually no imports this has a tremendous spin-off effect in the economy.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that £8 million has to be spent in the rendering industry.  I would prefer to spend this money on other developmental measures but the consumer has demanded that risk material &mdash; the brain and spinal cord &mdash; be eliminated.  We have no option but to process this at higher temperatures and dispose of it.  Aid is available from Forbairt for the improvement of equipment.  The industry has some of the most modern technology available.  This is important because we are the largest exporter of cattle and beef in the European Union.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the matter of payments.  These are not being made as quickly as we would like.  There is an annual audit.  We have to ensure there are adequate controls.  I give a personal commitment that payments due, for a turkey, goose or some other exotic food people want to have on their table on Christmas day, will be made as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £40,505,000 be granted to defray the charge <Col N="25" /> which will come in course of payment in the year ending 31 December l997 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health and Children (including Oifig an ArdChláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to health boards and miscellaneous grants.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to bring this Supplementary Estimate before the House.</P>
    <P>The gross additional requirement is for just over £65 million, the precise sum being £65,505,000.  This figure is partially offset by additional Appropriations-in-Aid of £25 million, giving a net figure of £40.505 million. This Supplementary Estimate takes account of the fact that £30 million of the total level of funding originally provided in respect of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal will not be required in the current year.</P>
    <P>I should explain that some £26 million of the requirement is of a once-off, non-capital nature, £46 million being recurring non-capital and £23 million related to capital expenditure.  When account is taken of the £30 million non-capital provision for hepatitis C which will not be required in the current year and additional Appropriations-in-Aid, the net sum required is £40.505 million.</P>
    <P>The additional moneys sought are necessary to adequately fund a number of items within the health service which have given rise to additional expenditure not foreseen or which could not be accurately computed when the original Estimate was passed.  The document circulated to Members gives the background to this Supplementary Estimate.  I intend to cover a number of the main areas but, within the time at my disposal, I cannot go through all the issues.</P>
    <P>Broadly, the items contained in this Supplementary Estimate fall into two categories.  The first relates to items where there is an inevitable degree of uncertainty in forecasting the actual costs in any one year resulting in the original Estimates not providing fully for these costs.  The agreed practice has been to seek supplementary funding in these areas when the actual amount needed becomes apparent during the year.  The items recognised by the Department of Finance as falling within this category are medical indemnity insurance, superannuation costs, PRSI costs and demand-led schemes which consist of the community drugs schemes and certain capitation payments such as the domiciliary care allowance.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on these items is influenced by a number of factors difficult to predict in advance. Increases in medical indemnity costs are related to growth in claims experience.  As Members will be aware, in common with all developed countries, ours has experienced a significant growth in the number and average cost of civil claims throughout our health services, leading to an additional funding of £3.2 million being required for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The additional superannuation costs for which funding is sought are occasioned by the age profile <Col N="26" /> of personnel in the health sector.  Agencies are experiencing an increasing number of retirements, including those opting for early retirement, leading to an increase in the annual budgetary requirement.  A sum of £5 million additional funding is required for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In relation to PRSI, modified social insurance status does not apply to workers recruited into the public service after 6 April l995.  This means that health agencies experience increased costs in respect of employers' PRSI contributions when recruiting such employees to replace existing staff.  This item requires additional funding of £4 million.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the community drugs schemes is a factor of the number and cost of claims under these schemes, again difficult to predict in advance.  As the House will be aware, there is a statutory right to relief for expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of the expenditure thresholds laid down.  There is an additional requirement of £10.9 million in respect of these schemes.</P>
    <P>The second broad category of expenditure arises from the need to meet special service needs and genuine once-off expenditure of a pressing nature.  In dealing with special service needs, it must be recognised that the health services, particularly in the acute hospitals sector, are influenced increasingly by technological advances and more expensive drugs regimes.  In this regard, some £3 million is sought to cover expenditure on high cost drugs, many of which are of a life-saving nature, when the cost associated with even one patient can be very significant.  Similar expense is being experienced in relation to blood products for haemophiliac patients, including paediatric haemophilia treatments.  Overall some £2 million additional funding is required for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Another important matter being addressed in this Supplementary Estimate is child care, in particular the problem of homeless children and those with emotional and behavioural difficulties who require special care and education.  Provision is being made for an additional £1.5 million for health boards, on a once-off basis, to cover unanticipated legal costs arising from court cases involving these children.  In addition, a total of £4.5 million is being provided on a continuous basis to cover the additional costs incurred by health boards in dealing with these children.  It will clearly be seen that we are providing more funding to deal with the problem rather than simply paying legal costs and are introducing specific measures intended to alleviate the problem itself. There is an urgent requirement for funding of £6.9 million to allow health boards to meet the increasing demand for subventions toward the cost of care of older people in private nursing homes.  This sum will fully fund the changes in nursing home regulations introduced in l996.</P>
    <P>The Government has also agreed to provide a package of funding, on a once-off basis, to meet pressing needs in relation to the disabled and the elderly.  A sum of £4.825 million is being provided <Col N="27" /> for the purchase of equipment, technical aids and appliances by voluntary organisations working with people with physical and sensory disabilities and with older people.  A further sum of £4.5 million is being made available for services for people with physical and sensory disability.  Most of this funding will be provided to allow voluntary organisations to eliminate historical funding deficits built up over the years.</P>
    <P>In response to the major problem of drug abuse, the Eastern Health Board has drawn up a comprehensive service development plan to meet the objectives of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs.  This plan allows for the expansion of services in the areas of drug prevention and education, treatment and rehabilitation at a cost of £5 million included in this Supplementary Estimate.  This funding will assist in discouraging young people from turning to drugs in the first instance and in addressing the needs of drug misusers presenting for treatment.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that expenditure in the current year in respect of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal is likely to be lower than originally anticipated.  A sum of £72 million was made available this year to cover the costs of claims made by the compensation tribunal, associated legal costs and those of administering the tribunal itself.  The volume of cases dealt with so far this year was not sufficient to use up the approved level of funding.  In order to expedite claims before the statutory tribunal which I established by order on 1 November I have made arrangements to facilitate the settlement of claims.  In addition, I shall be appointing four additional members to the tribunal in the very near future. A total of £42 million is available for the remainder of this year to cover the payment of claims and associated costs, including £15 million to cover payment of outstanding reparation fund claims where payment is requested this year.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also provides for an additional £23 million for my Department's capital programme.  The original capital allocation for l997 was £108.743 million.  The need for an increased provision must be seen in the context of the serious under-investment in the past, particularly when account is taken of the considerable asset base requiring to be serviced which had been estimated at in excess of £4 billion for the health boards alone.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of this under-funding over the years has been that health services providers have not been in a position to invest in the replacement of hospital equipment.  The demands for priority capital projects this year resulted in a further postponement of expenditure on urgently required equipment.  The point has now been reached at which it is just not possible to further postpone the purchase of essential equipment without damaging the fabric of these services.</P>
    <P>Provision is also included in the Supplementary Estimate to allow agencies undertake essential <Col N="28" /> works to address the serious backlog of fire prevention and maintenance works.  These are necessary to allow health agencies meet their legal obligations with regard to health and safety regulations.  The proper provision for equipment replacement and maintenance works were two issues I was particularly concerned to address.  I also intend making provision for these areas from the l998 capital budget.</P>
    <P>The original capital programme did not provide for the purchase by the North Eastern Health Board of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda because of uncertainty in relation to the timing of this funding requirement.  In the event, the transaction was completed this year and provision must be made for the necessary funding.</P>
    <P>Provision is also included in this Supplementary Estimate for the relocation of the Blood Transfusion Service Board to the St. James's Hospital site as a matter of the utmost urgency. Funding will be required also for the board's requirements in relation to information technology and vehicle replacement.</P>
    <P>Since assuming office I have been conscious of the challenges with which we are faced in managing a system as complex and dynamic as that involved in the administration of our health services.  Perhaps more than any other sector of the public services, health is influenced by constant technological innovation and new methods of service delivery.  While there are undoubted attendant benefits to such developments, almost invariably they are very costly.  This Supplementary Estimate clearly illustrates that point.  I am also conscious of the genuine pressures with regard to the needs of groups such as the mentally handicapped, physically handicapped and the elderly.  I am in discussion with the Minister for Finance with a view to addressing such issues in the context of the forthcoming budget and the multiannual budgetary framework for the health services.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate will greatly assist health agencies in meeting their additional costs and in addressing the need for immediate investment in key service areas.  The funding being sought demonstrates the Government's real commitment to adequately fund our health services. Accordingly, I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's contribution and have carefully examined the Estimates he has presented to the House.  To some extent, I am more engaged about what the Minister is failing to do in the announcements he is making today.  One issue that needs to be comprehensively addressed is the additional provision of £1.5 million to health boards to cover unanticipated legal costs arising from court cases involving what the courts have legally described as unruly children &mdash; children with a variety of problems. <Col N="29" /> A small number of parents who cannot care for their children due to their conditions are spending substantial sums of money sending them to England for the special facilities they require. That issue must be addressed on a more fundamental basis.  There has been a plethora of court cases, both against the State and against health boards, to require that the constitutional rights of these children to have their welfare protected be upheld.  It is extremely depressing that £1.5 million has to be allocated to meet the legal costs of health boards in being represented in these proceedings, which is what I presume the Minister is telling us.  It would be far more satisfactory if that £1.5 million were put into meeting, or partially contributing towards meeting, the cost of the new facilities and services required in this State to cope with children who have specific problems which currently fall outside the network of our health service.  Until the Minister comprehensively addresses that issue, further substantial costs will go to legal services instead of to making provision for these children.  I hope the Minister will have something of a more comprehensive nature to say about this issue in either the Estimates debate next week or in the context of the budget.  It is not satisfactory that the current approach in this area continues to be maintained.</P>
      <P>I said I would comment on what the Minister has not referred to rather than on what he has in this Estimate.  To date the Minister has failed, in a way that is unacceptable, to address an issue that was addressed by the last Government and which he is now putting on the long finger.  The cardiology and cardiac surgery waiting lists are growing.  It is outrageous that some individuals have waited for more than three years for cardiac surgery and, as the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> so well highlighted last Sunday, others have been waiting five or six years.  That is completely unacceptable in a modern western democracy as affluent as this State.  We are told people on cardiac surgery waiting lists are dying.  The figure for the numbers dying is disputed to some degree but it is clear that a number of people who have been assessed as requiring cardiac surgery are dying.  If they had a private health service available to them and the financial capacity to cope with that, some of these people would not die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last May the previous Government decided, as a result of an objective report by a departmental appraisal group, to establish a new additional cardiac unit in St. James's Hospital.  That unit was to provide 500 additional beds for cardiac surgery.  It is outrageous and unacceptable that the Minister cancelled that decision, that he continues to prevaricate on the issue as the cardiac surgery lists grow and that he has still not made any final decision on it.  It is outrageous because, when in Opposition, the Minister suggested his predecessor's decision to sanction the construction of this unit derived from some sort of short-term political gain relating to a general election.  Since entering office, the Minister has discovered his predecessor implemented a decision recommended <Col N="30" /> by an objective departmental appraisal group.  Deputy Michael Noonan, when Minister for Health, made that decision because of the urgency of addressing the cardiac surgery waiting lists.</P>
    <P>As he now enters his sixth month in office, the Minister has been reviewing, considering, appraising and reconsidering this proposal.  While he prevaricates, patients die and the cardiac surgery waiting list grows.  People who would have had cardiac surgery at an earlier stage as a result of the previous Government's decision have had it further delayed and their lives have been further endangered.  The Minister should not wait until budget day to announce, as if distributing sweets or lolly pops, that he has finally made a decision on a cardiac unit of this nature.  This issue is too serious to be dealt with in that way in the context of looking for plaudits at budget time about political announcements.  This is a life and death issue for many people.  It is also about the type of life they can currently lead because of the delays in surgery.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us he will reappraise the issue and may make some general announcement in the future.  To cover up the manner in which the Minister has reneged on his duty as Minister for Health in dealing with this issue, I have no doubt that when the announcement is finally made it will be dressed up with a number of other announcements about upgrades in other hospitals or other cardiac services.  There is a case to be made for upgrading facilities in Galway Regional Hospital, for example, but there is nothing to stop the Minister sanctioning the construction of the cardiac unit in St. James's Hospital allowing progress to be made &mdash; he has delayed progress by six months &mdash; and making whatever additional announcements are required to ensure there is a comprehensive service necessary to meet the need in this area.  It is scandalous and unacceptable that for no reasons other than party political jousting, the Minister cancelled the decision to construct the unit in St. James's.  He is conducting a review of an objective report from his own Department on this issue and, by so doing, delaying essential surgery.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about another matter.  In fairness to this Minister, successive Ministers for Health have had to wrestle with the waiting list problems in each of our hospitals.  As medical advances occur, illnesses that could not be dealt with in the past can now be addressed successfully.  The previous Government took substantial steps to reduce the waiting lists and also ensured that we knew the position of waiting lists on different aspects of medical care, particularly surgery in a number of areas.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Health last week that was answered yesterday to ask him to state the up to date position with regard to the waiting lists.  I know, as the Minister said in his reply, that waiting lists are updated on a quarterly basis.  The Minister should have available to him in his Department, and should have had available for reply to me <Col N="31" /> yesterday, the state of the waiting lists as at 30 September 1997.  For reasons of which I am unaware, the waiting list table made available to me, which was widely published over the weekend in advance of the answer to my question, stops at the end of June 1997.  Is the Minister trying to suppress knowledge of the manner in which the waiting lists have grown under his Ministry?  This House is entitled to know the latest quarterly figures.  If I seek an updated position on the waiting lists, which are assessed on a quarterly basis, it is unsatisfactory that that information is not made available when it is or should be available to the Minister.  I insist it be made available to me prior to the Estimates debate next week.  I would like an explanation as to why I have been given figures for June rather than the end of September.  My suspicion is that the Minister is not willing to reveal the state of the waiting list during the first three months of his occupancy of the Department of Health and Children.  I hope I am wrong in that and, if I am, I will apologise to him.</P>
    <P>We will return to many of the issues in the health area in the debates on the Estimates for next year over the next three to four weeks.  It is important we address the issues in a sensible way and on an informed basis.  However, Members, including the Minister, have a duty to ensure that we do not continue to develop a two tier health service, where those on public hospital waiting lists are denied treatment which those who can afford to pay for it or who are in the VHI can readily obtain.  We must ensure people's lives are not placed at risk where essential surgery is required.  It is the duty of the Minister for Health and Children to implement policies to ensure that.  In so far as the Minister does that he will have support from this side of the House, but if he reneges on his duty and fails to establish necessary facilities for which there is finance and fails to deal with those who are on waiting lists for far longer than the charter for patients' rights envisages, we will put him under considerable pressure in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened, with some awe, to the indignation of Deputies Sheehan and Ring on the preceding Supplementary Estimate.  I am not sure I could ever reach that level of indignation.</P>
      <P>I want to comment on the abridged Estimates published last week, to pose some questions and comment on today's detailed Supplementary Estimate.  I do not mean this frivolously, but having listened to Deputies Sheehan and Ring on the preceding Supplementary Estimate it struck me that the total transfers of EU funds to farmers last year slightly exceeds the total payments to health boards in this year's health Estimates.  That puts things in perspective.  I do not mean that in a begrudging way, but we should be aware of those facts before we get as indignant as some colleagues did earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1998 Estimates are placed by the Government within a particular political and financial <Col N="32" /> context.  Minister McCreevy, with the full support of the Taoiseach, has chosen, at least in principle, to impose a 4 per cent limit&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that this discussion must be confined to the items constituting this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my intention, but I merely want to make some general comments about their context which is important.  We are working within the context of a general increase of 4 per cent for the 1998 Estimates, one imposed for ideological reasons which make no sense.  I do not believe that any sensible household would calculate its budget according to a particular target which was not related in some sense to their income, but that is what we, as an economy, are being required to do.  Inevitably, as a result health, education and other services will suffer.  I recall some months ago the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, told us that an increase of between 6 and 8 per cent would be required in the health service Estimates to maintain the current position but the abridged Estimates provide for a 5 per cent increase in GMS payments and an increase of 6 per cent to the health boards.  I understand the Supplementary Estimate, for which we are providing today, is included in the abridged Estimates and perhaps the Minister will confirm that.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that this Supplementary Estimate is required partly because of the requirements of the Health (Amendment) No. 3 Act, 1996, which received all party support and will come into play very shortly.  It should lead to greater accountability and transparency in the funding of health boards.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm that, with the benefit of this Supplementary Estimate, all the health boards will be in a position to implement the Act and that as of now all the health boards are operating in surplus and do not have the type of deficits that were run up over many years in previous times.</P>
      <P>Under this Supplementary Estimate the Minister is looking for an increase as part of the Partnership 2000 agreement.  I am unclear as to the amount of money being provided in 1998 for improvements in the health services.  I am conscious of what the Chair said about the Supplementary Estimate and I do not want to range too far from it, but it would be extremely helpful if the Minister could indicate how much money is available for improvements in services in the coming year and how much of it is taken up by payments in 1998 of the full year cost of the improvements in pay made earlier this year.  Perhaps the Minister will also give a figure of the cost in 1997 of the special increases which took place earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Shatter, referred to the waiting list initiative.  The Minister during the summer made some remarks about waiting lists when he essentially questioned whether they reflected the numbers of people waiting for particular <Col N="33" /> procedures.  The Minister owes it to the House to clarify that he is committed to the waiting list initiative and intends to pursue it in the year to come.  Deputy Shatter rightly said that we do not have up to date figures, but it seems fairly clear that waiting lists are increasing rather than decreasing.  We were all struck by the coverage in a Sunday newspaper of the problem related to cardiac surgery financing and Deputy Shatter also made that point.  The Minister's delay on that is inexplicable.  On a number of occasions he told the House he has commissioned a report for reasons that were unspecified.  The previous Minister made a decision to increase the number of cardiac surgery procedures which would be available in any given year by 500.  The Minister must make a decision on this or tell the House why he is not in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>There are other examples of waiting lists which are in a sense being dealt with by sleight of hand. The numbers on the orthodontic waiting list, particularly in one category, seem to be miraculously disappearing but concern has been expressed that they are disappearing by sleight of hand and not because the procedures are being carried out, and I asked the Minister to address that this morning.  Children are being told when they reach the age of 14 and 15 that even though they have been on a waiting list for several years for a diagnosed problem that the procedure will not be carried out under the GMS and they must have it done privately.  That is one way of dealing with waiting lists, but hardly the right way.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister about details on some of the provisions in the Supplementary Estimate.  I notice a figure of £220,000 is provided for freedom of information in 1997.  Will the Minister confirm that he has appointed an information officer in the Department and give an update on what provision has been made in the Department for the provision of information when the Act will come into play next April?  Will he indicate if the Department is involved in the extension of the Act to the health boards in years to come?  There is a provision of £4.5 million for legal fees.  I gather that does not include the hepatitis C tribunal and perhaps the Minister will give some more details of what is entailed in that figure.</P>
    <P>A once off figure of £1.5 million is provided for Tallaght Hospital.  The Minister will be well aware that there is still concern about the opening date of the hospital.  Perhaps the Minister could confirm that Tallaght Hospital will open early in the new year.  I notice a once off payment of £200,000 has been provided for an equalisation group during the course of 1997.  I would be obliged if the Minister would explain what that entails.</P>
    <P>On the BTSB, we were faced in October with a bizarre and unacceptable position in Cork where the Irish Medicines Board effectively told the BTSB that it would not license it to continue the production of blood products in Cork unless agreement was reached on the provision of a proper facility in Cork.  Will the Minister confirm that <Col N="34" /> agreement has now been reached?  Will he indicate whether the cost of upgrading the existing facility and providing a new facility is included in the Supplementary Estimate, or whether it will be included in next year's Estimates?  I welcome the provision for the upgrading of the BTSB facility in St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I confess, I am at a total loss to understand exactly how much money has been paid out in relation to the hepatitis C tribunal and how much money will be spent.  I can recall that moneys for hepatitis C payments were brought forward from the 1997 Estimate into the 1996 one.  The abridged Estimates refer to an outturn in 1997 of £27 million.  Does this take into account the £30 million underspend the Minister comments on in the Supplementary Estimate?</P>
    <P>The Minister is still seeking additional funds from the Minister for Finance in relation to budget day spending.  I hope he will be successful in getting that and I am sure he will receive support from all elements of this House if he does.  I hope in doing that, however, he will not be hamstrung by the Government's needless ideological commitment to targets that make no sense.</P>
    <P>I support the Supplementary Estimate, but I would be obliged if the Minister would answer the questions I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate what Deputy Shatter said with regard to homeless children and those with emotional behaviour problems.  There is a need to assist, educate and take care of them.  It is totally unacceptable that we must go outside the State to treat such children, who constitute a small number nationally.  They account for four or five in the Western Health Board's region.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of a register for child sex offenders about which the Minister has made some statements recently, I understand the Minister has not made a decision to establish such a register but is planning to have consultations about the matter over a period.  There is an urgency to set up such a register to protect our children and ensure that paedophiles and serious child sex offenders do not have freedom to move throughout the country posing a danger to children.  One of the Minister's backbenchers, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, highlighted the fact that with a register now in place in the United Kingdom, paedophiles are travelling to Ireland. We must be concerned about this issue.</P>
      <P>According to studies conducted in Britain, repeat offences by paedophiles run at an estimated 90 to 95 per cent, which makes a curative approach totally unrealistic.  In the circumstances, containment and control constitute the only policy to be pursued.  This needs to be combined with more effective co-operation among agencies concerned and a long-term preventative effort directed against child abuse, which is so often the root of such behaviour.  The rate of recidivism among sex offenders is less pronounced than with paedophiles, nevertheless it is disturbingly common.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> Among the criminal fraternity, paedophiles are in a special category.  We can distinguish their sexual activity from that of violent people, muggers and other criminals because, as research appears to show, paedophiles are usually highly manipulative and clever.  Their offending behaviour often intensifies as they become older.  They are a peculiarly dangerous category and some form of register or identification should be available after they have been convicted and released from prison.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in dealing with paedophiles is that they do not consider their activities to be wrong.  Hardened paedophiles believe the rest of us set unfair parameters on their sexual activity.  They do not believe that having sex with children is wrong.  Many of them believe that it is the right thing to do and that we are wrong to try to restrain their activity.  The fact that some of them are so clever and manipulative makes them especially dangerous.</P>
    <P>The requirement to register convicted paedophiles, recently introduced in the United Kingdom, applies indefinitely to those convicted of the most serious offences, that is, those sentenced to more than 30 months' imprisonment. Those sentenced to shorter periods are required to be registered for a period of up to ten years if the sentence is more than six months, and seven years if it is below six months.  A non-custodial penalty and caution attracts a registration period of five years.</P>
    <P>While such a register is necessary here, it can only form a limited part of a much more comprehensive approach we need to take towards child sex abuse.  The majority of children are not abused by convicted offenders.  In a minority of cases where prosecution follows the disclosure of abuse, the rate of conviction remains disturbingly low.</P>
    <P>Paedophilia is perhaps the most deep-seated of all perverse emotions and feelings with which people can be inculcated.  It is a pathetic fallacy to think that paedophilia can be cured; I do not believe it can be.  It is an inherent problem rather than one that people acquire and, therefore, we must consider how it can be controlled.  It is a problem which devastates affected families whose children have been abused and it also destroys the lives of children.  Paedophiles are evil people who take away childhood and innocence.  They should be registered.  While I recognise there will be much discussion about who needs to know the information available on such a register, the overall issue is so extreme and perverse that a special approach must be taken for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to release the report of the task force on suicide.  Next week, it will be two years since the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, set up the suicide task force.  It completed its work before Easter this year, yet we have not seen the publication of the report.  I do not know why the report is being delayed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> There is an urgent need to introduce suicide prevention programmes.  The Minister has a responsibility to tackle the problem.  When it is released, the report will herald an important debate on suicide, including the approach we must take towards reducing suicide levels and the services required to do so.</P>
    <P>On 7 October the Minister informed me that 378 suicides had been recorded in 1996.  There has been an upward trend in suicides over the past 20 years but there has been very little serious discussion of the problem.  Suicide is still part of the hidden Ireland.  Society is not equipped to deal with it or to shake off the stigma attached to it. Until 1993 suicide was a criminal act which was dealt with by the Department of Justice.  It is now a public health issue which must be tackled by the Department of Health and Children.  We must initiate public debate by publishing the task force's deliberations and discussing them in a compassionate and informed way.</P>
    <P>Society has a responsibility to respond to people who feel suicidal.  Counselling services must be available to those who feel suicidal and to those bereaved as a result of suicide because it is a different type of bereavement.  I recently heard someone from Aware on &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; discussing her attempted suicide from an overdose.  She said she was appalled at the hospital's response to her problem.  We have still not accepted mental health problems and attempted suicide as diseases or in the same light as someone who breaks an arm or a leg.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring to the Minister's attention the care of the elderly and the cost of private nursing homes, particularly in the Dublin region, relative to the subvention available.  The maximum subvention at present is £120 per week. If the old age pension is added to this figure, the amount available to meet such costs is less than £200 per week.  The average nursing home in the Dublin area costs between £350 and £400 per week.  This means there is a shortfall of £150 to £200 per week.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of old age pensions who do not have any other income are queuing up for the limited facilities provided directly by the health board.  It costs the health board between £450 and £500 per week to provide suitable accommodation for the elderly.  This means someone can be looked after in a publicly owned nursing home run by the Eastern Health Board at a cost of £450 or £500 per week or a subvention of £120 per week can be paid in a private nursing home.  It is crazy to force the health board to build more units at a higher cost than what could be provided by adequate subvention in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a social aspect to this problem.  It is often better for the patient or elderly person to go to a nursing home in their own community where friends and relatives can visit them on a regular basis than to a health board nursing home which could be far away from where they lived originally.  For that reason, I ask the Minister to <Col N="37" /> take into account the facts I have outlined when considering the Estimates for the care of the elderly, particularly in relation to nursing homes.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is now taking into account the income of other family members when assessing the maximum subvention limit of £120 per week.  This can cause untold problems, particularly if there are divisions in a family or if a son or daughter fail to co-operate because they are married and do not believe it is anyone's business what their partner earns.</P>
    <P>We cannot live in a false world by believing that a person can afford to stay in a private nursing home if they have £120 subvention and an old age pension.  If a person cannot get private nursing home care, they will either take a bed in a hospital longer than they should or they will ask the health board to provide them with a public nursing home at a higher cost.  I ask the Minister to treat this problem seriously and to give us some indication as to whether there is any hope for persons who are in dire need of nursing home care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Barrett's point and I am aware this is a problem which must be addressed.  We are making a further £6.9 million available in the Supplementary Estimates to allow health boards to meet the increasing demand for subventions. Since the change in nursing home regulations in 1996, the Department has increased the number of subventions paid at the higher rate of dependency and provided more funds for extra beds. Some £2.7 million has been made available in this Supplementary Estimate to cover the cost of increasing the numbers on the maximum scale and of providing new subventions.  Some £1.5 million of the figure is represented in the provision of extra beds.</P>
      <P>The chief executive of the Eastern Health Board informed me recently that the number of elderly in its area is due to increase by 75,000 between now and 2007 as a result of the success of our health services, people living longer and the various degrees of dependency given their age, state of mind, etc.  One can imagine the critical service pressures in trying to provide for those extra numbers.  The Deputy outlined an issue I have come across in my constituency but, unfortunately, it is not open to immediate correction. Extra funds will be made available to deal with the recommendation that there should be a higher rate of dependency and for the provision of extra beds.  I acknowledge this critical service pressure for which we must try to plan in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards must take into account household income when assessing a person's real needs. Difficulties may arise if certain family members feel they are not obliged or are not in a position to contribute towards the cost of maintaining a spouse or parent in a private nursing home. Given the demands on health boards and their attempts to prioritise needs, they must take these <Col N="38" /> matters into account.  Subvention by its nature is not meant to meet the full cost; it is a subvention of the total cost.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, we have enacted regulations for standardisation and proper care facilities in nursing homes.  There is an argument to be made about the cost effectiveness of private <i>vis-a-vis</i> public nursing home care.  However, there will always be a requirement for public nursing home care and we must find the proper mix which will give the greatest level of cost effectiveness.  The Deputy's point is well made; it is not amenable to an immediate solution.  The Supplementary Estimate contains an extra £7 million to deal with that issue.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for the contributions.  I will try to deal with some of the issues raised.</P>

      <P>Clearly, a broad range of issues has been raised by the spokespersons.  To do justice to the debate, my Department will check the record of the House and deal specifically with the questions raised.  Given the time constraint, that is the only satisfactory way I can deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>In relation to the cardiac services, I intend going to Government in the next week or two with a full programme for cardiac care services which will be more comprehensive.  Deputies referred to a specific initiative regarding 500 people who are on waiting lists for operations.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to give out the moneys for the waiting list initiative at the beginning of the year.  In recent years the waiting list initiatives have not been as effective as in previous years because the money is going out far too late to the health boards and we are not achieving the level of throughput which I am advised is possible.  If the initiative money is available over a 12-month period, the health boards can deal with the waiting lists far more comprehensively rather than being asked to deal with this initiative in the last three months of the year, which is not satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Opposition spokesperson, I was critical of the validation procedures introduced by my predecessor but I am insisting on concentrating on waiting times.  It is true that there are people waiting longer for a range of specialties than we would regard as acceptable in the modern day. We must work our way through those significant lists.  As far as the individual is concerned, it is not the number waiting that is of concern but the length of time it takes each patient to gain access to the procedures.  One of the ways of doing it is <Col N="39" /> to have a liaison officer at health board level who is specifically responsible to the Department for keeping these lists so that we have up to date information.  These lists should be validated to make sure that there are no other procedures with which clinicians at hospital level can deal and to do everything possible to make sure we reduce these waiting times as quickly as possible. Waiting lists are an unpalatable feature of every modern health service but I will do what I can to work more effectively in dealing with these waiting list initiatives in a more comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>On the other issues which were properly raised, I will check the record and deal with the spokespersons by way of correspondence in the next few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £23,300,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment in the year ending 31 December 1997 for the salaries and expenses of the Garda Síochána, including pensions, etc.; for payments of compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Force; for the payment of certain witnesses' expenses; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate of £23.3 million represents an increase of 5.1 per cent over the original Estimate of £456.832 million.  By far the most significant element in the Supplementary Estimate is the provision of an additional £16 million for Garda overtime.  While I intend to concentrate on this issue, I want, first, to refer to the question of witness security.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware from a number of recent high profile cases that the introduction of a witness security programme is a matter of extreme urgency in light of ongoing Garda operations.  Witness security is a priority commitment in the Government's programme for tackling organised crime and since I have taken office I have wasted no time in pursuing the matter with the Garda authorities.  A programme has now been drawn up and will operate in cases of serious or organised crime where a threat to the safety of the witness, his family members or associates is perceived to exist because of evidence which would be given in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of programme needs adequate financing and an amount of £250,000 has been provided in the 1998 Estimates for expenditure on this programme next year.  However, I want to ensure that the programme is put on a clear financial basis immediately.  For that reason a sum of £75,000 has been included in the Supplementary Estimate for this year in respect of formalising <Col N="40" /> arrangements currently in place in connection with recent cases before the courts.</P>
    <P>For a number of reasons the allocation of £25 million made by the previous Government in the 1997 Estimate for Garda overtime has proved not to be sufficient.  The entire allocation of £25 million was exhausted by the end of July and total expenditure on Garda overtime in 1997 is likely to exceed £43 million.  Because of savings of £2 million in other parts of subhead A.1, the net additional amount required is £16 million.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial increase in the demand on Garda operational resources and in the short term this demand can only be met by the use of overtime.  The two biggest demands on overtime in 1997 arise from the investigation of serious crimes and measures taken to deal with the BSE crisis.  Between them, they account for more than 50 per cent of all overtime.</P>
    <P>There are a number of major ongoing investigations, including that relating to the murder of Veronica Guerin which has also spread out into other areas such as drugs and money laundering. I am sure that we are all pleased to see that the resources invested in this operation are paying dividends and I pay tribute to the dedication of the gardaí involved.  To some degree, we have been the victim of our success.  As a result of these investigations and because more judges are available to try cases, Garda overtime costs associated with criminal trials have also increased.</P>
    <P>The BSE crisis in the United Kingdom posed a very significant threat to our exports of beef, the beef industry at home and the health of our citizens.  It was vital to the national interest that overseas purchasers be reassured that infected cattle were not being smuggled into this State.  A major Garda operation was put in place very quickly to secure the Border area from the threat of the illegal movement of cattle from Northern Ireland and this operation has been a key factor in protecting the image of Irish beef abroad. However, it has been a very costly operation.  This year the operation cost £10 million in overtime expenditure alone.</P>
    <P>In addition to criminal investigations and the BSE operation we have had other major operations, all of which entail overtime expenditure. Examples include Operation Dóchas, which has resulted in the seizure of millions of pounds of drugs, and Operation Boulevard, the policing plan for the north inner city, all aimed at preventing crime.  These types of operation have been effective in lowering crime levels.</P>
    <P>I might also mention Operation Lifesaver, launched in the Louth-Meath division on 14 July 1997.  The operation comprises a crackdown on speeding, drink-driving, non-seatbelt wearing and dangerous driving.  It involves the establishment of extra checkpoints, use of hand-held speed guns, undercover speed camera cars and the Gatso video van.  The Gatso system is a high volume, mobile system recording the speed and other details of vehicles and has proved to be <Col N="41" /> particularly effective in enforcing the law on speed limits and the wearing of seatbelts, so much so that a second system is to be purchased using funds provided by this Supplementary Estimate. We are all very aware of the number of deaths resulting from road deaths.  Clearly more action is required and it will be taken.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the major areas which have entailed increased Garda overtime.  Undoubtedly, in most cases the associated Garda activity has been of real benefit and I think the average citizen is conscious of a more visible Garda presence. Nevertheless, the level of overtime expenditure in 1997 is extremely high.  It has effectively trebled since 1994 and this is a matter of some concern.  The nature of police operations is such that some level of overtime will always be required.  Furthermore, if a crisis arises, the Garda has to respond, so the total expenditure on Garda overtime in any one year cannot be predicted in advance with any great certainty.  The taxpayer is entitled to proper policing but he is also entitled to value for money.</P>
    <P>I am of the view that a more focused approach to overtime expenditure is required.  Measures must be taken to reduce the level of routine overtime.  Legislative measures are being introduced to reduce the need for large numbers of gardaí to be present at court hearings.  Furthermore, as I made clear on a number of occasions, we are recruiting additional gardaí.  This will increase the total number of gardaí available for operational duties and should reduce the need for overtime. However, because of the time and resources required to fully train recruits, the increased recruitment will not begin to take full effect for a year or two.</P>
    <P>Gardaí require adequate resources to carry out their work and Garda operations should not be constrained by unnecessary or overly bureaucratic controls on expenditure.  Hence, those who have responsibility for planning operations also have a responsibility to account for their expenditure of public funds.  Throughout the public service more emphasis is being placed on resource accounting and the use of management information systems. As part of that process, which must also apply to the Garda Síochána, l expect existing controls on overtime expenditure to be applied in a more active, comprehensive and flexible manner.  The appropriate officers should know in advance what will be their overtime budget and allocate their resources to remain within that budget.  They must be accountable for the management of the financial resources put in their hands.  We must take full advantage of the improvements in management technology now available which allows for closer monitoring of expenditure and earlier intervention if targets are not being met.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we cannot be too rigid on the question of overtime as we have to allow for special operations and unforeseen circumstances. However, when planning operations, people must be aware of the resource implications, and of the <Col N="42" /> need to be able to justify any additional expenditure.  If expenditure on special operations can be justified, l will not hesitate to seek the resources to fund it.  However, the Exchequer is not a bottomless pit.  Overall, l hope to see a more focused and proactive approach to the management of overtime expenditure.  Senior Garda officers are not only policemen, they are also managers and, like all managers, they have to keep a critical eye on resources to ensure the best use is made of them.</P>
    <P>I shall now briefly deal with the other areas where approval for additional expenditure over and above the original Estimates is sought.  An additional £3 million is being sought for travel and subsistence.  As with overtime, the increased Garda activity associated with the BSE and major crime investigations has led to greater demands for travel and subsistence.  An additional £1.99 million is required in the area of transport.  Thirty extra 4-wheel drive vehicles were purchased at a cost of £800,000.  These vehicles will aid Garda members in the areas of crime and drugs, providing a highly visible, rapid response facility and resulting in a higher quality of service to the communities they serve.  There were also additional running and maintenance costs associated with the increased size of the Garda fleet and extra activity in relation to BSE mobile patrols and investigations.  Other areas where additional expenditure is required include the following:</P>
    <P>On subhead A5, £1.417 million for purchase of computer equipment originally intended to be purchased in 1996, a contract with Andersen Consulting was signed in 1996 for the delivery of the design and development of the systems and software of the Garda IT strategy &mdash; the PULSE project.  However, as the contract discussions were complex and protracted the signing of the contract took longer than anticipated.  Because of these delays, savings of approximately £1.4 million were realised on the computer capital subhead in 1996, arising from the non-placement of equipment purchase contracts.  The equipment costs involved rolled over into the current year giving rise to a considerable shortfall in moneys available for the PULSE project.  The additional funds being sought are to make good these shortfalls &mdash; on subhead G, £750,000 for increased costs for superannuation; on subhead E, £700,000 for radio equipment, installation of closed circuit television &mdash; CCTV &mdash; systems and purchase of various specialised equipment &mdash; including the Gatso equipment mentioned earlier.  As regards CCTV, the Garda Commissioner has established a CCTV Advisory Group to review the future of CCTV systems as an aid to policing.  It is understood from the Garda authorities that to date applications have been received in respect of more than 20 locations for the installation of CCTV schemes.  These will be considered by the advisory committee with a view to determining priority.  Work is currently ongoing in installing a CCTV system in Tralee with preparation on the specification for the Finglas area under way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> Specialised equipment to be purchased under this heading includes the provision of new technology for the Garda mapping section to allow the Garda Síochána move from conventional field surveying techniques of crime scenes and plan drawing by hand, to electronic surveying devices and computer aided drawing systems.</P>
    <P>On subhead A3, £700,000 is sought for a number of incidental expenses.  There was a general increase in expenditure under this subhead which includes the expenses of doctors involved in Road Traffic Act cases, crime prevention initiatives, contributions to Interpol and Europol and contributions to youth diversion schemes.  There is some increase due to the extension of some youth diversion schemes, a general increase in costing of schemes overall and the cost of a review of the neighbourhood watch schemes.</P>
    <P>On subhead F, £500,000 is sought for the payment of VAT on the purchase of aircraft which originally was not expected to be due until 1998. The cost of the purchase of the fixed wing plane and helicopter for the Garda air support unit was spread over three payments &mdash; one each to be made in 1996, 1997 and the final payment in January 1998.  Originally, it was envisaged that the full VAT payment would fall in 1998.  However, this is now not the case, and the position is that as the second payments were made in August this year, VAT at 21 per cent is now outstanding on these payments.</P>
    <P>On subhead A4, £300,000 is sought mainly for increased telephone costs.  These costs are mainly due to new charges from Telecom Éireann which have resulted in an increase in local call charges. There has also been an increased use of mobile phones by the investigation units, leading to a similar increase in phone costs.</P>
    <P>On subhead H, £54,000 witness expenses were slightly higher than expected.  This increased expenditure is due to the increase in numbers of cases coming to trial this year.</P>
    <P>There were savings in a number of subheads but they were not significant enough to affect the need for a supplementary estimate and I do not propose to go into any detail on them, unless specifically requested to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Mayo)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem agreeing the Supplementary Estimate for £23.7 million. The bulk of this finance is geared towards funding various schemes operated by the Garda, each of which are important in their own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like Operation Lifesaver to be expanded outside Counties Meath and Louth because it is specifically targeted at dealing with dangerous driving, speeding, bad driving practice and reducing the daily carnage on our roads. Operation Dóchas, introduced by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, has been successful and has further potential if given further resources.  I welcome the introduction of the CCTV scheme because of the obvious benefits of 24 hour surveillance on O'Connell Street and <Col N="44" /> other thoroughfares.  Constant vigilance is paying dividends in making this boulevard safer, open and accessible.  I hope it will become a place where, day or night, people can walk without fearing for their lives.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the introduction of the witness protection scheme.  Everything possible must be done from the point of view of protecting witnesses who have the guts, gumption and civic spirit to give evidence to ensure that the perpetrators of the most foul, pernicious, and vicious crimes and offences are brought to book.  I commend this scheme which will pay rich dividends in breaking the back of crime in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Having said that, considerable damage has been done to the Garda Síochána and the Criminal Assets Bureau by the advance leaking of the intention to carry out a raid on the law firm of Michael E. Hanahoe in Dublin.  The Garda had secured a search warrant as part of Operation Pineapple to search for files related to suspected money laundering and drug trafficking offences by certain people.  The Hanahoes sued Judge Gillian Hussey, who authorised the search warrant, the Garda Commissioner and the State for acting improperly.  The judge found that raiding a solicitor's office for confidential material covered by the lawyer-client relationship raised serious questions.  However, the raid had been properly authorised.  As the judge concluded, the problem was that the Garda, on the balance of probability, informed the media in advance with the result that journalists and photographers were at the scene before gardaí arrived to raid the premises.</P>
    <P>This leak was deliberately intended to embarrass the company involved.  Such behaviour is wrong, sinister and malicious and it must be stamped out.  The leaking of this information to the media was an outrage.  I demand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform institute an immediate inquiry to establish who is responsible for this leak.  We must know all the circumstances surrounding the authorisation.  It is in the public interest, the interest of the reputation of the Garda Síochána, and the interests of the Criminal Assets Bureau which has done such tremendous work in smashing the cartels of the bosses of crime, that these facts be established immediately and the action proposed to deal with the issues be made public.</P>
    <P>I welcome the estimate.  I hope the various sponsored schemes covered under the estimate will continue to grow in strength, size and efficacy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister to the House and, like Deputy Higgins, I welcome this supplementary estimate.  For many years we have had debates on crime in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There may be an impression abroad that there has been less concern in recent times. We should allay that impression.  Crime is still a very serious issue.  Some serious crimes have been committed recently, not least of which is one that has been debated here in recent days and to <Col N="45" /> which I will not refer further in the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to expand on his proposals for dealing with rural crime and on the changes which have taken place in some rural areas.  Newcastle West is a pilot area for introducing change in approaches to policing.  It is through the media we learned of the proposals.  Perhaps the Minister would, through the medium of this debate or in another forum, detail the objectives he wishes to achieve and why it was necessary to introduce those changes because of the concern occasioned by the closure of Garda stations and other changes already introduced.  It might be a cliché, but it is important to repeat that the presence of the Garda Síochána in rural areas is a vital component in ensuring the safety of citizens. It is constantly emphasised that the presence of the Garda in rural towns and villages is vital to the continuing safety of people and the reduction of vandalism, especially late at night.  I know of some villages where the presence of a garda ensured a reasonable level of behaviour at all times.  Now I hear reports of vandalism taking place in the early hours of the morning.  That would never occur if a garda were on patrol.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Nora Owen and the former Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, on the level of service in Rathkeale town at Christmas time.  Rathkeale town has specific problems.  Forty five per cent of its population are travellers.  For most of the year it is a crime free town, having the lowest crime rate of any town in County Limerick.  However, at Christmas there is an influx of travellers, at least trebling the number of travellers there.  Along with very civilised people, this influx brings in an unruly element which creates problems for the town.  Over the past two to three years these problems were successfully handled by the Minister's two predecessors who provided an increased Garda presence over the Christmas period and a special court hearing in the area the week after Christmas.  Until this was done, people who committed crimes, who engaged in vandalism and rows or, even worse, inflicted bodily harm on citizens, had moved on before a normal court hearing could take place, and there was no hope of implementing sanctions.  To overcome this, a special court sat after Christmas.  That, together with the presence of the Garda, eliminated nearly all the crime that took place at Christmas.  Statistics might indicate this was unnecessary as most of the cases heard originated not in Rathkeale but in other towns, but these measures acted as a deterrent because people were aware that if they committed crimes they would be taken to task and could not escape by moving on.  I ask the Minister to reintroduce those measures in the town during the Christmas period.</P>

      <P>I note the Labour Party and Democratic Left did not consider it worth their <Col N="46" /> while to send a spokesperson to speak on this supplementary estimate which involves a considerable amount of money, £23.3 million, for the fight against crime.  These parties are the transparent critics of zero tolerance, but they have decided they should put in a zero appearance. However, invisibility is the best form of transparency, and I suppose we should be thankful to them for illustrating their interest in the fight against crime in such a vivid manner.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies Higgins and Neville for their contributions.  I have noted the points they made. I will not have time to reply to all of them in detail, but I will come back to Deputy Neville's concerns regarding Rathkeale and write to him on the matter.</P>
      <P>I am committed to providing the Garda Síochána and the other elements of the criminal justice system with the resources necessary to ensure the system works fairly and efficiently.  In some cases there may be an increase in public expenditure. In other cases I expect to improve the system by making it more efficient.  The taxpayer is entitled to value for money, and I intend to ensure he or she gets it.</P>
      <P>Last night, during the Dáil's motion on zero tolerance, I went into considerable detail on my policies as regards the criminal justice system as well as outlining the action I have taken so far and my plans for the future.  There is no need for me to go over that ground again today.</P>
      <P>Publication of the strategic management report on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána is imminent, but there is no time to go into detail here.  However, the House should be aware that it addresses a wide range of issues and could and should result in the most significant changes in the Garda Síochána since their foundation 75 years ago.  Publication of the report will be only a first step.  I hope my colleagues here today will read it carefully and make constructive contributions to the public debate that is bound to follow.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins expressed justifiable concern about leaks concerning operations of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I share that concern and will seek a full report from the Garda Commissioner on the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville referred to rural policing which is a very important matter.  I repeat the assurance I gave on the Opposition benches that I do not intend to preside over the closure of rural Garda stations.  There has been some misunderstanding about the operation of the scheme which is synonymous in the minds of some people with the closure of rural stations.  However, this is not the purpose for which it was designed.  My aim at all times is to provide a better service to the community by allowing gardaí to spend more time on active operational duties in their districts, for example, visits to the elderly which are extremely important, while at the same time ensuring that rural Garda stations are not closed.</P>
      <P>I would like to have dealt in greater detail with the very important matters raised by Deputies</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> Higgins and Neville but, unfortunately, time constraints do not permit me to do so.  I hope to deal with these matters at a later stage.  I assure the Deputies that I will write to them privately in the interim.  In the interests of democracy perhaps a special invitation should be sent to the spokespersons for Labour and Democratic Left on the next occasion we debate this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the contributions by Deputies to the Second Stage debate and am greatly encouraged by their positive nature.  A strong feature of the debate has been the welcome high number of contributors and the clear indication of crossparty support for the activities of the Irish Film Board and for the continued need for a funding agency to provide development and production loans for film projects.  I also welcome the cross-party support for other incentives to develop the industry, such as the section 35 tax incentive for private sector investment in film and television projects administered by my Department, and the acceptance that the development of the industry provides tangible economic and social benefits to local and national economies, while also being an important input to Irish cultural expression.</P>
      <P>I welcome the favourable response of many Deputies to my intention to implement the two commitments relating to film policy contained in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium.  These are the establishment of a screen commission and an industry think tank with the task of developing a strategic ten year plan for the industry.  I am grateful to those Deputies who wished me well in driving the Government's film policy forward in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies, including Deputies Donal Carey, Michael D. Higgins and Liz McManus, were concerned that I have somehow been remiss to date in implementing the Government's commitment to establish a screen commission.  This is not the case.  The former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht announced the establishment of a screen commission on 4 June, two days before the general election.  The preferred method of funding was to be from recoupments on loans advanced by the Irish Film Board since 1994.  However, these funds were not immediately at his disposal and the screen commission could <Col N="48" /> not, therefore, be established and funded on this basis at that time.</P>
    <P>Film board recoupments, that is repayments to the board of development and production loans which now cumulatively amount to £800,000, represent repayments from EU-supported capital provisions for development and production loans under the Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-9.  Any decision to use these recoupments for any purpose other than development and production loans for the industry requires the express approval of the European Commission.  Coincidentally, this approval was conveyed orally to my Department at a meeting in Dublin of the monitoring committee for the operational programme on 6 November, the day after the Second Stage debate began.  The necessary technical decisions to allow the funding of the screen commission were also taken at that meeting.  The approval of the European Commission will not be operative until 1 January next year and formal written confirmation from the Commission is not yet to hand.  I reject, therefore, any suggestions of foot dragging by me on this commitment.  It is entirely appropriate that I discuss with industry interests, RTE and the Irish Film Board their priorities for a screen commission and views on the film board model before proceeding further.  I am pleased to inform the House that I have already met Film Makers Ireland to discuss, among other things, their priorities for a commission and I will meet the Audio-visual Production Federation of IBEC, RTE and the Irish Film Board very soon.  I expect to be able to make a decision on this matter very soon afterwards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donal Carey asked whether the Irish Film Board should follow the policies of other State development companies, such as Forbairt, which is now using preference shares and equity more frequently when investing.  He also asked my views on a rotating fund model for the board. There may be some misunderstanding on the Deputy's part about the nature of assistance offered by the board.  Such assistance is not grant-based but rather involves production loans.  While the conditions for such loans are negotiated for each project, the norm is that the board takes an equity share in individual projects, facilitating the board's recoupment in first position from all Irish receipts &mdash; theatrical, TV and video &mdash; preferential corridors from Rest of World Sales and a percentage of World Net Receipts.  Therefore, the recoupment and profit participation conditions attaching to production loans from the board correspond with the model recommended by the Deputy.  Development loans awarded by the board must be repaid before a production loan is given.</P>
    <P>On the board operating its support for film production through a revolving fund, when the board was first established in 1980 it was hoped that its investments could attract sufficient returns to enable its income to operate as, in effect, a revolving fund.  However, the board's experience <Col N="49" /> as well as the international experience of public funding agencies for film production is that this is not a realistic expectation.  In this context it is necessary to bear in mind a number of central points.</P>

From my meetings with taximen, they accept that new licences will be issued, and that will be done by agreement.  A fortnight ago we discussed other issues such as hackneys, cosies and so on.  The issue of late night buses needs to be addressed.  That service has worked well in recent years, but the service is provided in a limited number of areas &mdash; for example, there is no service on the north side. The time at which late night buses finish must be considered.  Up to now the finishing time has been 2 a.m and there is a proposal that the service should run until 3 a.m. Those issues will be addressed, and while all the problems may not be alleviated, it will go some way towards dealing with them.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of that; I am simply saying they are there.  The service has massively expanded in recent years, as has the demand.  There has been continued argument and disagreement about the reports.  A forum is necessary to implement decisions and I hope that will be done.  In the meantime the additional 200 licences will be issued.  The recommendations of the interim report from Dublin Corporation are being implemented, as are interim measures by other councils with which I am not familiar.</P>

      <P>Why will it take six months for the forum to reach a conclusion?  That would bring its work virtually to the end of the Dáil term before the summer recess, which means if legislation is to be introduced arising from the report it would be the autumn before it is prepared.  We would then have to face another winter before real action is taken.  Will the Taoiseach request the forum to report in a shorter period than six months?  There is no reason it should not meet every day for the next month and come to a conclusion within a month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the complexities of this issue.  There are two outstanding issues to be resolved.  First, the rate of fares needs to be addressed, and that can be done having regard to demand and the cost of operating a taxi, including insurance.  Second, and perhaps more intractable, is the question of ownership of the taxi plate.  Will the Taoiseach agree there is resistance from many existing plate owners in that any rapid increase in taxi licences will devalue the investment they have made, in some cases with borrowings rather than redundancy lump sums?  Consideration must be given to the legitimate concerns of people who have invested money by way of borrowings in acquiring a taxi plate &mdash; the going rate is about £80,000 whereas six or seven years ago it was about £40,000.  In market economics that could be explained only by increased demand and, consequently, value.  Would the Taoiseach consider the idea of short-term plates with a five, ten or 15 year shelf life that would facilitate increased supply to meet demand, but not undermine the property value of those who have made large investments and are currently exercising an understandable veto, if not restraint, on the issuing of extra plates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Taoiseach believe we should discuss this issue?  Since September l995, when this power was passed to local authorities, I have taken part in at least 200 hours of discussion with the relevant local authorities, taxi men and members of the public and we thrashed out all the issues.  Does the Taoiseach accept that by setting up a forum he is rapping the knuckles of local authorities who took a stand and issued 200 licences when nobody else was willing or able to make a decision?  Does he accept that in setting up a forum he is cutting across the decision of local authorities to commission a <Col N="52" /> further consultative study, at considerable cost, to get information that is free from political opinion and vested interest on the supply and demand side of the market?  What is the forum expected to achieve?  Will it replace local authorities and, if so, does the Taoiseach propose to introduce legislation to take power away from local authorities?  Are we to proceed on the basis of the consultancy study report which we hope to have early in the new year or wait for the results of further consultation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>As we all agree on the need for more taxis and a better public transport system generally, does the Taoiseach accept that £15,000 for taxi licences in Dublin and Cork is expensive for many new people entering the taxi business?  A lower charge could be imposed if it were linked, as mentioned by Deputy Quinn, to a prohibition to resell such licences within a specified period.  That would facilitate the provision of more taxis without much delay.  Will the Taoiseach ensure the forum takes account of the need to provide onloading or offloading facilities for people with disabilities?  While some taxis cater for people with disabilities, taxi ranks cannot cope with their needs.</P>

I am trying to accommodate Members in dealing with as many questions as possible.  Perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could examine how it would be possible for the House to deal with more questions on Question Time.  On some days we deal with only five or six. When I was first elected to the House we often dealt with 60 or 70 questions in an hour.

      <P>Deputy Quinn's point about the plates is right.  It is an important issue because many taxi operators see the plate as their pension.  It is a long-term investment and if they lose it they may not have other pension provisions.  I will take his suggestion on board and refer it on. The seasonality approach has also been mentioned.  That has worked better in the past than it does at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  There will be no delay on the fares issue.  The corporation has stated that from its preliminary report to which Deputy Mitchell referred, it will make an interim report on fares, licences and the other issues it believes relevant.  There is no reason for it to wait; it can go ahead and fully implement action on those issues.  The forum is more interested in examining the long-term issues to see how we can develop for the next century, in particular in Dublin, with the increased demand for taxis arising from changes in habits in night life and other issues.  It will not be concerned with the short-term issues.  I hope that can be done satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to disabilities, certain concessions were made many years ago by the Department of the Environment for taxis so that they would be able to cater for disabled people.  They have not <Col N="56" /> worked as intended at the time.  I will raise the matter with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and with the corporation and the councils.  It is an issue which has been raised by the bodies concerned with disability which I have met on other matters.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with the local authorities.  The work they have done will be taken on board.  However, there is not agreement on the issues.  Without people being prepared to work the system as a means of public transport we will not move the agenda forward.  Agreement with the people involved in the industry on the assessments made is needed.  Such agreement does not exist.  Nobody wishes to thwart the good work being done and I hope that work will be implemented.</P>
    <P>I have spent countless hours at committees in Dublin Corporation over the years dealing with taxi, public transport and road congestion issues, yet they have not changed much.  The matter is not as simple as needing more taxis.  There are other, more fundamental issues which must be dealt with.  Hopefully, the forum comprising decision makers from the interested parties will be able to reach conclusions to move the issues on.</P>

We must ensure that as many of the licences as possible are allocated to people with vehicles suitably adapted for people with disabilities.

      <P>When the Taoiseach meets the British Prime Minister will he stress the urgent need for a process of demilitarisation and a new policing service, especially in view of the case of Colin Duffy, which has been the background to disturbances in Lurgan and Armagh?  Is he aware that Colin Duffy has been the subject of a campaign of victimisation by the RUC; was recently released after being held for a year on a trumped up charge which was then dropped; has been assaulted and harassed by the RUC on several occasions since his release; that on Sunday night last, he and his friends were set upon by members of the RUC in what his solicitor described as an episode of unprovoked violence on the way home from his daughter's christening party &mdash; I have copies of statements by witnesses with me &mdash; and this is the background to the unchanged attitude of the RUC against which the events of last evening must be seen?  Given the questions asked and commentary in the House yesterday, will the Taoiseach confirm his view of Sinn Féin's full commitment to the peace process and his acceptance of its significant and ongoing efforts in the collective search for an agreed and peaceful settlement of the conflict?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the events surrounding Mr. Duffy and ongoing events.  I am not aware of all that the Deputy has stated but disturbances make life more difficult and we need to continue to focus on the talks.  I said yesterday I was quite satisfied when Sinn Féin signed the Mitchell principles they were bound by them. Yesterday, we addressed some remarks that were made by a prominent Sinn Féin member over the weekend.  I mentioned that I had seen the clarification on that and have since received further clarification on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>

Has the Government, in the context of my earlier question, put forward any concrete proposals on the reform of policing given that it is a central issue in discussions and this is accepted by everybody?  Will the Taoiseach raise with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair some of the suggestions that have been made for joint work between both Governments in matters such as information technology in schools, food safety and various areas where bilateral co-operation could be helpful in an east-west and north-south way?</P>

      <P>Depending on the time available some of those issues can be addressed but at official level they have been and continue to be progressed.  I did not say I had received any written clarification, but the issue concerning Mr. Molloy was raised here yesterday and I said that in clarification he stated that if the negotiations leading to agreement collapsed they would return to dialogue and negotiations and would not fall back into conflict.  I stated if people were talking about an armed conflict it was a worrying issue.  I have since been told they are working towards an agreement through negotiations and not talking about going back to an armed struggle.</P>
      <P>On the issue of policing, in the context of the strands and the papers put forward on all issues referred to, we have not put forward a position paper on it.  However, I will raise the policing and security issue and the intensification of security in some parts of Northern Ireland when I meet the British Prime Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Fourteen parliamentary draftsmen are employed in the office of the Attorney General.  Included in this figure are four draftsmen engaged on a contract basis, one of whom commenced work on 17 November 1997.  There are two vacancies which are expected to be filled shortly following a competition held by the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's contention that there is a delay in producing promised legislation. Eleven Bills have been published since this Government came to office at the end of June and five Bills which lapsed on the dissolution of <Col N="60" /> the last Dáil and Seanad have been, or are about to be, restored.  Drafting of a number of other Bills, some of which are very substantial, is far advanced.  I am confident that most, if not all, of the 21 Bills listed in the Government's press release of 25 September 1997, for publication or restoration prior to the Christmas recess will be delivered along with other Bills.</P>
    <P>The Government's legislative programme is substantial and I am anxious that it proceed as rapidly as possible.  If it proves feasible to engage additional suitable parliamentary draftsmen to expedite the programme the Government will do so.  We are also seeking to ensure the training of recently recruited draftsmen proceeds as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that of the nine Bills published when I put down this question, eight were the work of the previous Government and the one which originated with the Government was a two section Bill to close a loophole arising from a recent court case on kidnapping?  Does he accept the previous Attorney General established reforms in the office and that a shortage of draftspersons is not the cause of the delay in legislation?  Will the 21 Bills listed in the Government's schedule for this session be published before the Christmas recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will and pressure is being kept on all Departments to make sure that happens.  What is important is not the number of Bills put through in a session but that when Bills are included in the legislative programme they are followed through.  Former Attorneys General did a great deal of work and the previous one probably did more in the area of technology than anybody else.  I give him credit for that.  The difficulty is that some of the draftsmen recruited during the time of the previous Attorney General on short-term contracts came from various countries and have moved on.  There is a worldwide shortage of parliamentary draftsmen.  The Attorney General's office has been engaged in the slow process of trying to recruit and train parliamentary draftsmen.  It has always been a slow process. Frequently when trained those people move on. I am not sure what we can do about it.  There are two vacancies in the office.  One person commenced working in that office this week and another is due to commence prior to Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Departments have suitably qualified people but maybe not the perfection or standard required to bring legislation before the House, while other Departments use people as advisers to assist in the process.  That <Col N="61" /> has been the practice in some Departments for a number of years.  Other Departments have no expertise whatsoever.  This is a difficulty.  When I was Minister for Labour &mdash; and possibly in Deputy Quinn's time as Minister for Labour &mdash; an outside expert facilitated the legislation we were able to bring to the House in the 1980s.  That facility is not used in all Departments.  The parliamentary draftsmen in the Attorney General's office state that regardless of how it is done they still have to go through the full process.  That process is shortened when a great deal of the preparatory work is done.  In other Departments people involved in this work do not necessarily receive additional remuneration.  They are people who have legal qualifications, which they set about achieving in their spare time with some small assistance from the State.  Such people should be used when available.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will accept all Members have a common objective in relation to expediting legislation, particularly of the type to which Deputy Bruton drew our attention this morning on the Order of Business which is of critical commercial importance.  I refer to the copyright legislation.  Without wishing to score political points, I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that in some Departments, one of which I had the honour to be involved in, the former Department of Enterprise and Employment, there was a serious competence deficit in the area responsible for the credit union legislation, the consumer protection legislation and, I suspect, the copyright legislation which has 190 sections. Given that the Taoiseach has direct responsibility for the strategic management initiative, will he look at the operation of those Departments and revisit a Government decision, which I asked the Secretary of the Government at the time to have noted, that there should be a co-ordinated training programme across Departments for the training of civil servants to ensure legislation is prepared to a satisfactory pre-parliamentary draftsman stage, in order not to waste the time of the scarce and skilled parliamentary draftsmen?  He will be excoriated by us unless he addresses that issue.  It is in the interests of dealing with this country's problems that I ask the Taoiseach to look at that problem, otherwise the legislative programme will not get off the ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall the Deputy's suggestion and I undertake to look at it.  We have a total of 14 parliamentary draftsmen who are involved in legislation, regulations, consolidation of Bills, reviewing cases and dealing with the many issues that arise.  Theirs is a heavy workload.  There are some 90 Bills in various stages of the parliamentary process.  The speed at which these Bills move forward is unsatisfactory and has been for a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree &mdash; certainly it had been my experience when holding the office he now holds &mdash; that one of the biggest problems the parliamentary draftsman's office faces is when a Government changes its order of priority of drafting of legislation?  That means that a Bill with 90 per cent of the work completed has to be dropped and something else started from scratch.  Will the Taoiseach agree that he should ensure a priority is set for drafting, however difficult that may be?  Once set it should be adhered to, otherwise there will be much unproductive chopping and changing of work in the parliamentary draftsman's office which will slow down the total corpus of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done that.  That is the reason I chose 21 Bills which we will try to deal with in this session.  Some priority Bills have to be dealt with such as the education Bill and the employment equality Bill, which required substantial redrafting.  A number of other Bills which have been around for some considerable time dealing with constitutional or other legal issues need to be dealt with.  Except for one or two items of urgent legislation where we need to make amendments, I would prefer to adhere to that programme.  I accept that a parliamentary draftsman or whoever is dealing with the legislation may have to move on.  That happens in the case of finance Bills, social welfare Bills, urgent Bills and regulations that have been challenged.  This is part of the ongoing process.  Litigation means we are having to do that far more than previously. I read a note by the previous Attorney General which spelled out how often that has happened in the past five years compared with what happened in the previous 50 years.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, he has made in getting the European Commission to agree to a standard corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent; if his attention has been drawn to the views of Commissioners Monti and Van Miert on this proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In May the previous Government announced plans to <Col N="63" /> introduce a single 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax for trading profits and a higher 25 per cent rate for non-trading profits on the basis that this would be phased in over the coming years to eventually replace the current regime.</P>
      <P>As has been the practice with previous decisions in relation to the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing, the Commission was informed of the Government decision shortly after its announcement in May. Separate meetings have been held with Commissioner Van Miert, who is responsible for EU Competition and State Aid rules, and with Commissioner Monti, who is responsible for taxation. In the light of the discussions which have taken place to date with two commissioners, I am satisfied that a standard low rate of corporation tax for all sectors of the economy will not run into difficulty <i>vis-a-vis</i> EU State aid rules, nor should it be affected by the proposed EU code of conduct on business taxation which is currently under discussion.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Van Miert has sought clarification on certain aspects of the phasing in of the new regime, including transitional arrangements, and this is the subject matter of the discussions. However, the particular rate of corporation tax is not an issue in these ongoing discussions.</P>
      <P>As regards the code of conduct, this is due to be considered by the ECOFIN Council in December and the proposal is for a voluntary code of conduct which would fully respect the principle of subsidiarity in taxation matters and would not interfere with a member state's right to set its own general taxation levels.  It is proposed that the code would address certain aspects of business taxation which may be harmful to the Community interest.  The focus would be on special measures or schemes which provide a low effective tax rate relative to the general business tax rate in the country in question and which involve other special features of a potentially distortionary nature.</P>

We should be thankful if we can succeed in securing a rate of 12.5 per cent as long as we do not get into greater difficulty by the Minister's party reopening the issue.  Is the Minister aware the Commission has agreed to a paper submitted yesterday by Commissioner Van Miert, the essential element being that a favourable lower tax rate, even to manufacturing industry, is deemed to be a state aid and consequently falls within his remit and it is his strong view that it should be harmonised in line with the harmonisation of state aids for industry across the Union?

      <P>The Deputy and the Chair seem to be getting on exceptionally well today.  I would not like to interrupt the debate between them.  The manufacturing tax rate of 10 per cent was accepted by the Commission as a general taxation measure whereas the 10 per cent rate for IFSC and Shannon based companies was accepted as a state aid.  The Government of the day had to apply to the Commission to obtain approval of the IFSC's 10 per cent rate by way of written opinion.  The Commission deemed it acceptable that the 10 per cent rate in respect of the IFSC and Shannon should apply up to the year 2005, which was to be regarded as or within the context of State aid.  As my predecessor will know, never until late in 1996 did the Commission indicate that the 10 per cent manufacturing tax rate might to be regarded as general State aid.  Late in that year we were put on notice by the Commission that this was the manner in <Col N="67" /> which that 10 per cent manufacturing rate might be construed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know Deputy Quinn made that clear on many occasions.  As a result, the then Government, in which Deputy Quinn was the Minister for Finance, began some work on this matter.  It had been accepted over those years that our general corporation tax rate would be reduced from 50 per cent to 40 per cent, which obtained for a long time, then to 38 per cent and to its present level of 36 per cent.</P>
      <P>Resulting from much work and negotiations undertaken by the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn's Government submitted a proposal to the Commission that in future&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the new rate would be 12.5 per cent for trading income and 25 per cent for passive income and that the Irish Government would reduce its general tax rate over a period of years.  Commissioners Van Miert and Monti were informed at that time.</P>
      <P>The interim negotiations on transitional arrangements dealt with how that reduction would be applied.  I can assure the Deputy that each member state has a legal right to set its general rate of business or personal taxation.  Therefore, a possible interpretation of what Deputy Quinn read yesterday &mdash; I do not suggest it was his &mdash; should not be taken to mean that the Commission has the right to dictate to any member state its business tax rate.</P>
      <P>When the general level of Irish corporation tax is reduced from its present rate to the new single low rate it will be within our competence to apply it.  What is at present being negotiated by Commissioners Van Miert and Monti is the manner in which we should go about that process.  Whether the single low rate should be 10 per cent or 12.5 per cent has not been raised with either Commissioner.  What is at issue is how we proceed from a high general rate to the new single low one.  That new rate will be announced by me on budget day.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he has taken since 8 October 1997 to have the European Commission undertake a study of the impact upon employment which the abolition of duty free sales will have across the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not taken any direct action since that date to have the European Commission undertake a study of the impact on employment which the abolition of duty free sales <Col N="68" /> will have across the European Union.  Such a study was called for by the Deputy as my predecessor in the Department of Finance.  My colleagues continue to lobby for support for such a study and, as appropriate, the pressure will be maintained at European Union events, such as the forthcoming Summit on employment.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the ECOFIN Council and the Commission are well aware of the Irish position.  What they need are similar expressions of opinion by other member states.  There is no point in my approaching the Council again without further information on the consequences for Ireland of the ending of duty free sales.  Therefore, while I will encourage our partners to support the call on the Commission to undertake an EU-wide study into the impact of the abolition of duty free sales, I intend to examine the results of my own study before deciding how best to take this issue forward with my ECOFIN colleagues. That study is not likely to be completed until the end of the year.</P>
      <P>As I have already reported to the House, the results of my study will form a sound basis for our contribution to any further discussions on this topic both at the ECOFIN Council and within Europe more generally.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister explain to the House how, on the one hand, he has taken no action to convince the Commission or ECOFIN Council to revisit the subject while, on the other, his colleagues continue to lobby for a change in this area?

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy should be aware that three ECOFIN meetings have been held since I became Minister for Finance, on 13 October and 10 and 17 November.  Furthermore, as he probably also knows better than anybody else on that side of the House, if a proposal is submitted &mdash; the present position being that duty free will end on 30 June 1999 &mdash; to reverse that decision, the Commission only can advance that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn knows, as others should, that to change the decision of 1991, it must be proposed by the Commission and be agreed unanimously by all 15 member states.  That fact must be borne in mind.  My Cabinet colleagues have been dealing with this matter, in particular the Minister for Public Enterprise within the Council of Transport Ministers.  There is evidence to suggest that Transport Ministers have been exerting considerable pressure in this respect.  While no one can <Col N="69" /> predict how these matters will develop over the next 18 or 19 months, that is the factual position with regard to duty free sales.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At any stage since assuming office has the Minister requested that this matter be placed even on the agenda for an informal lunch-time discussion at meetings of the ECOFIN Council?  In the debate prior to the Summit on employment to be held in Luxembourg the Taoiseach stated specifically he would raise the issue of duty free.  Is the Minister aware whether the Taoiseach has specifically requested the Luxembourg Presidency to have this matter listed for formal or informal discussion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <P>Consequently, the Deputy, my predecessor, decided to initiate a study here and to intervene generally before consultants could be appointed.  Early in my term of office I appointed consultants to study this matter because all studies undertaken to date have been prepared by somebody involved in the trade or others who could be deemed to have had a vested interest.  That study should be completed by 31 December next and armed with that information I will be better placed to accede to some of the Deputy's requests.  However, the Deputy should remember that one year only has elapsed since he endeavoured to raise this matter when, let us say, it did not receive a hearty response.</P>

      <P>The September informal ECOFIN agreed that there will be a pre-announcement of the bilateral exchange rates of the currencies of the participating member states at the same time as the participants in EMU are decided and announced, which is due to take place in the first weekend of May 1998.  These rates will become effective on 1 January 1999 and, in line with the Treaty on the European Union, the setting of the conversion rates against the euro can only take place on that date.</P>
      <P>As regards the Irish pound, the Government's intention is that Ireland will join EMU at an exchange rate that meets the needs of the economy in the fullest sense of the term, and that between now and decision day we will keep the issue under active review.

There is an arrangement under which I have met with a group which came together in the 1992-3 period.

For the benefit of the House will he recite the considerations without opting for either rate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy probably knows, my policy in this regard, as Minister for Finance and when I was the Fianna Fáil Opposition spokesperson on Finance, has been outlined on <Col N="71" /> the many occasions I have been asked this question both inside and outside the House.  I will repeat it again.  In regard to the rate at which Ireland joins, I will take account of what I consider to be the best rate for the Irish economy in the fullest sense of the term.  I know Deputy Noonan does not want to make mischief in this regard but if I gave emphasis to any one sector or expressed a view on what I thought was more important in one area than another, it might be interpreted by the markets that I was signalling a course of policy which may not be in the best interests of the economy.  For those obvious and sound reasons I have resisted on all occasions any discourse on this matter.  I am strongly of the view, and have been for a considerable time, that the less said on matters of currency and interest rates by Ministers for Finance or people in authority, the better.  History is littered with financial tragedies as a result of people speaking out of turn.  I considered this matter over a long period and made up my mind on it even before I was an Opposition spokesperson.  It has been termed the &ldquo;button lip&rdquo; policy and that is what will operate until we join.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>One can sympathise with the Minister's desire to be prudent on this matter but there is another issue.  I put it to the Minister that entry to EMU is one of the most momentous decisions that will be made by this generation of Irish politicians.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;button lip&rdquo; policy is fine but a democratic deficit is emerging on that policy and people do not know exactly what is going on. I do not expect the Minister to indicate an option but it would be better if he gave a more balanced view of the pros and cons of a particular strategy so that he could share the context of the decision he will make with the public.  The conversion rate will be relevant to everybody's pocket.</P>
      <P>The Minister said a decision on the conversion rate will be made in the first weekend of May 1998 in regard to the states that will participate in EMU.  Is the Minister constrained from announcing a decision on conversion rates prior to that date if turbulence in the markets, for example, made it desirable to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain the background to this particular decision and the way it will take place.  At the Mondorf-les-Bains informal ECOFIN in September it was decided by the member states that on the weekend of 1 to 3 May 1998 the bilateral exchange rates between member states will be set.  At the same time, the participating member states in EMU will be decided.  That will <Col N="72" /> not necessarily be the rate at which countries will be interlocked against the euro as and from 1 January 1999 because the treaty lays down that at midnight on 31 December 1998 the rate of the ecu will become the conversion rate at that time. The ecu is an amalgam of a basket of currencies. It must be remembered, however, that some of the currencies which make up the strength of the ecu will not be participating countries and in theory there might be some fluctuation.  The rate at which participating countries will interlock with the euro will be the rate at 31 December 1998.  The decision taken at Mondorf-les-Bains was that when the participating countries are decided upon in the first weekend of May 1998, the bilateral exchange rates will be decided at that time.  In theory, therefore, from 1 May 1998 until 31 December 1998 some fluctuation could occur but it is unlikely because everybody will know the bilateral exchange rates between the participating countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing my point. Does the agreement he has made commit him to waiting until that date?  If considerations were to arise between now and May 1998, is the Minister free, as the Irish Minister for Finance, to make an announcement ahead of that date if trading conditions justify it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Minister for Finance is responsible for setting the Irish exchange rate. From 1 January 1999 those powers will no longer apply because the Irish pound will no longer be an internationally traded currency.  Up to 1 January 1999, the Irish pound will have a quoted rate against currencies throughout the Union and the world but in the first weekend of May 1998, participating member states in EMU will set their bilateral exchange rates.  Between now and the first weekend of May 1998, any Government could, under the current law, set a new rate for the Irish pound if it so wished, but as I pointed out to the Deputy earlier, and which he kindly accepted, speculation in this regard by a Minister for Finance would be unhelpful to the markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the reason the Minister has steadfastly adhered to a &ldquo;button lip&rdquo; policy until now but there is now a necessity for a &ldquo;button brain&rdquo; policy.  The idea that the Irish Minister for Finance can set the exchange rate is totally at variance with the facts.  Will the Minister agree that it is the monitoring committee, meeting over the weekend, which sets exchange rates and that no member state of the EMS and ERM can arbitrarily set the exchange rate, as he has mistakenly and perhaps inadvertently suggested to the House?  I further put it to the Minister that he will not be in a position to arbitrarily suggest, select or choose a rate in the weekend of 1-3 May and that what is critically necessary for the markets and stability to ensure there are no surprises in the marketplace is for the Minister to outline an understanding of what the process will <Col N="73" /> be in the debate between now and May.  Will the Minister agree that the bilateral rates that will be fixed within the mechanism of the monetary committee of the ECOFIN Council on the Friday of the weekend of 1-3 May will not necessarily be the rates that will apply between 1-3 May and 1 January?</P>

To avoid the sort of turbulence that could cause chaos in the Irish monetary system, which the Minister steadfastly wants to avoid but in respect of which he is creating serious difficulties, he must give some signals, as Deputy Noonan invited him to do, to ensure there will be no surprises.  In the interest of the national currency, for which the Minister has partial responsibility, will he not revisit his decision to adopt a &ldquo;button lip&rdquo; policy and have a clear brain policy instead of the present &ldquo;button brain&rdquo; policy because he does not know what he is talking about?

Perhaps that is because the parties in this and previous Governments have got so carried away with their propaganda on the Celtic Tiger that they failed to appreciate there can be drastic effects for our economy as a result of our joining EMU.  The Minister will agree that the cycle of the capitalist market is boom and bust.  Is the Minister not concerned about when there is a downturn of the effects on our currency of it being locked into EMU and the British currency not being locked into it?  It could have a disastrous impact on our exports which would put thousands of jobs in exposed sectors at risk?  Is the Minister aware that as preparations for EMU intensify in many European economies there is growing resistance among large sections of workers in many European countries to the programme of cuts in public expenditure and the social wage involved?  For example, cuts in pension rates and conditions for public sector workers in France has become a major issue. There is widescale and justifiable resistance by workers.  The protection of their hard won rights can mean that the timescale set could go into never-never land.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins has opened up the debate on whether EMU is a good prospect and whether Ireland should join.  All those issues were discussed at one forum or another over the past number of years.  The one point on which I agree with the Deputy is that the debate has not engaged the majority of our people, but that is not the fault of Members.  Over the past number of years there has been continuous debate on EMU in subcommittees and on the floor of this House.  That has been badly reported in most of the national media until quite recently.  The other matters raised by the Deputy were taken into account many years ago by the originators of the idea of EMU, by successive Irish Governments and by a number of independent research institutions which carried out analysis of what was best for Irish interests.  We decided to join economic and monetary union with the first wave of participating countries.  This Government, the previous Government and the one before that decided we should participate from day one in the overall interests of the economy.</P>

      <P>The decision on who will participate in the third stage of economic and monetary union will be made early next May, in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article <Col N="75" /> 109j of the Maastricht Treaty.  The Council of Ministers, ECOFIN, will assess whether each member state fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency on the basis of convergence reports from the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute. ECOFIN will recommend its findings to the Council meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, who will, after receiving the opinion of the European Parliament, confirm which member states fulfil the conditions.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom has an opt-out from the provisions of EMU, under a Protocol attached to the Maastricht Treaty.  Ireland decided not to seek such opt-out.  Under the terms of the Protocol, the United Kingdom has notified the Council of Ministers that it does not intend to move to the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999. Consequently, the United Kingdom is under no obligation to move to the third stage.  The United Kingdom may, however, reverse its notification at any time after the beginning of that stage.</P>
      <P>The British Chancellor of the Exchequer in his statement to the House of Commons on 27 October last made it clear that, barring some unforeseen change in economic circumstances, the United Kingdom will not participate in EMU during the lifetime of the present Westminster Parliament.  However, the Chancellor stated that, if a single currency is successful, and the economic case for Britain is clear and unambiguous, the United Kingdom should be part of it.  Therefore, the United Kingdom Government has for the first time stated that, in principle, membership of a successful single currency would be beneficial for Britain and Europe.</P>
      <P>The Chancellor of the Exchequer also said that it is in the United Kingdom's national interest for the single currency to work.  In particular, the United Kingdom will use its position during its EU Presidency to play a full part in ensuring a smooth launch of the single currency and has also indicated a determination to prepare intensively for its introduction.  The European Commission has welcomed the overall positive United Kingdom's attitude towards the euro and its determination to prepare intensively for the introduction of the single currency.  I, too, welcome the constructive approach being adopted by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a decision by the United Kingdom to enter EMU would have positive aspects for the Irish economy, it is a matter for the United Kingdom Government to exercise, as it wishes, the discretion it is afforded by the treaty.  My priority remains ensuring that Ireland qualifies for EMU and will take part in the third stage from the beginning.  When the Maastricht Treaty received the endorsement of the Irish people, this was given without qualification or any provision for Ireland to opt out from the provisions for economic and monetary union.  Membership of EMU, irrespective of what the United Kingdom does, will on balance be of benefit for Ireland &mdash;<Col N="76" /> an assessment borne out in studies by both the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council.</P>
    <P>The ESRI's EMU study considered, in a situation where Ireland goes into EMU and the United Kingdom stays out, both the possibility of sterling strength and sterling weakness against the euro.  The estimate of 1 per cent of GNP over the medium term presented in the ESRI study of the cost of the loss of exchange rate flexibility for the Irish economy allows for periods of sterling strength, as has been experienced since summer 1996.  When estimating the cost to the Irish economy of the loss of the exchange rate instrument in EMU the ESRI assumed that sterling would behave against the euro as it had behaved against the deutschmark, that is, a depreciating trend in sterling over time, interrupted by periods of sterling strength, reversed by sharp downward movements in sterling.</P>
    <P>The ESRI study went on to analyse in some detail the impact of an extreme scenario of a sharp 20 per cent sterling depreciation.  It also analysed the impact of an oil price shock, which leads &mdash; with the UK outside EMU &mdash; to a medium term sterling appreciation of 12 per cent. That a sharp 20 per cent sterling appreciation was not explicitly assessed does not bias the results of the study since the ESRI's findings are based on the behaviour of sterling against the DM historically &mdash; which includes periods of sterling appreciation and depreciation &mdash; and also draws on the likely impact of each as disclosed by the scenario analysis carried out in the report.</P>
    <P>In any event, it should be recalled that, in addition to the requirements to co-ordinate economic policies and to avoid excessive deficits, the Treaty on European Union requires all non-participating member states to treat exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest.</P>
    <P>The overall conclusion of the ESRI study, that EMU membership by Ireland would yield a net overall benefit to the Irish economy even if the UK was not to participate, remains valid.</P>
    <P>I believe EMU will start on time and Ireland will play its full part from the start.  Ireland approaches EMU from a position of considerable strength.  The priority now is to prepare for successful participation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply, but unfortunately he did not answer my question.  I specifically asked if either his Department or the ESRI would undertake a study against a scenario, which nobody anticipated 18 months ago, whereby sterling would appreciate by as much as 20 per cent against the punt and, consequently, possibly against the euro. The study undertaken, which the Minister referred to in his reply, quantified that approximately 28,000 jobs would be at risk in the scenario where sterling outside EMU, and the punt inside, would depreciate by 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To facilitate the debate Deputy Higgins and <Col N="77" /> others referred to, it would be useful and informative if a study could be undertaken and published either by the Department or the ESRI dealing with that scenario, which is now much more likely than it was previously.  Will the Minister agree to undertake such a study, postulating a scenario where sterling would appreciate by 20 per cent &mdash; which is approximately where it is at present &mdash; and examining what the impact of unemployment and inflation would be on this economy?</P>

      <P>For some time the UK position has been interpreted by many people as meaning the UK will not join EMU on day one and will not join for some considerable time.  When the British Labour Party assumed power earlier this year the soundings from it were far more pro-European than the previous Administration's.  As a result, there was some speculation in the market place that the participation of the UK in EMU would be changed somewhat by the Labour Government.  In his statement some weeks ago, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, laid out quite clearly that the UK Government was in favour of the idea, in principle, but that it would not be considered in the lifetime of this parliament.  All that was known when the ESRI was doing this study, therefore, there is nothing new in what happened in recent weeks.  All that Chancellor Brown's statement has done is to reiterate what everybody understood the position would be in any event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan may possibly be right as to what will energise the people between now and 1 January 1999, but this date has been known for some considerable time and this debate has gone on for an even longer time. The ESRI study was conducted in the full knowledge that we will participate on 1 January 1999. No useful purpose would now be served by commissioning a new debate, except the negative aspect which is that it might give the impression abroad that Ireland was not fully committed to joining EMU in the first wave of participants. That would be totally unhelpful to the Irish position and to the marketplace.  This Government and its two immediate predecessors wanted to make sure Ireland would fulfil all the criteria and that if it did, we would be in the first wave of countries participating in EMU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  When we brokered the Maastricht Treaty this is what the people voted for.  It would be totally unhelpful at this late stage to commission another report and seek to give the impression abroad that Ireland was reconsidering its position.  We are not reconsidering our position.  We are joining in the first wave of participating countries in January 1999 and no other impression should be given by anybody else.</P>
      <P>Over the past four or five years the level of debate among people was not as we would like it to have been, but there has been an avalanche of information from all kinds of official, trade and industry sources.  Arising from that, the Government commissioned the ESRI report and the National Economic and Social Council looked at it also.  To commission another report at this late stage would be futile and would create uncertainty where none exists.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister does not believe it is his job to keep his mouth shut on one of the most important issues confronting this country.  Is it not the case that the decision announced by the new British Labour Government in the House of Commons is a new factor in this?  Nobody is asking the Minister to reconsider his position or to send out any such signal. The Minister is being asked to address the implications of the British Government's decision, which the ESRI report did not.  Some people may hold the view that it was certain the British Government would not join on day one. However, would the Minister agree we did not know what we now know, which is that it will not join during the lifetime of the current parliament?</P>

However, it would be imprudent to commission such a study because it would send a signal that Ireland is reconsidering its position and I am not prepared to do that. Appreciation of sterling was considered by the ESRI in the context of that report.  There is no point revisiting the matter because we will join EMU from day one.  I have resisted and will continue to resist pressure to speculate on what the bilateral Irish exchange rates may be in the lead up to that momentous decision.  We have taken <Col N="80" /> all these factors into account and we will be in the first wave of participating countries.  It would be better if the UK joined from day one or in the medium term, but those matters have been examined by the ESRI which published its report during the Deputy's term in Government.  It does not help to revisit these issues.</P>

Is the Minister deliberately ignoring the fact that jobs could be seriously affected if the Irish currency is pegged at a high level in EMU compared to sterling?  Has the Minister forgotten the currency crisis a few years ago, when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, which pushed the export markets to the limit?  The Government has an obligation to tell the truth about the effects of EMU to the tens of thousands of workers whose jobs depend on this sector.  It should not cover it up and pretend nothing will happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody has suggested what the Deputy is implying in his question.  The ESRI study clearly shows the downside if the UK does not join.  The main document is large but the executive summary states that it would be better if the UK joined EMU from day one or in the near future.  However, it concludes that in the overall interest of the Irish economy, it would be better for Ireland to join with or without the UK. We will not join EMU with our eyes and ears closed.  Nobody has attempted to pull the wool over our eyes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the situation in 1992-93 where an appreciating Irish pound resulted in job losses in our export markets in the UK and colossal interest rates.  The Deputy must remember that, irrespective of how sterling fluctuates, our interest rates will be set by the European Central Bank.  That part of the &ldquo;double whammy&rdquo; will not exist in EMU.  That problem will not arise in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 4(1) of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, the board has been assigned the task of assisting and encouraging development of an industry in the State for the making of films, having regard to the need for the expansion of national heritage through the medium of film making.  In this regard, I believe Deputies will agree that there is a fundamental need to develop our new and emerging talent and to provide opportunities and experience for the development of professional skills and the upskilling of those involved in different aspects of film-making.  Investing in such activities inevitably involves a greater financial risk than backing established and proven teams only.</P>
      <P>To maintain and develop our production capacity and our competitiveness as a location for film production, it is essential also to maintain a critical level of production.  If the Irish Film Board were to be obliged to adopt strictly commercial criteria in deciding upon its investments, it would have to take extremely conservative decisions, supporting only those projects which, by virtue of their commercial strength, do not have so great a need for the board's support. Given the inherently risky nature of the business, even that strategy would not be a cast iron guarantee of success.</P>
      <P>Clearly, if the board were to take such an approach, much of the new and emerging indigenous talent, which is increasingly making its presence felt and winning critical acclaim internationally, would not have had that opportunity. I believe, and I am sure Deputies would agree, that investing in our own talent in this way &mdash; this is the focus of the Irish Film Board's efforts &mdash; is an investment which, while it may not reap the financial returns of a stringently commercial approach, is one which will be richly repaid in the years to come as our film makers gain in competence and stature and our industry grows and consolidates.  As Deputy Monica Barnes pointed out, it is precisely in the area of indigenous production that we can come to terms with our identity and expunge the stage Irish representations of Ireland which, unfortunately, still linger in certain quarters.</P>
      <P>If the Irish Film Board were to operate on strictly commercial criteria which would create the conditions for a revolving fund, it could be validly asked whether there would be a need for the board at all.  Why not just leave it to the banks?</P>
      <P>By international standards, the level of recoupment achieved by the Irish Film Board &mdash; at 20 per cent &mdash; is very good and I hope the board can maintain this record and improve upon it wherever possible.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="84" /> Deputy Donal Carey inquired what I was doing about the European Commission's proposal for a European guarantee fund to promote film and television production, having regard to the Irish Presidency initiative on this matter in 1996.  The Irish Presidency compromise initiative on the guarantee fund, which sought to address the objections of several member states to the original proposal put forward by the European Commission, failed because it did not secure the necessary unanimous support within the Council of Culture and Audiovisual Ministers.  At the next ministerial Council meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, 24 November, the Luxembourg Presidency has put forward a much diluted compromise as compared with the Irish proposal and I would be less than honest if I held out any hope that unanimity would be secured on this occasion either.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donal Carey was concerned at the possibility that section 2 of the Bill might lead to industrial relations problems such as have arisen in the National Museum.  I repeat what I said in my opening speech, that these are standard provisions for all non-commercial State bodies and represent no threat to the efficient operation of the board.  In the absence of the statutory provisions, administrative procedures had in any event been put in place by the Department of Finance for several years.  Section 2 of the Bill is simply putting these arrangements on a statutory basis as they are in other such bodies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins suggested that my opening statement argued for an equivalence between the section 35 incentive and funding by the Irish Film Board.  I believe that both measures are of equal importance and that my Department, with the Film Board, has a central role to play in the elaboration of the film and television policy of the State.  I was making this point to underline the fact that both section 35 and the supports offered by the board are the major determinants of what is taking place in the industry currently. These measures fund and ensure the healthy balance which exists between indigenous and non-indigenous production.  Productions supported by the Irish Film Board also avail of section 35 in most cases, so that there is a synergy between the Irish Film Board production loans and section 35 which is of particular benefit to indigenous production.</P>
    <P>However, I have no hesitation in acknowledging the important contribution other measures make to the development of the industry here. These include: the impact of significant commissionings from the independent production sector from RTE, Teilifís na Gaeilge and, very soon, TV3; the growing infrastructure of production and post-production facilities, including, as Deputy Donal Carey stated, the sophisticated dubbing facilities which have been supported by Údarás na Gaeltachta and Forbairt; and the focused training strategies for the industry which are being directed by the National Training Committee for Film and Television. <Col N="85" /> Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Pat Carey raised the question of improvements in the section 35 tax incentive scheme for investment in film projects.  The section 35 measure has been extremely successful in encouraging film and television production in the State.  Given that the overall volume of production covered by section 35 certification this year is well in excess of 1996 &mdash; involving a 41 per cent increase in gross budgets and a 36 per cent increase in Irish spend &mdash; and given also that the future of the section 35 measure, which is in place until 1999, will have to be addressed in the context of the 1998 budget, my inclination is to address the matter substantively next year.  However, I am in receipt of a submission from IBEC on this subject and I will give it careful consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins asked why the proposals put forward by STATCOM should be passed on to the industry think tank I will soon establish.  In working with the independent film and television production industry, STATCOM has done valuable work during the past four years.  However, I also want to encourage strong inputs from the wide-ranging interests in the industry.  While Government, through its financial, logistical and training supports can indeed create a climate favourable for the development of the industry, it is also clear the response of the industry is central to success in achieving our common objectives.  Four years on from the establishment of STATCOM, it is entirely reasonable to extend this discussion and have industry and State interests working together in an atmosphere of mutual respect and shared objectives to exploit fully the potential of the industry.  When we come to formulate our strategic plans for the next ten years, I would like to see the widest possible agreement.</P>
    <P>Much of the credit for progress in the industry has to go to those determined, imaginative, and creative industry professionals without whom we would not have a film industry.  It is important to listen to them, learn from their insights and experience and have their full participation in planning for the future.  To achieve this will be a key task for the industry think tank.  The highly successful deliberations of the 1992 Special Working Group on the Film Production Industry &mdash; which comprised a wide range of both State and industry representatives and was established by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds &mdash; was a very useful model which already saw the State and private sectors combining very effectively and constructively together.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also asked how many of the 22 member states of the Council of Europe who have signed the European Co-Production Convention have also ratified it.  My information is that, of the EU member states, only France and Greece have signed but not ratified the convention.  I understand from the legal section of the Council of Europe the convention will obviate the need for formal bilateral agreements between any two States.  It is for this reason I was pleased <Col N="86" /> to announce in my opening speech my intention to accede to the Convention during the first half of next year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan rightly commented on the important role the Film Institute of Ireland has played in the preservation of our film heritage in offering to its membership and to the wider public a wide range of Irish and international cinema, and in the work of its education department.  I am glad An Chomhairle Ealaíon, which operates under the aegis of my Department, gives substantial support to the Film Institute of Ireland.  Funding in the current year amounts to £340,000, reflecting the importance with which the institute is held.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGuinness referred to the remarkable initiative of a group of young Irish film makers who have recently produced a feature film &ldquo;Under the Hawthorn Tree&rdquo;, in Kilkenny and its environs.  It is truly a very laudable achievement, one which is full of hope for the future, that a group of young Irish people in the seven to 19 year age bracket made a film which will be broadcast not only in Ireland but in Britain.  Their use of the latest digital technology illustrates the point that our young people have no difficulty in seizing the opportunities to bring them to the cutting edge of technological development.  I look forward to seeing their film when it reaches the screen and I warmly congratulate those behind the Young Irish Film Makers group for their achievement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan referred to the prospect of John B. Keane's &ldquo;Durango&rdquo; being filmed in County Kerry.  He said that Kerry &ldquo;must put together an attractive package&rdquo; to ensure it is shot in its rightful county.  The Deputy is correct to make a distinction between national incentives for the industry and local initiative, and to emphasise the importance of local drive and enthusiasm to ensure the location of this film in Kerry, given that its author is one of the great sons of that county.  I assure the Deputy of my Department's full co-operation in attracting this film to Ireland, <i>via</i> the section 35 incentive, and I have no doubt that local responses can ensure its location in Kerry.  By way of encouragement I should mention the drive of the people of Wexford played no small part in attracting Steven Spielberg to Ballinesker last July with the film &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo; by triggering assistance from the local authority at the very highest level, appointing a liaison contact to iron out any local logistical problems and involving the county engineer to ensure the proper restoration of the beach, in full co-operation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.</P>
    <P>This is a good cue for other counties to follow and is one reason that, to date, 17 counties have benefited from film production.  Indeed a number of counties have established county film commissions and I believe others are giving consideration to doing so.  This is an excellent way for local interests, public and private, to prepare the <Col N="87" /> ground to facilitate and attract film production in their counties.</P>
    <P>Having referred to &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo;, I want to wholeheartedly endorse what Deputy Belton stated about the co-operation of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces. Their contribution to the industry in providing military personnel and logistical support has made an irreplaceable contribution to the development of our film industry.  Another good example of logistical support offered without undue delay by Government Departments was the British television drama series &ldquo;The Governor&rdquo; which obtained easy access to a number of Irish prisons to authenticate its storyline.  It is precisely this creative approach &mdash; which percolates down in a strong atmosphere of goodwill from Ministers to Departments and to their agencies &mdash; which makes Ireland an attractive working environment for film production.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn referred to the need for professional training, notably producer training.  The National Training Committee for Film and Television is organising a comprehensive range of training courses, including producer training courses, and I know that it has plans to locate some of these courses outside Dublin, including Cork.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn also referred to a dearth of film production facilities &mdash; including technical facilities, in Cork.  However, Cork Regional Technical College already has excellent schools of music and art and design as part of its institution. These areas are very relevant to the film and television production industry.  I have no doubt the schools in question have already made a significant input to the development of the industry. Cork has also achieved an excellent reputation through its international film festival &mdash; now in its 42nd year &mdash; which has achieved international status, particularly in the area of short films.  I am glad my Department was able to provide funding for the new arthouse cinema in Cork under the cultural development incentives scheme.  I welcome the fact that this excellent new cinema space served as a venue for this year's film festival.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus referred to the importance of Ardmore Studios.  I agree that Ardmore Studios is a central element of our film production infrastructure, with its excellent and expanding range of facilities.  I welcome the new sound post-production facilities now available &mdash; including a recently opened second sound stage &mdash; which has meant that many feature films which would normally go to post-production in London or elsewhere are now staying here.  For example, currently &ldquo;Dancing at Lughnasa&rdquo; and John Boorman's &ldquo;I Once Had a Life&rdquo;&mdash; having shot on location in Ireland &mdash; remained in sound post-production at Ardmore.  This greatly increases employment in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the new sound facilities at Ardmore recently enabled 16 personnel to take part in a <Col N="88" /> detailed course, funded by the national training committee, at the studios, with follow-on key placements at sound post production facilities abroad.  This course involved traineeships in sound post-production for assistant sound editors and represents an excellent example of how, over time, the broader strategic objectives of filling gaps in facilities and upskilling our workforce can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have had this opportunity to listen and respond to Deputies' contributions. The quality of these contributions reflects the interest and support from all sides of this House in the progress of our increasingly self-confident and vibrant film industry.  In the formulation of a strategic plan for the next ten years, I will take careful account of what has been said.  There is a certain urgency in the Bill before us, in that the full amount of the 1997 capital allocation for development and production loans by the board cannot be paid until it becomes law.  I welcome support for the Bill from all sides of the House during this debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very special honour for me to introduce the Turf Development Bill, 1997 to this House.  It is without doubt the most important legislation in relation to Bord na Móna since the original <Col N="89" /> legislation establishing the board was passed by this House just over 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna was established under the Turf Development Act, 1946 as a statutory corporation.  The company is governed by the terms of that legislation but is not subject to the general body of company law which has been developed over the past 30 to 40 years.  As a commercial company now operating in highly competitive markets, it is desirable that Bord na Móna should be reconstituted as a public limited company under the Companies Acts.  This Bill provides that the general powers and duties of the board outlined in the 1946 Act will continue to apply. However, as a company under the Companies Acts, Bord na Móna will be subject to all of the legal obligations and responsibilities that apply under general company law.</P>
    <P>Before speaking in detail on the Bill, I would first like to speak about the history of Bord na Móna, the strategic role peat plays in Irish energy policy and the recent turnaround in the fortunes of the board.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna was born out of the scarcities and privations experienced by this country during the last world war.  The company came into being just over fifty years ago on Friday, 21 June 1946 when the first board held its inaugural meeting in the company's head office in Fitzwilliam Square. One can imagine the Ireland of that time, the privations of the war, the fact that we had a policy of neutrality which left us in a critical situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> isolationism, the general sense that times were tough, the courage required to set up the board and to see that there was a huge source of energy and potential commercial viability under our feet to be harvested.</P>
    <P>The board was charged with responsibility for developing Ireland's bogs and the 1946 Act gave it the necessary powers to perform this work.  Its goal was clear-cut &mdash; to provide Ireland with an indigenous energy supply.  However, achieving this was not so simple.  It was in many ways a huge leap of faith.  Heretofore, turf gathering had been done locally by people using their own methods. Those of us from the midlands or where there are bogs remember happy times bringing home the turf and the associated enjoyment.  One did not work very hard if one was young but one certainly enjoyed the whole experience.  Those times seem tranquil in retrospect, but living through the privations of that time was not at all easy.  The scale of the operation to be tackled dictated that sod peat production had to be mechanised.  The production and use of peat in Russia and Germany were studied and new machine technology was developed.  Large tracts of bog had to be acquired and extensively drained and new work systems devised to undertake the sod peat production work.</P>
    <P>Sod peat was used to manufacture briquettes at Lullymore and for electricity generation at Portarlington and Allenwood.  In the 1950s the board changed over to milled peat to supply the new power stations at Rhode and Ferbane and this <Col N="90" /> necessitated radical changes in drainage systems, technology and work systems.  All of these were developed in-house by Bord na Móna.  It sounds easy to go out to the bog and harvest turf, but the huge scale on which it had to be done, the systems of drainage, technology and engineering, demanded not just physical strength, which it did in abundance, it also required creativity.  One does not think of that when one thinks about a solid matter such as a bog and the saving of turf.</P>
    <P>The board began to export moss peat to the UK in the 1960s and the household fuel market was targeted in a major way by building Croghan and Derrinlough briquette factories.  By the late 1950s Bord na Móna was producing over two million tonnes of peat per annum and had firmly established itself in a pioneering role in this field. Its mission was to develop Ireland's extensive peat reserves as a strategic energy source.  That mission brought significant social and economic benefits to the areas where the operations of the board were concentrated.</P>
    <P>With a turnover of £240 million, Bord na Móna is today one of Ireland's top 100 companies.  Since its establishment, the board has acquired and developed about 88,000 hectares of bogland.  It supplies peat to five power stations, to a large number of Irish homes in the form of peat briquettes and produces and markets horticultural products to many European states.  Since its inception Bord na Móna has designed and developed its own peat production machinery. The company, through its research and development expertise, has also developed pollution abatement systems using peat, and it is also provides consultancy and analytical services.  I noted with great interest when I visited the company's headquarters the pioneering research that is being done there which, in a modern sense, represents a further act of creativity which does not replicate the earlier work.  The young people who are carrying out the new research represent further steps forward for the company.  The value of peat was particularly noticeable during the oil crisis of the 1970s and 1980s when it was cheaper than oil &mdash; it was significantly cheaper at times &mdash; for many years.  While I hope we have left those days behind us recent events have given rise to fears that the same could happen again.</P>
    <P>Security of supply is also one of the main planks of the European Union's energy policy. The EU recognises the need for diversity of fuel supplies and has accepted that account must be taken of the need to develop indigenous energy sources.  This is best illustrated in the recently adopted EU Electricity Directive which provides that 15 per cent of the fuel mix used in electricity generation can be reserved for indigenous sources.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna is of major importance to the areas in which it operates.  Peat production by Bord na Móna and the associated ESB electricity generation business create significant employment, with corresponding social and economic spin-off, in the regions concerned.  With more <Col N="91" /> than 2,000 employees, Bord na Móna is a major employer and contributes enormously to the local economy, particularly in the midlands.  I do not wish to take from the Fine Gael spokesperson, but those of us reared in midland areas where there is much bog know the <i>frisson</i> which runs through a community&mdash;</P>

      <P>The physical geography of much of the midlands is dominated by large tracts of bog which are the only natural resource of any significance.  As a consequence, the region and, in particular, the many small towns and villages which rely almost exclusively on Bord na Móna and ESB activities are vulnerable to any run down in the peat economy.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the country continues to have a dynamic peat industry and a viable, financially secure and fully commercial Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>The future of Bord na Móna is based on four main pillars.  The first is the successful restructuring that has been undertaken by the company over the past nine years or so.  We all remember the large meetings held at Rochfortbridge and other places during the time difficult decisions had to be taken by the workers and management. The second is the investment by the State of £100 million of equity into Bord na Móna and the restructuring of the company.  The previous Government took the decision to inject this equity into the company and I was glad to follow it up this year, with this Bill.  The third is the planned construction of the new state of the art peat fired power station.  I will deal with this in greater detail later.  The fourth is this legislation which will give Bord na Móna a modern company configuration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has gone through a major rationalisation programme in recent years.  This programme was unavoidable.  By the late 1980s production levels continued to fall and the financial performance was poor.  Long term issues which had to be addressed included the continuing cost <Col N="92" /> of servicing loan capital and the level of overheads which were a legacy of older times.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation process which ensued was enormous.  The new self-directed work teams which were introduced allowed for maximum flexibility and resulted in greatly improved productivity levels.  The new work systems allowed workers to be rewarded on the basis of output, efficiency and the quality of peat they produced. This innovation, coupled with significant investment in modern machinery, designed and built for the most part by Bord na Móna, has resulted in an 80 per cent increase in productivity since 1988.  Virtually all milled peat is now produced by work teams and the concept of team-based and performance-related pay has been transferred into other areas of activity.</P>
    <P>It is only right that I publicly acknowledge the great work done by the management and workforce of Bord na Móna in turning the company's fortunes around.  Difficult decisions had to be made and Bord na Móna was the first of the State companies to engage in such a major process of change.  As a result, the corporate culture has undergone rapid transformation.  All this culminated in a clear understanding throughout the organisation that Bord na Móna was changing.</P>
    <P>Despite the successes of the rationalisation process, Bord na Móna continued to be in a very serious financial situation.  This brings me to the second plank on which the future of Bord na Móna is based &mdash; the decision by the State to address directly the board's historic debt problem.  At the end of the financial year 1995-6, Bord na Móna still had total borrowings of almost £170 million and a negative net worth of more than £60 million.  During the 1970s and early 1980s peat was cheaper than competing fuels.  As a result, Bord na Móna undertook a series of investments to increase the use of peat in the national energy mix.  This series of investments, known as the third development programme, involved total investment of approximately £164 million over a number of years.  The investment involved, among other things, building two new briquette factories and the development of large areas of bog.</P>
    <P>While the third development programme resulted in increased utilisation of peat, it failed financially.  The programme was predicated on oil prices remaining high for a long period.  However, the collapse in oil prices in the mid-1980s resulted in serious financial losses for Bord na Móna. Some of the investments made at the height of the oil crises became non-viable and the board had to engage in a major write-off of assets during the period 1985-89.</P>
    <P>The third development programme was funded entirely by borrowings, much of them at very high interest rates.  Following the write-off of assets, the majority of the board's debt became unsustainable from a commercial point of view. Despite the benefits of the rationalisation process and a return to profitability, Bord na Móna still had an inordinately high level of debt and a negative <Col N="93" /> net worth in 1993.  Financial consultants engaged that year by the board to look at financial restructuring reported that £126 million of the debt was unsustainable.</P>
    <P>In 1995 the previous Government decided to address the board's debt problem directly through an injection of equity.  I pay tribute to Deputies Dukes and Stagg and the departmental officials for working through the complex issues, compiling the memorandum for Government and seeing it through.  That decision had two advantages.  First, it restored Bord na Móna's balance sheet to commercial normality and complemented and completed the successful operational rationalisation which had been taking place within the company since 1989.  Second, it responded to the need for transparency in dealing with Bord na Móna's debt.  The equity provided and the removal of the historic debt will facilitate a commensurate reduction in the price of milled peat sold to the ESB and will bring to an end the current indirect method of servicing the unsustainable debt.  The reduction in the price of milled peat as a result of the State investment will lead to a saving of approximately £14 million per annum to the ESB.  I hope the company passes this on to consumers by way of lower charges.</P>
    <P>The decision to invest equity in Bord na Móna had to be cleared with the EU Commission from the State aid perspective.  The Commission had received complaints during 1995 that Bord na Móna was in receipt of State aid which was being applied in a manner incompatible with the Treaty of Rome.  The essence of the complaints made by competitors of the board in the horticultural field in other EU states was that the existing pricing arrangement with the ESB for milled peat for electricity generation and the proposed Exchequer equity would give rise to cross-subsidisation of the board's horticultural business, thus distorting competition on the European horticultural market.</P>
    <P>After an exhaustive examination, which took almost two years to complete, the Commission accepted in December 1996 that the equity proposal and the existing pricing arrangement with the ESB were designed to deal solely and directly with the unsustainable debt and that there was no cross-subsidisation.  The Commission did, however, identify the absence of a premium on the State guaranteed loans of the board's horticulture business as possible State aid.  The then Minister gave a commitment to withdraw the State guarantees and to seek reimbursement from Bord na Móna of an amount equivalent to the estimated benefit involved.  A sum of £875,000 was paid to the Exchequer by Bord na Móna earlier this year in full, final and retrospective settlement of the amount due.</P>
    <P>As part of the settlement of the case, the then Minister undertook to bring forward legislation for the incorporation of the board's different business activities as separate legal entities to protect against future cross-subsidisation.  The <Col N="94" /> current legislation meets that undertaking and Part III of the Bill provides specifically for the establishment of the different business activities of Bord na Móna as separate subsidiary companies under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>Following EU clearance, a first injection of equity amounting to £49 million was paid to the board late last year and a further tranche of £51 million was paid about two months ago.  That was commensurate with the early introduction of the Bill and of great assistance to Bord na Móna.  This latest injection brings the total Government investment in Bord na Móna to £100 million.  The company is now on a sound financial footing to meet new challenges.  I emphasise, however, that the Government investment, which is taxpayers' money, is not a free gift to Bord na Móna.  One of the strict conditions attaching to the equity injection is that Bord na Móna reduces its price of milled peat sold to the ESB, thus providing a saving of about £14 million per year.  Paradoxically, while that is very good news for Bord na Móna, there will be an obligation on the company to reduce its price.  That is a new challenge which it will have to face.  As well as having financial benefits, the removal of the huge financial overhang, which must have been a nightmare to those serving on the board, to management and staff, will also be a relief psychologically.</P>
    <P>The planned construction of the new 120mw peat fired power station represents the third pillar of support.  Bord na Móna needs to achieve minimum sales of three million tonnes of milled peat per annum over the next ten years.  Current projections show that the annual quantities of milled peat expected to be consumed by the ESB will decline sharply over the next two decades, from around three million tonnes currently to a little over one million tonnes.  On this basis, Bord na Móna would be unable to generate sufficient revenue from sales to remain viable.  The only realistic means of dealing with the situation is for Bord na Móna to increase sales in the medium term and the current proposal for the construction of a new power station will achieve this through an increase in peat consumption of around one million tonnes annually required for the new station.  The commissioning and building of the new station, therefore, is critical to the future of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The new station is included in the National Development Plan 1994-9 and the EU Commission has agreed to make available £21 million in Structural Funds.  There was some speculation earlier this year that this funding might be lost. One of the key priorities of the new Government, as identified in our programme for Government &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo;, is to ensure this funding is secured.  I am pleased to inform the House, therefore, that the Commissioner has confirmed to me that expenditure incurred up to the end of 2001 will be eligible for co-financing under the Structural Funds.  I am confident this timeframe will allow us to draw down all the grant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> At present all power stations in Ireland are owned by the ESB.  However, the new station is currently the subject of a competition on the open market on a &ldquo;build, own and operate&rdquo; basis.  The competition is now well under way and is being run by a consortium of independent consultants. All aspects of the competition are in the hands of the consortium to ensure transparency in the competition process.  The competition was launched last March and the prequalification phase, which identified five shortlisted candidates, was completed in June.  The competition is now in its second phase and the shortlisted candidates are in the process of finalising their full bids for the project.  It is expected that the preferred bidder will be announced early next year and the competition will then enter the detailed negotiation stage.  In parallel with this, it is expected the winning bidder will apply for planning permission and an EPA licence with a view to engineering-construction phase commencing in early 1999.  The consortium estimates that the station will then take about two and a half years to construct.</P>
    <P>The station will be located in the east midlands where there are sufficient resources of peat to supply the station for many years.  Bord na Móna has identified a site at Clonbullogue, County Offaly, which is available to bidders should they so desire.  Ultimately, however, it will be a matter for the successful bidder in the competition to decide the exact location.  The station will have a major impact on employment in Bord na Móna. The necessary work in the preparation of the bogs and in peat extraction work will support 250 full-time and 250 part-time jobs in the company over the lifetime of the station.  In addition, approximately 450 people will be employed at peak times in construction of the station.  The local economy will benefit significantly from the new station.  Studies carried out on behalf of Bord na Móna have estimated that there will be a direct income impact of £19 million during construction and £8 million per annum during operation of the station.</P>
    <P>The new station will be subject to full planning and environmental requirements.  It will be of the latest &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; design, use the most modern technology and will be substantially more efficient than the existing peat power stations. The new station will give rise to a temporary increase in emissions of CO2 from peat stations but there will be a progressive reduction in CO2 emissions from peat in the years ahead as some of the existing older peat stations come to the end of their operational lives.</P>
    <P>The organisational restructuring, equity injections and new peat station together provide Bord na Móna with a firm foundation to safeguard its future viability.  However, the final ingredient required to further strengthen the board's future prospects is the legal restructuring of the company to provide it with a new, modern corporate structure.  My objective in introducing this Bill is <Col N="96" /> to provide the board with this new structure.  The basic purpose of the Bill is to give Bord na Móna a modern company configuration of the kind required by such a company.  The Bill provides for the conversion of Bord na Móna from a statutory corporation to a public limited company and for the incorporation of Bord na Móna's individual business activities to limited liability subsidiaries.  The Bill also allows for the injection of further equity to the new plc as well as updating certain miscellaneous provisions.</P>
    <P>I am continuing the fine work carried on by previous Ministers and thank them for their efforts in that regard.  I have strong local knowledge, based on constituency and local work over the years, of the work of Bord na Móna and I am very interested in it.  About three months ago I visited Bord na Móna and met each member of the board.  I was greatly impressed by the communion of spirit that exists between all who work there.  There was a lack of the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude and a great belief in sharing of challenges and commitment to Bord na Móna.  That was very evident in the operation of the company.  That belief originated from the challenges the company has had to meet and prepares it for the fresh challenges it faces.  Many people who work in Bord na Móna are the families of those who were the pioneers of the company.  There is a belief that the staff are doing a worthwhile job, which is the nation's business because they are using a native resource, albeit in a modern way.  That is good for those who work in the company who, in general, have managed to rise to major challenges.</P>
    <P>I will be pleased to consider amendments on Committee Stage and I have arranged to meet the main union representative.  I presume there will be a lapse of time between Second and Committee Stages during which I hope to meet members of the board to consider any lacunas that may arise and rectify them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill is essentially the same as that introduced by Deputy Dukes when he was Minister. Deputy Stagg had a strong input into that legislation and I was pleased to be able to incorporate an essential change made by Deputy De Rossa which was recorded on the files in the Department.  Major challenges face the company in the future, but I am sure they will be successfully surmounted.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 5 contain standard provisions in legislation, for example, short title and collective citation.  Sections 6 to 11 provide for the formation of the new company, Bord na Móna public limited company, and for the assignment to this company of the functions of the existing Bord na Móna statutory corporation.  Sections 12 to 17 provide for issuing shares in the company and for further issuing shares to the Minister for Finance. Provision is also made for issuing a share to me and to each of the subscribers to the memorandum and articles of association who shall hold the shares in trust for the Minister for Finance. <Col N="97" /> Sections 18 to 20 provide for the appointment by me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, of the chairperson and directors of the board of the new company.  Section 21 is an enabling provision for the further injection of equity, not exceeding £10 million, into the new company to be used by it for the sole purpose of repaying debt.  Sections 22 and 23 include a number of standard general powers, including confirmation of the powers of borrowing.  Sections 24 to 25 are standard provisions relating to the keeping of proper accounts and the appointment of auditors.</P>
    <P>Section 26 deals with the managing director. The existing 1946 legislation provides for the appointment of the managing director by the Government, but it is now common practice for boards to appoint managing directors.  Section 26 provides that the existing managing director will become the managing director of the new company for the residue of his term of appointment. Thereafter, each subsequent managing director may be appointed and removed by the directors of the new company.  I hope that will not happen. Sections 27 to 33 are in the main standard provisions relating to remuneration of staff, disclosure of interests by directors, prohibition of unauthorised disclosure of information and provisions governing directors or staff who become Members of either House of the Oireachtas or the EU Parliament.  Sections 28 and 29 update the existing superannuation powers of the board to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for modern pension schemes.</P>
    <P>Sections 34 to 40 provide for the establishment of Bord na Móna's business activities as separate limited liability subsidiaries under the companies Acts.  This fulfils the promise to the EU made by the then Minister, Deputy Dukes.  The four business activities are the peat energy division, the horticulture division, the solid fuels division and the environmental products division.</P>
    <P>Overall, therefore, the board has one division supplying milled peat under contract to the ESB for electricity generation purposes.  The remaining three business activities are &ldquo;open-market&rdquo; activities.  Each of these individual businesses will be established as a separate subsidiary company and effectively will have to operate as independent entities, without any cross-subsidisation. That has come about because of the proposed action under &ldquo;State aids&rdquo;.  Section 41 deals with share capital.</P>
    <P>In line with our programme for Government, these provisions represent a pragmatic, rather than an ideological, approach which recognises the highly competitive environment in which much of Bord na Móna's activities take place. The board is anxious to have the necessary flexibilities to respond to the commercial realities of the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 to 44 provide for the appointment and terms and conditions of the chairpersons and the directors.  The boards of the subsidiary companies will be primarily concerned with the day-to-day operation of the businesses and implementation <Col N="98" /> of group policy.  Sections 45 to 55 deal with standard provisions.  Section 56 provides that, in carrying out its activities, the new company must afford appropriate protection to the environment and archaeological heritage.  Section 57 provides for the dissolution of Bord na Móna's statutory corporation on the vesting day of the new company.  Sections 58 to 62 also deal with standard provisions.</P>
    <P>The new corporate and legal structure proposed is fully in line with the philosophy advanced in the Culliton and Moriarty reports, which recommended incorporation under the companies Acts as the general model for commercial State enterprises.  Bord na Móna is one of our older State bodies.  It has evolved from being a producer of peat for electricity generation and of sod peat for home heating to a company which has developed successful applications for peat in the area of horticulture and environmental control.  In 1995 the company successfully acquired the assets of Coal Distributors Limited.  It remains a significant player in the domestic heating market.  The future viability of Bord na Móna's constituent businesses require that they have the same commercial flexibilities as their competitors and the same ability to exploit any commercial opportunities that may arise.</P>
    <P>The Bill will complement and complete the major changes which have taken place within Bord na Móna in the past ten years and lay the legal basis for its further development in the next millennium.</P>
    <P>I extend to the company my warmest wishes on its developments to date and wish it every success in the future.</P>

      <P>My party supports the legislation.  In Government we prepared the heads of the Bill and in 1995 we agreed to the investment of the equity to which the Minister alluded.  This is not a contentious Bill in that sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Many members of my party will speak from a constituency perspective.  This gives me more latitude to cast a colder and harsher eye on the enterprise than those who need the votes of people who live in the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I carry no baggage on the issue.  I have not had many dealings with Bord na Móna although I have had a number of meetings with its management in Newbridge and found them extremely open and courteous.  The more I delve into this area of public enterprise, the more I realise one must approach it with some concept of the role of the State and shareholders in such matters.  Is it the same as an ordinary shareholder, pension fund holder or equity investor?  What are the normal elements one expects?  It is not unreasonable to have a commercial focus for the sake of the company's success so that it might grow abroad, <Col N="99" /> return a dividend and be efficient and competitive. This is not an ideological position &mdash; the company should succeed whether in State ownership, as a joint venture or in private hands.  It is with this analysis that I view this legislation.</P>
    <P>The last decade has been a horror story for Bord na Móna.  If one looks at the balance sheets and the cumulative figures, one sees that the debts peaked at £187 million in 1991.  In 1989 the company lost £91 million, which is extraordinary by any standards on a turnover of £119 million.  I appreciate that written into that is an accumulation of difficulties.  I do not wish to attach blame to any particular Government, Department, board or management.  I have no agenda in that regard.  I am simply examining the figures as presented.  When I examined what we got for the £90 million lost I found that we developed bogs and other facilities at Ballyforan, for example, yet there are no plans to cut the turf.  There have been serious errors of judgment.  Some 3,500 jobs have been lost.  One might have argued that the expenditure was justified if it had sustained employment but, as the Minister pointed out, there has been a transformation in the employment in Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>In terms of examining the cause 1986 is a pivotal point in time when the price of oil collapsed. It changed fundamentally the economics of milled peat as an energy source.  It is instructive to examine the figures for the comparison between heavy fuel oil and milled peat before and after the oil crisis.  In the period 1974-85 in terms of the differential between milled peat and heavy fuel oil paid by the ESB, it gained £295 million.  Since the oil crisis the figures are staggering.  If the ESB had decided that it wished to use heavy oil only &mdash; never mind coal, although the ESB has told me that it has twice the efficiency at Moneypoint &mdash; it would have saved £221 million.  That works out at an average cost penalty of about £21 million a year on the ESB and on every domestic and industrial electricity user.  It is easy to be wise after the event.  The cost the ESB has paid for milled peat to date is a source of grievance for it because the price is uncompetitive.  Moreover, the thermal conversion rate of milled peat is about half that of the coal fired station at Moneypoint.</P>
    <P>An assumption of continuing high oil prices led to large investment in bog development and briquette manufacturing facilities.  Some of these have proved worthless as developed bogs are either unused or subsequent investments have had to be abandoned.  Over the period successive Governments did not inject equity but allowed Government guaranteed borrowings to stack up, resulting in the huge historic interest burden of which the Minister spoke.</P>
    <P>If it was not bad enough that the economics of using milled peat changed, a number of other factors, unrelated to the operations of Bord na Móna, have come into play.  It is now acknowledged to be the most smoky of fuels, with the highest level of CO2 emissions.  Ireland has signed <Col N="100" /> up to a reduction in the levels of CO2 emissions overall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that while coal has more sulphur emissions, CO2 emissions are higher from peat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Try heavy fuel oil then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of fact, not opinion.</P>
      <P>Households are using less solid fuel.  More people have switched to oil or gas because they are clean and convenient fuels.  Outside the control of Bord na Móna these environmental and household factors and the change in oil prices have taken effect.</P>
      <P>It is right that equity should be invested in the company and the legislation should be seen as a cornerstone for a proper commercial plc structure for Bord na Móna and its four subsidiaries.  It must be seen as a one-off; we cannot repeat this level of equity injection because the taxpayers could not justify or afford it.  We must examine a new commercial focus for the company's future operations, with which I am sure the staff of Bord na Móna would agree.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined four divisions of the company.  The biggest of these is the peat energy division.  I met a delegation from IBEC recently and it complained bitterly about electricity costs and a proposed 2 per cent increase in prices for industrial users.  It pointed out the lack of competitiveness between electricity prices here and in other countries in Europe.  The most pivotal aspect of the peat energy division is Europeat in the east midlands.  This 120 megawatt facility which is to use one million tonnes of milled peat is fundamental to the future of the peat energy division.  It meets not only the strategic objectives of fuel diversity and power generation but uses an indigenous energy resource.  In 1991 between gas and peat the ESB found 44 per cent of its energy resources from Irish materials.  Accounting for the outlay of capacity in the years to come that figure is to decline to 11 per cent by 2001. Europeat will have the latest technology in terms of thermal combustion and energy generating efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on the Europeat station but I have heard somewhat different information from that which she outlined.  I understand the Commission approved in principle the injection of £21 million into the investment of £120 million.  My concern is that the Commission has reservations at a technical level about Europeat.  It has reservations about CO2 emissions and because of the historic subsidies to the coal industry in Europe in the major five coal producing states and the former East Germany. It is concerned that the door might be opened to <Col N="101" /> national and EU subsidies which it has thoroughly resisted.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it will be early next year before the process for the five competitive tenders to construct Europeat will be completed. With an environmental impact study, the EPA analysis for licence purposes, the planning process and the prospect of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála which we cannot discount&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>And about which we can do nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;we could run into a situation where, despite the best efforts of the successful tenderer or Bord na Móna, the timeframe could be beyond that envisaged by the Minister.  It will take two and a half years to construct and there is a prospect that it will run into 2002 should something go wrong.  It is essential the Government maintains pressure on a doubting Commission to ensure this is seen as having political priority and ensure funding because the fuel comparison of oil, coal and peat, as well as hundreds of jobs, depend on the thermal efficiencies of Europeat.</P>
      <P>Many householders no longer use coal, turf or other forms of solid fuel as their main heating source.  The lower cost and greater convenience of oil and greater availability of natural gas to homes has proved attractive to many.  Bord na Móna has increased its share of a declining market through the acquisition of CDL, the principal coal distributor in Dublin and the east coast. Increasingly, solid fuels are used only in the living room given their ornamental attractions of warmth.  There is likely to be further consolidation in this sector and Bord na Móna, through its fuel subsidiary, should be open to cross shareholding to establish not only a strong market share in terms of other fuels, such as coal, but also because this is a prime market.  Unless one is a big player, one will have difficulties because of its overall dynamics.  Efficiencies and savings will come with the larger sales and distribution systems that can afford heavy marketing, a fleet of trucks, etc.  Growth will not come generically and a very specific plan is necessary for the fuels division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am most concerned about the horticultural division.  This was first brought to my attention by an economist who expressed concern that the losses sustained by this division were high over recent years.  A clear and transparent breakdown of the division in the accounts of Bord na Móna which allows one to analyse what went wrong.  It primarily sells peat moss under the Shamrock label and 94 per cent of its sales are exports &mdash; 95 per cent to the UK and 5 per cent to continental Europe.  Bord na Móna also got involved in a French company which proved less than successful, but it is focused mainly on the UK market. Two developments have been very unhelpful. First, the market is oversupplied by Russian, Finnish, Irish and other operators who are chasing <Col N="102" /> a narrowing band of consolidated distributors. Bord na Móna has done a deal with BNH and we are dealing with a price war and wafer thin margins, if not losses.  Second, Prince Charles stated that the use of peat moss was not environmentally supportable or friendly and that people should use bark mulch instead.  There is a decline in the use of peat moss by gardeners in the UK.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that peat moss is essential because it covers the top half of bogland beneath which is the fuel source for briquettes and peat energy.  The Irish taxpayer is not in the business of giving cheap peat moss to the householders of Britain.  Of course, one can justify indigenous resources for our fuel energy sources and a regional policy that supports the midlands but giving subsidised peat moss to gardeners in England is difficult to support.  A hard headed assessment on the future viability of this division needs to be undertaken.  Sometimes those most closely involved are not the best to make the assessment because they made the original investment decisions.  I wish to see a commercial analysis of the horticultural division so that increasing difficulties in this area are not sustained.</P>
      <P>The most exciting area in Bord na Móna is its environmental division.  I had a similar experience to the Minister on visiting Newbridge as I found it to be dynamic.  We saw the development of new products and the soakage capacity of peat used in terms of septic tanks and other facilities.  This is extremely exciting in terms of research and development but, as any industrialist will acknowledge, this area is characterised by high capital intensity and risk.  One could spend a fortune developing a product and the straitjacket that often exists between obtaining approval from line Departments and the Department of Finance is not necessarily the best structure.  The environmental division needs an equity partner to grow at the extent of the potential of the company.  It may have successful or unsuccessful products but it can fly high on the wind of opportunity.  The recycling project is a joint venture with Irish Rail. In Dublin there are major objections and obstacles to the building of a new incinerator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not.  When will the Minister receive EU approval?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were to go to Kill, there would be many objections.  The local authorities in Dublin charged with refuse and recycling have a number of options and, in the event of a national incinerator not going ahead, I would support the proposal by the environmental division of Bord na Móna.  In terms of the successful growth and development of the company, I wish to see an employee shareholding option, which other semi-State <Col N="103" /> companies have, to build on the successful transformation of work practices so that the company can achieve its full potential.  I am disappointed there are no proposals for an ESOP, particularly in the subsidiaries where there is exciting potential.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the 80 per cent improvement in productivity by the workforce at Bord na Móna.  Payroll costs have been halved, which is a tremendous achievement, and I pay tribute to the commitment and partnership ethos between management and the staff working at the bog face for the enormous structural changes. If they had not taken place, the company would have had no future in terms of supplying a competitive product to the ESB.  Up to l985 the price of milled peat was governed by regulation.  Since l988 the price has remained unchanged and there has been an interim arrangement between the ESB and Bord na Móna.  What the price of milled peat will be needs to be transparently established. Will it be based on a basket of prices between oil, alternative wind energy or other fuels such as gas, coal or other fuels for the ESB?  That would be one basis on which a fair price could be set, another would be on a cost recovery basis.  It should not be for politicians to set the price but the ESB should not be lumbered with a high price.  There should be competitive pressures on Bord na Móna to reduce its cost structure on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>If the Celtic Tiger is to continue to roar the Government has a duty to provide low cost telecommunications, energy and electricity.  We have a peripherality problem which we have to live with <i>vis-a-vis</i> transport costs.  It is an overall competitiveness mandate on every Government and we will have legislation in relation to the EU directive on electricity generation.  There are many different points of view as to how that should be done.  Heavy industrial users have an EU right to get 28 per cent of their energy requirements from suppliers other than the ESB by a certain year.  It is grossly unfair to ask the ESB to produce electricity at a price if they are expected to pay a political price.  When I met the ESB officials they said peat is the most political fuel.  We must ensure the ESB is not lumbered with an unfair price which in turn has to be recouped from the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The future of Bord na Móna depends on oil prices because once the natural gas field in Kin- sale comes to an end&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;there is likely to be a second gas interconnector to the UK.  Given the way it has developed in terms of the EU directive on gas, through those two pipes one will be able to buy Norwegian, Russian or Algerian gas.  There is a huge grid and there is not the security of supply argument to suggest there is a problem.  When I met the INPC in the refinery at Whitegate I <Col N="104" /> learned that all the big companies in the oil business &mdash; Statoil, Gulf Stream etc &mdash; are closing down refineries.  They say there is no problem with oil supplies for the future and that oil will be extremely competitive.  It is easy to say that in l996 the price of oil collapsed, everything that was decided at Ballyforan went out the window and wrong decisions were made.  One cannot assume high oil prices.  We must have a realistic assessment of where oil prices are going.</P>

      <P>On the positive side, the peat reserves are unlimited.  I understand we have 130 million tonnes and existing foreseeable capacity will use only 70 million tonnes.  For the Europeat power station, the particular bog in the east midlands has 34 million tonnes.  There is no problem with the resources although the environmental argument may change.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael supports this Bill and the tremendous turnaround achieved by the staff and management of Bord na Móna.  Let us go into this with our eyes open as regards the future threats. The threats to Bord na Móna are that the timescale for Europeat will jeopardise the EU funding; the existing ESB plants are grossly inefficient at bound milled peat; the ESB can produce conclusive arguments that it is its most expensive fuel; the market for peat moss as a product is not growing and in the UK is meeting serious problems; there is a growing environmental lobby which is negative to peat in terms of the bog and I foresee EIAs being needed for bog development in the future, leaving aside the CO2 question; the use of solid fuel in households is declining and the ESB has to be more cost competitive.</P>
      <P>Those who will prepare the next Turf Development Bill would want us to have looked at some of the things that were not assessed.  When replying will the Minister say if there was any external consultant in the Department of Finance who signed off Ballyforan or was it a political project?  In fairness to Bord na Móna, did politicians insist on these things?  The whirlwind of the £110 million is due to some of those mistaken investment decisions and nobody has been brought to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the management, staff and all involved in the midlands peat development every success. We will support the Bill on Committee Stage.  I see Europeat as critical.  I hope the issues relating to pensions and superannuation can be dealt with satisfactorily while moving to a new commercial structure and legal framework.  I am not suggesting that is a particular problem. <Col N="105" /> The managing director should be a member of the board, as provided for by law.  It is not possible to manage the complexities of a company unless one is a member of the board where the decision are taken.  Any part-time director, no matter how committed, will not have the knowledge which the executive team will have.  Fine Gael supports the Bill and hopes the circumstances which led to the serious investments which were necessary will not arise again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment briefly on the position of the ESB on peat.  Traditionally the ESB has resisted Government policy in the matter of using peat as a fuel and this has bedevilled the power stations it owns.  It has consistently refused to keep them in working order except in one case, Bellacorick in County Mayo, where it needs the power station.  It does not need the others for its grid.  They are now in a state where they produce the most expensive form of electricity.  That was a deliberate action by the ESB. I say that advisedly, having examined the matter during my term in the Department.</P>
      <P>Sulphur, as a greenhouse gas, has ten times the effect of CO2.  Given that we produce larger amounts of CO2 from motor cars it is the main concern but sulphur is ten times worse from the greenhouse gas point of view.  If Moneypoint were to have the standards required by the European Union for power stations the electricity from it would not be as cheap.  A case should be made for a retro fitting at Moneypoint to prevent it polluting the atmosphere, particularly for our neighbours in Europe who get the brunt of acid rain arising from the operation at Moneypoint.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the management, workers and unions in Bord na Móna.  The midlands, County Kildare in particular, have been transformed by its actions and activities.  Small areas of the west have also had positive experiences.  I remember fondly the times I spent cutting turf on the bog. At the age where I spread rather than cut turf I recall an occasion when my father was ill and we had to hire a man to cut the turf.  He worked 12 hours a day for which he was paid £1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In the mid-1980s Bord na Móna was in serious trouble with debts of £170 million-£180 million and rising.  In 1987 Dr. Eddie O'Connor was appointed chief executive.  Mr. Brendan Halligan was appointed chairperson of the board around the same time.  With the unions, they tackled long outstanding issues.  Cost efficiencies were agreed to reduce operating costs.  This involved severe pain with a reduction in staff numbers from 4,687 to 2,270.  Autonomous enterprise units were established and a direct labour system put in place.  Partnership in the workplace was the reality.  Management and unions were determined that Bord na Móna would not only survive but develop, expand and thrive.  The previous Government decided to make State equity of £120 million available.  I was glad and honoured to be involved in pressing it to make that decision.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to some of the people who have been involved.  The SIPTU representative, Mr. Kevin McMahon &mdash; it is unusual to name a trade union official in the House &mdash; was a critical person in the development of Bord na Móna.  He maximised the number of employees that could be fruitfully retained by the company and the benefits and conditions of the remaining employees.  He developed and sold to his members the concept of partnership.</P>
      <P>I pay special tribute to Dr. O'Connor.  Under his stewardship between 1987 and 1996 the company was literally turned around.  He was handed an ailing monster and turned it into a profitable going concern.  He had new ideas and found new markets for the company's products.  Sales increased from £98 million to £141 million per annum; productivity from 1,750 tonnes to 5,100 tonnes of turf per person and profits from £4.5 million to £24.2 million.  If he had been a chief executive in a private company Dr. O'Connor would have received large bonuses if he had achieved anything like the results achieved in Bord na Móna.  He was instead hounded from office by mean-spirited people incapable of appreciating his work.  I regret that I did not have the power to prevent his good name being dragged through the mud.  Bord na Móna did not come within my remit.  By a series of leaks and innuendo he was effectively undermined.  What was it all about?  The answer is a bottle of smoke, a few bottles of wine and a suit of clothes.  Dr. O'Connor cannot be airbrushed out of the history of Bord na Móna.  Without him it would have collapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent newspaper article sought to give the impression that I, as a Labour Party Minister of State, and Labour Party advisers were somehow responsible for the attacks on Dr. O'Connor because of his opinions on the ownership of the company.  This is not true.  The leader of my party, Deputy Quinn, then Minister for Finance, and his <Col N="107" /> advisers brokered an honourable and acceptable severance package for Dr. O'Connor who I understand is now engaged in a variety of enterprises in the private sector.  I wish him the best of good fortune and I am sure the private sector's gain is the public sector's loss.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the new chief executive, Mr. Paddy Hughes, who has brought a new style and energy to the position.  It could be said without any inference that Bord na Móna is in a safe pair of hands.</P>
    <P>What is the real purpose of this Bill?  Why is it necessary and what will it do?  It is instructive that it was not brought forward during the term of office of the last Government.  The Minister may wish to give credit to various Members in Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>The company has been brought back from the brink of ruination and is now thriving with increased productivity and sales.  It has excellent industrial relations and a positive partnership agreement between management and unions.  It has a new outlet for its core product in the Europeat power station.  It has new well developed products in its horticultural and environmental divisions and the potential to further develop its wind energy division and the artistic and innovative Celtic Roots.</P>
      <P>All this is controlled and managed by a central board and four divisions which are well managed. It is now proposed to break up the company into a holding company and four separate subsidiary companies each with its own board.  This will result in duplication.  Since it is agreed by everybody that the existing board is doing a good job, why is it necessary to have five boards?  The Minister referred to the European Union and the need for transparency between the divisions but there is no need to have five boards to ensure this.</P>

      <P>The heads of a Bill had been agreed but that is a long way from introducing it in the House.  The reason it was not introduced was there was no agreement, as the Minister will discover if she looks at the correspondence.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill the Minister will have the power to sell off 49 per cent of the holding company and all of any one of the subsidiaries provided its value does not exceed 50 per cent of the total. Why does the Minister need this power to sell off half of the company without further reference to the House?  Is there a bidder or buyer waiting outside the door?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Should the need arise the Minister should seek the authority of the House and explain why it is necessary to sell off half the company. <Col N="108" />  We can take it as read that the horticultural division in which 312 people are employed and the environmental division in which 70 people are employed are for the high jump.  This Bill is a blueprint for the sale of all but the core activity of the company, the production of peat.  It is a regrettable return to the sterile philosophy of &ldquo;stick to your knitting&rdquo; first put forward by the former Minister for Transport and Communications, Deputy Lowry.  Though he has departed that office I am aware of strong supporters of that philosophy in very high places in the Minister's Department determined that Bord na Móna cut turf and do nothing else.  The proposers of this hopeless position seem to ignore the fact that the planned commercial life of bogs is some 20 years. If we accept their planned obsolescence, what will happen the midlands when the turf runs out?  What will happen the villages, communities and commerce depending on the company's activities?  We must reject the knitters with a limited supply of wool and put in place structures to allow the company diversify and develop rather than force it to sit around until the turf runs out.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna should be encouraged to develop as a premier alternative energy company exploiting in full the development of wind energy as well as the varied commercial uses of its primary product.  That might mean that some of its core activities, while desirable, will be diverted to other usage by the company, to ensure that all of its potential is not usurped by continually cutting turf.</P>
      <P>In its present form this Bill will prevent such development.  The Minister's was a very positive contribution with regard to Bord na Móna but she needs to examine this Bill more closely and the effect of its implementation.  Why else does she seek power to sell half the company and any or all of its subsidiaries?  The agenda is clear: sell off what you can and plan obsolescence for the rest.  On the basis of the case I have made, knowing the Minister's positive attitude to Bord na Móna and the commercial public sector generally, I ask that she withdraw this Bill and introduce one of her own reflecting the views she expressed today.</P>
      <P>There are other areas of concern in this Bill also, such as that of worker directors.  The four main activities of the company are to be divided among four subsidiaries.  The numbers of their board members are not yet known although there is provision for only one worker director on each. At least the same level of representation of worker directors should be provided for within these new companies as obtains in the primary company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1996 the Government decided to give £120 million equity to Bord na Móna, of which £100 million has been paid.  The balance of £20 million requires legislation to allow payment. Why has this Government decided to pay £10 million only of the balance of £20 million due? <Col N="109" /> Why is it not all being paid, or have I missed £10 million somewhere?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the current legislation did not permit payment of more than the £100 million which has now been cleared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>But £120 million was the amount the Government decided to pay in 1995 whereas the provisions of this Bill allow for the payment of an additional £10 million only, which would appear to leave a shortfall of £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point which was raised with me by a number of people.</P>
      <P>The Bill is essentially flawed in a number of areas.  It is a blueprint for a sterile, hopeless philosophy of &ldquo;stick to your knitting&rdquo;, a very dangerous philosophy for this company which will simply be left digging turf in the short-term.  When the turf runs out, there will be no further planned commercial activity for the company or its workers.  The Bill fails to address how the company will develop and diversify and the necessary structures to be put in place.  While facilitating sell-off, it does not address the essential question of worker shareholdings.  The issue of worker directors in subsidiaries is subject to the vagaries and tender mercies of management.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider with-drawing this essentially flawed Bill which will not result in achieving her intentions, as expressed today.  Since there is no enormous rush, I ask her to re-examine it.  If she cannot see her way to withdrawing it, its provisions will warrant major amendment to prevent the hiving off of certain of its activities which could become the core of certain activities when the turf runs out in the foreseeable future.  In the event of the Minister being unable to withdraw it, I shall table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House I wish to share my time with Deputy Seán Fleming.  I welcome the Minister's introduction and presentation of this Bill.  Though not from the midlands or a midlands constituency, I am deeply interested in all business activities in the semi-State sector.  We are all committed to their being placed on a commercial footing to ensure they are profitable, stand-alone operations rather than continuing to absorb taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I perceive the change in status of Bord na Móna from that of a semi-State company as a very positive, innovative one.  For too long its development has been hampered by the restrictions of the Turf Development Act, 1946 enacted on the establishment of the company that year. The proposed change in its status from semi-State <Col N="110" /> to PLC is a positive move because its development has also been hampered by lack of investment.  Its conversion to a PLC will mean the company will be in a position to attract investment partners.  Such investment and partnership arrangements will facilitate research and the development of its business activities, as will diversification into new areas, also vital to its expansion and survival.  The implementation of this Bill will result in the constitution of the company as a PLC and of its four subsidiaries as public limited companies.</P>
    <P>On a personal note this change is a far cry from my childhood memory of walking down Cork Centre Park Road toward the marina, seeing the vast stock piles of turf of local fuel merchants. Those massive manmade mountains were a relic of the war years.  I remember then wondering how anybody could ever burn that amount of turf.  It also brings to mind the thriving turf business run by many Cork companies, one of whom was Pope Brothers whose lorries were driven regularly to the midlands to keep our fires burning and Corkonians warm in their homes.  Unlike Deputy Stagg, I have no experience of cutting turf even though, believe it or not, there is a turf bog in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is still a pub there.  In the not too distant past I remember the pride I felt when some European peat developers came here to study and learn peat harvesting technology from Bord na Móna which was then and remains the foremost in Europe.</P>
      <P>When established in 1946, with a largely developmental mandate, it was appropriate for Bord na Móna to have the structure of a statutory corporation.  In the intervening years the company has successfully carried out its mandate from successive Governments under a series of turf development Acts.  It is now being converted to a PLC with a full commercial structure.  This conversion will have the general effect of causing the company to adopt and operate the financial management and legal structures in general use in all commercial entities.  The main effect of the change will be that Bord na Móna will become a holding company.  All its operations and business will be carried out by one or other of the new subsidiary companies.</P>
      <P>The 1990 Turf Development Act gave Bord na Móna the power to form subsidiary companies but did not allow Bord na Móna to delegate any of its statutory functions to such subsidiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> More particularly, it did not provide the mechanism for the transfer of assets and liabilities to subsidiaries.  As a result of this Bill, it will be possible to constitute the operating divisions of Bord na Móna as stand alone companies.  Their performance can be monitored and evaluated, they can be promoted as separate entities and will have to be profitable to survive in the commercial world.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Bill and the equity the Government has invested, Bord na Móna will for the first time have a share capital that will make possible the measurement of its performance and the assessment of its appropriate borrowing level as a ratio of its capital.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issuing of shares, the Government must always hold the majority.  We do not want to see any outside shareholder taking a dominant position in the company.  Until some months ago, all of Bord na Móna's long-term borrowings were under Government guarantee. Other speakers have charted the past business problems of the company.  I agree that by providing the company structure and the necessary asset base, the Bill will make it possible for the holding company and its subsidiaries to borrow on a commercial basis and without Government guarantee, thereby putting responsibility on the company to ensure it is profitable and viable.  A limited liability structure will also give Bord na Móna the freedom to form strategic alliances and enter into joint ventures subject to the provision of the Bill.  Partnership arrangements will help by supplying funding, technology and access to wider markets.  Divisions such as horticulture, environmental products and Celtic Roots would benefit greatly from such arrangements.  It will also make possible the introduction of an employee share participation scheme should such a scheme be agreed by the company, the Government and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>The first substantive part of the Bill deals with the establishment of Bord na Móna as a PLC.  It provides that the authorised share capital shall be set at £300 million.  The objects to be included in the memorandum and articles are to be the functions set out in the various turf development Acts.  It will make allowance for additional objects and powers incidental or ancillary to Bord na Móna's functions.</P>
    <P>I note from the Bill that one share will be vested in the Minister for Public Enterprise.  I do not believe that will affect the Minister in any way in relation to remarks she made earlier.  The remainder will be vested in the Minister for Finance other than those held in trust by the members.  The Minister for Finance may not reduce his shareholding to less than 50 per cent without a resolution of Dáil Éireann.  That should satisfy Deputy Stagg who was concerned that the company would be sold off piecemeal.</P>
    <P>The chairman, managing director and other board members will retain their positions after the changeover to PLC for the balance of their current terms of office.  As the Minister has <Col N="112" /> already explained, the Government is empowered to pay a final tranche of equity up to £10 million.  An upper limit is set on the borrowing powers of the PLC and its subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>The pension entitlements of employees will be retained and protected, and changes in regulations will be made to bring them into line with the Pensions Act, which is welcome.  Penalties will be imposed on board members taking part in decisions on which there is an undisclosed conflict of interest and for disclosing confidential information.  I welcome that proposal.</P>
    <P>The second substantive section allows for the formation of Bord na Móna's divisions into subsidiary companies.  It provides that these subsidiaries can include in their objects functions of Bord na Móna under the turf development Acts. The Bill provides for a vesting day when Bord na Móna will cease to exist and Bord na Móna PLC will come into existence.  It will also allow land owned by Bord na Móna to be licensed through a subsidiary.  It will ensure that Bord na Móna may not sell more than 50 per cent of the value of the whole of its subsidiaries without a resolution of Dáil Éireann.  The Bill also provides for a transfer day when business, assets and liabilities will be transferred to each subsidiary.</P>
    <P>The third substantive section protects the terms and conditions of employment of employees who have played a positive role in the success of Bord na Móna.  I acknowledge also the pivotal role played by the staff of Bord na Móna in today's events and in the advances achieved by the company since its foundation.  Thanks to them, output has doubled through changes in work practices, training, new machinery and the introduction of team-based production systems.  The workforce has already been hit by substantial job losses but it has shown a willingness and capability to accept change.  The unions have played a positive role also in this transformation and they are to be commended for their contribution.  I anticipate that the change to PLC status will not affect the staff through further job losses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg expressed concern about turf resources but I understand from listening to other speakers this evening and from my own research that there is approximately 40 years of production available in the bogs in which Bord na Móna is currently operating.  That is a fairly long period in which to have so many resources available.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Mr. Pat Dineen, the chairman of Bord na Móna, who joined the company a short time ago&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>&mdash;and who was nominated to that office at a difficult time.  I know unethical practices were conducted in that company at the highest level but I disagree with the comments made by Deputy Stagg.  Mr. Dineen faced all of the issues with his noted business acumen and has brought the company to the level of achievement it has attained today.  He has prepared it for the <Col N="113" /> changeover in his own calm and efficient manner and I have no doubt he will ensure the company goes from strength to strength in the years ahead. He deserves our thanks, as do the board members and the staff for their contribution to the company.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the imagination and foresight she has shown in introducing the Bill.  She has my full support in ensuring it is passed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Bill.  As a Deputy from the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly I am delighted to see the Bill being introduced by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke.  Bord na Móna is and has always been a major employer in the midland region and we are very aware of its positive effects on the economy in both Offaly and Laois over many decades. Coolnamona and its Bord na Móna subsidiaries in Portlaoise is one of the major employers in the Portlaoise region.</P>
      <P>The timing of this Bill is particularly interesting because a short time ago I spoke on local radio about the difficulties caused by population decline in Ferbane.  Local councillors are very concerned about the lack of investment and the future of Bord na Móna.  People in the area were pleased to be informed that the Bill was being introduced in the House today.</P>
      <P>An £11 million refurbishment programme for Ferbane power station was recently put in place which will secure the life of the station for the next 15 years.  That announcement is welcome in a region such as Ferbane where Bord na Móna is a key employer.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 2,000 employees in Bord na Móna and their concerns must be taken on board in any new change of status of the company.  We must be concerned also about the customers and the operation of the business.  In addition, the diversity of the Bord na Móna activities must be recognised also.  It is not simply concerned with turf.  Many of the company's subsidiaries deal with the horticulture and peat moss, areas which have seen enormous development in recent years.</P>
      <P>On a more minor point, most people burn either briquettes or turf in their homes.  I suggest the new management should be more customer friendly in terms of the products they sell because both men and women find the plastic used to tie bales of briquettes difficult to handle.  They should be sold in easy to use plastic bags or something similar.</P>

    <P>In her contribution the Minister highlighted a number of aspects in relation to the financial position of Bord na Móna.  I refer to the most recent set of accounts published which cover the period up to March this year.  Approximately one year ago Bord na Móna had a negative net worth of £63 million.  After a £49 million capital injection by the Government, with EU consent, last December and the profit generated during the course of the last financial year the negative net <Col N="114" /> worth of the company is now approximately £7 million.  The summary of the financial statistics of Bord na Móna is a credit to its management team and board of directors.  They have generated increased revenue over a considerable number of years and have generated profits in the region of £20 million.  However, they have been crippled with substantial interest payments which last year alone amounted to £15 million.  Nevertheless, after allowing for all operating expenses, depreciation and interest payments the company has a net profit of more than £7 million.  I am sure if Bord na Móna's level of activity is maintained in the course of this year it will have for the first time in my recollection a positive net worth.  I look forward to its achieving that.  There is also a Government commitment to contribute an additional £10 million towards the company's debt repayment.  That will put the company for the first time ever in a position of positive net worth.  That is a source of celebration for the Minister, the board of directors and the employees.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna has had an important history. Its role was to provide a strategic energy source. One of the key planks of our policy is to have an indigenous source of energy and to produce it economically.  That is what we have in Bord na Móna.  Natural gas off the south coast is another indigenous energy source, but it has a short lifespan and when it is exhausted we will be fully reliant on Bord na Móna as our only indigenous energy source.</P>
    <P>There are four key aspects to the restructuring of Bord na Móna which we should consider.  First, the company has been successfully restructured from a financial point of view.  That was done with a good deal of pain but a minimum of fuss. There was major rationalisation, but it was achieved with increased productivity by employees and without any major industrial dispute.  Second, an investment of £100 million, which is now almost complete, was made in the company.  Third, the Europeat 1 power station will be located in the midlands and that will further underpin the role of Bord na Móna in the midland region for many years to come.  Fourth, there is the legislation before us.</P>
    <P>I mentioned some of the key aspects in relation to the company's employees.  This Bill does not involve any diminution in employees' rights. Their rights are being fully maintained and I am pleased there will continue to be worker participation at board level in the new arrangement.  I was particularly disappointed to hear what could be described as nothing short of scaremongering tactics used by some speakers.  It is not a correct interpretation of the Bill to send out alarm signals that will do nothing but upset people who have no reason to be upset.  It is not possible for Bord na Móna to be sold off without the consent of this House.  That guarantee has been given and I am sure all Members are pleased about that.  It is important that any commercial company, such as Bord na Móna, has the flexibility to enter into <Col N="115" /> strategic alliances where it sees fit.  The company will have some flexibility in that regard without the need to refer back to the House.</P>
    <P>I am sure the appointment of a managing director which is covered under section 26 is one of a number of points that will be raised in the course of this debate.  The most important position in any company is that of managing director.  Bord na Móna has had some excellent managing directors over the years who oversaw restructuring and brought the company back to profitability.  The choice of managing director not only now but in the future will be one of the key decisions any board of directors will have to make.  I am pleased the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Enterprise will be shareholders in the new company.  A number of sections deal with routine measures such as the appointment of auditors, the role of subsidiaries and the transfer of staff rights, assets and liabilities to the new company and to the various new subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>The new company is being charged to carry out its work and activities in an environmentally friendly way and to make appropriate provision to protect our archaeological heritage.  That is very important.  Under many boglands there are important archaeological artefacts that have not come to light and that is something on which we should concentrate.</P>
    <P>When Bord na Móna has completed work in an area it should develop a strategy to deal with cut away bogs.  There are not too many tourist attractions in the midlands and cut away bogs may have some tourism potential.  There is a great wealth of wildlife, flora and fauna in those areas and we must ensure they are protected for future generations.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Fleming that it is a sign of tremendous achievement and hope for the future that Bord na Móna is in sight of being in a position of positive net worth.  Against the background of the figures adduced by Deputy Yates that is a phenomenal achievement.  Deputy Yates made a fair point about why we should have realised such an accumulated deficit over a decade.  The company has been turned around. Deputy Fleming is right in acknowledging the contribution of those who are responsible for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure Deputy Fleming is as entitled to dismiss the views of Deputy Stagg in terms of his remarks on the configuration of the company as presented in the Bill.  I hope Deputy Fleming is right and Deputy Stagg is wrong.  Not too many years ago the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, presented the same arguments in this House about the Irish Sugar Company that now roll so easily off the tongue of Deputy Fleming and no doubt will roll of the tongues of other Government backbenchers before this debate is finished.  The record will show what Deputy O'Kennedy said at that time. We know what happened subsequently.  It is not <Col N="116" /> relevant to this debate as to whether what happened was good or bad.  I do not want to reopen that debate.  I do not dismiss Deputy Stagg's point of view on this quite so lightly.  I have no difficulty with Bord na Móna being converted to a PLC. That is probably overdue, but I would be concerned if the official attitude is that Bord na Móna should be restricted to what is described as its core activity.</P>
    <P>I should comment on the Civil Service in this regard.  I come from the school of thought that has a high regard for the Irish Civil Service.  The brief time I spent in closer proximity to them than I normally spend enhanced my regard for them. I do not want to convey any rose tinted view of the Civil Service.  Its members are not uniform in competence, quality or application, but generally speaking they have served the State well in an independent and patriotic manner.  Having said that, it would be naive to suggest that ideological positions are not adopted by senior figures in the Civil Service.  Over a decade ago, I remember making the life of the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Jim Mitchell, a misery when the same Department with which we are now dealing wanted to sell off the Great Southern hotels. According to the official line, the hotels were a disaster and had to be given away.  It is not an exaggeration to say that if they had been disposed of it would have been for a song.  That line was taken largely for purposes of convenience but in the event we contrived to prevent that happening. Look at those hotels now and the importance of the hotels network generally for our tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Having praised the civil servants I believe their place is in the Civil Service and not running commercial companies, even at one hand's remove.  I was deeply uncomfortable about recent developments in Bord na Móna.  I do not know if Deputy O'Flynn has a basis for his remarks or whether, which is more likely, he was being parochial in praising the present chairman.  I do not wish to take away from praise of the present chairman with whom I dealt quite often as a Minister of State.  I was, however, uncomfortable about what happened.  It was an unhappy chapter.</P>
    <P>I have known the managing director since we were students together.  It happened and there may have been matters of detail that I did not know about.  However, the fact that I did not know about them and should have known, only makes me more uneasy.  I did not know where things were coming from or why and that is not a desirable position.</P>
    <P>I want to return to the configuration of the new Bord na Móna and what Deputy Stagg summarised as the &ldquo;stick to your knitting&rdquo; philosophy. That is an extension of my contention that, in many cases, senior officials in the permanent government &mdash; I do not use the term derogatorily &mdash; do have ideological baggage.  They discovered that straightforward privatisation was not an <Col N="117" /> attractive proposition, even though it seemed to be popular internationally.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil itself is a coalition of forces that unites cohesively when the occasion requires it. On other occasions, however, there are disparate views within the party, for example, on the question of privatisation.  There is no mad ideological aggression in Fianna Fáil on the question of privatisation.  The party will take a pragmatic view on it.  Many people in the senior management echelons of semi-State companies and, indeed, in the Civil Service, have read that and decided they cannot go at it head on, so they will devise the &ldquo;stick to your knitting&rdquo; or &ldquo;stick to your core activity&rdquo; strategy.  That, in itself, will produce a situation where some of these companies will necessarily need strategic partners and, in some cases, will need to be sold off altogether.</P>
    <P>The practice in Britain has clearly shown that senior executives have a definite and direct personal interest in their companies being privatised. Across the water it was one of the great scandals under the Tory Government.  Figures have been published in various reports &mdash; in the past I have put some of them on the record of this House &mdash; showing that executives in some of the former State utility companies in Britain made fortunes beyond their wildest dreams as a result of privatisation.  I am not suggesting that would happen in this country, but it is a factor driving this kind of approach.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied to take Deputy Fleming's view that there is nothing sinister, only the modernisation of the commercial structure to allow Bord na Móna to achieve its potential and at the same time provide employment in regions where it is badly needed.  However, because of the company's structure, I can see how it and the four subsidiary companies are neatly parcelled up for a situation where they could be disposed of and where the company itself would return only to saving turf.  I honestly do not think there would be a particularly long-term future for Bord na Móna if that is all it had to do.</P>
    <P>I was immensely impressed by the modern company and its management.  I was especially impressed by the research and development division and the new product development that is being piloted from Newbridge.  It is immensely encouraging.  However, if the company was to restrict itself to its core activity it would beg serious long-term questions.</P>
    <P>I want to share my time with Deputy Enright who has a particular interest in this matter.  I would like to make two quick points before doing so.  Deputy Fleming raised the question of cutaway bogs.  When the Minister replies, I would like her to deal with the 1991 report of the independent expert committee on the future uses of cutaway bogs, which referred to 90,000 hectares coming back into use.  What is the policy orientation on that?  It seems to be a critical and important question.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the workers in Bord na Móna who took all the pain of a pretty savage, but <Col N="118" /> necessary, rationalisation programme.  Some 2,500 to 3,000 workers lost their jobs.  A system of contract companies was created which did have the merit of retaining some people in employment.  While it is certainly more efficient in terms of the overall interests of the company, the workers deserve great credit for facing up to severe rationalisation.  I wish the company well in the future.  It is right that it should be modernised and I am glad I was a member of a Government that made the massive equity injection into it for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is important legislation which outlines the thinking of successive Governments on the future of Bord na Móna since it was established under the Turf Development Act, 1946.  The Bill makes provision for the future of Bord na Móna, which will mean significant changes in the company in the next 25 to 30 years.  We should be thankful for the major contribution Bord na Móna has made to society through its economic development over the past 50 years.  In the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s people had the vision, courage and persistence to identify and commercialise one of our great natural resources.  The development of vast tracks of bogland across the midlands and west made a huge contribution to the economic development of the State.  It provided jobs and led to the development of many regions where, prior to that, there had been little employment.  It is important to realise that Bord na Móna has a role in regional development.  At one stage it had developments in 13 of the Twenty-six Counties, while today it operates in approximately ten.  When we consider the problems associated with traffic congestion and lack of housing in our towns and cities, particularly in Dublin, it is important to do what we can to ensure that bodies such as Bord na Móna continue to be developed in the regions.</P>
      <P>This country has failed to spread economic activity on an even basis across the country.  As an energy producer, Bord na Móna has approximately 30 years left as an employer.  As an extractor industry, it has by its definition a limited life-span and is now well into the second half of its life.  It is therefore essential that the Bill's provisions ensure that Bord na Móna not just completes the primary task for which it was established, but that it is given new direction to use its valuable resources of land and skills as a vehicle for major regional development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should conduct proper research and development into other sources of energy, such as the cutaway bogs in Bord na Móna's possession.  I will give the Minister some statistics on research and development.  British Nuclear Fuels Limited spends more money on public relations than is spent on research and development into renewable energy in the United Kingdom.  That shows that sufficient research and development is not being carried out on new sources of energy, such as wind, water, solar energy and biomass.  Great strides have been made in northern Europe in <Col N="119" /> developing wind energy.  Bord na Móna has expertise in this area as one of its stations already produces wind energy.  If we allow Bord na Móna to proceed, then I am confident it will be able to develop wind energy as a clean renewable source in Laoighis-Offaly and along the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>I welcome the power in this Bill to issue shares in the company, which will be of major benefit to Bord na Móna.  We must consider how these shares will be issued and how this practice can be extended to other industries.  Bord na Móna has shown its skills and expertise in the past and I am confident that if it is given Government support it will create many jobs and produce clean economical energy.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, Bord na Móna owns approximately 120 million tonnes of peat which has yet to be extracted from bogs.  It is essential to proceed with the development of this resource. I want to know what is happening regarding the new 120 megawatt peat powered generating station.  The House is aware that a major initiative is under way to set up this additional station, but I am disappointed at the progress being made on the independent generating programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that Deputy Dukes secured an extension on the draw down of funds for this programme when he was Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I understand that further delays have been experienced in organising the competition to build the Europeat station.  I ask the Minister to exercise her powers to ensure no undue delay in completing this project.  I also ask her to examine each stage of the selection, planning and construction process so that European Union funds provided for this project are drawn down.  If it is necessary to make provisions in this Bill or to issue statutory instruments for that purpose, then the Minister should do so immediately.  I am certain she will have the full support of this side of the House if changes are necessary to ensure that the Europeat station proceeds as quickly as possible because it is important for the future of Bord na Móna and for the midlands.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I spoke publicly about the necessity to provide equity for Bord na Móna. For many years it was used as a plaything by different Governments.  Wrong decisions were taken which left it with a huge debt.  Developments carried out by Bord na Móna were paid for without grants; it was given an opportunity to borrow.  That is why Bord na Móna found itself in difficulty, which it has now resolved.  I thank Deputy Lowry for getting £120 million equity sanctioned by the Government when he was Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  One tranche of £49 million was provided by the previous Government, while £51 million is now being provided.  Bord na Móna requires a further £20 million which I hope will be provided at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I live among and represent many Bord na Móna workers and we have seen what the ESB <Col N="120" /> and Bord na Móna have done.  They have helped to develop the small towns and villages in the midlands and to make it a prosperous and progressive area in which to live.  It is for this reason that Bord na Móna must be encouraged to make progress in these areas.</P>
    <P>What is causing the delays in relation to unit four at Ferbane power station?  Eleven months ago the then Minister, Deputy Dukes, announced the refurbishment of the power station.  I am disappointed and angry that little or nothing has happened since.  Is Bord na Móna, the ESB or the Government responsible?  I believe these delays are being caused by the ESB.  If it is experiencing difficulties, it should make a public statement immediately.  The Minister must make a special effort to ensure that work is completed on the Ferbane power station at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to carbon dioxide emissions.  Bord na Móna is active in this area. Between 1990 and 2010, the reference period in which the target for greenhouse emissions has been set, emissions of carbon dioxide from peat will have been reduced by 30 per cent.  Bord na Móna is anxious to ensure a clean environment. Energy produced from peat is clean.  It is important that Bord na Móna makes every effort to ensure the cleanliness of the product it produces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.  I am delighted we are discussing not only Bord na Móna's development but the provision of more equity.  I pay tribute to the workers and management for the work they have done over the years.  I do not speak as a midland Deputy but I know that east County Galway has often been regarded as part of the midlands.  There is a hospital in Ballinasloe, County Galway, which serves the midlands and there are thousands of acres of bog in north and east Galway and south Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bogs of east Galway and south Roscommon have often been mentioned in terms of development by Bord na Móna.  I remember an ESB proposal in the 1970s to build a power station in the area and I think we lost out at that time to an extension to the Shannonbridge station.  Later a peat briquette factory at Derryfadda/Ballyforan was suggested but a decision was taken subsequently not to proceed with it.  However, thanks to Bord na Móna, we continued to develop and mill peat there for transportation to Blackwater and Shannonbridge, and this involved the employment of over 100 people in the 1970s.  The tragedy for the area which I represent was that the number at work declined over the years to the point where few were employed and very little peat was being transported to the midlands.  One of the reasons given by Bord na Móna for not proceeding with the development of Derryfadda was the increased cost of transport, particularly after the oil crisis in <Col N="121" /> the 1970s.  It is ironic that the Derryfadda work-shop is serving a useful purpose as a classroom for a school which is being refurbished at present. The House will recall the public protest at the national school at Kilglass near Ahascragh, County Galway.</P>
    <P>I am glad a new station is to be provided in the east midlands and I would have Deputy Enright know that we were looking to have it established in the west.  I recommend that the bogs of east Galway and south Roscommon be developed to serve that station.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the former managing director of Bord na Móna, Eddie O'Connor.  I want to pay tribute to him because he was conscious of the fact that Bord na Móna should market its products and he was geared towards the needs of the consumer.  I know he and many of the Bord na Móna staff were anxious to get the supermarkets and smaller shops to promote Bord na Móna products.  That was not always easy when there was such an array of imported briquettes and other products.  If Eddie O'Connor and the Bord na Móna staff had had more funding to market and promote Bord na Móna products, they would have been able to sell more.</P>
    <P>I agree with others speakers who said that Bord na Móna could still do more to improve the packaging and presentation of briquettes.  They could be made more user friendly.  If it can be done with firelighters, surely it can be done with briquettes. This area should be developed.</P>
    <P>A small station at Attymon, County Galway, at which turf production by Bord na Móna has ceased but where a worker co-operative has taken over the production of turf, is also involved in the distribution of briquettes.  It is doing an excellent job both in the sale of loose turf and briquettes.  This is the kind of thing in which Eddie O'Connor and his team were involved.</P>
    <P>Thousands of acres of bog have not been developed.  I admit that a small section of the bog to which I refer will become part of the national heritage area and the special areas of conservation.  Farmers, from whom bogs were acquired compulsorily in many cases for the development of Derryfadda and who were paid as little as £20 per acre, are most anxious to find out whether they can seek the return of that bog, especially where it is in the heritage areas which qualify under the REPS.  The answer these farmers receive is that this bog is now being dealt with by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I would hope some resolution can be found to help these farmers, such as a lease arrangement under which they could include this bog under the REPS or cut turf for themselves and their families.  All these questions relate to this evening's debate.</P>
    <P>The workers have suffered in helping Bord na Móna address its serious debt and I pay tribute to them.  Some of them suffered unemployment but I am glad to see there is still a large number employed in Bord na Móna.  Figures for the peat energy division show that 1,258 people were employed in six Bord na Móna works and 655 <Col N="122" /> people were employed in five of the ESB stations. Hopefully, the number employed will increase through the construction and operation of the new station.</P>
    <P>The board consists of a chairman, a managing director and up to ten other members, including four worker directors.  Eight of the directors are appointed by the Government and the worker directors are elected by the workforce.  The board's duties in relation to acquiring and developing bogs and in the production, use and marketing of turf and turf products are very important.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that a large area of bog has been acquired.  We will see Bord na Móna develop this over a number of years, but there is still great scope for Bord na Móna to market products.  The new board is doing that and I wish them well.</P>
    <P>We all remember the furore about smog and pollution from certain fuel products.  The Bord na Móna products have always been first class.  One could not have more environmentally friendly products.</P>
    <P>There are 362 people employed in the five Bord na Móna works of the horticultural division. We are all familiar with &ldquo;Shamrock&rdquo; branded peat products, which have been a great success. Over 90 per cent of these products are exported, mainly to the UK and continental Europe.  These are high bulk, low value products and a high proportion of the division's costs are accounted for by freight charges.  The company operates in the European market which is heavily oversupplied and experiences intense competition.</P>
    <P>There are 365 people employed at the briquette factories of Bord na Móna's solid fuel division at Croghan, Derrinlough, Littleton and in the board's works at Ballydermot and Lullymore.  A further 60 people are employed in the divisional headquarters.  The solid fuels division is responsible for the production and sale of Bord na Móna's branded products of peat briquettes and sod turf for use as home heating fuel.  The division operates in a market which is in long-term decline due to changes in consumption patterns, namely, increased use of oil and gas by consumers.  The majority of the division's sales are in Ireland.  In 1995, the solid fuels division diversified into the coal market through its acquisition of CDL.  This was designed to restrict the impact of Bord na Móna's declining peat business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for sharing time.  The motion and the amendment are meaningless and this debate is tiresome.  The issue of crime in the community is not well served by the Minister and the Opposition slugging it out in this Chamber or over the airwaves.  There is an element of macho shadow boxing involved which does little to inspire public confidence in Members.  It also does nothing to help us get at the root causes of crime and discover practical ways to tackle the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the framers of the motion merely plucked aspects of the crime problem out of the sky.  Why is the main Opposition party calling for the introduction of a comprehensive drug treatment and therapy programme for women prisoners?  Why only women prisoners when <Col N="125" /> there is a major and, in many ways, more serious problem with their male counterparts in this regard?  The motion is very selective in respect of the areas to which it draws attention.  I fault the motion in the same way I faulted the Minister's approach to tackling the crime problem because of its overemphasis on legislation.  There seems to be a view that legislation alone can tackle the serious problem of crime in the community.  The motion also fails to recognise the close relationship between drug abuse and high crime figures. Unless we get to the nub of the issue and put in place practical and well funded measures to tackle the supply of and demand for drugs, our discussions will only be so much hot air.</P>
    <P>In the amendment, the Minister begins with his usual rant about zero tolerance.  The root of this concept, which is in operation in New York and certain parts of Britain, is that an equally strong arm approach should be taken to minor and serious crimes.  Having been in office a number of months, however, the Minister has decided that the issue is more complex than he stated during the election campaign.  He has discovered that this approach is not possible in the Irish context. The Minister now states that people did not understand what he meant by &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; and it should, in fact, be applied only to serious crimes.  This makes a nonsense of his original proposal from which he gained huge mileage before and during the election campaign.  Most people accept that the concept of zero tolerance &mdash; as it is understood in other jurisdictions &mdash; is dead as far as the Government is concerned.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the motion also refers to the Minister's plans to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 12,000, which is hardly an ambitious proposal.  The Dublin area is under-staffed in respect of Garda personnel.  This issue is regularly raised at public meetings because people want gardaí back on the beat so that they will be familiar with the areas they patrol, have better relations with the community and be more vigilant.  There has been much discussion about large scale crimes but the majority of people are more concerned about the frequency of burglaries, bag snatches, car thefts, etc.  We should be able to deal with such problems at local level through the provision of more gardaí on the beat. However, increasing Garda strength to 12,000 is not particularly ambitious.</P>
    <P>The amendment also supports the measures taken by the Minister to provide 1,000 prison spaces.  It is difficult to sift through press releases and public statements but, as far as I can see, the Minister is only proposing the provision of an additional 200 spaces over and above those already provided by the previous Government.  I am open to correction but it appears that is all the Minister has secured.</P>
    <P>With regard to drug treatment in prisons, the amendment &ldquo;notes that ongoing discussions are taking place with the Eastern Health Board&rdquo;. There are, in fact, few such discussions taking place.  There is a major drug abuse problem in <Col N="126" /> Mountjoy Prison and great difficulty in deciding how best to tackle it.  I made this point on previous occasions and I believe drug treatment services in our prisons should be the equal of those available in the wider community.  I am familiar with people who were involved in the drugs culture and who, following a long wait, managed to gain acceptance to community treatment programmes.  However, they were then given prison sentences of two to three years for the larceny associated with their drug abuse.  They entered Mountjoy Prison where a treatment programme is not available and returned to using heroin. That is an utter disgrace.  I do not know how any Minister can preside over such a situation.  This matter requires urgent attention and the Eastern Health Board is willing to become involved, on an agency basis, and provide a full range of drug treatment services to the 60 per cent plus prisoners in Mountjoy who are addicted to drugs. However, this will only happen if there is a change in the mindset in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The amendment also refers to counselling for sex offenders.  The programme available is pathetic as there are ten people on it at any one time.  Apart from removing offenders from the community, the main function of prisons should be to rehabilitate.  However, we are utterly failing to rehabilitate prisoners serving sentences for drug or sex offences, which is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the motion welcomes the Government's publication of the Courts Service Bill, which was already in train before the change of Administration, and notes the Government's imminent decision on the Garda SMI report.  The latter is overdue and I urge the Minister to get on with publishing the final report.</P>
    <P>Included in the amendment is the Government's welcoming of its commitment to publish the Criminal Justice Bill, about which so much was reported in the media today.  As I understand it, it is the policy of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce on an annual basis a &ldquo;tidying up&rdquo; Bill which is precisely what the Criminal Justice Bill represents.  To loud fanfares today, the Minister referred to mandatory sentences but I read the Bill and it is clear he has walked away from the issue of mandatory sentences.  There were headlines today and talk from the Minister about the introduction of ten year mandatory sentences for drug offences, but there is an opt-out clause.  We have been sold a pig in a poke.  Today the Minister got away with it and it is to be hoped the media will pay attention to what is in the Bill and discover the Minister has reneged on his pre-election promise.  I will not complain too much about that because I am glad he is now taking the advice of the Law Reform Commission and of his own Department on mandatory sentencing.  However, the headlines and the fanfare only bring this House into further disrepute by making it seem out of touch with problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> Although tidying up a few aspects of the law, this Bill does nothing to tackle the drug problem which is seriously affecting my constituency and many constituencies throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I could not help but notice Deputy Shortall's hypocritical attitude to drug treatment centres.  As chairman of the Eastern Health Board, of which I also am a member, Deputy Shortall is well aware it had a marvellous premises in the Weir Home which was eminently suitable for development as a drug treatment centre. It was to be a headquarters for the centre city from which five satellite clinics throughout the south inner city would operate, and it was labour activists and members of the Labour Party in my constituency who prevented it going ahead.</P>

While it is necessary for men to have methadone treatment in prisons, I do not know why Deputy Shortall should be offended by the fact that women are being given the chance of treatment first. However, I emphasise that the opposition to drug treatment centres in my constituency is being led by the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>When we said we would introduce zero tolerance that is what we meant.  I am delighted the Minister has introduced this Bill.  It is most welcome.  Many of the changes are necessary.  If the Minister finds we do not have enough <Col N="128" /> prison places or that building works need to be carried out on existing prisons to bring them up to a modern standard, he should consider leasing prisons from the private sector.  The private sector could build prisons and lease them to the State, just as it does in the case of toll roads, and when it has made its money, the prisons could revert to the State, just like the Roche Bridge in Dublin which will revert to Dublin Corporation when it has been in operation for 20 years.  I suspect we may not have enough prison places, although having a ten year minimum sentence for people in possession of drugs worth more than £10,000 for the purposes of supply should act as a deterrent. However, the mules will have to be careful that they are not used by drug dealers to keep more of their product.  Regarding the testing of drugs, it sometimes takes up to six months to test the strength of drugs.  This is far too long in bringing a case to court.  It is important that more facilities are provided and I hope the Minister will provide them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was in the process of preparing a discussion document on sexual offences, including the possibility of a register of sex offenders.  I am totally in favour of that, and the Minister should have no doubt that the vast majority of the people want a proper register of sex offenders.  Deputy Dan Neville said something similar earlier and I agree wholeheartedly with him.  I am sceptical about the suggestion that anything can be done to treat such people.  I do not believe any paedophile has ever been cured. We must be careful not to give these people another way out.  We need to show zero tolerance towards them.</P>
      <P>At the last election I said zero tolerance was what this Government would stand for.  I stand over that and believe it will be seen to be true. We will not tolerate crime any more.  There will be no more excuses.  I felt for the Minister this evening because of the manner in which he was interviewed on television and blamed for a judicial problem.  Any fair-minded person would agree that we should have a school for judges because some of our judges make decisions that give rise to concern.  I hope the President of the District Court will deal firmly with this matter if there has been a serious error of judgment.  Somewhere down the line there has been an error of judgment but the Judiciary and the Executive are separate and the Judiciary will have to police themselves.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The people in my constituency will be pleased to know we are carrying out our promises on law and order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition have a brass neck to come in here after just five months to criticise the Minister for not addressing in that short time the neglect perpetrated by the last Government over a period of two and a half years.  He has clearly and unequivocally laid out his philosophy on zero tolerance.  To expect a <Col N="129" /> major advance on this in less than six months, which also included the summer recess, is totally unrealistic.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has little to shout about, having maintained in office a Minister who not only sat on her hands when decisive action was required but who could not even get the most fundamental elements of her programme past her coalition partners.  I need hardly remind Deputies Higgins and Flanagan of the red faces which abounded in their party when Deputy Owen's proposals on the bail laws which had been trumpeted all over the media were publicly and brutally slapped down by her so-called partners in the Labour Party.  It was the regrettable death of Veronica Guerin which galvanised Deputy Owen into action and forced her and her partners of the loony left, through the strength of public opinion, to put together a face saving programme of measures. Otherwise it would have fallen to the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to initiate an even wider programme of reform today.  Fine Gael has always had to be shocked into action, in the same way as the mongrel foxes had to eventually toe the line in 1972 when another crisis gripped the country and they were forced to withdraw their opposition to another Fianna Fáil measure.  History repeats itself.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to some of the achievements and proposals of the Minister.  I do not propose to slavishly repeat them but I draw the attention of the Opposition to the massive increase in the financial provision for the Department of Justice for next year.  Ministers can waffle for hours about what they would do if they had the money or, worse still, promise a great deal and provide no funding.  The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has set out clearly and with no equivocation his needs for next year in terms of the Estimates.  I again draw the attention of the Opposition to his commitment to spend 10 per cent extra on necessary areas in his Department next year.  That is a positive and tangible advance in the fight against crime.  When this extra resource has been spent as wisely as he proposes then there will be action on the ground and a positive advance on the road to zero tolerance.</P>
      <P>Today a constituent asked me to congratulate the Minister on providing new four wheel drive vehicles for the Garda.  The public have noticed these vehicles on the streets of their towns.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the more visible measures being taken by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on putting in place the State's first witness protection programme.  It is an unfortunate sign of the times that we have in our midst criminal elements who are willing to interfere with witnesses to the point of inflicting serious injury or even death in an effort to escape the rigors of the law.  Formerly this was the preserve of subversive organisations.  Unfortunately criminal elements have taken over in this area.  If <Col N="130" /> it is properly promoted and fully funded this new programme will go a long way to restoring public confidence in the criminal justice system.  In the same way as he had the foresight and ability in Opposition to initiate and promote the proceeds of crime legislation in 1996, the new Criminal Justice Bill will form the backbone of additional measures against criminality.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue is a strong and forthright Minister who commands the respect and inspires the support of his colleagues in Government.  He has no need on his path to zero tolerance to look over his shoulder to see who on this side of the House might snipe at him and his proposals.  His course is clear, his task is set and his goals are fully defined.  He recently announced the appointment of a new assistant State pathologist.  Fianna Fáil campaigned strongly for this appointment when in Opposition and the Minister has delivered on his promise after only a short time in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the number of murders, we need a few more assistant State pathologists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy McGahon has come into the House to support me.  I appreciate it very much.</P>
      <P>We are all only too well aware of the immense workload of Dr. Harbison and the great responsibility he carries in the administration of the justice system.  I congratulate the Minister on this new appointment and look forward as a result to the speedier administration of justice which will end in more criminals finding themselves behind bars, with a resultant improvement in the quality of life for people under threat.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot make any clearer his commitment to reduce the effects of drug addiction on our streets today.  I was most surprised to hear Deputy Higgins on lunch time radio belittle the Minister's proposals on stiffer sentencing for serious drug offences or mandatory sentencing where it is patently called for.  There has to be a scale of seriousness applied to this offence and the value of the drugs and the consequential profit are as good a yardstick as any other.  Would the Deputy maintain that the robbery of £1,000 is as serious as the robbery of £10,000?  In spite of all his fancy rhetoric, Deputy Higgins does not yet understand that the public wants decisive action on serious crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Zero tolerance is not all about the major criminals with fancy nicknames.  It is about bringing about an improvement in the quality of life for us all.  It has to do with reducing traffic accidents, eliminating road deaths and making life in our cities and towns a little better for us all.  That is why the Minister proposes to deploy 150 probationary gardaí in ensuring that traffic and buses can run on time over Christmas.  We in the capital will clearly benefit, as will the probationary gardaí who will gain a level of experience not usually available to members at their level.  Respect for the law and concern for road users is what not <Col N="131" /> parking on yellow lines is all about.  Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out this to people and to penalise them if they infringe the law.  The Minister is making a good point on our behalf in taking this traffic safety initiative.</P>
    <P>Zero tolerance is ultimately about raising the consciousness of people to even the most minor misdemeanours and indiscretions in our society so that we can live as normal a life as possible. We are all human and guilty of some misdemeanours and if the punishment fits the crime and is applied equitably then I have no problem in being corrected for any of my indiscretions. This is a concept I wholeheartedly espouse on behalf of my constituents who have seen civic standards fall before their eyes on a daily basis. We will all have to change our habits and accept that a new society begins with us and the effort we make.  It will eventually come down to the lesser wrongdoings such as littering the streets, defacing public property, the neglect of private buildings etc.  Society means all of us trying to live together in the least disruptive manner possible. Society is not about punishing someone else for wrongdoing, it is about the people who make up the communities in which we live.</P>
    <P>Zero tolerance is not just about providing extra prison accommodation, even though the Minister proposes to provide 1,100 new spaces by the end of two years and 2,000 spaces by the end of five years.  It is also about using these places wisely, an issue which the Minister has also addressed. Time does not permit me to deal in detail with the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau, the abolition of the preliminary examination procedures in the courts or the introduction of greater methods of efficiency in courts administration.  I need hardly mention the drug treatment programmes, the sex offender treatment programme or the probation and welfare services, all of which have the Minister's attention.  We can look forward in the near future to the setting up of the crime forum which will lead to a White Paper on crime.  It is only then that the Minister's work towards achieving his stated goal of zero tolerance will be exposed.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has a brass neck to call the Minister to task for what he has done.  If the previous Minister had done more than sit in her chair then the backlog would not be as great as it is.  I have no difficulty in expressing my confidence in the Minister and have no doubt that when he goes before the electorate in five years' time it will give him and the Government the kind of resounding vote of confidence which will put them back in office for a further term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the aspects of crime policy set out in the motion.  I am glad the debate has been conducted in an unemotional way.  I am sorry Deputy Shortall has left the Chamber as I wish to deal with the weaknesses she identified in the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997.  Her comments <Col N="132" /> smack of the same attitude adopted by the Labour Party in relation to the referendum on bail and the provision of extra prison spaces.  Deputy Quinn vetoed that provision in the absence of the then Minister, Deputy Owen.  It is a pity that obstructionist approach is still prevalent in the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comprehensive overview of the crime debate, which not only addresses law enforcement issues but places welcome emphasis on the need for us as a society to identify and deal with the root causes of crime.  The publication today of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is the clearest signal yet of the absolute determination of the Government to crack down on crime and tackle the criminal head on.  With the passage of that legislation there will be, as promised, no hiding place for the perpetrators of pain and suffering on society.  In implementing zero tolerance, the Government is stating clearly that the laws of the land will be implemented and the necessary resources provided.  The resolve and commitment in this regard could not be clearer.</P>
      <P>The determination shown by the Minister when on the Opposition benches in proposing radical reforming legislation is being carried through in his role as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In addressing the House last night he placed considerable emphasis on the need not only to be tough on crime but also on the causes of crime.  All empirical and anecdotal evidence points to the fact that the highest levels of crime are committed in areas with poor housing, lack of educational and employment opportunity, little or no recreational facilities and a high level of dependency on social welfare.</P>
      <P>I welcome the renewed emphasis in the Minister's address on the need to tackle the causes of crime on a multi-agency basis.  This reinforces the finding of the Lord Mayor's commission on crime, published in this city a couple of years ago, which stated <i>inter alia</i> that regrettably there was a concentration of crime in a small number of postal districts in Dublin city, the same areas which down the years have had poor quality housing, with little planning consideration and even less strategic thought.  They are the areas where there is greatest alienation from main-stream society, where gardaí are treated with suspicion and are most likely to be viciously attacked, where the old and vulnerable are most likely to be attacked with blood-filled syringes or have a knife held to their neck, where men attempting to round up horses are set upon, beaten up and their jeep burned, as happened in my constituency last Thursday night.  Those activities cannot be condoned.  We must examine the reasons behind those incidents.  Is there too much violence on television?  Is there too much tolerance of outrageous behaviour?  I hope these matters will be explored by the proposed crime forum and the White Paper on Crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must involve the public as never before in a fundamental heart-search of society's ills.  That <Col N="133" /> must be done at community level, involving all groups, in every home, school and youth club, at trade union meetings and factory assembly lines. If it is not done objectively, from the bottom up, the whole exercise will be a wasted effort.</P>
    <P>The gardaí must actively engage in the debate.</P>
    <P>They must listen because they will have their critics as well as their supporters.  Unless they are seen to be responding and responsive, the communities hardest hit will lose confidence in their capacity to protect them and work with them. Other professionals such as teachers and health and social workers will have to be equally involved.  Without pre-empting the outcome of the debate, I hope each Garda district will ultimately have its own liaison council which will be a monitoring vehicle for crime strategy in the district.  In this regard communities need to be assured enforcement strategy forms part of a continuum.</P>
    <P>I have doubts about the value of recent operations such as Operation Freeflow.  No sooner had the motorist begun to realise that parking illegally was unacceptable and become used to disciplined driving than the whole exercise was wound down.  The same can be said about the Christmas drink driving campaign, with wall to wall checks for a few weeks around Christmas. Public confidence is hard won but easily lost, particularly in areas of law enforcement.</P>
    <P>On longer-term strategies, I welcome the Minister's commitment to the expansion of the youth crime diversion projects.  Those projects have been extremely successful, particularly where they dovetail with mainline youth provision.  I would, however, sound a cautionary note.  I have been long enough in youth work &mdash; most people would say far too long &mdash; to have seen many excellent projects into which generous resources were put, only to be starved of funding once the pilot phase has passed.  That happened in the case of youth encounter projects introduced by the Department of Education and neighbourhood youth projects sponsored by the Department of Health, which were the product of discussions begun by the late Frank Cluskey when parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>A plethora of projects are funded by the national drugs strategy team and by EU funding. Those projects, which are considered long-term, are at present awash with cash, but what will happen when the first tranche of funding dries up?  Before many more such projects are brought on-stream, a thorough evaluation of the effectiveness of those that are up and running must be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to the provision of significant resources for extra prison places.  Without additional places the revolving door syndrome will continue inexorably to become more chronic.  We are, unfortunately, paying dearly for the lack of provision by previous Governments.  When I was a member of the board of Trinity House in Lusk officials of the Department of Justice decided to scale down that <Col N="134" /> centre.  If that facility had been built to its original scale, it is likely at least some of our most notorious criminals would not have been able to ply their evil trade so freely or flaunt their wealth so openly in recent years.  Some of the most notorious criminals of today could not be housed in that centre because of lack of space.  Even in those days criminals had to be released early.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent innovation by the Garda in introducing closed circuit television.  We are already beginning to see the benefits of that in the Temple Bar area and O'Connell Street.  I welcome the Minister's decision to extend CCTV to the Finglas area in 1998.  Together with additional resources such as the provision of all-terrain vehicles and the Garda air support unit, that will help to reassure the hard-pressed community there.</P>
    <P>People, whether urban or rural dwellers, irrespective of age and gender, want to be reassured the Government of the day has a clear policy to counter criminal activity, a policy which will allow them sleep undisturbed in their beds and walk the streets in safety.  The Minister for Justice will meet that requirement.  The Government has the resolve to provide the resources and the determination to implement policy which will be tough on crime and on the causes of crime.</P>
    <P>I wish to advert to comments by Deputy Shortall on mandatory sentencing as it relates to the Criminal Justice Bill published today.  The Bill amends the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, by the introduction of a new offence of possession of drugs with a value of £10,000 or more with intent to supply.  The Bill proposes a minimum penalty of ten years to be imposed where a person is convicted of the offence.  That will apply automatically subject to certain limited exceptions.  For example, a court will be able to take into account the fact that a person pleaded guilty or materially assisted the Garda in the investigation of the offence.  It is disingenuous of Deputy Shortall to infer that there is a lack of commitment on the part of the Minister in that regard.</P>

      <P>This debate could not be more timely.  I thank Fine Gael for putting down this motion during Private Members' time.  The issue of crime was the keynote of Fianna Fáil's policies before the last election.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, made his reputation in Opposition as the hardline, hard headed opponent of crime who would zap the criminals with his policy of zero tolerance.  After five months in Government, however, that reputation lies in tatters.  Far from being a man who strikes terror in the hearts of the criminal fraternity, the Minister is likely to be remembered for his failure to live up to his promises and responsibilities.  His <Col N="135" /> pledge of zero tolerance, which he resurrects as a pale shadow of itself in the Criminal Justice Bill, is a joke.  Zero tolerance has been shrunk beyond recognition in that Bill, which deals mainly with administrative measures and proposes mandatory sentences for possessing drugs worth £10,000 or more.</P>
      <P>On the day he published the Bill, the Minister revealed an astonishing inability to take responsibility.  Five people walked free from a court even though they were charged with a series of drug related crimes.  Those five men were arrested and charged as a result of a £3 million drugs seizure. The Minister took delight in basking in the success of the seizure, but adopted a rather different approach subsequently.  The men were released when it was discovered the extension of the period of detention under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act was without proper authority. They were immediately rearrested and charged again when, incredibly, they were released for a second time because there was no court warrant. Today while the Minister was promoting himself on the airwaves as a champion of the lawful and the foe of the criminal, five men arrested on charges involving drugs worth more than £3 million walked free from a court because of technical blunders.  Those blunders are of monumental significance and the Minister must take ultimate responsibility for them.</P>
      <P>In Opposition Deputy O'Donoghue pointed out many times that the Minister is ultimately responsible when blunders occur.  Yet this evening he tried to wriggle out of blame.  It is despicable that a Minister should use bluster and denial to cover up his or her inadequacies.  In her time as Minister, Deputy Owen, had the courage and conviction to stand up in the House when Deputy O'Donoghue tried to pin every single glitch in the system on her, even down to the loss of a photocopy in an extradition case.  She took responsibility while he has taken refuge in offloading the blame.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  If the Minister is not willing or unable to accept his role, he should stand aside and let somebody else take over who is willing to live up to the office.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time a blunder has led to the release of persons charged with serious drug offences during this Minister's watch.  In September a person remanded in custody, charged with possessing drugs worth £1.5 million, was released on bail because of an administrative error.  In the Bill published today the Minister wants to introduce mandatory sentencing for those charged with possessing drugs worth £10,000 or more.  Yet in the five months since the Minister took up office six people charged with possessing drugs worth £4.5 million walked free from court and, to add insult to injury, the Minister is in denial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public is entitled to better.  They are entitled to know the Minister is not only willing to take the credit when things go right, but brave <Col N="136" /> enough to shoulder the blame when things go wrong.  I wonder if the Minister understands how shocking these events are for the public, many of whom expected Fianna Fáil to tackle crime.  The public is not reassured by the sight of a Fianna Fáil Minister washing his hands when those arrested and charged with serious crime walk free.</P>
    <P>We have serious problems to tackle.  The previous Government laid the ground work in terms of legislation and investment in resources.  Crime rates are beginning to drop, but we have a long way to go.  The Minister is not capable of filling the role.  He has failed to deliver on his promises and to live up to his responsibilities.  The public deserve better.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for sharing time with me.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister for Justice is such an avid supporter of zero tolerance on crime, I am sure he will be more than willing to address the issues affecting my constituency of Dublin north east and the country in general.  Crime has become more than a token concern to be addressed by candidates in an election campaign. It is the single most sinister threat to public well-being in modern Ireland.  The Celtic Tiger and our booming economy mean little if people are afraid to walk the streets after dark or fear for their children as they play.</P>
      <P>The murder of Veronica Guerin was a wake-up call for our judicial system.  Much has been made of the gardaí's progress in the murder investigation and they are to be commended for their success to date.  Unfortunately, the effort, manpower and intensity which has gone into that investigation is rare in the general area of crime. The handling of that case has shown the gardaí to be a highly competent skilled police force when given the necessary resources.  Most crime committed here, including the murder of Veronica Guerin, is linked to drugs.  Even what would have been considered a simple purse snatch some time ago can now pose a threat to life due to the emergence of blood filled syringes as the modern thug's weapon of choice.  In my constituency there have been numerous attacks on bus drivers and Irish Rail staff by known drug users.  Apart from the serious risk to the safety of staff and commuters, this has led to the curtailment of bus services in parts of Coolock, Darndale and other parts of my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot deny there have been positive developments in the area of crime, the most notable being the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau and changes in the bail laws during Fine Gael's last term in office.  Those changes have put more pressure on the drug barons, but we must ensure they do not have any place to hide and that there is an end to the revolving door prison system.  We must examine possible flaws in our judicial system from the moment a person is suspected of a crime through to the courts process. <Col N="137" /> The alleged rape of a woman patient in St. Vincent's Psychiatric Hospital in Fairview on 5 June is a matter of grave concern.  Even though the attack was witnessed by a member of staff and a suspect was detained and questioned by the gardaí, no person has been charged with the crime.  This has caused great distress to the woman's family and to the staff of the hospital.  The only suspect in the case was released without charge and the Director of Public Prosecutions received a file on the case only this month, six months after the incident.  This means a man who could be a potential threat to society is free to strike again while our legal system tangles itself in bureaucracy.  I received a reply today to a question I tabled to the Minister on this case and, while I accept his hands are tied at this stage, I expect a fuller report from him in due course.</P>
    <P>For many years I have called for a proactive response to the increasing crime levels in my constituency, which should take the form of a new Garda station in Donaghmede.  We also need more gardaí on the streets.  This would act as a deterrent to would-be criminals and reassure long suffering communities.  The further development of community policing and neighbourhood watch schemes should also be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Crime can manifest itself in many forms.  Bay-side DART station has been the subject of numerous vandalism attacks while undergoing an £80,000 improvements scheme.  Apart from the nuisance caused to commuters and the serious blow to Irish Rail, which is trying to improve facilities for its customers, unless the root cause of this mindless vandalism is tackled head on, the petty criminal of today will be the drug baron of tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I have seen many Ministers perform in the House over the past 20 years but I had not heard until this evening an admission from a Minister for Justice that he was not embarrassed about a monumental blunder which has allowed five people to go free.  I thank the Minister for his lesson but the public does not believe it.  Whether he likes it or not, he is the person to whom the public will ascribe political responsibility for all such activities.  It is a lesson he will learn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country does not appreciate the extent and depth of the challenge which faces it in tackling drugs, a world wide problem which is being experienced increasingly in our country.  Yesterday, with a number of other Members, I met a group of people from the US Congress.  The head of the US Drug Enforcement Agency was with the group.  His budget is larger than the Irish national budget &mdash; $70 billion a year is spent in combating drugs through education and other prevention activities.  He walked around Dublin with some of his officials and he saw intelligent, ambitious and proud young people.  He said that the one common denominator which was apparent between them was money.  Young people with money in an affluent economy face the danger <Col N="138" /> of drugs.  The Minister faces the responsibility of providing the resources and facilities to deal with the problem.  If parents are not educated to the challenge the consequences from the drug barons will be enormous.  These criminals are not the kind who steal apples from trees.  They could compete in many cases with Fortune 500 companies given the amount of money involved in the drugs trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have the full support of the House in the action he takes to tackle drugs barons and drug related crime.  The setting up of the Criminal Assets Bureau by the Government of which I was a member was one of the best decisions made by any Government to deal with an issue such as this.</P>
    <P>The Minister should see to it that the Garda Commissioner restores Operation Shannon for the winter months.  It was successful and provided a deterrent to those who travel to carry out crimes.  It appears that the latest two unfortunate killings in County Galway happened after sporting occasions when licensing exemptions applied. They are serious cases the details of which will emerge in due course, but it would appear that the deaths may be drink related.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ask the Commissioner to continue to encourage his superintendents to reside in the areas in which they operate and to ensure that that station rosters apply as previously.  One can travel through many small towns early in the morning and find 200 or 300 young people on the streets.  This does not lend itself to normal activity and it would do no harm if a Garda presence was available in such towns on more occasions than at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister faces a great challenge and where he does right we will give him credit.  However, he must take responsibility.  He is the political master of the Department of Justice and those under his aegis will look to him to lead.</P>

      <P>No one more so than the Minister and his dancing partner, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell.  Over recent years the Minister waxed eloquent and charged Deputy Owen when she was Minister with conceiving crime.  Unfortunately for him his finest days are behind him and the chickens are coming home to roost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps there is an element of opportunism about this motion and I accept that the Minister is only five months in his job.  I wish him well and I do not lack sympathy with the concept of zero tolerance.  However, the problem is zero punishment.  The Minister and his predecessors are prisoners <Col N="139" /> of the system.  The sooner we remove the civil servants and the Department from the administration of justice and return it to the Garda Síochána, who are professionally trained to fight the criminals, the better.  The Garda knows what is happening, not the desk bound civil servants who may only have theories and analyses of why people commit crime.  We must take the fight to the criminals.</P>
    <P>A society which denies the right of a father or mother to chastise a child for wrongdoing cannot expect stability.  A society which denies the right of a school teacher to administer punishment to a youth for wrongdoing does not deserve to have stability.  It is the absence of deterrents which causes the problem.  We can listen to fine analyses and theories but it is the absence of deterrents which is crucial.  There is now a rate of one murder a week which is a horrifying indictment of society and it is because there are no penalties or deterrents.  What will it be like in 20 years?</P>
    <P>The drug culture is established for all time and we are only tinkering at the edges of the problem at present.  It is a natural by-product of the drinking culture which has engulfed the youth in a sea of drink.  It is also a product of the violence we see on American television programmes every night.  We must do something to stop this and prevent some children from imitating such violence.  The creation of deterrents is what is needed.</P>
    <P>The people will always be offered referenda on sexual or moral issues, but they will not be offered a referendum on crime prevention measures.  If there was to be such a referendum people would vote for the return of capital punishment for wilful crimes.  It is horrendous to consider all the people, especially women, who are being killed week after week while the State seems powerless to prevent the deaths.  People who make huge amounts of money from drugs should be put in jail forever and the key thrown away.  Such sentences should be used as a deterrent to others who would take their places.  Unless strong measures are introduced to deal with crime all the analysis which takes place here, no matter who is in Government or Opposition, will be as ineffectual as a eunuch in a harem.</P>

      <P>I hope we will not have to listen to the Minister giving any more television interviews, such as on this evening's &ldquo;Six-One News&rdquo;, where he dares Opposition politicians to question whether he or his Department are responsible for different problems.  It is not acceptable.  He did not pursue that line when in Opposition.  According to him, everything was wrong, nothing was done correctly and he did not take into consideration the legacy of work done by the former Minister in establishing the Criminal Assets Bureau and restarting the prison building programme which was abandoned by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.</P>
      <P>There are many problems where crime is concerned.  It is annoying to think Ireland is top of the league for drug abuse among young people. If the crime problem is to be solved, many things need to be done.  The proposals announced by the Minister yesterday will not solve many of them.  I hope he has greater initiative than he had prior to the general election with his policy of zero tolerance.  The then Garda Commissioner stated it could not be implemented.  The only major change to take place was the retirement of the Deputy Garda Commissioner because he probably could not work with the Minister of the day. It is amazing how this policy has been overturned by the Minister and a spokesperson for the Department of Justice since his time in Opposition.  It is frustrating not alone for Members but for the public who tell us they are cynical about politicians because of the way major issues are dealt with by us in the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister for Justice put more proposals in place to deal with many variant problems that she inherited from the previous Government.  The Minister has an enormous amount of work to do to live up to half of what he promised.  He is only five months into his tenure and many of his proposals have fallen by the wayside.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, my constituency colleague, well in her efforts and I have no doubt she will give it the attention and dedication it requires but I hope what the television viewers witnessed tonight will not become an ongoing event as the Minister deals with such a serious problem.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, well.  I also wish the Minister well but he will need more than wishes.  Prior to the last general election, the public was told that crime would be the key issue during the election <Col N="141" /> campaign.  It was the first time in the history of the State that crime was an election issue, which was sad, because crime is always an issue.  It is a social problem with a serious impact on its victims.</P>
      <P>The Government parties attacked the former Minister day in day out and now there is not a word from them.  The public has realised that she introduced legislation, increased Garda numbers and made provision for 800 prison places while being castigated in the House.  Calls were made for her to resign.  The &ldquo;untouchables&rdquo; were touched by her and I pay tribute to the Garda on its 75th anniversary and I wish the new Garda Commissioner, Mr. Byrne, well because his force is doing a good job.  The Minister was prepared to provide the resources for the Garda and this has produced results.  The Government must face up to its responsibilities and support the Garda. Fine Gael has always been on the side of law and order and it is only when all people of goodwill support the Garda and security forces that crime can be defeated.  It was not too long ago that the country was on the edge but the Garda fought back and is winning the war.</P>

      <P>The Minister assured the House last night that zero tolerance is being implemented.  There is a clear and determined focus on tackling those who are engaged in criminal activity and that the strategy is zero tolerance, a determination that law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime and will work with each other and other relevant agencies in a cohesive manner.  There is a commitment to address the causes of crime so that yesterday's mistakes will not be tomorrow's problems.  Everyone in the House will agree we can never tolerate a state of affairs in which lives are destroyed by drug dealers.  Zero tolerance is the only answer to such evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication today of the Criminal Justice Bill is proof positive of the Government's commitment and that of the Minister to zero tolerance.  It is worth looking again at the proposals in the Bill published today.  Deputy Shortall described it as a tidying-up Bill.  This tidying-up Bill introduces such measures as a minimum sentence of ten years for persons found guilty of trafficking in drugs to the value of £10,000; trials will take place more quickly through the abolition of preliminary examinations; courts will automatically initiate an inquiry into the assets of people convicted of drug trafficking offences with a view to confiscating those assets; gardaí will spend less time in court through extending the type of evidence which can be given by certificate and the rules relating to courts taking into account guilty pleas are being placed on a clear statutory basis. The Minister deserves great credit for bringing forward the legislation and for his commitment to zero tolerance.  He is determined that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped <Col N="142" /> and resourced to deal with crime and that they will work with each other and other relevant agencies in a co-ordinated and cohesive fashion.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that the establishment of the criminal assets bureau represented substantial progress in the fight against crime and, in particular, against those who profit from ill-gotten gains. The bureau has mounted definitive attacks aimed at denying criminals their illegally acquired assets and more will be done to fight organised crime. The Minister has given authorisation for a formal witness security programme to be put in place by the Garda Síochána.  The key aspect of that new measure is its formal structure to process applications by persons who wish to be considered as protected witnesses.  It will have its own budget. That is an acknowledgement that the Government is serious about that initiative.  The scheme may also be backed up by legal changes which may be regarded as complementary to it.  These changes are not actually required for the scheme to be in operation but are designed to enhance it. An example of that is the law on the preservation of the identity of witnesses will be examined to see whether stronger provisions are required.  The Garda regard this new programme as an important measure which will strengthen their hands considerably in this most difficult and dangerous area of criminal investigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is delighted to demonstrate the Government's resolve to deal with serious crime. The Garda will also have additional resources.  I join with Deputy Belton in wishing the Garda Síochána well in its 75th anniversary.  The programme for Government provides additional recruitment to bring the strength of the Garda force to 12,000.  Deputy Shortall said that was a big deal but it is 1,000 additional Garda over and above the previous Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>The Government, recognising the urgent need for a significant increase in prison accommodation, is proceeding as a matter of priority, and as rapidly as is feasible, with a major prison building programme.</P>

      <P>&mdash;the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform lacks the basic information in many crucial areas from the commission of the crime to the release of the criminal back into the community.  Without this information we cannot hope to properly deal with the criminal justice problem.  There is a huge problem because of the lack of communication or inter related activity between the three major operational branches of the system &mdash; the Garda, the courts and the prisons.  If we do not have the statistical data how can we assemble the detailed expertise to understand the extent of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> In regard to the Minister's engine I expected a clear and positive statement on his participation in Government and what he intended to do. Instead, the response has been more of the now typical masterly inactivity or fudge that we have heard from the Minister since he took office five months ago.</P>
    <P>It is difficult at this stage to speak about zero tolerance without breaking down in laughter.  It was heralded by the Minister from the boreens of Cahirciveen to the hallowed halls of Leinster House as the solution of all solutions.  It was dropped by the Minister in a Galway speech in September.  Last night he reaffirmed it as the fundamental plank and backbone of his policy. Today he revealed the Criminal Justice Bill that bears no relation to the type of zero tolerance the Minister trumpeted in Opposition in recent years. A simple question I wish to put to the Minister is, how can his concept of zero tolerance fit in with the juvenile liaison scheme or the whole concept of compassionate juvenile justice?  The Minister should forget about zero tolerance and settle down to his work in the Department.</P>
    <P>Much play was made by the Minister when he was in Opposition of the matter of prison places. Repeatedly he refused to acknowledge the improvements carried out by the former Minister, Deputy Owen, to the tune of 800 places when between 1989-93 not one single prison place was provided.  The Minister was so aggravated by the former Minister's performance on prison spaces that he upped the ante in his anger and called for 2,000 extra prison places.  He now tells us he is putting 2,000 extra prison places in train.</P>
    <P>The Minister would do well to reflect on the role of the prison within the criminal justice system because our prisons are mere recycling units for criminals.  I refer to a study undertaken by criminologist, Paul O'Mahony, which showed that the average prisoner has been convicted about 15 separate times, that he has received five non-custodial sentences and was sentenced to prison on ten separate occasions.  This horrific profile is typical of both short-term and long-term prisoners.  Prison sentences will fail to prevent reoffending and may even contribute to the revolving door revolving even faster than heretofore, unless he reflects on the role of prison in the community.  The Minister has discovered that pithy soundbites on radio and television are no longer acceptable and that knee-jerk reactions of the type engaged in by him when in Opposition are less than constructive or helpful.  His hysterical outburst this evening was extraordinary.  I will not condemn him, rather I will leave it to the general public to judge.</P>
    <P>In the age of the computer it is unacceptable that the Department of Justice does not have sufficient statistical data to evaluate fully the various criminal justice system interventions.  We do not have information on all recorded crimes which can be related in a meaningful way to prosecutions and verdicts, penalties and early releases.  If the criminal justice system is to function <Col N="145" /> properly we must be able to analyse and determine whether a prison sentence imposed on a teenage criminal for a certain type of criminal offence is a more effective deterrent than a community service order.</P>
    <P>In the meantime our prisons are chaotic, being schools of criminal activity for some and a home from home for others and anything but an organised centre of detention or penal correction.  The challenge for the Minister is not to provide thousands of extra prison spaces but to operate institutions where rehabilitation and preparation for a return to society as well as punishment and deterrents are the order of the day.  The chaos and lack of organisation within the system will continue until the Minister takes a leaf from the book of the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, who decided to establish an independent prisons board as recommended in the Whitaker report.  The Minister has been silent on the issue of penal or prison reform.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months there has been an increase in the number of sex crimes.  The Minister made no reference to his proposals on domestic violence.  If he states that he will adhere to the concept of zero tolerance in this area we will support him.</P>
    <P>The peddling of the concept of zero tolerance by the Minister when in Opposition was a callous and cynical exploitation of the crime problem for cheap political gain.  The only beneficiaries were the Minister, his Fianna Fáil colleagues and sidekicks in the Progressive Democrats.  Following a murder in this jurisdiction last year the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, said that a serial killer was stalking the land and that the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, was in some way responsible.</P>
    <P>On mandatory sentencing, the Criminal Justice Bill is a blunt instrument which will tie the hands of the Judiciary by removing their discretion, one of the basic pillars of the democratic process.  In essence, mandatory sentences make bad law.</P>
    <P>The five months the Minister has been in office have been a damp squib when matched against his zealous attitude when in Opposition.  It appears that his fire and brimstone act when Opposition spokesperson has been shelved.  The jury is out on his performance to date.  What it has heard so far is not inspiring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Mayo)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  I thank in particular Deputy Perry with whom I shared time.  He is one of the new Members in the House and has a great grasp of a range of subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also thank the Minister for Justice for gracing us with his presence for a brief period.  Like his past performances, his contribution was long on rhetoric but short on specifics.  The amendment in his name calls on Dáil Éireann to note his determination and sets out the programme he intends to follow during the next four to five years.  This speaks for itself.  The amendment refers to the ongoing discussions taking place <Col N="146" /> with the Eastern Health Board with a view to expanding the range of drug treatment services available.  There is no reference to discussions with the Southern Health Board, the Western Health Board and so on, although approximately 80 per cent of crime is drug related.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann is asked to confirm the continuation of individual counselling for sentenced sex offenders.  Of the 250 persons incarcerated in our prisons for sex offences, ten are receiving treatment.  It is the Minister's intention to expand the service.  Does this mean that the number in receipt of treatment will increase from ten to 11, 20 or 30?</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann is also asked to endorse the recent decision by the Minister to establish a review group to examine the probation and welfare service which does extremely good work on a miserly budget of £12 million in deterring and heading off would be criminals.  It has been left to languish as the Cinderella of the Department.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann is further asked to commend the decision of the Minister to establish a crime forum and a crime council.  There is one murder per week in this jurisdiction by strangulation, stabbing or shooting, not to mention physical violence and public disorder.  The Minister's response is to establish a crime forum and a crime council to talk about the matter.  He has announced that it is his intention to publish a White Paper on Crime &mdash; a discussion document on sexual offences is also being prepared &mdash; and borrowed a number of Bills produced by the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, whom he derided when in Opposition.  These include the Courts Service Bill, which he said solemnly in his own pouting and pompous way would strip the Minister and the Department of their powers and functions, the Europol Bill and the Children Bill.</P>
    <P>What we are left with is threadbare legislation, the Criminal Justice Bill.  If a Bill was ever sterile and stillborn this is it.  It is unfortunate that the Minister is not present.  He is missing, like Lord Lucan, Shergar or the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>A mere five months ago the Minister made nine promises.  He promised to establish within two months of taking office a specialised organised crime unit and a specialised squad to deal with what he described as certain types of murder; to provide for the suspension of pub licences where drugs are found on the premises; to establish a specialist drug court, custodial detention centres for drug addicts and a community warden service; to provide for the provision of temporary accommodation immediately <Col N="147" />&mdash; as Deputy Owen said, 50 prisoners per day are being released from Mountjoy Prison to make room for incoming inmates &mdash; and to pursue the concept of zero tolerance which nobody understands.  There has not been one word about any of these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the day the Minister launched his magnum opus, the Criminal Justice Bill, on which he worked throughout the summer when he was invisible, five people charged with possession of £3 million worth of cannabis seized last week in Tallaght were released from the courts.  A mere five weeks ago Denis Mulligan was hauled before Court 44 presided over by Mr. Justice Smithwick. What happened?  He was refused bail, committed to Mountjoy but later released on bail of £350, and that for a seizure of £1.5 million.  Of course, with regard to the courts clerks issue, which the <Col N="148" /> Minister was informed was impending and must be rectified, he did nothing, indeed he blundered. First he signed a collective warrant which was invalid.  Over the weekend, having signed that and allowed further very serious cases to be struck downy &mdash; cases of grievous bodily harm, of offences against the person and against property &mdash; lo and behold, at the eleventh hour, he signed a second warrant, on that occasion an individual one.</P>
    <P>The Minister should get his act together and get a handle on his Department.  He is managing the most important Government Department, that charged with public safety.  He should be visible more frequently and more answerable.  As I said, like Lord Lucan, Shergar, Elvis or Albert while he may remain missing the day of reckoning is fast approaching.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Health and Safety Authority Funding.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to your office for selecting this important issue.  It is regrettable that it has taken the justifiable savage indignation of a High Court judge and the tragic fatality of a young building worker to provoke the current scrutiny of the adequacy of our health and safety legislation, whether fine levels are appropriate and enforcement is sufficient and whether an industry which is benefiting from an unprecedented boom is doing all it reasonably can be expected to do to safeguard the health and safety of its workforce.</P>
      <P>In the case of the building group, the subject of Mr. Justice Kelly's unprecedented castigation, Zoe Developments Limited, the answers to these questions sadly seem open and shut.  This company has continued on its careless ways after 12 convictions and three fatalities since 1991 and scarcely desires even the benefit of the doubt.  Mr. Justice Kelly referred to the company concerned as &ldquo;a corporate criminal&rdquo; and warned the principal director that &ldquo;the company was not entitled to make profits on the blood and lives of its workers&rdquo;.  Unfortunately not even that eminent judge's trenchant remarks, or the £100,000 conscience money extracted from the poor box will provide much solace for the family of the young man killed on the Charlotte Quay site.</P>
      <P>The alarming aspect of this controversy is that the trade unions involved with the building industry believe Zoe Developments Limited is not an exceptional case and that the protection of workers generally is not a sufficient priority in the industry.  They instance the reluctance of the Construction Industry Federation and its members to release construction workers for safety training. There are scant statements in existence from the CIF sanctioning the release of workers for safety courses.  Although workers are entitled to elect safety representatives under the legislation in many cases that is not facilitated by the employers.  The proliferation of bogus self-employed contractors on RCT1 certificates cutting corners for profit enhancement serves only to enhance this negligent climate.</P>
      <P>One of four recent collapses of scaffolding has taken place within metres of this House and, ironically, another took place adjacent to the headquarters of the Health and Safety Authority. Trade unions have drawn attention on several occasions to the incidence of accidents in the industry over the years.  Yet we are advised that the spend on safety is approximately half that per worker in Ireland compared to the United Kingdom.  More HSA personnel at the coalface are required on site inspections essentially because they are especially demanding at times of boom in the industry.  The fine levels are derisory.  One reads today of a fine of £500 being imposed following a fatality.  I am not sure how realistic it is to invite the HSA to more frequently submit to the jurisdiction of a higher court.  It is remarkable given the frequency and seriousness of transgressions that there is no role for the Garda in the area of safety.  Why does the Garda Síochána have a role if one cycles past a member at night with no light on one's bike, but if one cycles into an unprotected hole left by a contractor it is a civil matter and there is no role for the Garda?</P>
      <P>I am personally aware that the Health and Safety Authority has greatly modernised itself and availed of the potential of information technology to streamline the conduct of its business. However, I specifically ask the Minister to respond to the demand for additional resources for the HSA, to amend legislation on matters such as fines, to ensure that the industry is required to attach the higher premium to the safety and protection of its workers and to ensure the Garda have a role in certain circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to respond to the understandable position taken by the Deputy on the loss of life of a young man of 24 years of age on a site managed by Zoe Developments Limited.</P>
      <P>The first and perhaps most fundamental point is that there is a vast and comprehensive block of health and safety legislation which more than adequately meets the requirements necessary to protect our workforce and which conforms to all best international practices.  The Deputy will be aware that measures such as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the 1993 general application regulations and the 1995 construction regulations provide a solid legislative framework by which effective and co-ordinated management of all construction projects can be ensured and by which health and safety standards can be formed.</P>
      <P>The 1989 Act is the principal legislation dealing with occupational health and safety and it sets out in clear and unambiguous terms the responsibilities of employers and employees in relation to providing and maintaining a safe working environment.  What permeates this legislation and what must be emphasised over and over again is that it is the primary duty of every individual employer to identify, assess and manage the health and safety needs of his or her business.</P>
      <P>The 1995 construction regulations implement a European Union Directive concerning minimum safety and health requirements on temporary or mobile construction sites.  Those regulations constitute one of the most detailed pieces of legislation dealing with any one specific industry. Their purpose is to reduce accidents, fatalities and ill-health during the construction phase of the project and during building maintenance.</P>
      <P>Under those regulations construction work is now seen in broader terms, each undertaking is more a project than a job.  Like all projects this requires proper advance planning, preparation and assessment with effective management and co-ordination while on site.  Those regulations introduce an important concept, that of a chain of responsibility thus making health and safety an integral part of construction work from inception to completion.  This requires commitment from all involved in the sector, including clients, design professionals, contractors and workers.  In effect we are talking about a partnership approach in the workplace.</P>
      <P>The solution to preventing workplace accidents does not lie in changing legislation, it lies in changing attitudes.  It means moving from an attitude that accidents cannot be prevented and that they will happen.  Accidents can be prevented when employers accept responsibility for their actions and obligations, not just their moral but their legal obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Authority for Occupation Safety and Health, better known as the Health and Safety Authority, is responsible for the enforcement of all existing legislation providing for the <Col N="152" /> health and safety of workers.  That enforcement is carried out in a very proactive manner.  The Authority regularly reviews and focuses on those sectors where most accidents happen.  The construction sector is always given priority by the Authority with approximately 30 per cent of its resources devoted on an ongoing basis to enforcement in that sector, a figure which is disproportionate to the size of the workforce in the construction sector <i>vis-a-vis</i> the size of the workforce. That is a statistical fact.  Deputy Rabbitte has drawn a comparison between our Health and Safety Authority and the work of the Health and Safety Executive in the UK.  I wish to clarify the position.  He will be aware that the HSE in the UK has a wide range of functions in the area of public safety in relation to the railways, gas and nuclear industries which are not the responsibility of the Authority in this country.  Public safety functions absorb nearly half of the resources of the HSE.  That point was made in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> and I wanted to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>In relation to the resources available to the Authority to carry out its tasks, which was the net point raised by the Deputy, there has been a steady increase in the funding and staff allocated to the Authority over the last few years.  In 1990 Exchequer funding amounted to £2.3 million and in 1998 it will amount to £4.7 million.  That is in addition to the Authority's relatively small income from fees, etc.</P>
    <P>I recently secured Government sanction to enable the Authority to increase its total staff to 119 with effect from 1 January 1998.  That will represent an increase of 20 per cent in approximately three years and an overall increase of 55 per cent in the last eight years.  In addition, I have also recently received from the Authority a submission on its future staffing needs which is being studied by my officials.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment on the fact that cases of breaches of occupational health and safety legislation are brought before the District Court where the maximum applicable fine is £1,500.  The legislation also provides for fines on conviction on indictment for which no maximum monetary amounts are prescribed.  Convictions on indictment may also be punishable in certain circumstances by a term of imprisonment of up to two years.</P>
    <P>I stress I am satisfied that existing legislation and regulations are more than adequate to protect the health and safety of our workforce and I am also satisfied that the Authority is discharging its role properly.  I cannot stress enough that what I want to see changed and improved is the attitude of some employers to the issue of worker safety.  I want the message to go out loud and clear from Dáil Éireann this evening to companies that take shortcuts when dealing with the safety of their workers that they are dealing with a matter of life and death.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House.  On Tuesday, 4 November, an oil spillage was reported from the refinery in Cork Harbour.  Initially it was reported that three tonnes of heavy fuel oil had leaked and the leak was described as being quite small.  When I visited the area, however, it was quite obvious that more than three tonnes of oil had leaked.  Four days later, the estimate was revised to 25 tonnes and we still do not know the full extent of the spillage. We are being told it was somewhere between 20 and 100 tonnes, but some groups estimate that up to 300 tonnes of oil leaked that day.</P>
      <P>There is much public concern in the area around Graball Bay where most of the oil was deposited, that the full facts have not been disclosed and people do not know how much oil actually leaked. Up to last Sunday, 12 days after the spillage, some 24 dead birds had been found in the Nohoval and Rocky Bay areas.  There is serious concern at what is perceived to be a cover-up, although I do not think it is.  Answers have not been provided, however, and people do not know exactly what happened in Whitegate that day.</P>
      <P>Others questions concern why the oil leak was not detected, what monitoring procedures were in place and what pipeline testing procedures were in place.  These questions need to be answered.  While recognising the important role the oil refinery plays in our economy, we must also recognise the serious threat of oil as a pollutant and what impact a major leak like this could have in Cork Harbour in terms of tourism and local recreational facilities.</P>
      <P>The EPA is currently considering an application from the refinery for an INPC licence.  The emergency response procedure must be stated clearly in this operating licence.  A number of questions have arisen concerning the infrastructures at the refinery.  These include when the pipes that fractured were laid, how often are they replaced and how are these pipelines checked and monitored?  All these questions need to be answered.</P>
      <P>Do we need more State investment to upgrade the plant?  If so, I hope it will be made.  Questions that need to be asked of all major State industries include, what percentage of the running costs of the plant are spent on environmental concerns, and what percentage of capital investment has been expended on environmental protection?  These questions are asked of all major private sector industries when they are setting up.  We employ strict guidelines and criteria in terms of backing, and we must also be seen to apply these to our State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise that environmental concerns cannot be dealt with cheaply.  We need to build environmental costs into all our developments.  The Minister should allay public fears of another oil spillage and the facts surrounding the latest incident should be made known to the <Col N="154" /> people of Cork.  They are entitled to know that Cork Harbour and its environment will not be subject to such a negative impact in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about any oil spillage which occurs in our waters and the threat which such a spillage poses for our marine environment.  The recent incident at Whitegate could have had serious consequences but for the relatively small size of the spillage and the speed and efficiency of the clean-up operations.</P>
      <P>The Irish National Petroleum Corporation, Cork County Council, Cork Harbour Authority and the Environmental Protection Agency are directly responsible for the response to the Whitegate incident.  The Irish Marine Emergency Service of my Department provided advice and assistance, as requested.  While having no direct responsibility in the matter, IMES personnel were on hand at Whitegate to assist as necessary.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the incident my Department has kept in touch through the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre and the INPC, and is satisfied from the reports received that everything possible has been done in accordance with the Whitegate oil spill contingency plan.  This plan involved the deployment by the INPC of refinery personnel, outside organisations and other individuals in mobilising booms, the Port of Cork pollution barge and other emergency services, as well as tracking the oil on the water by the Port of Cork pilot boat, containing the oil at the jetty site, operating the computer model to identify future location of the oil, starting clean-up operations within the refinery, dealing with queries raised by or on behalf of the public, and visiting all beaches and accessible locations in the vicinity of the harbour.</P>
      <P>Since the incident, daily visits were made to all beaches in the harbour vicinity to check for any traces of pollution damage.  Oil washed up was promptly identified, reported, contained and removed as quickly as possible.  An ongoing survey by boat is also being operated in the harbour and its immediate environs.</P>
      <P>My Department is also satisfied from the reports received that the INPC and other agencies involved have shown due concern for the various interests which might be affected by this incident.  I understand a number of Irish refining company representatives attended a meeting with the residents of Graball Bay on 7 November at Crosshaven community centre.  A frank and open discussion took place during which a number of issues were discussed including the extent of damage to the shoreline, how and when it would be restored to its previous condition, how such an incident could occur, the difficulties raised by the limited access to the shoreline, the risks posed to fisheries and human health <i>via</i> the food chain, the quantity of oil, the need for volunteers to observe damage to sea birds, the effectiveness of the initial response to the incident, the intrusion of the clean-up activities on the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> I understand that the refinery undertook to progress a number of action points and agreed to meet the residents again at a later date to discuss overall progress.  While the affected area is important locally, it does not include any sites of known nature conservation importance, special protection areas or national heritage areas.  It is continuously exposed to tidal movements and climatic conditions which should assist natural remediation of the area.  It is predicted that the levels of mortality for fish life, birds or mammals will not be significant.  Inter-tidal flora and fauna in a concentrated area of approximately one kilometre has been impacted.  I am advised that once the clean-up is complete and natural biodegradation has occurred, the area will re-colonise naturally over time.</P>
    <P>All beach clean-up activities have been carried out with the underlying objective of minimising further damage to the natural environment. Future planned clean-up activities will be scheduled around the tidal cycle to minimise the impact on the environment.</P>
    <P>I note the corrective actions which have been taken by the INPC to prevent similar incidents in future.  I understand the damaged section of pipe has been removed and, following consultations with the EPA inspector, a detailed metallurgical examination will be carried out to identify the failure mechanism.  The results of this will determine the extent and nature of the corrective action required to prevent a recurrence.  I intend to monitor the matter and address any issues relevant to my Department, particularly, in the light of the investigations initiated and currently being carried out by the responsible authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague Deputy Bradford.</P>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity of raising this important matter in the House.  The decision of Irish Ferries to terminate its ferry service from Cork to Roscoff, which has been operating for 14 years, is a detrimental step and will have serious effects on the tourism economy of the south west region.  This is a clear signal demoting such services to and from the region.  It is of paramount importance that direct services with the Continent be maintained by all means.</P>
      <P>What will the Cork-Kerry tourism region receive from the extra £5 million recently announced by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to attract more tourists from EU countries?  In view of the withdrawal of this service, I urge the Minister to make a substantial amount of that £5 million available to the Cork and Kerry region to offset any damage inflicted on the tourism potential of the south-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Ferries connection with Cork goes back to 1820 through B &amp; I and the City of Cork Steam Package Company.  Almost 180 years of <Col N="156" /> association has now been brought to an abrupt end.  If the Minister fails to get Irish Ferries to restore the service, he should consider the construction of an airport in Bantry, the heart of the Cork and Kerry tourism region.  There should be a direct flight from the Continent to that airport. If the Minister cannot convince Irish Ferries to change its attitude and maintain the service from Cork to Roscoff, he must try to get an alternative.</P>
    <P>Any erosion of services to an area which relies on tourism will have devastating results for its economy.  I urge the Minister to act before it is too late.  We cannot live on fresh air and cold water; we need our tourism economy.  I urge the Minister to convince Irish Ferries to restore the service or to construct an airport for my maternal town of Bantry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped to start by saying I agreed fully with Deputy Sheehan but when he mentioned overflying the towns of Mallow and Fermoy on the way to Bantry, I had to rethink my position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The 50 per cent reduction of carrier space between Cork and continental Europe is a serious blow to tourism.  It is ironic that next summer, when participants in one of the world's major sporting events, the Tour de France, leave Cork harbour by ferry to travel to France, we will lose a major ferry service into Cork.  Pressure must be exerted by the relevant Government authorities, particularly the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, to ensure that Cork and the south-west region will not lose out as a result of the vastly reduced numbers of people coming to the area.  I saw the benefits of the Cork to continental Europe service during the summer months when thousands of motorists passed through the towns of Fermoy and Mallow.  This had a positive impact on the tourism industry in those areas.</P>
      <P>Irish Ferries made its decision for commercial reasons.  I do not expect the Minister to reverse that decision but I appeal to him and to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to do everything possible to ensure that the long-term future of the tourism industry in Cork and the south-west region is not affected and that it will be protected and developed by other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and I appreciate their concerns about this matter.  I will convey the views expressed tonight to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  I am sure he will bear in mind the impact this decision by Irish Ferries will have on tourism in the south-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Ferries has, as part of its rationalisation process, decided to reduce the number of ports serviced on the Ireland France route.  Until now the company operated out of two Irish ports, Cork and Rosslare, to three French ports, Le Havre, <Col N="157" /> Cherbourg and Roscoff.  The decision was taken on a commercial basis by a privately owned company and I have no function in the matter. However, I welcome the company's continued commitment to the continental route.</P>
    <P>Maintenance of direct maritime links with continental Europe remains an important and essential strategic objective.  It is my policy not only to ensure the maintenance of this link but also to expand services where possible and commercially viable.  In terms of quality service provision, it is important to note that the introduction of the new vessel represents a significant upgrading. Passengers on the route to and from Ireland will welcome increased standards of comfort for what is a relatively long journey, particularly for families.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to the shipping sector under the Action Plan for the Millennium.  The plan accords full recognition to the strategic importance of our shipping industry and the development of a comprehensive policy for the industry. This commitment is given concrete expression in the Department's strategy statement for 1997-99.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been undertaken or are under active consideration, including fiscal concessions such as reliefs introduced in the 1996 Finance Act.  These enable vessels dry leased by Irish interests to qualify for 10 per cent corporation profits tax while double ring-fencing against tax based ship leasing has been removed.  A second initiative is the refund of employer PRSI for seafarers.  The provisions introduced in the social welfare regulations in 1997 represent considerable cost savings for Irish registered and controlled ships.  Approval from the European Commission for this scheme has been sought and is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>A third initiative is seafarer taxation.  This issue is being discussed with the Minister for Finance by myself and by officials of both Departments in the run up to the forthcoming budget and Finance Bill.  A fourth initiative deals with seafarer training.  The shipboard training subsidy introduced in 1996 has helped to secure essential training placements for students at Cork Institute of Technology.  These measures were taken to try to improve the situation for shipping companies.  A task force to examine all aspects of seafarer training with representation from those engaged in the shipping sector, including shipowners and trade unions together with education and training interests, will commence its work shortly.</P>
    <P>A final initiative is the duty free campaign.  Several sectors of the Irish economy, including passenger ferries, have expressed concern at the possible effect of the abolition of the intra-EU duty and tax free sales on 1 July 1999 and adverse effects on revenue, employment and profitability. An initiative under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach involves a number of key Departments and agencies.  The objective is to maximise support in EU member states to persuade the Commission to rethink the abolition <Col N="158" /> policy and to highlight the issue at every available opportunity in relevant fora.  The previous Government took a similar line when trying to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy is fully compatible with Commissioner Neil Kinnock's communication, Towards a New Maritime Strategy, published in March 1996.  It is principally concerned with the competitiveness of the EU shipping sector, establishes a definite link between substandard ships and unfair competition and emphasises the importance of training for EU seafarers.  I am satisfied that the pursuit of this policy rather than the direct intervention in the affairs of individual companies offers the best prospect for enhancing the competitiveness of the service provided and the sustainable development of the shipping sector, including ferry services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to respond to this important matter.</P>
      <P>The Irish Air Corps is at a critical crossroads in attempting to service and develop the range of vital functions which Ireland as a marine nation and developing economy is coming to depend upon more and more.  As we stand at this crossroads, where the options are to develop the Air Corps or subcontract its services, the Minister is engaging in a botched attempt to deal with the very real problems involved in maintaining staff morale and staff pay by trying to introduce an incentive scheme targeted at 24 of the flying officers in the Air Corps.  Instead of approaching this issue in an all embracing manner with a plan that would underscore confidence in the ability of the Air Corps to develop these services, the Minister has instead whipped up a gale force wind and caused serious disquiet with a scheme which will do little or nothing to maintain and develop this service for the future.  It leads me to question this Government's commitment to the long-term future of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the offer and the manner of introduction of a so-called retention gratuity to Air Corps pilots by the Minister has, as I predicted on two previous occasions during Question Time, been met with resistance and anger by those to whom the offer was made last week.  This offer is seen as divisive and morale lowering, nor is it seen that it will achieve its goal.  There are serious questions to answer about the lack of negotiation with representative organisations in relation to this offer which raises serious questions for the Defence Forces as a whole about the impact of this type of incentive offer within the forces generally.  Where does the scheme of things begin and end?  In five years what decision will be taken in relation to remuneration of this specially selected group?  What is the impact of a member of the team being paid more than the leader of the team?  Will <Col N="159" /> those who refuse this offer be allowed to leave if they wish to do so?  I know that all 24 pilots, to whom the offer was made, have asked the Department to continue discussions with the pilots' representative organisations and to change the closing date.  If we are serious about continuing the key role of the Air Corps and I, for one, am, and if we want to enable it to carry out a variety and developing range of functions, then a whole series of actions must be undertaken by the Minister.  If this Government is happy to push for a contracted out marine search and rescue service and air Garda pursuit service, for example, then we are already being driven down that road by the Minister.  If, on the other hand, we want an Air Corps capable of meeting current and emerging needs with high staff morale, a career structure for all, proper management and a training cycle that ensures we have enough pilots but is not unduly punitive to pilots in terms of years of service, then a comprehensive response is needed that involves much more than a retention gratuity of this type.</P>
    <P>People join the Defence Forces for a variety of reasons.  They join to be part of a service to this country, to have a worthwhile career and to be part of a well paid team.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight some of the problems which have been experienced in relation to this offer.  A press release was issued without any discussion with the Air Corps.  The working group seems to have fallen apart.  There are a series of unanswered questions which were put by the representative organisation as far back as 7 August 1997. At the Air Corps RACO AGM on 23 October a motion was passed rejecting this scheme, and yet the offer was still made on 5 November 1997 to pilots of captain and commandant rank with a closing date of 16 November 1997.  This offer excluded a number of people who one would have expected to have been included.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to develop a long-term plan to rectify the situation.  This would include re-examining the number of trainee pilots taken annually, looking at contract and pension conditions, personnel management in the Air Corps and a number of other areas which need examination, including the purchase of equipment for the Air Corps and improved working conditions. Some 60 pilots and air crew are currently working in appalling crowded prefab accommodations, described many years ago as &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister visited Baldonnel today and I hope it is an indication of his commitment to the service there.  A serious situation has arisen in the Air Corps which requires an indepth examination of the issues which I have outlined.  The attempted solution is far from satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael spokesperson on Defence, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for raising this matter.  I am overwhelmed by the confidence that she places in <Col N="160" /> me to create all these problems in the four weeks I have been in office.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This presents an opportunity for me to clarify the position in relation to the service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots.  Far from whipping up a gale force wind, I am a calming, reassuring type of person and I will take the necessary steps to solve this matter.</P>
      <P>There is no policy of blanket retention and no Air Corps pilot has been refused permission to retire.  Because of the high number of Air Corps pilots who have applied for permission to retire recently it has not been possible to grant them the retirement date which they sought.  Every effort is being made to facilitate personnel taking the operational requirements of the Air Corps into account.</P>
      <P>Because of the current upturn in the civil aviation industry and the resulting attractive financial packages on offer from civilian airline operators, the number of Air Corps pilots seeking to retire has risen sharply.  The Air Corps could not sustain full operational capacity if the loss of experienced personnel were to continue at the 1997 level.</P>
      <P>Rather than imposing compulsory retention on such personnel, which was the general position up to 1993, it is proposed that the service commitment scheme will be offered instead.  Such financial incentives are not uncommon in Defence Forces in other countries where similar difficulties exist in retaining qualified personnel.  To put it into context, we are not unique or alone in relation to experiencing a difficulty in retaining military pilots during a commercial aviation boom.</P>
      <P>The scheme will apply to experienced personnel who are rated on and flying the Gulfstream IV, Beechcraft, CASA, Dauphin, Squirrel and Defender aircraft which are the principal operational aircraft of the Air Corps.  The number of officers engaged on flying duties or direct management of these aircraft represents about one-third of all flying officers in the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The scheme is being introduced with a view to retaining senior pilots who have received extensive training at public expense and who occupy key appointments in areas such as search and rescue, maritime surveillance, Garda air support and ministerial air transport and, consequently, are very attractive to commercial operators who, because of the upturn in the airline industry, experience difficulties in recruiting experienced pilots.  In fact the situation has been reached where civilian operators are in competition with one another to recruit well trained experienced pilots, such as those in the Air Corps.  The scheme is designed to strike a balance between the demand of the commercial environment and the need to exercise responsibility in relation to public service expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> A payment of £10,000 per annum will be payable to those officers who undertake to remain in service for a further three, four or five year period.  In addition, personnel who commit to serve for four years will receive a terminal bonus of £2,000 and those who opt for a five year term will receive a terminal bonus of £5,000.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have met the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers in relation to this scheme on a number of occasions, most recently this morning.  The association has put forward some proposals in <Col N="162" /> relation to the scheme and I am pleased that I have been able to take some of these on board.</P>
    <P>I am looking forward to completing the negotiations in the context of this measure.  It is not possible to extend the commitment in this area across the board but we are doing everything possible to find a balance which will retain pilots who are needed for operations and, at the same time, not expose the public purse to undue demands.</P>

      <P>Where married couples are jointly assessed for tax, the income of each spouse is combined and then assessed for tax on the basis of the appropriate married allowances, bands and rates.  Joint assessment is beneficial to married couples as the allowances and bands available to a married couple, which are twice those available to a single person, are transferable between the spouses.  In the circumstance the Deputy refers to, it is appropriate to add the income which one spouse receives in respect of the carer's allowance to the income of the other spouse for tax purposes where the married couple are being taxed on the basis of joint assessment.</P>
      <P>As regards the taxation of the carer's allowance, it is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  In line with this principle the majority of social welfare payments, including the carer's allowance, are therefore reckonable as income for tax purposes.  Treating such payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  Accordingly, income from the carer's allowance received by one spouse is added to income, if any, received by the other spouse, for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that either the social welfare recipient or the recipient's spouse has in the particular tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the carer's allowance, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the carer's allowance itself.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my speech at the annual meetings of the IMF/World Bank, the Govenment believes that the Bank and the Fund are to be congratulated on the progress that has been made on the implementation of the HIPC Initiative.  We very much welcome that decisions have been made on Uganda, Bolivia and Burkina Faso and that preliminary consideration of a group of other countries <Col N="164" /> is well under way.  This is no mean achievement, given the complexity of the problems affecting the indebted countries and the number of diversity of the players who are party to each decision.</P>
      <P>We also welcome the flexibility with which the initiative is being implemented.  It is important that this flexibility be used to ensure that the maximum number of eligible countries benefit from the initiative, and as early as possible.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned that the initiative must offer a real exit from excessive debt to the countries concerned and allow them to regenerate their capacity for economic and social development.</P>
      <P>In short, Ireland's position is informed by a number of key principles as follows: the number of beneficiary countries should be maximised; the level of debt relief to be delivered should be as generous as possible in each case: expeditious decision-making and implementation should drive the process; flexibility and pragmatism should inform each decision; and the level of debt relief provided should offer a real exit from the burden of debt.</P>
      <P>I will continue to emphasise these considerations in my dealings with the IMF and World Bank in connection with the debt issue.</P>

      <P>The 1998 Estimates are based on an expected inflation rate of about 2 per cent next year.  The ESRI in their most recent forecasts also suggest that inflation could be 2 per cent in 1998.</P>
      <P>Inflation in Ireland continues to be very moderate.  In the first ten months of 1997 the average year-on-year increase in consumer prices was just 1.4 per cent and the average for the year as a whole is now expected to be about 1.5 per cent. This compares with an original forecast at the start of the year that inflation would be about 2.2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some commentators have expressed concerns that inflation will increase next year, there is evidence to suggest that a number of factors have played a substantial role in maintaining low inflation during 1997.  These factors will continue to have an influence next year.  Strong investment is increasing the Irish economy's capacity to sustain strong non-inflationary economic growth. Greater competition in all sectors of the economy will continue to subdue prices.  Partnership 2000, for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness should restrain the potential for wage inflation in the non-traded sector.  Externally, the international inflationary environment was subdued in <Col N="165" /> 1997 and is expected to remain so in 1998.  In addition it is possible that some Irish importers have switched to alternative cheaper sources for their products; this should have a mitigating effect on Irish inflation next year.</P>

      <P>I met representatives of First National Building Society and the EBS on 16 October 1997 and Irish Nationwide on 20 October 1997.  Each of these societies had asked to meet me to discuss the question of possible amendment to section 102 of the Building Societies Act, 1989 which, as Deputies will be aware, prevents any single investor from holding more than 15 per cent of the shares of a newly-converted building society for a period of five years after conversion.</P>
      <P>I informed the societies that I had no plans to initiate any change to section 102 and that I was not aware of any proposals from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in this regard.  This remains the position.  I should add that any amendment of section 102 of the Building Societies Act, 1989 is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>I did not announce a post-budget spending figure on the publication of the 1998 Abridged Estimates because I considered that this was a matter proper to budget day itself, especially as there is only a short time between publication of the Abridged Estimates and budget day.</P>
      <P>The statement I issued on the publication of the Estimates set out very comprehensively how the Government's spending plans for 1998 affect its current and capital expenditure targets.  In the statement I indicated that budget day spending measures may increase current expenditure, as defined in the Government's programme, above the 1.8 per cent figure reflected in the Abridged Estimates, but that I am confident that the postbudget figure will remain well below the 4 per cent limit provided in our programme.  I also indicated that I am determined that whatever happens after the 1998 budget, for example by way of unavoidable additional spending, the 1998 outturn for net current spending will be below the 4 per cent limit.</P>

      <P>A milk quota is viewed as a non-wasting capital asset, subject to the capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax codes.  If expenditure on the purchase of milk quotas was allowed as a deductible expense for income tax purposes, the logical outcome would be that the proceeds from the sale of a quota should be treated as income and, therefore, liable for income tax.  At present, the proceeds are treated as a capital receipt and are subject to capital gains tax which can give much more favourable tax treatment because of indexation relief.</P>

      <P>The amount of unallocated lottery funds at the end of 1996 was £43.6 million.  A reserve is maintained in the national lottery fund for two reasons.</P>
      <P>First, given that lottery revenues cannot be predicted with certainty it is necessary to maintain a sufficient reserve to meet any shortfall in lottery revenues required to cover the costs of ongoing lottery programmes.  In practice, the allocations published in the Book of Estimates are contingent upon estimated lottery sales in the year in question.  In the absence of a sufficient reserve, it would be necessary either to transfer funding of lottery programmes to the Exchequer or to curtail or cancel programmes in the event of lottery income not materialising.  Such an eventuality could seriously damage the credibility of the beneficiary fund.</P>
      <P>Second, the maintenance of a healthy reserve can enable the fund to finance major projects of capital nature from time to time.  Such a &ldquo;flag-ship&rdquo; project could help in promoting the image of the national lottery.</P>

    <P>In my statement on the publication of the Estimates, I indicated the Government is determined that whatever happens during 1998 by way of unavoidable additional costs, the 1998 outturn will be below the 4 per cent limit set out in its programme.  One of my priorities will be to ensure that adequate administrative mechanisms for managing and controlling public spending are in place to ensure that the limits on spending set out in our programme are adhered to, not just in 1998 but for the life of this Government.</P>
    <P>Setting a specific limit on public spending growth is a very effective tool for managing and controlling public expenditure.  However, if the political will exists, as it does in the case of this Government, to ensure adherence to these limits, the need for higher legislative controls along the lines of the New Zealand Fiscal Responsibility Act, 1994 is not so pressing.  This is not to say that the process of public expenditure management should not be subject to continuous rigorous appraisal.  Any means of further developing and strengthening the process will always be considered by the Government.  Any studies of the issue will, I assure you, be very carefully considered.</P>
    <P>In this regard the Government's programme indicates that placing &ldquo;Substantial emphasis on quality and effectiveness in public expenditure programmes&rdquo; will be a key policy priority.</P>
    <P>In settling the 1998 Estimates, the Government gave detailed consideration to the expenditure allocations.  Ensuring that programmes are run as efficiently and as effectively as possible formed a major part of that consideration.</P>
    <P>However, it is also important that an emphasis on quality and effectiveness is built into the whole expenditure process if the commitment in the Government's programme is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in July, the Taoiseach announced the Government had agreed a schedule of expenditure reviews to be carried out over the next 12 months as part of a three-year programme of such reviews.  Continuing review of public expenditure programmes is a central part of the public sector reforms being introduced under the strategic management initiative.</P>
    <P>The aims of these programme reviews are: (a) to provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each programme; (b) to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between spending programmes; and (c) to ensure that the public get good value for money.  The reviews are to be carried out jointly by individual Departments and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>As well as the public expenditure reviews which I have just outlined, arrangements are also in place for conducting value-for-money assessments of domestic spending.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> The Comptroller and Auditor General, under the provisions of section 9 of Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, is empowered to carry out specific examinations as he considers it appropriate in relation to economy and efficiency in the use of public moneys.  The effectiveness of certain management systems &mdash; the systems, procedures and practices used by a Department to evaluate the effectiveness of its operations &mdash; may also be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  These examinations are what are known as value for money examinations, and the Comptroller and Auditor General has completed and published 18 reports of such studies to date which have provided an extremely useful examination of a wide range of expenditure programmes.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993 also places a responsibility on accounting officers of Government Departments and offices to exercise economy and efficiency in the use of resources so that value for money is obtained.  Accounting officers are answerable before the Committee of Public Accounts for the use of resources under their control.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing arrangements for managing and controlling public expenditure are adequate.  However, as I have outlined, developments are taking place in this regard under the strategic management initiative which will improve and strengthen the process of expenditure control.</P>

      <P>It is accepted on all sides of the House that if Ireland is to remain competitive in a changing environment, we must adapt our corporate tax system to reflect new and emerging market conditions. Much of our employment growth is being generated by the services sector and there is a general consensus that the retention of a preferential corporation tax rate for manufacturing is not a tenable proposition in the long run.</P>
      <P>In May of this year the previous Government announced plans to introduce a single 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax for trading profits and a higher 25 per cent rate for non-trading profits on the basis that this would be phased in over the coming years to eventually replace the current regime.  These plans have been notified to the EU Commission as is customary with decisions relating to the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing.  Discussions have been taking place with the Commission on various aspects of the change, although the particular rate of corporation tax is not an issue in these ongoing discussions.</P>
      <P>While the present Government is committed to the introduction of a single low corporate tax rate for trading profits, it has not yet decided what the rate ultimately will be.  This issue will be considered by the Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that immediately on publication of the tribunal report, I requested the Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with my Department, to carry out a review of their existing powers, which are substantial, in the light of the findings of the tribunal.  That review is in progress.</P>
      <P>The last major change in Revenue powers was given effect to in the 1992 Finance Act, and included reporting arrangements for domestic institutions in relation to the opening of foreign bank accounts by Irish residents.  Revenue powers were further extended in 1993, and penalties for tax evasion were significantly increased, in conjunction with the introduction of the tax amnesty. The 1995 Finance Act also introduced a provision, section 172, to which the Deputy's question appears to refer, which obliges an auditor or tax adviser who in the course of his or her normal work for a client company becomes aware of certain material tax offences committed by the company, to communicate particulars of the offences to the company and request it to either rectify the situation or report the offences to the Revenue Commissioners within six months after the communication.</P>
      <P>If the company does not do so the person is obliged to cease to act for the company as auditor or as tax adviser for up to three years or until the matter has been rectified, if that is earlier.  An auditor who is required to resign under the section must notify the company and send a copy of the notification to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputies that if the present review of Revenue powers indicates that additional powers are required and these are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective, they will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 45, 69, 81 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>The decision on who will participate in the third stage of economic and monetary union (EMU) will be made early next May, in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 109j of the Maastricht Treaty.  The Council of Ministers, ECOFIN, will assess whether each member state fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency, on the basis of convergence reports from the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute. ECOFIN will recommend its findings to the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, who will, after receiving the opinion of the European Parliament, confirm which member states fulfil the conditions.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom has an opt-out from the provisions on EMU, under a Protocol attached to the Maastricht Treaty.  Ireland did not seek any such opt-out.  Under the terms of the Protocol, the UK has notified the Council of Ministers that it does not intend to move to the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999.  Consequently, the United Kingdom is under no obligation to move to the third stage.  The UK may, however, reverse its notification at any time after the beginning of that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Chancellor of the Exchequer in his statement to the House of Commons on 27 October last made it clear that, barring some unforeseen change in economic circumstances, the UK will not be participating in EMU during the lifetime of the present Westminster Parliament.  However, the Chancellor stated that, if a <Col N="175" /> single currency is successful, and the economic case for Britain is clear and unambiguous, the UK should be part of it.  Therefore, the UK Government has for the first time stated that in principle British membership of a successful single currency would be beneficial to Britain and to Europe.  The UK Government has also indicated a determination to prepare intensively for the introduction of the single currency.</P>
    <P>The Chancellor of the Exchequer also said that it is in the UK national interest for the single currency to work.  In particular, the UK will use its position during its EU Presidency to play a full part in ensuring a smooth launch of the single currency.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has welcomed the overall positive UK attitude towards the euro and its determination to prepare intensively for the introduction of the single currency.  I, too, welcome the constructive approach being adopted by the British Government.</P>
    <P>The British Chancellor set out five economic tests to be met by the UK Government to recommend membership of EMU to the Westminster Parliament and to the British people.  These included economic convergence, flexibility to cope with change, the effect on investment, the impact of the financial services industry, and whether it is good for employment.  These were used to make an assessment as to whether or not the UK Government would exercise their opt-out &mdash; a situation which does not arise in Ireland's case.  The Chancellor concluded that EMU membership by the UK would yield significant benefits to the UK economy in terms of investment, growth and jobs.  However, he has decided that the UK is not at the present time in a position to consider EMU membership from 1 January 1999, reflecting the current cyclical divergence of the UK economy from that of prospective EMU members.</P>
    <P>Ireland, on the other hand, has over several years demonstrated sustainable and settled convergence with likely euro zone participants.  On this basis, Ireland's participation in EMU from 1 January 1999 is entirely justified.  Ireland's strong growth over recent years reflects the fundamental strength of the Irish economy and the acceleration in Ireland's trend growth rate.  Inflationary pressures in the Irish economy remain subdued, with inflation forecast to be no more than 1.5 per cent for 1997, one of the lowest rates in the EU. Inflation in the UK is currently running at 3.7 per cent.  Adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact, together with the intensification of the Single Market consequent on EMU, will accelerate the ongoing process of economic convergence.</P>
    <P>While a decision by the UK to enter EMU would have positive aspects for the Irish economy, it is a matter for the UK Government to exercise, as they wish, the discretion they are afforded by the Treaty.  My priority remains ensuring that Ireland qualifies for EMU and will take part in the third stage from the beginning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> When the Maastricht Treaty received the endorsement of the Irish people, this was given without qualification or any provision for Ireland to opt out from the provisions for economic and monetary union.  Membership of EMU, irrespective of what the UK does, will on balance be of benefit for Ireland &mdash; an assessment borne out in studies by both the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council.  The possibility of sterling volatility <i>vis-a-vis</i> the euro was a major element of the ESRI study of the implications of EMU for Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards Mr. Kenneth Clarke's remarks, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the hypothetical movements of another member state's currency.  It should be recalled that, in addition to the requirements to co-ordinate economic policies and to avoid excessive deficits, the Treaty on European Union requires all non-participating member states to treat exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest.  As the UK Chancellor's statement makes clear, the UK is now committed to a path of sustainable economic convergence with a view to eventual EMU membership.</P>
    <P>Ireland approaches EMU from a position of considerable strength.  The priority now is to prepare for successful participation.</P>
    <P>The single most important contribution that Government can make to securing Ireland's international competitiveness is through its management of the economy.  By ensuring the Government's budget is in broad balance over the economic cycle, by allowing only moderate growth in public expenditure, by reducing the burden of taxation on labour in the economy, and by continuing to support the social partnership approach to economic and social policy which has helped secure moderation in wage growth in the economy, the Government will remain focused on the intensification of an internationally competitive environment for enterprise in the Irish economy in EMU which is the key to successful participation in EMU.</P>

      <P>As has been pointed out to this House before, the abolition of duty free sales for intra-EU travel is not proposed.  The decision has already been taken and enacted into Community law.  Ireland continues to raise this matter at various EU Council meetings, but there are no proposals to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> This decision to end duty free facilities for intra-community travel can only be reversed by unanimous agreement at Council, following a proposal from the Commission.  The Commission continue to repeat that they are not prepared to put any such proposals to the Council for any extension beyond 30 June 1999.  In the absence of a proposal from the Commission, duty free sales will end.</P>
    <P>However, following concern on the possible impact &mdash; which has been spearheaded by Ireland &mdash; the Commission is being pressed to conduct an EU-wide study into the consequence of implementing this decision that has already been taken.  In order to persuade the Commission to put any new proposals to the Council it will be necessary to convince them of the negative impact the decision will have.  It will also be necessary to have widespread support from other member states.  This will require an EU-wide study into the consequences of ending duty free sales.</P>
    <P>As well as continuing to press for an EU-wide study to be undertaken, I have also commissioned a study by consultants to assess the consequences for Ireland of ending the duty free facility.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners they fully agree with the views expressed by the President of the High Court about the need for early action by Revenue in cases where individuals or companies default on their tax obligations.</P>
      <P>Where companies experience cash-flow difficulties they can quickly run up a sizeable arrear of tax.  I understand that, unless specific arrangements are made with Revenue to secure payment, Revenue will move speedily to take enforcement action.</P>
      <P>However, the need for speedy action in such cases has to be balanced against the problems that can arise for genuine businesses.  Revenue have indicated that, once they are satisfied that a company is capable of paying arrears of tax as well as current taxes as they fall due, they are prepared to consider proposals to discharge the arrears of tax by the company to survive.  Such instalments carry interest at a rate significantly higher than commercial interest rates.</P>
      <P>In the normal course efforts to secure payments in cases in default will have been made through standard enforcement measures, such as the referral of the case to the Revenue Sheriff, before liquidation is considered.</P>
      <P>In the particular case before the court the appointment of a liquidator by the court was sought because it was felt that the particular circumstances of the case justified such action.  I am satisfied from my discussions with the Revenue Commissioners that the overall approach they are following in regard to tax collection and enforcement is a balanced and effective one, and has indeed proved highly successful.  Procedures are of course kept under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that, by State banks, Deputy Stanton means ACC, ICC and TSB Banks.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will recall, the question of the future structure of the State banking sector has been under review by successive Governments since around 1990.  That a decision is still pending is a reflection of the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved.  One of these issues is the fact that any initiative for changing the present status of TSB Bank must come from the trustees of the bank &mdash; as Minister for Finance, I can only authorise such a change, subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  To date, I have not received any formal proposal to this end from the Trustees but, if I do, I shall give it my full consideration.</P>
      <P>However, in the short time since I assumed office, I have had the position of ACC and ICC Banks reviewed and, in this, I have had the benefit of the views which my predecessor sought from both banks on the issue.  In the light of this review, I hope shortly to be in a position to make recommendations to the Government on a framework within which consultations with stakeholders on the future of ACC and ICC Banks can take place.  I can assure the Deputy that it is my intention that my recommendations will constitute a well balanced stragegic approach to this issue.</P>
      <P>As regards consultancy services, the provision of £1 million in my Department's Vote for 1998 relates exclusively to the consultancy services which the State will need to engage to advise on the restructuring of the State banks should the Government decide to proceed on this matter.  I would, however, like to draw the Deputies' attention to the fact that, in recent years, a significant provision has been made in the Vote each year for this purpose but, so far, none of these provisions was availed of because no decision was taken to proceed with restructuring.  However, if a decision so to proceed is taken soon, I would expect that significant expenditure on consultancy services will be incurred in 1998.  Given the processes of decision-making and consultation that will be involved in this very complex issue, it would not be useful to set out a timetable for progress at this juncture.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to change the existing rules on the taxation of farm land leases between family members to that pertaining to leases between unrelated parties to a lease; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under section 10 of the 1985 Finance Act, there is an exemption from income tax in respect of the first £4,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than five years and in respect of £6,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than seven years.  The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 55 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming.</P>
      <P>These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees.  In this context, &ldquo;qualifying lessee&rdquo; specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives.  A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife.  A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendant.  The restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure without which the relief would be open to manipulation with spurious arrangements being set up, such as the passing back to the lessee of rent on which tax relief had been claimed by both.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to point out that in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as by gift or sale, very generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs already apply.</P>

      <P>I am arranging to circulate with this reply a copy of the Community Support Framework mid-term review package, as agreed between the Government and the European Commission and as adopted by the CSF Monitoring Committee on 29 July 1997.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will see, included in the review package is a provision that the CSF Monitoring Committee will review progress on the national conference centre, the peat power station, Biomass Blanchardstown, the National Gallery and Luas in the spring of 1998 with a view to deciding whether funds should be decommitted from those projects if sufficient progress on them is not being achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> This is simply a precaution which will enable the Structural Funds for the projects concerned to be redeployed to other projects or measures within the CSF in sufficient time if any of them should look unlikely to be completed within the time allowed under the current round.  If Structural Funds available to Ireland under the CSF are not committed and spent before the expiry of the current round they would be lost to Ireland.</P>
    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX 1</P>
    <P Just="Center">CSF Mid-Term Review Package for the agreement of the CSF Monitoring Committee</P>
    <P>
      <i>Introduction</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Community Support 1994-99 (CSF) for Ireland stipulates that a mid-term assessment be undertaken by the Monitoring Committee after the third year of implementation so that any adjustments required can be made.  In carrying out this mid-term review, the CSF and its constituent operational programmes were subject to mid-term evaluations by independent evaluators. The decisions in the mid-term review have been informed by these evaluations and the views emerging from discussions at Monitoring Committee meetings on the evaluations.  They have also been informed by the Commission's Priorities for the adjustment of Structural Fund programmes to the end of 1999 and by a report of the European Parliament on Community Structural Funding for Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Strategic Priorities</i>
    </P>
    <P>The CSF Mid-Term evaluation concluded that to date the CSF "must be accounted a significant success".  The Evaluator found, however, that a number of apparent shortcomings emerged.  It is acknowledged, therefore, that the broad balance of the CSF is correct and that it represents the most appropriate strategy for the use of Structural Funds to achieve the CSF central objectives of</P>
    <P>&mdash; ensuring the best long-term return for the economy by increasing output, economic potential and long-term jobs</P>
    <P>&mdash; reintegrating the long-term unemployed and those at high risk of becoming so into the economic mainstream.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> It is recognised that some adjustments are necessary to enhance the effectiveness of the CSF interventions at the mid point of the current round.  These include financial adjustments and improvements in monitoring and implementing arrangements.  As no additional Structural Funds ar being made available to Ireland in the mid-term review and as the Exchequer, due to the fiscal requirements for membership of EMU including the Stability and Growth Pact and other considerations, is not in a position to provide additional resources any reallocation of funding will have to be financed by way of savings within the operational programmes.</P>
    <P>Extensive negotiations have taken place between the Irish Authorities and European Commission on a mid-term review package.  The negotiations were informed by:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the conclusions and recommendations of the OP Evaluators, the Regional Impact Evaluator and the CSF Evaluator,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the views of the monitoring committees on the evaluation findings as expressed at their special meetings,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Commission's guidelines on "Priorities for the Adjustment of Structural Funds Programmes to the end of 1999"</P>
    <P>&mdash;the anticipated development gap which will face Ireland Post 1999, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;a report on Community Structural assistance for Ireland adopted by the European Parliament at its Plenary Session in December 1996.</P>
    <P>The main priorities for additional resources which have been identified in those negotiations are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;National Roads</P>
    <P>&mdash;Industry Research and Development</P>
    <P>&mdash;Long-term Unemployed, including Early School Leavers</P>
    <P>&mdash;Information Society</P>
    <P>&mdash;Farmyard Pollution</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Environment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Reprogramming</i>
    </P>
    <P>The following specific reprogramming is proposed in order to address the agreed strategic priorities:</P>

    <P>¹ In the case of the peat power station a full review will be carried out at the end of 1998 as agreed in a letter dated 11 July, 1997 from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies to Mrs. Mary O'Rourke, TD, Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>
      <i>All OPs</i>
    </P>
    <P>Any additional reprogramming within the OPs indicated or within the remaining OPs will, subject to the terms of this package, be a matter for the monitoring committees for the OPs to decide.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed in principle that the progress on the projects and measures in the reserve list above will be considered in the spring of 1998 by the CSF Monitoring Committee and that if it cannot be proven that sufficient progress has been achieved to secure their likely completion within the existing agreed time scale for them all or part of the funds will be decommitted.  National Roads will be one of the main priorities in the consideration of the usage of any European Regional Development Fund funds which might become available.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Human Resources</i>
    </P>
    <P>While the existing balance between "equity" and "competitiveness" measures is deemed largely appropriate, sustained investment in human resources will continue as a high priority over the remainder of the programme.</P>
    <P>Particular areas of concern continue to be the incidence of early school leavers as well as the stock of long-term unemployed.  While the "flow" of early school leavers is beginning to decline in response to measures taken in this area, it is clear that action on this front must be accompanied by a concerted effort to address the "stock" problem.  In this regard a package of measures (26 million ecu) is proposed incorporating a minimum of an additional 1,000 places under Youthreach (20 million ecu), as well as a strengthening of accompanying measures such as bridging/progression (2 million ecu), counselling/ guidance (1 million ecu) and preventive actions (3 million ecu).</P>
    <P>As well as this increased emphasis on progression for early school leavers the Tourism and LURD OPs will also examine the scope for providing more progression places for this target group.</P>
    <P>The achievement of a reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed continues to be a priority in the CSF.  This target group must be the focus of a more effective and targeted approach <Col N="186" /> over the remainder of the programme.  In this context the ESF co-funded training component of the Community Employment Scheme will be refocused to provide pathways towards open employment.  3.5 million ecu will be provided for the National Employment Service.</P>
    <P>In the context of the White Paper on Human Resources Development, an industry-related package of 9 million ecu is proposed in response to a number of policy goals which it identified, namely Traineeship (3 million ecu) and TSS/Network-Industry (6 million ecu).  Increases on the infrastructural side include provision for additional capital equipment for FÁS (4 million ecu) as well as child care infrastructure (1 million ecu).  In addition, there will be a new education initiative involving the provision of 1.5 million ecu for language training.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industry</i>
    </P>
    <P>The development of a critical mass in research and development is seen as essential to improving the long-term competitiveness of Irish Industry. It is proposed, therefore, that some of the savings within the industry OP will be used to fund additional expenditure of 37 million ecu on Industry Research and Development to further stimulate movement in this direction.  The Industry Monitoring Committee will revamp measure 1 of the R&amp;D Sub-Programme to include innovation.  Furthermore, elements of competitive bidding and reduced aid rates shall be introduced having due regard to the special circumstances of smaller companies.</P>
    <P>The Industry Monitoring Committee shall initiate a process of identifying areas, where in the interest of industry, the quasi-monopoly position of Government agencies could be opened up to competition.</P>
    <P>Where presently deficit financing mechanisms exist, the Industry Monitoring Committee shall consider the introduction of programmatic financing mechanisms.  This will apply in particular, but not exclusively, to Industry/Third Level Co-operation services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development</i>
    </P>
    <P>The prevention of farmyard pollution can make a significant contribution to the quality of the environment as well as increasing the efficiency of production methods.  It is therefore proposed that 18 million ecu of the savings from the Food SP in Industry together with 10.5 million ecu of savings in the Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development OP will be used to fund additional expenditure of 28.5 million ecu on Farmyard Pollution and Dairy Hygiene.</P>
    <P>In relation to Sub-Programme 5(B), the research stimulus fund, it is agreed that of the remaining uncommitted amounts under this measure one third will be reserved for projects where TEAGASC is not involved.  If all funds have been committed, the amounts falling free because projects are abandoned should be used for projects where TEAGASC is not involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" />
      <i>Tourism</i>
    </P>
    <P>In recognition of the importance of the environment a new sustainable tourism measure is being proposed.  This will tackle on a pilot basis congestion problems in areas of high demand and it is proposed to provide 3 million ecu for this purpose.  In order to increase the value added to the economy of the investment being made in cultural tourism and to promote off-season events an additional 3 million ecu is being provided for marketing this aspect of the tourism programme. This additional expenditure will be funded from some of the savings within the Natural/Cultural Sub-Programme.  The Tourism Monitoring Committee will give consideration to the aid rates, geographic spread and qualifying types of investment (other than hotels) in relation to the use of the remaining allocation for the Product Development Sub-Programme.</P>
    <P>The training measures in Tourism OP should be better focused on small tourism operators and large firms should pay a larger part of the training provided.  Progress on the National Conference Centre will be monitored closely and if there is a risk that the project will not be completed on time to draw down the funds committed to it, all or part of these funds will be decommitted next year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic Infrastructure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The development of the information society is seen as a key to improving competitiveness and overcoming peripherality.  In recognition of this, it is proposed to reallocate 10 million ecu within the Economic Infrastructure OP to fund a new measure for broad band telecommunications.  It is a condition, however, that all the players, including the private sector, are allowed to participate in tendering for the grant on the basis of criteria set down in advance.  An Information Age Town pilot project by Telecom Éireann will go ahead without grant aid except for the possibility of some technical assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Transport</i>
    </P>
    <P>The completion of the country's road network to reasonable standards remains a priority in overcoming peripherality and increasing competitiveness.  There is evidence of increased congestion on Ireland's road network and in order to partially address this the agreed savings identified in Transport OP together with some savings within the Tourism, Environmental Services and Economic Infrastructure OPs will be used to finance additional activity on National Primary Roads.  At this time an additional 26 million ecu is proposed for National Roads and these will also be a priority in any consideration which might be given to the reallocation of funds as a result of reviewing progress on the large projects to be revisited in the spring of 1998.  These additions are conditional on improvements in cost control and in economies in road design.  Furthermore, the Transport Monitoring Committee <Col N="188" /> should ensure that a study on road pricing and related issues is undertaken.  The study should have regard to practice on road pricing across the EU.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that the first stage of Luas will be completed under the current programme it is proposed to allocate an additional 10 million ecu to finance preparatory work on the third line to Ballymun.  A study on the selling of the operational concession for the light rail will be carried out including aspects of Park and Ride facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Local Urban and Rural Development</i>
    </P>
    <P>There has been slow progress to date in expenditure in this OP and it will be monitored carefully to ensure that it is capable of spending the resources allocated to it within the programme period.  One million ecu will be reallocated from ESF funded activity within the OP for child care infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The operation of this programme will be reviewed by the programme monitoring committee to see what scope there is to make use of existing funds to further develop and promote the effectiveness of the four designated Territorial Employment Pacts selected in Ireland and to introduce a Pilot Scheme for Rural Resettlement. To the extent that requirements are identified and that future resources become available within the programme these will be regarded as a priority for the use of such resources.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exchange Rate</i>
    </P>
    <P>In view of emerging concerns among some of the implementing agencies in relation to movement of the IR£ against the ecu the Department of Finance issued an instruction on 6 March, 1997 reminding Departments and agencies that grant commitments should be made in ecus or, alternatively where they are expressed in IR£, they should contain a condition to the effect that the exchange rate is subject to fluctuation.  It pointed out that any losses which might occur as a result of movements in the IR£ against the ecu would be borne by the beneficiaries of the EU aid. Activities and targets within programmes will, where necessary, be scaled back to reflect the level of funds which will be available as a consequence of exchange rate movements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Use of the Deflator</i>
    </P>
    <P>With the exception of Human Resources, the 1996 deflator will be applied on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis within OPs.  While the 1996 European Regional Development Fund element of the Human Resources deflator will be applied <i>pro rata</i>, the ESF element will be applied to the priorities identified above.  Three million ecu of this deflator will also be allocated to FÁS.  It is proposed that a more flexible use of the 1997 and subsequent years' deflators will be employed.  Subject to satisfactory progress being achieved, the 1997 and subsequent years' deflators will be applied on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis to all OPs but the monitoring committees for the OPs will decide which measures <Col N="189" /> should benefit.  Exceptions to this arrangement for 1997 are the Industry, Human Resources and Transport OPs where the deflator will be applied as indicated in the above reprogramming proposals.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Progress and Reallocations</i>
    </P>
    <P>In preparing progress reports between now and the end of the current round for the monitoring committees of OPs the lead Departments will include a specific heading on substantial underspends.  A report will be given to the monitoring committee under this heading in relation to measures in respect of which expenditure is expected to be more than 20 per cent below the year's provision in the latest approved financial plan.  The report will give details of the underspend, the reasons for it together with the corrective action proposed.  Apart from the major projects/measures included in the above reserve list, the monitoring committee may, if it is not satisfied with the explanation given, propose the reallocation of the funding to another measure within the OP (provided it is under the permitted limits for reallocations by OP monitoring committees as set out in the CSF).  If there is insufficient scope within the OP or if the monitoring committee cannot reach agreement on a reallocation of the funding the matter will be brought to the attention of the CSF Monitoring Committee for decision.  The OP secretariats will report regularly to the CSF Monitoring Committee on the operation of this arrangement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cost Recovery and Deliver Mechanisms</i>
    </P>
    <P>The CSF Evaluator's recommendations in regard to greater recourse to cost recovery and the need for more competition in the delivery of services are noted.  It is recognised that there are inherent risks as well as practical difficulties in attempting to introduce fundamental changes over a relatively short period of time.  This is especially so in programmes which are proving significantly successful in providing training for employment and enhancing the competitiveness of industry.  Implementing departments will, nonetheless, examine the scope for implementing changes in pursuit of these goals. An effort will be made at OP level to increase private sector participation and/or to reduce aid rates and to initiate a process where the position of Government agencies as deliverers of services could be opened up to competition.  A new impetus will also be given to a policy direction which initiates a more &ldquo;market driven&rdquo; approach to education and training provision whether at company or individual level.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation will require the industrial agencies to review their range of activities and to indicate the steps which they have taken to date towards reducing aid rates and greater cost recovery from industry.</P>
    <P>The purpose of existing training measures for industry such as Training Support Scheme (TSS) <Col N="190" /> is to encourage industry to provide their own training.  It is focused on SMEs with the aid rates being tailored to their needs.  FÁS training for industry is put to tender in many cases under existing arrangements.  There will be an increased emphasis on tendering for training delivery under the auspices of the proposed National Employment Service.</P>
    <P>The proposed savings in the Advanced Technical Skills measure under the Human Resources OP will mean that the aid rates under the scheme will have to be reviewed to see if it is possible to avoid the measure being closed down for the academic year 1999.</P>
    <P>Additional resources for National Roads is contingent on the issue of road pricing being examined.  In this regard the external evaluator for the Transport OP has been requested to carry out a study on future road pricing mechanisms.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Indicators/Monitoring</i>
    </P>
    <P>The recommendations of the CSF Evaluator in regard to a revision of the indicators and the monitoring systems at CSF and OP level are noted.  It is proposed that the CSF Evaluation Unit will be asked to review the recommendations of the evaluator and to make specific proposals for a change in a paper to be presented to the Spring 98 Monitoring Committee meeting of the CSF.  Similar work will be undertaken at OP level and it will be co-ordinated by the CSF Evaluation Unit.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Evaluation Units</i>
    </P>
    <P>The monitoring committees for the OPs will review the work programmes of the evaluation units to consider the findings of the CSF Evaluator that their work programmes are excessively broad as compared with the resources available and whether their work should be more focused.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that to assist the deliberations of the monitoring committees in this regard the CSF Evaluation Unit will carry out a review of the performance of the evaluation units and external evaluators for the OPs.  The outcome of that review will be furnished to the CSF Monitoring Committee in the spring of 1998.</P>
    <P>In order to address the concerns of the CSF Evaluator in regard to the quality of certain cost benefit analyses the CSF Evaluation Unit will finalise its draft paper on cost benefit analysis.  It is proposed that the Unit will produce a follow up paper on cost benefit analysis for the benefit of implementing departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>The additional functions and responsibilities envisaged for the CSF Evaluation Unit will mean that the existing staffing complement will need to be increased.  It is proposed that an additional evaluator and an additional IT Officer will be recruited as soon as possible.

    <P>While chairmanship of the Human Resources Co-ordination Committee will be retained by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as the lead Department for human resources policy, it is proposed the committee will be put on the same footing as the RTD Co-ordinating Committee.  It will become a sub-committee of the CSF Monitoring Committee and it will report twice yearly to the CSF Monitoring Committee.

    <P>A Working Group comprising representatives of the Commission, regional authorities, the CSF Evaluation Unit, the CSF Information Office, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Finance and the lead Departments responsible for the ESF, EAGGF and FIFG will be established to improve the arrangements for the dissemination of information to regional authorities and to help regional authorities to carry out more effectively their review function in regard to the implementation of the CSF in their functional areas.  A report will be presented to the Spring 1998 meeting of the CSF Monitoring Committee.</P>
    <P>The Evaluation Unit in conjunction with the CSF Information Office will also collect information from lead Departments and the implementing agencies of interest to regional authorities.

Efforts will, however, be intensified with the assistance of the Structural Funds Information Officer to avail more frequently of opportunities to brief the media on CSF developments and on the contribution of structural funds to Ireland's development.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 50 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>This issue is one which has been around for some time and I would draw the Deputies' attention to my predecessor's reply to a parliamentary question on 22 April 1997 when this matter was last raised in this House.  The position is that, earlier this year, a study group within my Department, comprising officials who deal with banking issues, completed an examination of the general issue of dormant accounts held in credit institutions.  To facilitate this examination they had been in contact with the industry, including representatives of the banks and the building societies.  They reported their findings to my predecessor who decided that, given the potential legal and constitutional issues, the amounts likely to be involved and the administrative and other difficulties associated with establishing an operationally viable system to deal with dormant accounts, further action in the matter at this time would be unlikely to be cost effective from an Exchequer viewpoint.  I too have examined the Department's report and am in agreement with the conclusion reached by the previous Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specific query raised by Deputy O'Keeffe concerning notification procedures, I would like to advise the House that, in general, the banks' duty of secrecy prevents them from disclosing information about any account to a <Col N="193" /> third party without the express consent of the account holder.  This duty of secrecy is a legal one arising from the implied contract between the bank and its customer, and is fully recognisable in case law.  It is, of course, open to any account holder to come to some arrangement with his or her bank concerning the issuance of regular statements, which would alert themselves or their relatives to the existence of any accounts.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular concern of Deputy McManus regarding deceased account holders, I should point out that even if the legal duty referred to above did not exist, the fact is that unless someone tells them, banks will not be aware of, say, the death of a customer and the consequent dormancy of the account.</P>

      <P>One of the requirements for Ireland's successful entry into and participation in EMU, will be to create the right macro-economic environment within which strong economic growth can be maintained.  Central to this strategy will be the achievement of tighter fiscal discipline as our Action Programme for the Millennium indicates. In adopting this approach we have to ensure that we make adequate provision for the greater investment needs of our economy, for improvements in the delivery of essential social services and for continued reform of our personal and business tax regime, while at the same time fully observing the Maastricht criteria as detailed in the Stability and Growth Pact.  My forthcoming budget will set out this Government's objectives in these areas.  This budget together with the terms of the Partnership 2000 Agreement will ensure that the conditions for successful participation in EMU will be created and sustained. Indeed, Partnership 2000 includes a specific provision that:</P>
      <P>In the event of unforeseen changes in economic circumstances arising from EMU the arrangements for monitoring the new Partnership will be utilised to provide a mechanism for reviewing this Agreement should this be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An EMU Business Awareness Campaign is managed by Forfás on behalf of the Government, in consultation with the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Finance and Tourism.  It has as its objective the delivery of relevant information on EMU and the changeover to the euro to enterprises so that they can prepare <Col N="194" /> effectively for the changes that will arise.  The Campaign involves a wide range of business and professional organisations, as well as state agencies dealing with enterprise, through the mechanism of a Consultative Committee that brings all these groups together.</P>
    <P>In relation to the implications for Irish industry of the UK remaining outside EMU for the present, consultants have been appointed by Forfás on behalf of the Campaign to determine appropriate strategies for groups of enterprises, likely to be particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the sterling/euro exchange rate.  The study also involves consultations with the sectors in question, both through industry associations and through workshops conducted with representatives of the companies concerned.  The consultants are expected to report by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will bring the results of this report to the attention of the relevant business groups and the Ministers with responsibility for the sectors mentioned by the Deputy.  I expect that on foot of this, my colleagues in Government will have appropriate consultations with the business sectors directly concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreements under the local bargaining provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> in respect of the groups mentioned by the Deputy tended to be very complex and to differ widely in their structure.  Among the elements which were included in different agreements were salary increases, which varied depending on an individual's length of service and in some cases were confined to serving staff and did not apply to new recruits, selective up-gradings and promotions for a limited proportion of a grade, and non-pay items such as enhanced early retirement provisions and the reckonability in future of certain payments for pension purposes.  As a result of the complexity of the settlements, it would not be possible to express, in a meaningful way, the value of the settlements in terms of the percentage payments being made to serving staff.</P>
      <P>I assume, however, that the Deputy's main concern relates to the impact on pensioners of the decision which I announced on 4 November 1997. As I explained at the time, the effect of the Government's decision is that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring deals under the PCW will benefit from those deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum increase of 3 per cent (or 2 per cent in the case of any pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent).</P>
      <P>Accordingly, pensioners will in general get the same percentage increase as applied to the salaries of staff serving in the grade and on the scale point from which the pensioners retired.  Traditional parity meant that pensioners could not benefit from some of the elements included in a number of deals (such as new allowances, personal long-service increments and higher scales which applied to limited numbers of staff). However, in order to protect those retired public servants who would have received less than 3 per cent had parity been applied in the normal way, the Government decided, as a once-off measure, that pensioners should be guaranteed a minimum increase of 3 per cent (or 2 per cent in the case of any pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent).  The decision on pension increases reflected the position put forward by the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and has, I understand, been welcomed by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where parity applies, the increases will be effective from the dates set out in the deals negotiated for serving staff, including phasing, where appropriate.  The 3 per cent floor increase will take effect from 1 September 1995.  In the case of a pensioner who did benefit from an advance <Col N="196" /> payment of 1 per cent with effect from 1 April 1994, the 2 per cent floor will apply with effect from 1 May 1996.</P>
    <P>As regards the cost of these increases, the Deputy will appreciate that my direct responsibility relates to Civil Service pensions only.  An accurate estimate of the cost involved will only be available when the relevant Departments and organisations involved have implemented the increases.  I can, however, say that when the decision was announced on 4 November, the best estimate of the cost was £23 million in 1997 and about the same in a full year.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment all participated on behalf of the Government, in yesterday's Dáil statement on the Special European Council on Employment to be held in Luxembourg tomorrow and on Friday.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government laid before the Dáil a written statement of the Irish position on employment and on the Special Council.  A copy of the statement is being provided also to the Heads of State and Government in advance of the Special Council meeting.</P>
      <P>It will be evident to the Deputy from these developments that the Government is a very active participant in the Special Council.  I have been involved in preparatory discussions in the ECOFIN Council that are designed to ensure a successful outcome at the Special Council.</P>
      <P>A number of developments are expected to emerge from the Special Council of which two are particularly significant.</P>
      <P>First, an agreement on employment guidelines to be implemented by the member states.  Progress on implementation of these guidelines will be monitored through national action plans to be prepared by each individual member state.</P>
      <P>Second, a financial package under which the European Investment Bank will provide an additional one billion ECU for investment in projects with job-creation potential, particularly in small and medium sized enterprises.  The EIB contribution is expected to be complemented by a special allocation of an initial 150 million ECU from the EU Budget for employment measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is confidently expected that these two measures &mdash; the guidelines and the financial <Col N="197" /> package &mdash; will be adopted by the Special Council which will thereby provide a visible impetus to employment policy in the Community.</P>
    <P>The Government fully supports the initiatives that I have described and is confident that the Special Council will be the success that we all wish for.</P>
    <P>While Ireland is making good progress in employment in recent years and have reduced the unemployment level, we still have an unemployment rate of about 10 per cent, which is unacceptably high.  We have a definite interest in joining with our EU partners in the further measures now envisaged to tackle unemployment in the EU and in the individual member states.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to place the employment issue at the top of its agenda and that we will follow up vigorously in implementing the agreement reached at the Special Council.</P>

    <P>The 1997 and 1998 figures quoted above are based on the 1997 forecast outturn and 1998 estimates figures for gross non-capital supply services included in Table 6 of the 1998 Abridged Estimates Volume published on 12 November 1997 and the latest Department of Finance estimates of Gross Domestic Product for those years which are subject to revision.</P>
    <P>The Government's Programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, indicates that one of its key priorities will be &ldquo;.to reduce overall Government spending as a share of national output&rdquo;.  The programme does not contain a specific percentage target in this regard.  It also refers to reducing overall Government spending rather than gross current supply services spending as a share of national output.  The programme <Col N="199" /> includes specific targets to limit the growth in net current spending to 4 per cent and the growth in capital spending to 5 per cent on average up to 1999.  Net current spending for this purpose comprises expenditure on net non-capital supply services and central fund services.</P>
    <P>Setting limits on the growth in spending is, a more effective means of controlling expenditure. A specific target related to the share of national output is not as restrictive because in periods of high economic growth it would permit substantial increases in spending.  As long as the rate of increase in spending was less than the rate of increase in Gross Domestic Product, the target would be achieved.</P>

      <P>The setting of interest rates is a matter for the Central Bank, which is independent in its implementation of monetary policy and I am not going to make any comment in that regard.</P>
      <P>We are now enjoying a sustained period of unprecedentedly high economic growth rates. There are a number of macroeconomic policy implications to be drawn from this.  In periods of strong growth, such as we are experiencing at present, it is appropriate that the Government finances should move into balance if not into surplus.  It is the Government's policy that Exchequer borrowing should be eliminated over the next two to three years if current conditions continue.</P>
      <P>The Government's tight fiscal policy stance, with the provisions of Partnership 2000, will help to ensure that the right conditions for economic growth are sustained.  It is essential for the maintenance of our current strong performance that all sides adhere to the provisions of Partnership 2000.  The wage moderation embodied in this agreement and its predecessors has been an important factor in our overall economic performance over the past decade including the rapid increase in employment in recent years.</P>

      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy was referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on the Appropriation Accounts, 1996.  In his report the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to queries he had raised with the Office of the Attorney General regarding the bringing to its attention of cases of intestate estates which may potentially be due to the State under the Succession Act, 1965.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred specifically to certain balances held by the health boards on behalf of discharged or deceased patients some of which may be due to the State and which had not been brought to the attention of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>In the light of the specific concerns raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in relation to patients' funds held by the health boards, my Department has raised the matter with the Department of Health and Children and with the Office of the Attorney General with a view to ensuring that procedures are in place to bring relevant cases to the attention of the Chief State Solicitor who, under the Attorney General, has responsibility for the administration of intestate estates which may fall to the State under the Succession Act, 1965.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that procedures are adequate to ensure that any moneys or property due to the State are brought to account.  Generally speaking, ownerless property comes to the attention of the State authorities from the local gardaí and, in a minority of cases, through a local solicitor.  Most intestate property falls into two general categories &mdash; land and buildings and moneys in bank accounts or other financial institutions.  Where appropriate, the Attorney General deals with such cases by instructing the Chief State Solicitor to obtain letters of administration from the High Court.  When the administration of the estate has been finalised, the proceeds are paid into the Intestate Estates Fund Deposit Account, which is under my control and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am not of the opinion that further legislation would procure additional benefit for the Exchequer in this area.</P>

      <P>The 1998 Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version) provides under Subhead A5 (Office Machinery and Other Office Supplies) for a sum <Col N="201" /> of £18,733,000 for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Expenditure under this subhead relates to purchases and maintenance of computers and office equipment and stationery costs.  The actual increase which has been provided for the Revenue Commissioners, over and above the 1997 forecasted outturn of £13,139,000 is £5,594,000 and not £11,088,000 as referred to by the Deputy. The difference is due to an error which resulted in the forecasted 1997 outturn, as published, being understated (by £5,494,000).  The error will be corrected in the Revised Estimates.</P>
      <P>The additional £5,594,000 was provided to fund/part fund a number of new developments as well as to cover the increased day to day running costs associated with maintaining the Revenue Commissioners' extensive and sophisticated computer systems.  It is estimated that the latter dayto-day running costs will increase by some £1,000,000 in 1998.  In addition, extra funding has been provided for major developments in a number of areas, such as the Euro, Year 2000 and Freedom of Information.  Funding has also been provided to replace the present largely manual stamp duty system relating to land and property transactions with an integrated computerised system.  Finally, extra funding has been made available for integrated tax processing which, when completed, will enable a consolidated view of a taxpayer's affairs across all taxheads to be taken as opposed to the present single taxhead approach.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the additional investment in Revenue's IT infrastructure is essential to under-pin tax collection levels and to continue providing a quality service to the growing numbers of customers dealt with by Revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a statement issued on 31 October 1997, having consulted the Attorney General my Department referred the Central Bank report to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his consideration and any action he considers necessary and also asked the Director for his view as to whether communicating the response of the Central Bank and the addendum thereto to the Houses of the Oireachtas might prejudice consideration and possible prosecution by the DPP.  I am awaiting his response.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my statement of 31 October 1997 that I also wrote separately to the Govenor of the Central Bank regarding the general supervisory issues arising from the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments) as the Central Bank has responsibility for the prudential regulation of banks and other financial institutions.  I have been advised that while bank staff engaged in supervision are primarily concerned with prudential matters, there was no barrier on their reporting alleged breaches of exchange controls to their colleagues in the Exchange Control Division of the bank.  However, I have been further advised that it is the recollection of officers in the two functions when exchange controls were in force that exchange control issues did not arise from banking supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank, by virtue of section 31 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, (replaced by section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, subsequently amended by section 52 of the Central Bank Act, 1997), is prohibited from disclosing information to the Authorities.  The situation was modified by the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  This Act has placed an obligation on the bank to report to the Garda any suspicion of a criminal act (such as assisting tax evasion/money laundering) by a <Col N="203" /> bank.  To date the bank has had no occasion to make such a report to the Garda.  There is no authority for the Central Bank to report on matters to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Given these circumstances, I asked the Governor to report separately to me on the supervisory issues and, in particular, if the board of the bank is satisfied that the bank has the necessary legal powers for the effective execution of its regulatory role, that the procedures and practices necessary to effectively exercise these powers are in place and that these procedures and practices are being implemented effectively.</P>
    <P>A reply has been received from the Governor which states as follows:</P>
    <P>11 November 1997</P>
    <P>Mr. Charlie McCreevy TD,</P>
    <P>Minister for Finance,</P>
    <P>Department of Finance,</P>
    <P>Merrion Street,</P>
    <P>Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>I refer to your letter of 31st October about supervisory issues arising from the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments).</P>
    <P>These issues concern a breach by Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited (G&amp;M hereinafter) of the Central Bank's non-statutory Licensing and Supervision Requirements and Standards relating to large liabilities to interbank depositors and to matters relating to the control and management of G&amp;M.</P>
    <P>In 1988/90 G&amp;M was in breach of the Bank's requirement that liabilities to any one interbank depositor may not exceed 15 per cent of total borrowings.  Prior to 1988 there was no breach as the interbank liability was to an affiliate on which there were no limits in the requirements (The McCracken report dates the sale of the Guinness Mahon subsidiary which eventually became Ansbacher Cayman Limited as taking place in 1984 and 1985.  In fact, the entity was first sold out of the Guinness Mahon Group in 1988).  The Bank identified specifically the interbank liability to Ansbacher Cayman Limited in G&amp;M in 1989.  The breach of requirements was eliminated stepwise within two years of the matter coming to light.</P>
    <P>The 15 per cent limit was designed to protect banks from the negative effects of a sudden withdrawal of liquidity by one interbank depositor.  However, the Bank would not appear to have had cause to question seriously the liquidity aspects of G&amp;M's operations at the time.  Overall holdings of liquid assets by this bank were exceptionally high by any criterion &mdash; the average liquidity ratio was around 70 per cent through this period, compared with a 25 per cent norm.  The important supervisory issues relating to this bank at the time were matters touching on ownership, future direction, <Col N="204" /> profitability and intra-group relations, rather than on liquidity or solvency.</P>
    <P>On the matter relating to the control and management of G&amp;M, there is no record in the Bank that it was informed of the matters in the internal auditor's report carried out by Guinness Mahon &amp; Company Limited on G&amp;M in Dublin in 1989.  It emerged in the Tribunal report that these matters related essentially to inadequate internal controls and possible exposure to fraud relating to a large percentage of G&amp;M's deposits.  There is no record that the Bank had discovered the system for operating the Ansbacher accounts during its inspections and review meetings.  Prior to publication of the Tribunal report, the Central Bank had no knowledge of the existence of the "Ansbacher Deposits" referred to during the Tribunal hearing or of the role played by G&amp;M in the management of those deposits.  I should stress that only in the 1990s has it become standard practice both in Ireland and elsewhere for supervisors to seek all material internal audit reports.</P>
    <P>Supervision has three main elements; authorisation of new entities; ongoing supervision of existing entities; and policy development.  Entities supervised by the bank are required to submit a regular flow of detailed financial data which represent the basis for assessment of institutions by the bank.  Regular reviews and on-site inspections of entities are also undertaken.  The reviews are usually on a half-yearly basis.  There is a programme in place for the inspection of supervised entities on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that the Board is satisfied with its legal powers which are generally adequate to enable the bank to discharge, satisfactorily, its statutory functions.  The statutory position in Ireland follows mainstream European law in the area of prudential supervision and all EU Banking and Investment Directives have been transposed into Irish law and have been brought into force.  In relation to credit institutions I would mention that the latest review of legislation was undertaken in 1996 and amendments to legislation were introduced in 1997 to take account of that review.  In relation to the supervision of investment intermediaries, the Bank is currently in negotiations with the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment with a view to amending the governing legislation i.e. the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  Several of these amendments are necessary to facilitate the transfer earlier this year of supervisory responsibility for retail intermediaries from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the bank.  The Bank is anxious to take advantage of this amending legislation to put forward certain changes to the 1995 Act which would enhance its ongoing implementation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the supervision of recently transferred investment intermediaries, I would <Col N="205" /> like to take this opportunity to highlight what the Bank perceives as a distinct lack of compliance culture among the retail end of this sector.  Significant efforts on the part of the Bank will be required to address this problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to supervisory procedures and practices, the Board keeps under review the Bank's supervisory practices and its approach to supervision.  It endeavours to ensure that these are in line with international best practice and are subject to continuous modernisation and adaptation to meet the needs of a changing global environment.</P>
    <P>I can also confirm that the board is satisfied that the supervisory procedures and practices are being effectively implemented by the Bank. The board is briefed on all matters of supervisory significance, on a monthly basis.  It receives a comprehensive report, on a half-yearly basis, on work undertaken over the previous six months and on significant issues outstanding or likely to arise in the future.  All significant proposals are subject to approval by the Board on a case by case basis &mdash; e.g. authorisation of banks, acquisition of/by banks and refusal to authorise investment intermediaries.  Papers on various topics relating to supervision are circulated regularly to the Board and a significant part of board meetings is usually concerned with supervisory matters.</P>
    <P>The board also decides on the manpower and other resource requirements of the supervisory functions.  At present there are up to 100 members of staff engaged in supervision duties. Staff levels are kept under constant review, particularly by reference to the increasing regulatory functions being assigned to the Bank.  In this respect staff numbers have increased significantly in recent times.</P>
    <P>I would wish to draw your attention again to the strict legal requirements on confidentiality. In this connection I should mention that some of the matters set out above are disclosed on foot of a waiver of the confidentiality requirements of Section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, given by G&amp;M at the request of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Effective supervision requires the co-operation of the supervised entity.  No matter how effective a supervisory regime may be, there can be no assurance that deceit or default will not arise.</P>
    <P>If you require any further information or clarification please get in touch with me and I will be available at any time to discuss further with you the issues that are raised here.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>

      <Quest>when the Government intends to reduce the rate of VAT as an initial step to bring it into line with other countries in the EU with the eventual aim of harmonisation; and if he will list the standard rates of VAT in other EU countries.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19560/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the standard rate of VAT in Ireland is 21 per cent.  This rate complies with Article 12 of the EU Sixth VAT Directive which stipulates that the standard rate may not be less than 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not significantly out of line with the rest of the European Union in this regard.  The arithmetic average of the standard rates is about 19 per cent and three member states have rates higher than ours.  I would point out that our standard rate has also come down considerably in recent years, from 25 per cent in 1990.  In addition, a very sizeable proportion of Irish business enjoy the benefit of zero or reduced rating: only about 51 per cent of the VAT base is standard rated.  Furthermore, our zero rating provisions (e.g. for food, children's clothing etc.) are very broad by EU standards.  Only the UK and Ireland make extensive use of zero rating.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out to the Deputy that the cost of a one percentage point reduction in the standard rate is very considerable, some £126 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>As regards harmonisation of rates, the situation is that a transitional system has been in operation in the European Union since the introduction of the Single Market on 1 January 1993.  This system continues automatically until the Council decides on a definitive system.  In July 1996, the Commission brought forward a work programme which involves a phased presentation of proposals up to the end of 1999 in order to work towards a common VAT system.  The Commission have indicated that their proposals will be based on a single place of registration for traders and will involve considerable harmonisation of the rating structure.  The standard rate, it is suggested, could be set within a narrow band and a small number of reduced rates would be allowed, but their number and scope would be limited.  The Commission have only recently begun to table formal proposals from this work programme and their proposals on the main elements and in relation to the rating structure have yet to emerge.  The Government will examine any such proposals on their merits and with due regard to the national interest.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Deputy asked for a list of the standard rates in other member states, which is as follows:</P>

      <P>The additional moneys in my Estimate for central information technology services are for the provision of a new personnel administration system, to support the changes in personnel management now planned for the Civil Service, as a result of the Strategic Management Initiative.  A decision on the system to be purchased has not yet been made.  It is anticipated that the total cost for the Civil Service will be of the order of £3 million. As the new system will be designed as a standard system for use by all Departments, it is proposed to fund a significant element of the development cost centrally.  To meet this central cost, I have made a provision of £1.1 million in my Department's Vote for 1998.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there has been a significant growth in the number of women at work over the past number of years.  Female employment, between 1971 and 1981 grew by 54,000 and then by a further 57,000 between 1981 and 1991. The subsequent growth in the six years to 1997, at 126,500, is greater than the entire growth in women's employment in the previous 20 years. Some 60 per cent of the increase in women in employment since 1991, was in full-time employment.  By 1997, women accounted for almost four in ten of those at work.  The growth in female employment has been cosiderably stronger than that for males and the Irish female labour participation rate, while still below the EU average, is increasing rapidly.</P>
      <P>The general improvements introduced over the past number of years aimed at reducing the tax burden on earned income have been of benefit to all taxpayers, both female and male.  They have improved employment incentives for all workers and have contributed to the strong growth in employment.  Given the strong growth in female employment, I see no need to engage consultants as suggested in the question.</P>
      <P>I will, however, be announcing measures aimed at reducing further the tax burden on employees generally in the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>The regulation in question, Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2064/97 of 15 October 1997, establishes detailed arrangements for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 4253/88 as regards the financial control by member states of operations co-financed by the Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>The principles governing the financial control of Structural Funds have been long established and Ireland has long complied with them.  This Commission Regulation clarifies details of the scope and scale of controls and procedures for consulting with and reporting to the Commission about these controls.  So the generality of the controls are already being implemented; what is now required is that we comply with the newly specified details.</P>
      <P>My Department has engaged management consultants, with EU assistance, to examine the detailed controls now in place and to make recommendations about improvements, if such are needed, to meet the detailed requirements now set out.  The study covers all stages of implementation of the European Regional Development Fund, for which the Department of Finance has specific responsibility, and all bodies involved in that implementation.</P>
      <P>I expect that this study will be completed shortly, and implementation of its recommendations will proceed immediately.</P>

      <P>On 27 March 1997, the Department of Finance issued a Circular (Circular 17/97) on IT Systems and the Year 2000 to all Departments-Offices asking them to verify the year 2000 compliance status of their IT infrastructures and systems.  It requested each Department and office to ensure that their IT infrastructures and office equipment were year 2000 compliant, and to draw up plans for dealing <Col N="209" /> with any non-compliant systems by January 1999, or earlier for those systems that process multicentury dates in this century.  Plans were to be submitted to this Department by July of this year.</P>
      <P>This planning exercise is now complete.  Unlike the situation in the UK referred to by Deputy Bruton, year 2000 Compliance Plans were received from all Departments and Offices.</P>
      <P>These plans have been reviewed by the Department of Finance.  They set out the actions to be taken and the period over which such actions will extend to achieve year 2000 compliance for departmental information technology systems, and any associated costs.</P>
      <P>The volume of year 2000 compliance activities varies considerably from Department to Department, and in some cases it is relatively minor.  It is evident from the plans that many potential year 2000 problems have already been eliminated by the replacing of ageing computer systems and infrastructures.  Considerable remedial work has been ongoing for some time in those Departments and offices most affected, and all expect that this remedial work will be completed by early 1999.</P>
      <P>The additional costs arising in 1998 and 1999 for the resolution of year 2000 problems will amount to some £12.8 million for the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The Government has also decided to set up an independent monitoring committee to oversee the achievement of year 2000 compliance in the Civil Service.  The committee will be chaired by my Department, and will include members from the private sector.  It will submit quarterly reports to Government on the progress being made in achieving year 2000 compliance in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The Government has also instructed Departments to ensure that bodies operating under their aegis in the wider Public Service are addressing the year 2000 problem.</P>
      <P>The publication of the detailed information contained in their year 2000 Compliance Plans can be provided by individual Departments and offices.</P>

Accordingly, in our Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government committed itself to tighter management of the economy so as to maximise the long-term <Col N="210" /> potential for growth, jobs, social inclusion and improved living standards for all.  In pursuing this objective, our programme also identified a number of key priorities, including running a current budget surplus and the elimination of Exchequer borrowing over the next two to three years, if present conditions continue, so as to reduce the burden of the national debt.  In my forthcoming Budget Statement, I will inform the House of the progress which I have already made and which I hope to make in delivering on those priorities.</P>

      <P>My Department published <i>EMU and the euro: Ireland's National Changeover Plan</i> in May this year.  The plan states that assuming that the European Council confirms in 1998 that Ireland fulfils the necessary conditions for adoption of the euro, a Currency Changeover Board (CCB) will be established after the European Council's decision in order to oversee the detailed implementation of the changeover.  The European Council decision on which member states qualify for the adoption of the euro is expected to be taken in early May 1998.</P>
      <P>The composition of the Currency Changeover Board has yet to be decided.  However, the National Changeover Plan states that the Euro Changeover Group (ECG) is expected to provide the nucleus of the board.  The ECG comprises representatives from ICTU, IBEC, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Irish Bankers' Federation, the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Stock Exchange and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (Ireland), the National Lottery, and Forfás and a member of the Cees-Maas Expert Group on the changeover to the single currency which reported to the EU Commission in May 1995, as well as officials from the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Central Bank.  The Group's function is to advise the Department on technical issues in the run-up to the 1998 European Council decision and to help co-ordination of the changeover across the economy.</P>

      <P>The ECOFIN Council has held discussions in recent months on Commissioner Monti's proposals for a tax package consisting of a code of conduct on business taxation and certain other measures aimed at removing tax-related distortions affecting the EU Single Market.  No decisions have yet been taken on the matter.  However, the proposals are due to be considered again at the ECOFIN meeting on 1 December 1997 at which it is expected that decisions will be taken.</P>
      <P>The code of conduct is seen by the Commission and some member states as the key element of the package and is designed to tackle certain aspects of business taxation which may be harmful to the Community interest.  What is envisaged is a voluntary agreement which would not amend or override Community law and which would fully respect the principle of subsidiarity whereby general taxation policy remains the prerogative of the member states.  The focus would be on special measures or schemes which provide a low effective tax tate relative to the general business tax rate in the country in question and which involve other special features of a potentially distortionary nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other elements of the package proposed by the Commission on which decisions may be taken at the December meeting of ECOFIN.  First, the Commission will ask the Council to adopt broad principles which would form the basis of a common EU tax regime in respect of personal savings income.  The purpose of such a regime, which would require EU legislation in due course, would be to ensure that individuals resident in a member state would be subject to a minimum level of tax in respect of interest earned on savings held in other member states.  Second, <Col N="212" /> the Commission will ask the Council to make a political commitment to work towards the early adoption of an EU Directive providing for the elimination of witholding taxes on cross-Border interest and royalty payments between companies.  Such taxes are considered to be an impediment to business transactions and the smooth functioning of the Single Market.</P>

      <P>I should emphasise that negotiations on the next round of Structural Funds are very much at a preliminary stage.</P>
      <P>The European Commission, in its document Agenda 2000, accepts that there should be no abrupt cut-off of funds for regions that have passed the eligibility threshold for Objective 1 of 75 per cent of GDP and that appropriate transitional arrangements should apply to such regions.</P>
      <P>The application of Structural Funds has contributed significantly to Ireland's recent economic growth and progress.  It is important that this progress be copperfastened and that it is not undermined by any abrupt scaling back of structural funds after 1999.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that my Department has the basis for a comprehensive, well-argued case for continued access for Ireland to substantial structural funding in the next round.</P>
      <P>Ireland's goal in these negotiations is of course to secure the optimum result for the whole country.  Within this overall approach, the Government will be seeking to secure the position of the less-developed parts of the country.  The Government are particularly conscious of the needs of the less-developed parts of the country and of their commitment to these areas in &ldquo;An Action Plan for the New Millennium&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Measures aimed at reducing tax on lower incomes, such as increasing personal allowances and reducing the standard income tax rate, are among the tools in easing unemployment traps and, to some extent, poverty traps.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, unemployment traps, as referred to by commentators, centre on the financial return from work when compared with social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The poverty trap refers to the potential for some cohorts to actually experience a reduction in take-home pay as gross earnings increase over certain income ranges.  The proverty trap is mainly caused by the interaction of the withdrawal rate for FIS with the operation of the marginal relief taxation system.  Those mostly affected are families with dependent children who are taxed under the marginal relief system and in receipt of FIS.  Therefore, increasing personal allowances or reducing the standard income tax rate have only a limited immediate impact on this cohort, through moving some of the group into the normal tax system, where the marginal rate of taxation is lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated, one of the main problems in regard to poverty and unemployment traps is the larger number of people who are taxed under the marginal relief system.  In this regard the expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems considered it undesirable, from a work incentive perspective, to have such a large <Col N="214" /> proportion of taxpayers &mdash; then around one in six &mdash; being taxed under the marginal relief system. The group recommended that tax policies at the lower end of the income distribution should, therefore, be directed towards limiting and eventually abolishing the system of exemption limits.  The group suggested that this could be done over time by increasing personal allowances at a rate faster than exemption limits.</P>
    <P>Removing such traps can also be assisted by changes in the FIS system.  Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to move the calculation of the FIS payment from a gross to a net income basis within the lifetime of the agreement.  The first step in meeting this commitment was introduced in the budget 1997 where PRSI and the health and employment levies were removed from the calculation.  When the move to FIS on a net basis is complete the difficulties with the poverty trap will be significantly reduced.</P>
    <P>There are myriad schemes and programmes which serve to reduce unemployment traps and successfully encourage people to enter the labour market.  Examples of such schemes include the back to work allowance, jobstart and workplace.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 20 of 8 October 1997 on this topic.  I reiterate that the permitted hours for boookmakers' registered premises are set out in section 21 of the Betting Act, 1931.  Enforcement of the opening hours restrictions is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>As also mentioned in the reply, I have no difficulty with reviewing the present opening hours.  I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the issue.

      <P>The State has no outstanding liability that causes an underfunding in respect of public service pension funds in semi-State companies and State organisations.  All Exchequer pension liabilities, including those in respect of State organisations that were formerly part of the Civil Service, are met on a pay-as-you-go basis and not on a funded basis.</P>
      <P>As regards An Post and Telecom Éireann, under statutory arrangements, payment by the State of its pays-as-you-go liability was postponed.  The pensions funds of the companies used their own resources to meet the Exchequer's liabilities between 1984 and 1933 so that by the end of 1993 the amount discharged on behalf of the Exchequer, including interest, had reached almost £435 million.</P>
      <P>Since 1994 the Exchequer has discharged all fresh liabilities and paid interest on the outstanding sum thereby capping the growth in the outstanding liability.  In addition, payments have been made to reduce the outstanding sum: £29 million in 1994, £108 million in 1996 and £150 million in 1997.  The outstanding liability is now £150 million approximately.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to meet this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> In settling the 1998 Estimates, the Government gave detailed consideration to the expenditure allocations.  Ensuring that programmes are run as efficiently and as effectively as possible formed a major part of that consideration.</P>
    <P>However, it is also important that an emphasis on quality and effectiveness is built into the whole expenditure process if the commitment in the Government's programme is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in July, the Taoiseach announced that the Government had agreed a schedule of expenditure reviews to be carried out over the next 12 months as part of a three year programme of such reviews.  Continuing review of public expenditure programmes is a central part of the public sector reforms being introduced under the Strategic Management Initiative.</P>
    <P>The aims of these programme reviews are: (a) to provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each programme; (b) to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between spending programmes; and (c) to ensure that the public get good value for money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made a statement indicating that the report from the Central Bank has been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his consideration and any action he considers necessary. The report was also sent to the Revenue Commissioners for any necessary action and to the Tribunal of Inquiry (Payments to Messrs.  Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having consulted the Attorney General, I have asked the Director of Public Prosecutions for his <Col N="218" /> views as to whether communicating the Central Bank response to the Houses of the Oireachtas would prejudice consideration and possible prosecution by the DPP.  His reply is awaited and until I receive it, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot disclose any information contained in the Central Bank report.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Ansbacher accounts, I would like to make it clear that the examination of the tax affairs of any individual or institution in the State is a matter solely for the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister for Finance does not get involved in such cases for obvious reasons.  The Revenue Commissioners have already made it clear, following the publication of the tribunal report, that any action needed to uphold the implementation of the tax code in the light of the information contained in the McCracken report is being taken.  Clearly any additional information in the Central Bank report and any other relevant information that emerges will also be taken into account by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>As regards access to bank accounts, the principal legislative provisions governing such access by Revenue are contained in section 18 of the Finance Act, 1983, and section 13 of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993. These sections, which are similar in effect, provide that an authorised officer of the Revenue Commissioners may, in certain circumstances, seek an order from the High Court, or a determination of the Appeal Commissioners, to require a financial institution to provide particulars of undisclosed bank accounts.  Information may be sought only in relation to a named individual who is ordinarily resident in the State and only in circumstances where that person has not made a return or the authorised officer has reason to believe that a return made by that person is incorrect.</P>
    <P>Immediately on the publication of the McCracken Tribunal report, I requested the Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with my Department, to carry out a review of their existing powers.  If this review indicates that additional powers are required and these are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective, they will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>A group, entitled the "Environmental Taxation Group" was set up comprising representatives from the Departments of Finance, the Environment, Enterprise and Employment, Transport, Energy and Communications and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <Quest>the average amount of tax paid by a PAYE worker, a self employed person and a farmer for the most recent year for which figures are available; if he has satisfied himself that these payments are consistent with the income levels for each group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest relevant information available on income tax receipts is in respect of the calendar year 1996. The average individual tax payment from each of the PAYE, farming and other self-employed sectors in 1996 is estimated at £4,308 for PAYE, £1,028 for farmers and £4,020 for other self-employed.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, on the basis of trend in tax receipts and from the information supplied by the Revenue Commissioners, that these payments are consistent with the income levels for each group. The efficiency of the tax collection system for all sectors of the economy has improved significantly in recent years.  The Revenue Commissioners are continuing with their overall successful approach to compliance which is designed, on the one hand, to make procedures easier for those who are trying to meet their tax obligations and, on the other, to pursue people who do not pay on time or at all.  Measures taken to improve collection and compliance include as follows:</P>
      <P>(1) modern payment methods including direct debits;</P>
      <P>(2) programmes to secure returns from those who do not file;</P>
      <P>(3) the large-scale targeted audit programme which resulted in some £132.6 million being collected in 1996;</P>
      <P>(4) the random audit programme which exposes every taxpayer to the risk of audit;</P>
      <P>(5) introduction of withholding tax and tax clearance procedures;</P>
      <P>(6) significant use of the power to attach assets of tax defaulters, as well as other strong enforcement measures;</P>
      <P>(7) new local collection and arrears compliance initiative;</P>
      <P>(8) measures to tackle black economy operators and</P>
      <P>(9) a more active prosecution policy in cases of serious evasion.</P>
      <P>Revenue have confirmed that these measures, which are to be intensified under Revenue's new corporate plan, are underpinning the improved compliance in the tax system in recent years.  The measures needed are reviewed each year on the basis of Revenue's analysis of the returns and levels of compliance for that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that from 1991 to 1996 the contribution of the farming and other self-employed sectors as a percentage of the aggregate take from these two sectors and the PAYE sector increased from 10.2 per cent in 1991 to 13.5 per cent in 1996.  The latter figure would have risen to 14.1 per cent but for the once-off cash <Col N="221" /> flow cost, estimated at £35 million, of the High Court decision to allow withholding tax on professional fees to be offset against an individual's overall liability to income tax on a current year basis.</P>

      <P>Information for GDP on a county basis is not available.  Regional accounts have been published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and these give details of GDP for regional authority regions for 1991 and 1993.  The regional level is the most detailed level at which reliable GDP estimates can be produced.  The <Col N="222" /> GDP for the Border region, which includes counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo, was estimated at £2,382 million (£5,910 <i>per capita</i>) for 1991 and £2,797 million (£6,892 <i>per capita</i>) for 1993, the latest year for which figures are available.  Information on household income by county for the year 1994 is currently being compiled by CSO and will be published early in 1998.</P>

      <i>International Labour Organisation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Of the 181 Conventions of the International Labour Organisation dating from 1919, 50 have been ratified by Ireland and are currently in force in this country.  It is unlikely that the majority of the remainder will be ratified by us because they are outdated or have been superseded by more modern conventions.  We are actively considering the ratificaton of a number of recent ILO conventions.  It should be noted that signature, as such, does not arise in the case of ILO conventions.  It is policy to ratify only those conventions which are completely in accordance with our existing legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Council of Europe</i>
    </P>
    <P>Ireland signed and ratified the European Social Charter which was opened for signature on 18 October 1961 at Turin.  On 14 May last, Ireland signed (without reservation as to ratification) the Protocol amending the European Social Charter, which was opened for signature by the member states of the Council of Europe signatories to the Charter, in Turin, on 21 October 1991.  Ireland has not signed or ratified the 1988 Additional Protocol, the 1995 Additional Protocol to the Charter providing for a System of Collective Complaints or the revised European Social Charter (1996), because we adhere strictly to the principle that we should only sign and ratify those international instruments which are completely in accordance with our existing legislation.  This has led us to adopt a very cautious approach to the question of signing and ratifying the above Protocols and revised Charter.  This matter is undergoing detailed examination at present.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the answer which I gave to Question No. 69 on 4 November 1997.</P>
      <P>A first time application for a work permit (not an extension as stated in the question) was received by my Department in September and was refused on 3 October 1997.</P>
      <P>Work permit policy is based on the need to ensure that job opportunities which arise in the State are, as far as possible, reserved for Irish or EEA (European Economic Area) nationals. Work permits are not granted unless the employer can show that, despite all reasonable efforts having been made, there are no suitably qualified Irish or EEA nationals available for the position in question.  In addition we must also now have regard to the employment requirements of the growing legally resident non-EEA Muslim community in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I should point out that, according to our records, the company concerned currently have five permits in respect of the Ballyhaunis plant and have, to date, been issued with a total of 27 work permits in respect of ritual slaughtermen by my Department.</P>

      <P>Participants in community employment receive a personal allowance which is pitched at a slightly higher level than their previous social welfare entitlements. Participants can also qualify for additional allowances in respect of an adult dependant and-or dependent children if they had such an entitlement under their previous social welfare claim. As an employment scheme, CE pays a personal rate above that which a participant would otherwise receive on social welfare, as an incentive to participate.</P>
      <P>For reasons to do with anti-poverty measures dependant allowance for persons on unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit are somewhat higher than those paid on community employment.  However, the total payment to a CE participant is generally higher than he-she would receive as an unemployment payment.  At present a CE participant with an adult dependant receives £124.85 per week compared to an entitlement of £107.50 per week for a person with an adult dependant on unemployment assistance.</P>

In that context, a great number of international agreements covering a wide range of subjects fall under the auspices of the Department and it must consider <Col N="240" /> on an ongoing basis the desirability of Ireland becoming party to those agreements to which it is not already party.

      <P>Agreement was achieved at the Telecommunications Council on 18 December 1996 to a draft Directive entitled Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the development and improvement of community postal services.</P>
      <P>The draft Directive represents the first phase in the liberalisation of the postal sector in the EU.</P>
      <P>The essential elements of the Directive are as follows:</P>
      <P>(1) the defining of the minimum universal service as the permanent provision of a postal service of specified quality at all points in the territory at affordable prices for all users including door-to-door deliveries five days per week as well as ensuring that the density of contact points is adequate for the needs of users;</P>
      <P>(2) rules on quality of service (for both national and cross-Border mail), cost accounting and terminal dues (the arrangements by which postal operators compensate each other for delivery of cross-Border mail) which are related to costs;</P>
      <P>(3) the designation of a national regulatory authority in each member state legally separate from and operationally independent of the postal authority;</P>
      <P>(4) a reserved area of letter mail costing up to five times the basic tariff and weighing up to 350 grammes to support the universal service (any mail outside these parameters will be liberalised when the Directive comes into force);</P>
      <P>(5) that the Council and the European Parliament will decide not later than January 2000 on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of the postal sector on the basis of proposals to be made by the Commission before 1998 following a review of the sector &mdash; this further liberalisation to take effect from 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" />The Government supports the proposals contained in the Directive.  Secondary legislation to transpose the provisions of the Directive will be prepared and signed in 1998.</P>

    <P>(¹) This agreement entered into force on 29 January, 1968. The Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Bill, when enacted, will allow Ireland to accede to the agreement. It is hoped that this will be effected early in 1998.</P>
    <P>(²) To date these agreements have not been considered appropriate for signature, having regard to some aspects of the content.  However, this matter falls to be reconsidered, following consultation with the Attorney General, in the light of the recent agreements listed at 7 and 8 above.</P>
    <P>(³) Ratification of this agreement is expected to take place within the next month.</P>
    <P>(4) The question of signture of these Conventions is under review in consultation with the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Note: The European Energy Charter Treaty has been signed by Ireland and is now in the process of being ratified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Aviation Authority has two primary roles: to regulate the safety standards of the Irish aviation industry and to provide air traffic control and related communications services in Irish controlled airspace.</P>
      <P>In fulfilling its safety regulations role the IAA operates to international safety standards as laid down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), The Joint Aviation Authorities of Europe and the European Union.  Its costs in discharging this role are recovered through charges levied for services to the Irish aviation sector for such activities as aircraft registration, pilot licences, etc.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the air traffic control service operates to guidelines laid down by ICAO and by Euro-control, the European organisation for the safety of air navigation.  It operates on a cost recovery basis, recouping its costs from airlines in line with charging principles laid down by ICAO and Eurocontrol.</P>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied with the current arrangements for safety regulation and air traffic control operations within the Authority.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 1997 suckler cows premium grants on 39 animals.  At an onfarm inspection carried out on 15 October 1997 he presented what he claimed were 37 of the original animals applied on plus suitable replacements for two others.  He claimed a retagged animal presented was one of the animals included on his application.</P>
      <P>My Department is not satisfied that the two animals which had been replaced at date of inspection were, in fact, cows at the date of application as they were described as one and a half years old and females on a veterinary test on 6 March 1997 and there are no calves registered in the Bandon database showing the animals in question as dams.  A veterinary test report indicates that the animal which was retagged and presented as an animal listed on the application was not one of those included on the original application.  The person named was informed of the position by letter dated 13 November 1997 and that his application could not be processed further until these matters were resolved.</P>

One of these conditions provides that aid may be paid in the form of an annual supplement to the normal retirement pension paid by the State.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 165 and 168 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial action relates to the filling of the post of chief staff valuer which fell vacant in March 1996.  As part of the ongoing restructuring of the office, local management in the Valuation Office did not wish to fill the post and entered into discussions with the trade union IMPACT to see if a mutually acceptable alternative to filling the vacancy could be found.  To date, it has not been possible to reach agreement on the issue. Local management is, however, available for discussions <Col N="257" /> on the subject.  I am prepared to consider any reasonable proposal which satisfies the requirements of both management and the interests of Valuation Office staff and which has regard to relevant pay and staff numbers policies.</P>
    <P>There is agreed industrial relations machinery for dealing with such disputes between management and staff representatives.  It would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the dispute. The industrial action in the Valuation Office is causing some inconvenience, but has no effect on the rights of ratepayers or on revenues of the local authorities.  I am, however, keeping the situation in this regard under review.</P>

      <P>As I reported to this House on 8 October I have asked KPMG Management Consulting to undertake a study into the consequences for Ireland of ending duty free sales for intra-EU travel.  This study will be looking at the direct consequences on employment, and to the extent that the abolition of duty free sales will directly affect the tourism industry, this will be taken into account.  The study will include an assessment of the extent to which travel fares may rise if operators are no longer able to cross subsidise activities from the profits made on duty free sales.</P>
      <P>However, people come to Ireland for a number of reasons and the availability of duty free is hardly likely to be the main one.  The number of people travelling has been increasing significantly, and the travel industry is extremely competitive.  Also, one of the reasons for the delay in ending duty free sales until 1999 was to allow the travel industry time to diversify and thus minimise any negative impact on its ending.  The KMPG study is not likely to be completed until the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the annual small gains exemption limit which has always been part of the capital gains tax code.  Chargeable gains, from whatever source, in excess of this exemption limit in a year of assessment are subject to capital gains tax at either the standard rate of 40 per cent or the reduced rate of 26 per cent.  In general the effect of inflation, by way of indexation, is taken into account in arriving at a chargeable gain.</P>
      <P>The annual small gains exemption limit for individuals is £1,000.  For 1981-82 and previous years the exemption was £500, and for 1982-83 up to 1991-92 the annual exemption was £2,000 for each individual.  Since 1992 the exemption limit was reduced to £1,000 per annum.  It was reduced specifically to discourage the practice of &ldquo;bed and breakfasting&rdquo;, a process whereby shares were sold and subsequently re-purchased solely to rebase their value and realise capital gains under the threshold, i.e. tax free.  I understand that in the United Kingdom, every individual has an annual exemption amount of £6,500 (1997-98).  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, all taxation areas are reviewed every year in the context of the annual budget.</P>

      <P>I announced on 4 November 1997 that the Government had decided that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum adjustment of 3 per cent in their pensions (or a 2 per cent in the case of those pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent).</P>
      <P>This is in line with the joint Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats pre-election press statement of 4 June 1997 which said, <i>inter alia</i>, the &ldquo;in Government they will resolve the problems surrounding the pensions of retired public service staff&rdquo; and they are &ldquo;committed to restoring the link between pensions and increases in current rates of public sector pay&rdquo; and the Government undertaking in its programme, Action Programme for the Millennium, to protect public service pensions.</P>
      <P>In its interim report, the Commission on Public Service Pensions stressed that its comments on pensions increase policy are necessarily incomplete and preliminary.  It emphasised that it would be considering this issue within the broad range of pension issues coming within its remit and on which it is scheduled to report to Government in 1998.  Nevertheless, its preliminary view was that pensions should be increased in order to provide a secure and fair level of retirement income to pensioners.  The Commission went on to suggest that there are three principal pension increase options available (in line with pay, in line with the CPI or in line with some other index appropriate to pensioners) and it will consider each of these in its final report.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes the commission's interim report and looks forward to receiving its final report next year.</P>

      <P>The total income tax and corporation tax liability of playschools, kindergarten and Montessori schools for the years 1994-95, the latest year for which the figures are avilable, is of the order of £980,000.  This does not, however, include creches which are classified elsewhere with other miscellaneous personal services and which cannot therefore be separately identified without carrying out an individual examination of all the tax returns for such cases.  Such an examination could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Stamp duty on property has an important role to play in shifting some of the burden of taxation on wage and salary income to property.  The stamp duty yield from the transfer of real property, including second hand houses, for 1996 was £194 million.  If the present level of stamp duty on second hand residential property was reduced there would be a significant on-going cost to the Exchequer.  It seems likely that any such reduction would benefit sellers most and would become built into the level of house prices generally.  Apart from reducing Exchequer revenue, with no apparent benefit to the purchaser, such action could therefore further accelerate an already over-heated property market.</P>

    <P>¹ In addition to cars the figures shown for MVED and VRT include MVED collected on commercial vehicles up to 1992 and VRT collected on certain car derived vans (category B vehicles) registered between 1993 and 1996.</P>
    <P>² VAT Figures shown are estimates as VAT payment statistics do not identify particular goods or services.</P>
    <P>³ Figures for 1993 include a carryover of £7.8 million MVED and £6 million VAT from 1992.</P>
    <P>4 These are gross figures from which the following repayments were made: £18.1 million (1993); £24.3 million (1994); £29.4 million (1995); £51.3 million (1996).  These were made under the various VRT repayment schemes i.e leasing, demonstration, short-term car hire, disabled drivers and scrappage scheme (operable from 1 July 1995).</P>
    <P>5 The amount of VAT shown for 1993 reflects the abolition of VAT at point of entry and the fact that VAT collected covers the period January to October 1993.</P>
    <P>In view of the variety of methods of calculation and the different rates charged it is not possible to provide a detailed account of the level of taxation applied to cars in other European countries. However, a background paper issued by the European Commission DGXXI entitled &ldquo;Vehicle Taxation in the European Union 1997&rdquo; indicates the following: all 15 member states charge VAT on new cars &mdash; the rate varies from 15 per cent (Germany and Luxembourg) to 25 per cent (Denmark and Sweden); Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden and the United Kingdom do not charge <Col N="262" /> registration tax while in France and Italy the tax is of a nominal nature; the basis on which the registration tax is charged varies in the case of the remaining nine member states e.g.</P>
    <P>&mdash;in Austria the tax has regard to the level of fuel consumption;</P>
    <P>&mdash;in Belgium tax is charged on the basis of the cubic capacity of the engine with a discount allowed for the age of the car;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the remaining countries charge tax on the basis of the selling price of the car either inclusive or exclusive of the registration tax and in some cases the rate also varies depending on the size of the engine;</P>
    <P>the highest levels of registration tax are applied in Denmark, Finland, Greece and Portugal.</P>

      <P>As regards the PRSI deduction on retired PAYE staff, this deduction refers to the health contribution and the employment and training levy (levies) as retired people are not liable to PRSI. The levies are charged at a rate of 2.25 per cent on a person's total income from all sources with only a few exceptions, e.g. social welfare payments, including social welfare pensions.  Occupational pensions are, therefore, liable to the levies.</P>
      <P>However, the 1994 budget introduced a low income exemption threshold for the levies of £173 per week of £9,000 per annum which means that where a person's income is lower than the threshold they are not liable to the levies.  Prior to the 1994 budget the levies were applied to a person's income irrespective of the amount earned.  The threshold figure of £173 per week, or £9,000 per annum, was selected on the basis that two thirds of the average industrial wage is a widely used international measure of low pay.  Following this year's budget the threshold is now £197 per week or £10,250 per annum.</P>
      <P>In relation to the cost of exempting pensioners from the levies, it is estimated that exempting all people aged 65 and over from the levies would cost around £25 million (data for pensioners on their own is not available).  While the low income threshold will continue to be increased there are no plans to exempt occupational pensions from the levies.  However, the overall tax burden on the elderly is of concern to the Government and will be borne in mind in the context of preparations for the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>There are three EU directives coming wholly or partly under the auspices of my Department or agencies under the aegis of my Department that are not currently fully implemented.  The details are as follows: Department of Finance Directive 97/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on Cross-Border Credit Transfers of 27 January 1997.</P>
      <P>This directive relates to payments being made by a person in one member state to a beneficiary in another member state and covers issues of transparency and the availability of information on transfers, time limits on transfers and liability for non-completion of transfers.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to transpose the directive by Statutory Instrument before the deadline for transposition of 14 August 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive 97/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on investor compensation schemes was adopted on 3 March 1997 and came into force on 26 March 1997.  The directive must <Col N="264" /> be implemented within 18 months of the date on which it came into force, that is 26 September 1998.  Draft legislation to implement Directive 97/9/EC, and to provide for investor compensation generally, is being finalised by my Department in consultation with the Departments of Enteprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>A Memorandum for Government requesting the authority to arrange the accession by Ireland to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners Convention on Customs treatment of Pool containers used in International Transport which is under the aegis of the United Nations, is currently in preparation.  The convention will enter into force on 17 January 1998 and it is intended that Ireland will accede to the convention before that date.</P>
    <P>OECD/Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters has not been signed by Ireland.  The convention was opened for signature in 1988.  The convention entered into force on 1 April 1995 after the requisite five states consented to its entering into force.  The convention would involve Ireland in the collection of revenue claims of other countries, which presents a number of legal difficulties.  There are no immediate plans for Ireland to sign the convention, though the legal difficulties are under consideration.  To date only seven countries have signed and ratified the convention.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 173 together.  I indicated in my reply to parliamentary questions from the Deputy on 4 November 1997 that I had approved a capital grant of £475,000 for the purchase of a CT scanner at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown and the necessary infrastructural work associated with the installation of the machine.</P>
      <P>I understand from St. Columcille's Hospital that the radiology department at the hospital will be extended to accommodate the CT scanner.</P>
      <P>The level of revenue funding required in 1998 to commission this service will depend on the timing of purchase and installation of the equipment and also the completion of building works.  My Department is in discussion with the Eastern Health Board regarding these issues.</P>

In 1996 a capital grant of £300,000 was approved towards the upgrading of electrical services.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174, 175, 176, 177 and 178 together.</P>
      <P>Assisted reproduction is not available within the public hospital service.  Accordingly, persons who undergo such treatment do so in a private capacity.  In vitro fertilisation treatment is, I understand, provided on this basis at the human assisted reproduction unit at the Rotunda Hospital and at University College Hospital, Galway.  These services operate under the guidelines in relation to such treatment issued by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland and approved by Medical Council.  The Well Woman Centre provides a donor insemination service using imported semen in accordance with the UK guidelines of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that proposals in relation to assisted human reproduction raise significant legal and ethical issues.  I am of the view that a careful examination of the full range of matters in this complex area is needed and I am currently considering how best these might be addressed.</P>

It was the view of the Department of Education that Montessori schools did not provide an educational programme similar to a national school and thus it was decided not to exempt Montessori schools from the regulations.</P>

      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to my reply of 12 November 1997.</P>
      <P>Successful completion of the students of the three-year registration/diploma programme leads to registration as general nurses with An Bord Altranais, at which point they will become eligible for employment.  As a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, the particular one-year degree course proposed by University College Galway would essentially be an additional course leading to an optional post-registration qualification.  Students wishing to undertake the degree course would, therefore, have to meet the costs involved themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that the specific programme which the students entered in 1994 is currently the subject of an independent external evaluation being undertaken by a team from the School of Education and Nursing, University of Southampton, under the management of the Institute of Public Administration.  In addition, the interim report of the Commission on Nursing has identified a number of issues relating to the registration/diploma programme generally, which the commission is expected to address in its final report.  I do not propose to make any changes in the present arrangements for pre-registration <Col N="270" /> nursing education and training pending the completion of these two important exercises.</P>
    <P>The approval of the payment of higher education grants is one for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.  I have no function in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991 imposed a statutory duty on health boards to carry out, as soon as practicable, assessments for foreign adoptions.  In carrying out this function, the boards must have regard to the competing demands in other areas of the child care services, particularly in relation to the protection of children from abuse and neglect, which takes priority over all other work.</P>
      <P>However, that said, I understand that prospective adopters in the Eastern Health Board area are experiencing delays in having adoptions assessments commenced in comparison with applicants in other boards.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1994 the Minister for Health signed an agreement on Working Arrangements for the Co-ordination of InterCountry Adoption with the Romanian Committee for Adoption.  This committee was dissolved earlier this year and a new committee established in Romania.</P>
      <P>In July of this year the new Romanian Committee for Adoption forwarded a new draft agreement to the Adoption Board.  No advance notification was received in writing or otherwise from the Romanian committee of its intention to withdraw from the original agreement.  Paragraph 11 of the 1994 agreement states that either party may terminate the agreement by giving three months notice in writing to the other party of this intention and that such termination will not affect the completion of adoptions already in progress. It would appear that the Romanian authorities have suspended all adoptions of Romanian children by Irish couples pending the signing of the new agreement.</P>
      <P>The new draft agreement was examined by both my Department and the Adoption Board and it was agreed that a number of minor amendments should be proposed.  My Department wrote to the Romanian Government in mid September 1997, enclosing a draft of the proposed amendments.  The Romanian Committee for Adoptions has recently agreed the changes proposed by this Department and it is my intention to bring the final text of the agreement before Government shortly.</P>

      <P>I was recently unable to visit the hospital due to unforeseen circumstances.  However, I intend to reschedule my visit at an early date.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the alleged incident which took place at the hospital on 5 June 1997.  The matter was reported promptly to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and I understand that the incident is now a matter of investigation by the gardaí</P>
      <P>I understand the management and the unions representing the staff at the hospital have been involved in ongoing discussions regarding security at the hospital and that a number of measures have been undertaken or are about to be undertaken to improve security on the hospital campus. I have been assured by the management at the hospital that it is making every effort to resolve the security issues and I hope it will be possible to reach a consensus with the unions involved in the best interests of patients and staff.</P>

      <P>Following on the introduction of Class A PRSI for community employment (CE) workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996, CE workers who revert to the live register may qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit as a result of having paid at least 13 Class A PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>In such cases, the earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.  The social welfare secondary benefits, including the Christmas bonus, are payable only with long-term social welfare payments.  Unemployment benefit claimants do not therefore have an entitlement to these benefits.  While I recognise the difficulties faced by CE workers who re-qualify for unemployment benefit when their period of CE finishes, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot introduce special concessionary arrangements for such people without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry an extremely high cost and could only be considered in the light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>

The directive was due to be brought into effect by 1 September 1997.  It is proposed that this will be done by way of Statutory Instrument and arrangements to this end are in hand at present.  2. Directive 97/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997 amending Council Directive 89/552/EEC on the co-ordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in member states concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities.  The directive is due to be brought into force not later than 31 December 1998.  It has yet to be decided if primary legislation or a statutory instrument will be the means of bringing the provisions of the directive into force in Irish law.  3. Directive 97/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1997 amending Council Directive 92/43/EEC (the Habitats Directive) of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora.  This directive, which amends the Annexes to the Habitats Directive, is due to be brought into force by 31 <Col N="281" /> December 1997 and arrangements to this end are in hand.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to my Department is as follows: The European Convention on Transfrontier Television: the body responsible for this convention is the Council of Europe and it was opened for signature in Strasbourg on 5 May 1989.  It is Ireland's intention to sign and ratify this convention, but it is under amendment at present.  Unidroit Convention on the International Return of Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects: this convention was adopted in Rome on 23 June 1995.  It is my intention that this convention would be signed by Ireland.  To this end, following the recent report of the Law Reform Commission which recommended accession to the convention, I have agreed to take the lead in discussing the initial issues arising in relation to the question of ratification and of subsequent implementation of the convention with my Cabinet colleagues, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General.  Ratification and implementation may require legislative action.</P>
      <P>European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages: this Charter was opened for signature by the Council of Europe for signing on 5 November 1992.  The question of this country signing is under consideration.</P>
      <P>European Convention on Cinematographic Co-operation: this convention was opened for signature by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on 2 October 1992 and came into force on 1 April 1994 when five member states had ratified it.  My Department intends ratifying this treaty in the first half of 1998.</P>
      <P>Ireland/Australia Film Co-Production Agreement: following the initialling ceremony in Dublin last June, the position is that the agreement must obtain Australian parliamentary approval as well as Government approval here before formal ratification.  These procedures are in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that while the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Agreement, <Col N="282" /> under the Bonn Convention, on the Conservation of Migratory African-Eurasian Waterbirds have been signed by Ireland, the ratification of those agreements cannot take place until the amendments of the Wildlife Act, 1976 (which I propose to introduce early next year) have been enacted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  One scheme is the 1979 scheme for the employment of caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI.  However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant.  The second scheme is the provision by my Department of additional capitation grants for primary schools as agreed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and has been in operation since 1 September 1992.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provided for the introduction of a phased scheme of additional capitation grants with a view to expanding the provision of caretaking and clerical services to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.  This scheme did not provide for the linking of those additional grants to any particular payscale.  In the circumstances the priority has been to extend the scheme in the first instance to schools which have no caretaking or clerical provision.  The position of schools which are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the terms of the scheme will be examined in the context of any improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the future.</P>

      <P>There are 1,588 permanent ex-quota remedial teacher posts, 211 permanent resource teacher posts and 14 temporary resource teacher posts in schools at primary and post-primary levels.  The information regarding the number of remedial and resource posts by county is outlined in tables A and B.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the board of management of each school with an ex-quota resource teacher to recruit the teacher whom they consider to be most suitable, irrespective of gender.  Information on the gender of resource teachers is not kept in my Department in a readily accessible format.</P>
      <P>The information regarding the number of pupils assessed as having special needs who are enrolled in mainstream schools is not available. However, it is estimated that there are approximately 8,000 children with special needs attending schools on a fully integrated basis.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Regional Technical College Tallaght that this student applied and was accepted for entry to the open national diploma in electronics which the college offers on a part-time basis to any qualified applicant.  This course was not offered on a distance learning basis and the student would have been aware of this when he applied.</P>
      <P>In relation to distance-learning option the position is that the Regional Technical College Tallaght is currently piloting a national diploma in electronics in distance learning mode in partnership with Intel Ireland who are contributing substantial funding.  This pilot is based on an existing Intel specific national diploma in electronics and the students are drawn from Intel for the course. As the student in question is not an employee of Intel, this course was never available or open to him.  This pilot run will enable the college to test the material, delivery methods and support mechanisms in preparation for making this and other courses available as part of the college's normal programme.</P>

The local authority accepted the late application and processed it accordingly. They wrote to the student on 19 September 1997 informing him he was ineligible for a higher education grant on the basis that his father's reckonable income exceeded the limits set down in the grants scheme.</P>
      <P>However, they have since reviewed the case and have requested further income details from the applicant.  On receipt of this information Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will issue a decision in this case.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  One scheme is the 1979 scheme for the employment of caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI.  However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant.  The second scheme is the provision by my Department of additional capitation grants for primary schools as agreed under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and has been in operation since 1 September 1992.</P>
      <P>St. Kevin's school had a full time caretaker under the 1979 scheme until November 1996 at which stage the caretaker resigned.  The school at this time was not eligible for the appointment of a replacement full-time caretaker and consequently my Department has since provided funding to the school on the basis of the additional capitation grants agreed under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.  St. Kevin's school is currently in receipt of a grant of £15 per pupil per annum (subject to a maximum grant of £7,500) towards the cost of caretaking services.  Under the scheme the school authority has discretion to apply the funding to meet its particular caretaking needs.</P>

      <P>My Department's professional advisers have examined and reported on the present heating system at this school.  They have advised that the existing storage heating system is the most suitable for this size of school.  Installation of additional heaters will resolve the current heating problems.

      <P>The original site for the proposed Regional Technical College, beside the Blanchardstown shopping centre, proved unsuitable following extensive investigation.  My Department has since identified an alternative site comprising circa 45 acres at Blanchardstown for the college. The site, which is being developed by the IDA and Fingal Council as part of a scientific-industrial and business park, is considered to be suitable.  The relevant provisions have already been made in the 1997 Estimates to facilitate the acquisition of the site.</P>
      <P>The acquisition documentation is at present being processed by the respective legal advisers with a view to having the final stages completed at an early date.</P>
