      <Quest>if he will give details of the Government's plans to support the construction of a memorial monument in Messines, Belgium, to commemorate Irish First World War dead.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a meeting I had with members of the Journey of Reconciliation Trust, including Mr. Glen Barr and Mr. Paddy Harte, I announced that the Government would provide £150,000 towards the cost of a First World War memorial in Belgium for all the Irishmen who died in the conflict.  The memorial is to be erected at Messines which is the only location where the 36th Ulster Division and the 16th Irish Division fought side by side in that war.  The funding will come from moneys accruing to the Government in connection with the winding up of the Irish Soldiers and Sailors Land Trust, a body established in 1922-23 to provide housing for veterans of the First World War.</P>
      <P>The memorial will not only recall the sacrifices of those from all parts of Ireland and from all political and religious traditions who fought and fell in the war but will also serve as a powerful symbol of reconciliation in the present day.  I warmly commend the trust on its initiative.</P>
      <P>Political controversies and divisions of the past must be transcended in favour of common humanity and in the interests of our future and that of our children.  There needs to be room for all traditions and recognition that there are many different ways in which fine people try to serve their country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was entirely fitting that I announced the Government's plans on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Enniskillen bombing.  I note my announcement was welcomed in editorials in the <i>Irish News</i> and <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> and that they coupled it with the SDLP Mayors of Belfast and Derry taking leading roles at the Remembrance Day ceremonies in their respective cities. I endorse the view of the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> that <Col N="486" />&ldquo;In these days of confidence-building, these are important gestures&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in commending the SDLP mayors of Derry and Belfast on taking part in the Remembrance Day commemorations. It was a courageous and important gesture on their part.  I also compliment the Taoiseach on his initiative in allocating funds for the erection of a memorial to the Irish men in the British Army, in both the Ulster Division and the 16th Irish Division, who died in and around Messines. How much money is accruing to the Government under the winding up of the sailors' and soldiers' land trust?  What proportion of this has been allocated to this project and how much remains?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his remarks.  The Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust is in the process of being wound up.  When this is complete, approximately £1 million will become available, most likely some time in the new year.  At that stage, advertisements will be placed in the national newspapers inviting individuals and bodies to apply for appropriate grant aid, and criteria will be issued to assist applicants. In the meantime, if money is required for the project, it will be provided initially by the Exchequer which will be refunded by money from the trust. This will cost approximately £150,000 which should leave about £800,000 in the trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall the important commemoration which took place at the memorial in Islandbridge on the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II.  Will he consider allocating some of the money from the balance of the trust fund towards further improvements to the memorial on the banks of the Liffey at Islandbridge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall that initiative of the then Taoiseach and was honoured to be there on the occasion.  The memorial needs substantial funding.  Some of the international media which were there recently pointed out that, while the location was beautiful, a number of improvements could be made to the site.  I have taken that into account.  A proposal would probably need to be put forward to obtain funding, but I will examine the issue nonetheless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, as the State administers and maintains Islandbridge, the initiative to use trust funds for this will have to come from either himself or the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine the issue, but there is a difficulty in that one of the agreements in the winding up of the Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust is that it will not be disbursed in a narrow way and used for a specific governmental purpose.  However, I will examine the issue to see <Col N="487" /> if some procedure could be adopted to fulfil the Deputy's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to this project.  My colleague, the former Deputy, Paddy Harte, is committed to this project. Will the Taoiseach indicate if the design or the nature of the monument has been decided? What is envisaged will be its form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McGinley that Paddy Harte has long been associated with this issue, and both he and Glen Barr are the two central figures.  The peace park will be located on the outskirts of Messines which is where the Ulster and Irish regiments fought alongside each other in the First World War.  The park will contain a number of features intended to represent the entire island without being denominational or particular to one community.  It will include a round tower, a physical structure readily identifiable with Ireland.  It will also consist of four areas symbolic of each of the provinces.  A map of the island will be laid out in a paved form with a variety of native trees and shrubs.  It is also planned to link the park by path to the nearby New Zealand monument which will be a symbolic linking of the northern and southern hemispheres while also linking the various traditions of Ireland.  The park will be used as a focus point to encourage cross community relations by sponsoring visits to the region, maintaining the park, studying historic causes and the effects of conflict and war.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister jointly turn the sod and launch this proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This suggestion has not yet been put to me.  There are a number of other proposals. The group will meet today and will contact me within the next week or so.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may realise, I give the bones of many interviews.  At times others put the flesh on those bones.  On this occasion, they put slightly more flesh on the bones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good reply; the Taoiseach gives out the bones and others get the flesh. This article appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 10 November.  I recommend that everyone read it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no task forces under the aegis of my Department.  However, my Department is represented on: the Task Force on the Implementation of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which is under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the Task Force on Services, which is under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and the Implementation Task Force on Communicating Europe, which is now under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach come to any conclusions on Communicating Europe on any modifications to the application of the McKenna judgment in relation to giving information in the Amsterdam Treaty referendum?  Can the Taoiseach give an indication of his plans in this area? Will we proceed by legislation or within the confines of the existing judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to this matter recently and we have not made any final decisions.  I am conscious this may require legislation. We need a more satisfactory procedure for dealing with this matter in a far more comprehensive way.  My initial advice is that legislation will be required.  My Department and the Department <Col N="489" /> of the Environment and Local Government are looking at how this may be dealt with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not only a question of legislation.  Whatever we do, I am anxious that we reflect on what happened in the recent referendum in terms of the format of nominating two people from the Bar Council who can briefly set out the case.  I have spoken to a number of people about this.  The Ministers and Secretaries group has discussed the referendum in detail.  It requires the Government to put forward the case in a proper manner.  I hope to finalise this matter before Christmas and provide a clear outline on how the Government intends to proceed.  The White Paper on the referendum will be published around Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm that the White Paper will be published before Christmas? What level of distribution of the White Paper is permissible according to the Attorney General? Can it be distributed comprehensively?  Is it his intention to produce a user-friendly synopsis of the White Paper, as White Papers are normally not very digestible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cabinet is currently considering the White Paper and how it should be presented.  It would have been discussed today but the Minister concerned is in Northern Ireland so it will be discussed next week.  The matters referred to by the Deputy will form part of those deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the substantial number of refugees, immigrant workers and illegal immigrants, and the fact that communities are in some cases reacting in an unhealthy way because they do not see any plan to deal with this in a co-ordinated manner, will the Taoiseach agree that it would be healthy to appoint a task force or at least a Minister to co-ordinate the response to this problem?  Would he agree that the racist comments made by some Members of this House are fuelling the problem and should be resisted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard any Members make such comments, but nobody should engage in racist comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Such comments are against the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I am well aware of the growing tensions which are inevitable.  I will consider the Deputy's suggestion.  The response does need to be co-ordinated and I realise the pressures being put on many services which in turn is resulting in many tensions in communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government inherited from its predecessors the ministerial task force on drugs.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that there is no necessity to consider the re-establishment of a task force of relevant Ministers in the context of the evolving nature of this problem?  I appreciate and welcome the fact that the day to day task of driving the programmes put in place by the previous Government has been allocated to the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood.  However, the Taoiseach has replaced the task force by a Cabinet committee and I am not sure it has met. Has the committee met in the context of next week's budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am chairing the Cabinet sub-committee which has met and discussed the issues in the context of the 1998 Estimates and budgetary matters.  The sub-committee is endeavouring to look at all the issues, with which Deputy Rabbitte will be very familiar, covering the recommendations of working groups including those on children sleeping rough, educational issues, disadvantage, etc.  We are discussing these with the relevant Ministers, including the Minister for Finance and the service Departments.  Behind this the various interested agencies are dealing directly with the Minister of State, Deputy Flood. It is working and I have been endeavouring to keep in touch with some of these groups through meeting them, going to the launch of some of their task forces and listening to their problems and hearing of the way in which they wish to proceed.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the provisions of the McKenna judgment are not applicable until after a referendum Bill has been passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case.  The issue of presenting a more extensive White Paper on the matter and the manner in which that should be done still needs to be addressed and we should avoid creating further difficulties.  It would seem that the manner in which the White Paper is presented to the public should be in the domain of the Government and should not be restricted by other considerations.  However, some people hold different views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that devolution should be taken seriously?  I understand <Col N="491" /> the reasons for the commission being transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach to the Department of Environment and Local Government but will the Taoiseach give the House an assurance that he will arrange for the commission to meet or, in fairness and courtesy to its members, will he tell them that the Government intends to take a different tack on this issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the commission has had formal meetings, it is my understanding that it is still working.  The chairman of the commission, Mr. Phil Flynn, and some of its members have communicated their views to me.  I will find out exactly what meetings have been held.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The general rule regarding the acceptance of public speaking engagements or media appearances by special advisers, related to their official duties or otherwise, is that they will be undertaken with the approval of the Taoiseach or the relevant Minister.  In the case of at least one of my own advisers, that is written into his contract.  I would normally receive an advance copy of any such speech.  The Deputy will be aware that, under the same general rule, senior permanent public servants can from time to time be asked and be given permission to speak in public by the Taoiseach or a Minister.</P>
      <P>In the past, special advisers depending on their background and expertise have, on occasion, made television programmes, appeared on discussion panels, written books or edited party magazines.  Unlike the permanent public service, special advisers are not required to be politically neutral and can be members of political parties. Under the Deputy's own Administration one adviser played a very prominent public role in relation to his party.  Those, on the other hand, who have a special expertise in particular areas can play a useful role in the work of communicating the background considerations influencing Government thinking.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I attended the Special European Council on Employment in Luxembourg on Thursday, 20 and Friday, 21 November.  As the Deputies will be aware, I made a statement to the House on Tuesday, 18 November 1997, which set out Ireland's position on the Special European Council. I also placed copies in the Library of the House of the paper entitled &ldquo;Special European Council on Employment: An Irish Perspective&rdquo; which I circulated to my colleagues in the European Council before the summit.</P>
      <P>The Special European Council was very successful. The Council conclusions, copies of which I have arranged to be placed in the Library of the House, include employment policy guidelines for member states which were endorsed by the Council. These guidelines commit member states to focus their efforts on four key pillars of employment policy, namely, improving the employability of the unemployed, developing entrepreneurship, encouraging adaptability in business and their employees and strengthening equal opportunities for employment between men and women.</P>
      <P>While having the necessary degree of flexibility to allow for differing conditions in member states, the guidelines set out reasonably specific targets in relation to interventions by member states especially in regard to the crucial areas of youth unemployment and long-term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Member states will now be required to draw up employment action plans within the framework of the guidelines.  Member states' performance in regard to the implementation of these action plans will be subject to a surveillance process at EU level.  In my view, the guidelines and the follow-up surveillance mechanism which have been agreed will facilitate a more co-ordinated approach to employment policy throughout Europe and will be a stimulus to strengthening <Col N="493" /> efforts in combating unemployment on a national level.  This is a new and significant development which will, I believe, improve Europe's employment performance.</P>
    <P>From an Irish perspective, many of the programmes we have in place for the young and long-term unemployed are consistent with the guidelines.  We will, where necessary, intensify our efforts.  Work will also now commence on drawing up Ireland's employment action plan under the procedure agreed.  The action plan will be drawn up in consultation with the social partners, reflecting the relevant provisions of Partnership 2000.  I envisage that it will spell out clear targets to ensure we maintain or accelerate our progress in reducing unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Special European Council also agreed a funding package to help foster job creation by releasing additional resources at EU level.  These resources will involve additional credits from the European Investment Bank and additional funds to be made available from the European budget. The beneficiaries of these additional funds will include small and medium sized enterprises which have been shown to be a particularly strong engine of employment growth throughout Europe in recent years.</P>
    <P>I raised at the Council the issue of the phasing out of duty-free facilities.  I pointed out that whilst the conclusions proposed to be adopted by the Council required that all Community policies should be harnessed in support of European employment, abolition of duty free trade would have an adverse effect on employment.  My intervention laid down a marker as to the importance of the issue for Ireland and the Government will continue to press the case on this issue.</P>
    <P>I met the UK Foreign Secretary, Mr Robin Cook, MP, on Monday, 3 November last.  Our discussions focused on EU issues, notably the Special European Council on Employment, Agenda 2000, economic and monetary union and the priorities of the UK Presidency which commences on 1 January next.  We also noted the excellent working relationship between our two Governments, especially in regard to the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>
    <P>The meeting afforded a very useful exchange of views on EU issues.  In particular, I relayed to Mr. Cook Ireland's general approach in regard to the Agenda 2000 issues and he briefed me on the UK position on EMU in the light of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's recent statement on the subject to the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>Overall, I believe our meeting, and Mr. Cook's visit in general, has improved mutual understanding of our countries' respective positions on EU issues and has helped lay the foundation for fruitful co-operation during next year's UK Presidency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance he participated in the decision to abolish duty free sales.  Does he agree that if that <Col N="494" /> decision were implemented it could cost up to 2,000 jobs in Ireland?  Will the Taoiseach explain why the Minister for Public Enterprise said two or three weeks ago that there is considerable support at the highest level in other member states for reversing the decision to phase out duty free sales while he indicated in Luxembourg that there was very little support for revising that decision in which he participated while Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue was recently discussed in the House and the Minister for Finance gave a very detailed reply.  In 1992 I was very pleased that, rather than banning duty free sales from 1 January 1993 as part of the harmonisation of taxes and the single market, the campaign which was led by several countries, including me on behalf of Ireland, managed to get an extension until 1 January 2000, which was a considerable improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not have done anything if the Taoiseach had not agreed because it required a unanimous decision.  All he had to do was say no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am shocked and aghast that the Deputy who understands the EU better than most Members, would not know that was one of the crucial decisions in the context of the single market.  We managed to get an extension.  It is all on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent four years setting it up for the Taoiseach and he dropped it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Deputy had done a bit more in the last while when nobody raised the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is still dining out on what I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We got it seven years later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We must deal with supplementary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The campaign continues, especially at the level of the Transport Ministers among whom there is agreement on the need to endeavour to get some changes made.  There is little support at ECOFIN level and there is some, but not much, support at heads of Government level.  In recent months, consultants to the Minister for Finance have been preparing a study on the impact of the decision on jobs and this will be ready in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to continue to make the case on this issue for two reasons.  First, decisions were made in the context of an ideal Single Market. However, this does not exist because of tax differentials and other disparities.  I have made this argument on previous occasions and I made again at the summit. Second, there was an understanding before the <Col N="495" /> decision was implemented that studies would be undertaken by the EU in advance to establish the effects of the abolition of duty free sales.  In 1996, the European Parliament ascertained that the EU Commission had taken the view that, since the decision had been made to abolish them, there was no need to undertake these studies.  I strongly contest that argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At what stage during the summit did the Taoiseach raise this issue?  Did he get a response from any of the other Prime Ministers? Did anybody support his case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stressed the Irish position and did not seek support.  I made my case in the main part of my contribution to the summit, before the heads of Government and where the Irish position would be understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the matter discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I framed my argument in the context of the employment study in the presence of the heads of Government &mdash; it is regrettable that such an approach was not adopted at previous summits &mdash; when we addressed the possibility of improving the position of the 18 million unemployed in the Union.  I was glad of the opportunity to point out that the only comprehensive EU study on the abolition of duty free sales indicated that another 140,000 people would be added to that list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>What response did the Taoiseach get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it would be easy for people on all sides of the House to score political points about what happened in the past?  The relevant issue is what he will do in the future.  Would he also agree that in making a broad presentation to the summit on the Government's position on the employment issue he put down a marker on the abolition of duty free?  If so, did he advance that marker in the form of a request to President Santer to initiate the studies which the EU has declined to undertake?  Will he indicate if he received support from the Finnish or Greek heads of Government whose representative at ECOFIN have expressed concerns regarding their transport costs to the rest of the EU?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Support offered in the past continues; the difficulty rests with the EU Commission, not with the ECOFIN Council or the European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Commission has been approached by the industry, the trade unions, some employers, Transport Ministers and other delegations, including ourselves, but it is holding <Col N="496" /> firm.  It does not want to change the decision because it believes that to do so would represent a major row back from its concept of the Single Market.  It also believes that the original adjustment period, from 1993-2000, was probably too long.</P>
      <P>I raised the matter with President Santer and others at the fringes of meetings at the summit. The format of these meetings was not ideal and I hope to raise the matter again in a more formal context.  I hope to discuss this matter, Agenda 2000 and EMU at an upcoming meeting which I have been requesting for some time.  I also intend raising it again in the context of the meetings on 12 and 13 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept my commendation for admitting the gross error of his ways in 1991-2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My successful ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is of any comfort to him I remind him of the text, &ldquo;There is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ten just men who do not need repentance.&rdquo;  Will he now employ the zeal of the convert in campaigning for this?  Does he agree, notwithstanding what he said, that it is a cause for serious concern that Commissioner Monti has only in recent days shown himself to be unbudging on this and will the Taoiseach apply himself to the Commissioner in the same way he contributed to his self-education? Is that where he needs to put in the effort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At least I am putting in the effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the Transport Ministers set up for the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will follow the advice of Deputy Quinn and not go back too much into the past as it is a very sorry story.  I note what Commissioner Monti stated in the European Parliament. Under pressure from members of the parliament, he seemed to claim this is his position but if somebody changes it he is prepared to move on.  That is not the technical legal position as the matter rests with him.  We must continue to lobby on this question.  The decision in 1991-2 was greatly appreciated by the duty free industry across the Community, not only in this country.  It was on the understanding, not the agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That studies would be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I looked at the wording very carefully before I went to the summit.  I read the entire document last week and cross referenced it.  There was a clear understanding and one could not take any interpretation other than that the studies would be done prior to the final trigger.  Somewhere along the way the Commission made a decision not to do that.  Regardless <Col N="497" /> of what happens and what decision is finally made, it behoves the Commission and those of us who have some voice to make the point that the study should be carried out.  We are doing it in the context of our national position but it should be done in the context of the EU.  That is a fair line of argument and one which I will push.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is not persuaded that 2,000 jobs are at risk as a result of this decision on duty free sales, how many jobs does he believe are at risk if he does not manage to pull it out of the fire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only figure I can give is 140,000, based on the only authoritative study carried out by the industry.  That is the figure in the documents I quoted from on Friday last.  In terms of Ireland the study covered much of the work done by the previous Minister for Finance and followed on by the current Minister and the report will be finished by Christmas.  We will then see the position in the context of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>An integral feature of the midwest region and Shannon is duty free shopping and there is concern on this issue in Shannon, Dublin and Cork especially.  Does the Taoiseach find at European level that he is reminded by his European counterparts of his agreement in 1991-2 and does it make the position difficult that he is seen as inconsistent on this issue in looking for the continuance of duty free sales?  As the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, refused to participate in a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, would the Taoiseach agree that, even with a study, he is whistling past the graveyard, that he is not really serious and has given up on the cause already?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be charitable to the Deputy.  The view is to the contrary, that in l992 a number of us got far too much, and the Commission does not want a repetition.  That is how the Commission would look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach did not say that in public.  That is a hell of a negotiating position. All he had to do in l992 was to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making the arguments we made then.  I do not accept what was said about the report for the reasons I stated earlier and because the ideal Single Market that was spoken about at the beginning of the l990s does not reflect itself.  Disparities in taxes and duties and other issues mean that the reason for abolishing duty free is not nearly as strong as it was towards the end of the last decade and the beginning of this one.  Equally, many countries take no particular interest in this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach optimistic?  He is pessimistic.  He should be honest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there is a certain sense of complacency and <Col N="498" /> cosiness about this debate?  We are talking about an emerging crisis in relation to transport costs on this island, the only part of the European Union that is not physically connected to the rest of it.  According to preliminary studies, there will be serious implications to the extent that in some cases the ferry services on the southern corridor could be discontinued altogether.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to give an undertaking to this House that, in view of the strategic importance of the impact of the abolition of duty free on access costs to Ireland as well as on internal employment costs, which are important but secondary, he will raise this with the President of the Commission as a matter of strategic importance to Ireland, and serve notice that Ireland's attitude in respect of other matters will be informed by how well the Commission responds to Ireland's indication that this is a matter of strategic concern and not an academic desire to complete the internal market from the perspective of tax harmonisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the line I am taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not come across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been very little support for this issue for a long time but that has not stopped us from continuing to raise the issue. Duty free was very nearly abolished before we got an extension because, to a number of countries, it is irrelevant and they find it hard to understand additionality in respect of Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need the Taoiseach to make that case.  We need him to make our case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Taoiseach's strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael should have been making the case last year, but did not do so.  The strategy is to talk to transport Ministers, ECOFIN, the European Council and the Commissioner and to keep making these points.  I do not want to mislead the House.  The position is the same now as it was last year.  The Commission is holding out on this.  I will attempt to deal directly with these issues armed with the report we will have in a few weeks, which will strengthen our argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened intently to his reply, I take it all the Taoiseach sought was a derogation.  Why was he associated with the unanimous agreement reached in 1991-2?  If this decision is to be reversed he should have the active public support of the Minister for Finance. It gives no comfort to see the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, struck dumb on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>Given the ramifications, that would not have been a bright decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin West</i>): On the critical level of unemployment in the EU, and leaving aside the usual plámás in communiqués and statements by party leaders after such meetings, will the Taoiseach agree that no serious quantifiable action is planned to bring to an end the scandal of 18 million unemployed in the EU?  There are vague aspirations but no sanctions are envisaged. What did Chancellor Kohl mean when he said: &ldquo;One thing is clear concerning public budgets, we will make no decisions which require additional funding&rdquo;?  Is it not the case that the unemployed are taking a poor second place in the gallop to cut back social and public spending to meet the criteria for EMU?  Is this not also shown by the fact that the EU will spend the same in direct cash terms on jobs over the next three years as it spent last year in subsidising the tobacco industry which created a product of such inferior quality it could not even be sold in the EU?</P>
      <P>The European Commission had a proposal before the summit to create 12 million jobs over five years but it was not agreed.  It also had a proposal to reduce the average unemployment rate for the entire Union from 10.6 per cent to 7 per cent but it also was not agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It still remains the Commission's target to reduce the unemployment rate to 7 per cent and to create 12 million jobs.  I do not accept the Deputy's assertion that this is all diplomatic plámás.  The policies pursued by the EU have led to a great improvement in employment in recent years.  In spite of some of the difficulties, the Single Market has broken down trade barriers and is a major contributor to economic growth and employment.  This has been the policy of the EU for more than a quarter of a century. Community policies, such as the Common Agricultural Policy and Cohesion and Structural Funds, have contributed directly and indirectly to the creation of employment in member states. Economic and monetary union which is due to come into effect from 1 January 1999 will also assist in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines, reporting structures and surveillance mechanisms in the programme will be of assistance as we move forward.  In the past people argued the Community was only interested in a monetarist philosophy and fiscal budgets, not growth.  The same mechanisms will obtain in creating jobs in that there will be an action plan for employment as there is for economic targets and people will have to meet those plans.  That has given a much better focus to the employment issue in the Community than has been the case in <Col N="500" /> the past.  I admit the system is not perfect, but it is better than that which existed in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's original reply he said that one of the four pillars of employment policy is to improve employability of the unemployed. He referred to extra credits from the European Investment Bank and additional funding from the budget.  Does he agree the biggest barrier to re-entry to the workforce for people clustered in the main unemployment areas is low skills, or no skills?  Will any of the additional money be devoted specifically to investment in training or retraining of the people in those geographic blackspots?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on the point made by Deputy Quinn about ferry services, the position here is already uncompetitive in that ferry fares per mile are far in excess of those in other European countries and the abolition of duty free sales will make that position even more uncompetitive. The European Union wants to abolish duty free sales on grounds of competition, but how can it stand over a proposition where the position would be more uncompetitive as a result of a widening of the gap between ferry fares to and from Ireland, which is dependent on tourism for its viability, and those for other European countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Rabbitte's question about the European Investment Bank, the money will, by and large, go towards SMEs. In the context of the other funding, the emphasis at the employment summit, and in our document, was on skills shortage, which is rapidly increasing in the European Union.  The next question deals with the information society.  While there is an enormous number of jobs throughout the Union in the skilled area, there is a shortage of skills.  In that context we must concentrate on upgrading the skills of FÁS trainees.  Money for that purpose comes from the European Social Fund.  That fund must be maintained into the next decade because skills are more necessary now than when we entered the Community in 1973.</P>
      <P>A sum of £250 million has been provided for education but, at the lower end of the scale people are dropping out of school early.  Many people on long-term unemployment worked in traditional industries and their only opportunity to get back into the labour market is by training and retraining.  That point was made by everybody last week.  Chancellor Kohl made an impassioned speech on this issue which, from a man of his expertise and years, was enlightening. He spoke about the importance of helping people who are socially disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett is right about ferry services.  In terms of competition, costs must be increased or there must be subsidisation.  The European view is that there cannot be subsidisation and, therefore, costs must be increased.  To reiterate for the third or fourth time, we have made this argument <Col N="501" /> but many countries on the European mainland are not concerned about it because they do not incur this inbuilt expense in their transport costs. We will continue to make this case.</P>

      <P>The following provisions of the Act have already been brought into operation: section 1 which provides for the short title and commencement; section 2 which relates to interpretation; section 4 which relates to the monitoring of the operation of the Act by the Public Offices Commission; Parts II and IV which provide, respectively, for the establishment of a constituency commission on a statutory basis and the disclosure by political parties, their members and candidates for election to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament of political donations received by them; sections 46, 47, 48, 57 (1), other than paragraph (b); sections 50 and 61, in so far as they relate to disclosure of donations received by candidates at a presidential election; section 71 which provides for the appointment of an officer by each political party who is responsible for ensuring compliance by the party with the provisions of the Act; section 73, other than paragraphs (a) and (c) which relate to the inspection of documents furnished to the Public Offices Commission under the Act; section 74 which contains a provision relating to offences by corporate bodies under the Act; section 76 which provides for amendments to the law relating to the registration of electors and postal voting; section 77 which provides for technical amendments to electoral and referendum law relating to the expenses of returning officers; section 80 which provides for an amendment to the law relating to the production, on foot of a court order, of Dáil election documents held by the Clerk of the Dáil; section 81 which provides for technical amendments of the law relating to the registration of political parties; and section 82 which amends local election regulations in line with other electoral codes which require public notice to be given by returning officers of polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following provisions are due to come into force on 1 January 1998: section 3 which provides for the increase of various monetary amounts and limits specified in the Act; Part III which provides for annual payments to political parties and for the reimbursement of election expenses of candidates at Dáil elections who save their deposits; Parts V and VI which provide for the limitation <Col N="502" /> of election expenses at Dáil and European elections and presidential elections, respectively; and section 23, other than those provisions already in operation.</P>
    <P>The Act provides that the remaining four sections should be brought into operation by a commencement order or orders to be made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  These are sections 72 which relates to donations and election expenses at local elections, section 75 which provides for a consequential amendment of the law relating to local election petitions, section 78 which amends the law relating to free postage for candidates and section 79 which provides for greater flexibility for returning officers in commencing the count earlier than allowed at present.  The commencement of those provisions will be considered in due course.</P>

      <P>I have not carried out a review of the system.  I have appointed Deputy Molloy, Minister of State at my Department, to head such a review.  The Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a commitment to review the electoral system. The purpose of the review is to initiate an informed debate on the system of election which is appropriate to modern circumstances.  The process for this review is being considered.  The electoral system has been in place for over 70 years and it is proper that it should now be the subject of a thorough examination and an informed public debate.  There are changes in the system which I would favour but it will be a matter for the review process to analyse all the possible options.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

Will the Minister indicate whether there are any particular terms of reference for the review &mdash; to head which he has appointed the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy &mdash; if so, in what direction it is heading, or is it simply another gabfest of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to divert attention from their inactivity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an exercise in kite flying. I have strong views on the electoral system and changes to it and have made them known in Opposition and quite recently.  We should have an informed public debate on the matter.  We are considering a number of options as to how that review might be undertaken.  Anybody who closes <Col N="506" /> their eyes to the need for a review of the electoral system is not doing a service to politics or the body politic.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will be interested in views from Opposition parties in relation to this matter but we can approach it in a number of different ways. For example, we could commission a report by consultants, the Department could prepare a Green Paper, we could establish a committee of experts to prepare a report or it could be referred to the all-party committee on the Constitution. There are a number of options to start the debate but the bottom line, so far as I am concerned, is that it is time to have an informed debate, not a debate about the 1950s, 1960s and so on.  We have to look at the options, the electoral system and a number of the other institutions of State to ensure they are geared for the new millennium.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, in relation to greenhouse gas emissions the Government intends to support at the Third Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto in December 1997; the action, if any, which is under way to ensure a co-ordinated EU position is put at that conference; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>At the Third Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change Ireland will fully support the agreed EU position, which is that developed country parties, individually or jointly, should reduce emission levels of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, taken together, by 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent by 2005 and 2010 respectively compared to 1990 levels.  In the context of the EU position, Ireland has adopted an indicative target of limiting the growth of these emissions up to 2010 to 15 per cent above their 1990 levels.</P>
      <P>The preparation of the EU position for the forthcoming conference has been the subject of intensive co-ordination at official and ministerial level for some time.

      <P>I am well aware of the ESRI study to which the Deputy referred.  I attended the launch.  The short answer to her question is we can commit ourselves with great difficulty. The target was set by the previous Government and it is one to which I fully subscribe.  It will require effort.  We are committed to limiting the growth of emissions to 15 per cent above their 1990 levels.  Some member states will have to <Col N="508" /> reduce emissions by 30 per cent.  Through the use of new technologies, energy conservation and abatement measures we must reach the target set because there are wider issues at stake.  The issue of climate change is seriously exercising the minds of countries throughout the world because of possible dangers to health and food if action is not taken now.</P>

Previous Fianna Fáil documents committed us to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 300,000 tonnes by 2010, a doubling of the rate for renewable energy sources from 4 per cent to 8 per cent and a trebling of electricity production by renewable energy.  Can we expect proposals of this nature to be advanced?  What is the Minister's thinking on a green taxation commission and the introduction of green taxes at this juncture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will not be responsible for all the necessary measures to ensure reduction of carbon dioxide in addition to a number of other gases, most notably methane and nitrous oxide.  Within my remit I have adopted the attitude that the environment and issues pertaining to it are not matters merely for me as Minister but will involve the Ministers for Agriculture and Food, Public Enterprise and the Marine and Natural Resources in ensuring that actions along the lines mentioned by the Deputy and others will be taken over a period, to reach the necessary targets under any agreement reached in Kyoto.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will probably be aware the European Union position is more ambitious than any of the other targets so far indicated for these negotiations.  For example, the present American target is stabilisation and the Japanese approximately 5 per cent, so it will be clearly seen there are differing views.  We have entered into a commitment, as part of the European Union position, which will be honoured if that is what is finally agreed.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister was reported recently as saying this was one of the greatest threats confronting humanity, does he agree the majority of the Irish electorate are blissfully unaware of it with a consequent, urgent need for an information campaign here?</P>
      <P>In addition, does he agree we have not a hope in hell of reaching the target to be set in Kyoto and that he, as Minister, ought be very honest about this?  Has the Minister hired English consultants, ERM, to advise on policy initiatives to meet the 15 per cent target or are they precluded from examining major areas such as Europeat I and ecological taxes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that most people are blissfully unaware of the present <Col N="509" /> position.  Over the past eight to ten years, the matter of climate change was ignored by Governments and people.  The issue was regarded generally with great suspicion.  Those who spoke of the dangers to humanity from it were perceived in the same light as soothsayers who went about in sackcloth and ashes forecasting the end of the world.  However, more recently, people appear to have adopted a more realistic attitude and have expressed concern about the matter.  We would not plan to attend the forthcoming conference in Kyoto were people not taking this issue very seriously.  From that point of view, I agree with the Deputy that we should make comprehensive information available as soon as possible.  In launching the recent ESRI study I complimented that institute on contributing to this debate, thereby adding to our general knowledge.  We must continue to educate people about this.  The possibility of reaching, if not exceeding, the targets will become more attainable as people realise more fully how serious is the overall matter. If we can get that message across we shall do the public a service.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept the scientific view on climatic change is accepted by the European Union Council of Ministers of the Environment and that the difficult targets negotiated during our last Presidency need to be set out in very clear terms?  I have three questions for the Minister.  First, will he publish the action programme to achieve the reduction targets now incumbent on Ireland?  I was a little concerned when he referred to an indicative target because I regarded it as a binding target to make up the European umbrella.  Second, will the Minister set interim targets between now and the year 2010, and publish those?  Third, acknowledging that it is not a matter exclusively for the Minister or the Department of the Environment, will the Minister consider re-establishing the Cabinet sub-committee on sustainability to ensure that all Ministers meet their responsibilities in this area in a structured way between now and 2010?</P>

May I ask him to review the file on the European Union decision on this matter with a view to understanding that the targets set down by the EU are in fact decisions by the European Union in that regard? May I ask him to confirm that one of the principal considerations in the minds of the Councils of Ministers in the European Union in adopting those targets was that they would be useful in putting pressure on other actors on the international scene at the Kyoto conference?  I invite the Minister also to reflect on the fact that such movement as we have seen so far, specifically from the United States and China, has come about as a direct result of the fact that the European Union has bound itself in the way it has.  I ask him again to reconsider setting up the Cabinet sub-committee on sustainability as being the only practical means of ensuring that the kind of <Col N="511" /> co-ordination he talked about so loosely is carried out.</P>

Will the Minister take that issue seriously and insist that parties make statements on the Kyoto Summit next week?  As in the case of the Employment Summit, it is important to set aside two hours to discuss this matter.  Does the Minister consider a &ldquo;Tallaght strategy&rdquo; to deal with the question of global warming would be a good idea?

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing Act, l988, provides a wide range of additional powers and responsibilities to housing authorities to enable them to provide an effective response to the accommodation needs of homeless persons.  Measures which have significantly improved the access of homeless persons to accommodation include the following.  The local authority housing programme which in recent years has been maintained at a high and consistent level benefits the homeless in common with other housing needs.  A substantial part of the accommodation provided under the voluntary housing schemes has been for homeless persons.  I recently announced significant improvements in those schemes which will enable the voluntary sector to increase its output of housing.  My Department recoups to housing authorities 90 per cent of their expenditure on the accommodation of homeless persons. The amount recouped to authorities has increased steadily from £902,000 in 1993 to £3.1 million in 1996 and is expected to be about £6 million in 1997.  An after hours referral service on a freefone basis is in operation in the Dublin region in counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow for homeless persons seeking accommodation outside normal working hours.  The Dublin Housing Initiative was established in 1996 to secure better co-ordination and delivery of services for the homeless in the Dublin region and to provide a framework for a more co-operative and unified approach by the statutory authorities working with the voluntary sector.  I will continue to keep the need for improvement to accommodation services for the homeless under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Department's intention to develop a national strategy to deal with homelessness? The Minister may not be aware there is a specific priority given to it in the policy platform of both Government parties where there is a serious commitment to undertake an assessment of homelessness and develop a national strategy. Where is this strategy?  Will groups involved with homelessness be consulted on the Minister's plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has established a ministerial committee on social exclusion.  Is the Minister a <Col N="513" /> member of this committee?  One of the key issues of social exclusion is the residual group of people who have no homes.  If the Minister is a member, what work is he doing?  Is it his role to lead the strategy on homelessness or is it that of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hardly need Deputy Hayes to remind me of the content of the programme for Government, which I negotiated on behalf of my party, with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who did so on behalf of his party.  We specifically included a commitment to undertake an assessment of homelessness and develop a national strategy.  We emphasised that special recognition would be given to the needs of those with mental handicap and autism requiring residential care.  It is an extensive commitment.</P>
      <P>I will fulfil my responsibilities.  I am concerned about the problem of homelessness.  Many safety nets have been put in place in recent years, particularly since the most recent Housing Act.  They are kept under review to ensure they operate effectively.  I recently announced substantial increases in income limits and grant assistance in relation to the capital assistance scheme, the remedial work scheme and other schemes which benefit those with a housing problem.  These were the subject of many supplementary questions on the last occasion questions to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government were taken. I am sure Deputy Hayes is pleased I have taken specific and effective action which has been widely welcomed by voluntary housing associations.</P>
      <P>I have visited many facilities provided in this city and other places since assuming special responsibility for housing.  I assure Deputy Hayes and the House that I will concentrate much of my energy and time in ensuring this assessment is carried out efficiently and effectively and in taking whatever additional measures are deemed appropriate to alleviate the problem of homelessness.</P>
      <P>This does not only extend to homelessness but to ensuring our community is in a position to have homes in which to rear a family and that there are proper facilities for the homeless to provide them with shelter and care.  There are those in society who choose not to take a traditional local authority house or the option offered by the various voluntary housing organisations.  There are many levels of need and I am concerned to ensure as much attention as possible is given to this problem and that as many resources as possible are devoted to it by this Government.  Substantial increases have been agreed by the Government for investment in this area, as is evident from the publication of the Estimates for the Department of the Environment and Local Government for 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered the question relating to strategy.  The answer is yes.</P>
      <P>The number of people deemed to be homeless in the assessments carried out in 1996, the most recent figure, was 2,501.  The figure in the previous assessment of March 1993 was 2,667.  In the previous assessment of March 1991 the figure was 2,751.  Looking at the those figures, there seems to have been a slight reduction of about 400 in that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I am concerned about what lies behind those figures and what provision is being made for accommodation, shelter and caring for the people who are listed.  The voluntary bodies claim the real figure is higher than this figure.  These were the figures in the assessments undertaken during the periods of office of the last three Governments.  The claims that these figures understate the numbers have not been substantiated. It would be a matter of concern to me if people genuinely felt that these figures were not correct.  It will be part of the assessment we are carrying out to ensure that we are getting accurate figures.  However, these are the figures which were presented to the Department with the help of all the local authorities and those working on the ground, including the health boards who are closest to people in this situation.</P>
      <P>Anything that can be done to assess it on a more accurate basis would be welcome.  It would not be in anybody's interest to underestimate the numbers involved.  In any modern society it is a great tragedy to have people who believe they cannot fit into the system.  I do not want them to be totally excluded from it.  Care and accommodation must be provided for them in a proper way.  Good work is being done by many voluntary organisations that are supported financially by the State, which has the primary responsibility in this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 274, 275 and 276 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the release of genetically modified organisms to the environment, I am committed to a precautionary approach and to the provision of full information to the public.  In my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 314, 315 and 316 of 12 November 1997, I indicated that I have asked my Department to prepare a national policy position on the deliberate release of GMOs.  The preparation of the policy position will include widespread consultation with the public and the biotechnology industry.</P>
      <P>While a moratorium on all activity related to the particular areas of genetic engineering covered by Community Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of GMOs would not be consistent with Community legislation, I will be keeping an open mind on future policy pending the completion of the national position next year. I will also be pursuing all possible options to strengthen environmental and public health protection in the expected amendment of this directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing procedures and controls with regard to the deliberate release of GMOs, derived from Directive 90/220/EEC, are transposed, as appropriate, into national law under the 1994 genetically modified organisms regulations.  The directive and the regulations lay down stringent notification and consent requirements for the purpose of protecting human health and the <Col N="516" /> environment and apply to releases both for scientific field trial purposes and for the placing on the EU market of products containing or consisting of GMOs.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the regulations, the Environmental Protection Agency is the national competent authority.  Any person seeking to deliberately release a GMO for the purposes of a scientific field trial must have the written consent of the EPA and must comply with any conditions attached to that consent.  Any person seeking to place a product containing or consisting of GMOs on the EU market must have the written consent of a competent authority of an EU member state and comply with any conditions attached to the consent.</P>
    <P>The EPA has power under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and the GMO regulations to prosecute offences to which substantial penalties under the Act apply.  The agency is also empowered to make an application to the High Court for an order prohibiting or restricting any process or action involving a GMO where the court is satisfied that the continuance would constitute a contravention of the regulations or pose a real or substantial danger to human health or the environment.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Does the Minister agree that genetic engineering of crops and vegetables which feed humanity poses a danger to eco systems and that we are gambling irresponsibly with nature for the sake of multinational profit? Does he agree that it creates monster weeds and plants which, when consumed, could be dangerous to human health?  In a press release on 26 April the Minister and Deputy Joe Walsh, now Minister for Agriculture and Food, said it was premature to release GMOs into the environment. They said Fianna Fáil did not support the largest nutritional experiment in human history which used consumers as guinea pigs and that it supported a moratorium on the release of GMOs into the environment.  Will the Minister allow field trials to continue and, if so, is that not a shameful and cynical betrayal of what he said in April about our environment?  He has the power under section 111 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, to instruct that no further trials take place.  Is he aware of newspaper reports that in Mississippi the genetically modified cotton crop of 46 out of 200 farmers on contract to Monsanto has failed?</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: What is the timescale for the study which the Minister is undertaking and the report?  Will he take immediate steps at EU level to secure an exception in that regard so that he can then exercise his power, under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, to prevent further experiments with genetically modified plants and crops?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have such power in relation to the EPA.  I am constrained by the directive. Because of the wording of the directive, we do not have to license releases in this country.  If another EU member state &mdash; this was the case recently, as Deputy Howlin would be aware &mdash; decides it will authorise the release of GMOs, there is little we can do about it because one of the unfortunate difficulties in relation to the directive, particularly in this area of releasing the GMOs, is that it is dealt with under competition law rather than under environmental and health law.  That is something I will be taking up at EU level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dáil last Thursday, when dealing with questions on the matter now before the House, I said I would make a full statement when proceedings before the High Court had been concluded.  My reason for proceeding in that way was to avoid the situation where something said in this House concerning the merits or otherwise of relevant court decisions might inadvertently impact on the matters now before the High Court.</P>
      <P>Deputies will also be aware that when the proceedings in question came before the High Court yesterday evening, they were adjourned until Thursday of this week.  However, because there is an understandable desire amongst Deputies and the public in general for further information relating to this matter, it is right that I should put before the House, as fully as I can, the information now available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I am as deeply concerned about these events as everybody else.  Before I proceed to recite the facts now made available to me, it is vitally important that we avoid the situation where something said in this House about the merits or otherwise of court decisions already made in connection with this matter would impact in any way on matters currently before the <Col N="526" /> High Court.  I am sure Deputies will agree on the absolute importance of avoiding that.</P>
    <P>In this context, I should also inform the House that the sequence of events I shall outline is based largely on information I received from the Garda. While I will set out as fully as I can the facts that have been made available to me, the House will appreciate that obviously the circumstances surrounding the facts of arrest and detention are matters which can, and often do, become the subject of dispute in court proceedings and, as new information might emerge at a trial, it will fall to the courts to decide the facts of the matter.</P>
    <P>At approximately 7.25 p.m. on Thursday, 13 November 1997 three persons were arrested under section 6 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, for an offence under section 15 of the 1977 Act.  The three were detained under section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.  There have been numerous arrests under the 1997 and 1996 Acts which have not given rise to difficulty.  A short time later two other persons were arrested under section 25 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 1984 for an offence under section 15.  These two were also detained under section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Approaching six hours into their detention all five prisoners had their detention period extended for a further period of 18 hours by Chief Superintendent Kevin Carty, head of the Garda National Drugs Unit, in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of the 1996 Act.  On Friday, 14 November 1997 their period of detention was further extended under section 2 for a period of 24 hours by Chief Superintendent Carty.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that on Saturday, 15 November the Garda, at approximately 4.55 p.m., went to the Dublin Metropolitan District Court in order to apply to the court, under section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 for an extension of the period of detention of the five persons under arrest.</P>
    <P>The Garda brought with them blank warrants and a copy of the Act.  The Garda gave the blank warrants and the copy of the Act to the District Court Clerk who passed the copy of the Act to the judge.  The five persons were legally represented. The court was adjourned to enable the court clerk to prepare the necessary documentation.  Approximately 20 minutes elapsed, following which Judge Windle heard evidence from Chief Superintendent Carty and granted the order sought by the Garda. At the time this application was made the Garda authorities genuinely believed that Judge Windle had been nominated by the President of the District Court to deal with such an application, a belief shared by the judge.  The warrant authorising the continued detention and signed by the judge included the following assertion:</P>
    <P>I, being duly nominated by the President of the District Court for the purpose of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 .................. hereby authorise the detention of [the persons named] for a further period not exceeding 72 hours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> The Act gives functions to District Court judges only following their nomination by the President of the District Court.  I am informed that on 12 September 1996 the President nominated all of the district judges assigned to provincial District Court areas, 22 judges in all, and on 8 November 1996 he nominated one of the judges assigned to the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Garda advise me that, prior to this case, they have experienced no difficulties in applying the detention and arrest provisions under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 since its introduction in September 1996.  To date, approximately 255 people have been detained under the Act and the detention was extended by a judge in 33 cases.  Furthermore, the Garda advise me that they have not encountered difficulties in applying power of arrest under the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1984.</P>
    <P>Late on Monday, 17 November 1997, Chief Superintendent Carty became aware, because of developments in another unrelated case, that there seemed to be some doubt as to whether Judge Windle had been nominated by the President of the District Court for the purpose of section 2 of the 1996 Act.  I am advised that he contacted Judge Windle that evening at the judge's home but was assured by the judge that there was no cause for concern.  Doubts continued to be expressed, however, and on Tuesday, shortly after midday, the Garda contacted the DPP to clarify the position.  As the President of the District Court was indisposed, an officer of the DPP contacted the office of the president and was informed that Judge Windle had not been nominated.</P>
    <P>The DPP then directed the release of all five prisoners from detention.  He also directed the Garda to re-arrest all five prisoners under section 25 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts for the purposes of charging them with an offence under section 15.</P>
    <P>The five prisoners were released from custody in the Garda stations where they had been detained at approximately 1 p.m. on Tuesday, 18 November 1997.  They were immediately rearrested by the Garda in accordance with statute and pursuant to the directions given and were charged with offences contrary to section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1984.  All five accused were brought before District Court Judge William Early presiding in one of the custody courts in the vicinity of the Bridewell Garda station.  Evidence was given before Judge Early of the arrest, the charging and the cautioning of the accused.  A remand in custody was sought.</P>
    <P>Solicitors for the accused made submissions to the effect that the prosecution was precluded from arresting the accused for the purposes of having them charged and brought before the court.  It was submitted that since the accused persons had been detained pursuant to section 2 of the Act of 1996, and had been released without charge, they could not again be arrested except in circumstances provided for by section 4(1)(b) of the Act.  This provides as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> Where a person is detained pursuant to section 2 and is released without any charge having been made against him or her, he or she shall not&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) be arrested again in connection with the offence to which the detention related, or</P>
    <P>(b) be arrested for any other offence which, at the time of the first arrest, the member of the Garda Síochána by whom he or she was arrested suspected, or ought reasonably to have suspected, him or her of having committed,</P>
    <P>except under the authority of a warrant issued by a judge of the Circuit Court or a judge of the District Court who is satisfied on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána since the person's release as to his or her suspected participation in the offence for which his or her arrest is sought.</P>
    <P>This provision exists to facilitate the further questioning of suspects who had earlier been detained under the provisions of section 2 of the Criminal Justice Drug Trafficking Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Detective Inspector Sutton from the Garda National Drugs Unit, on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, submitted that subsection 4(5) of the 1996 Act clearly covered the situation. That subsection provides:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding subsection (1), a person to whom that subsection relates may be arrested for any offence for the purpose of charging him or her with that offence forthwith.</P>
    <P>The accused persons before the court had been charged forthwith with the offences which were before the court and as a consequence, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, had no longer any relevance to the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Judge Early ruled that the rearrest of the accused persons was unlawful and that, therefore, the charges which had been preferred against them, their subsequent custody and their appearance before the court was also unlawful.  He indicated that in his view the only rearrest of the accused persons which was possible was a rearrest in accordance with section 4(1) of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Garda decided on the spot that the five persons should be rearrested and recharged.  They succeeded outside in arresting two, but the other three could not be located.  The Garda brought the two they had arrested to the Bridewell Garda Station where, following discussions, it was decided to release the two and consult fully with the DPP.</P>
    <P>Following further consultation the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that warrants should be sought from a district judge for the rearrest of the five persons.  The Garda decided that, as <Col N="529" /> Judge Early was familiar with the case, the warrants should be sought from him.</P>
    <P>That evening three gardaí travelled to Judge Early's home with a view to swearing information for arrest warrants for the five released persons, arriving at about 9.30 p.m. The judge declined to issue the warrants as he believed that such were not appropriate in the light of his rulings earlier in the day.  He indicated that, in his view, the Director could only apply for a warrant pursuant to section 4(1) of the 1996 Act.</P>
    <P>The gardaí submitted to the judge that section 4(5) of the 1996 Act clearly covered the situation and that there was no bar to the rearrest of the suspects for the purpose of charging them with an offence.  Judge Early, however, did not agree.</P>
    <P>The Garda again consulted the DPP and on the morning of Wednesday, 19 November 1997 a solicitor from the office of the Chief State Solicitor attended at the Bridewell Courts on the instructions of the Director to apply for arrest warrants. Judge King dealt with this application.  The applications for warrants were grounded upon the sworn information of two sergeants of the Garda Síochána and were warrants directing that the individuals concerned be arrested and brought before the court for the purposes of being charged.  It was pointed out to Judge King that although she was possessed of certain additional powers, pursuant to her nomination by the President of the District Court for the purpose of section 2 of the 1996 Act, it was not the intention of the Director of Public Prosecutions to rely on these powers as the Director did not wish to obtain any order pursuant to the Act of 1996. Judge King in chambers, having being informed of the earlier decision at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 November 1997 issued the necessary warrants for the arrest of the five persons.</P>
    <P>On the Wednesday evening two of the warrants were executed and on the following day a third. The three persons who had been arrested appeared before Judge William Early once more on the morning of Thursday, 20 November 1997. All three were represented by solicitors.  The cases of the first two were called first and there was evidence given of arrest, charge and caution. The Garda sought a remand in custody and both accused were remanded in custody for a week.</P>
    <P>There was a delay while the third person awaited the arrival of counsel in addition to his solicitor.  When this case was next called, counsel for the third person made submissions stating that the provisions of section 4(5) of the Act of 1996 were overridden by the provisions of section 4(1). It was indicated by the State Solicitor that the warrant before the court which had been executed by the detective garda was a normal arrest warrant and that section 4(1) of the 1996 Act had no relevance to it.  The State Solicitor argued that the accused was charged with an offence and that the Court had jurisdiction to remand him.  In response, Judge Early stated that he had to have regard to section 4(1) of the Act <Col N="530" /> and he then made an order discharging the accused.</P>
    <P>After this order was made counsel and solicitor for the two persons already in custody obtained further instructions from their clients &mdash; by then in Mountjoy Prison &mdash; and at about 4 p.m. they confirmed to the judge that they had instructions to ask him to vacate his earlier order.  Judge Early then indicated that he would hear their applications.  Having considered arguments from the counsel for the accused and the Chief State Solicitor, Judge Early indicated that in his view it would be unjust not to vacate his orders and he did so.  This meant that all three accused had to be released.</P>
    <P>On 21 November 1997 a High Court Judicial Review by way of <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> was applied for on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to the refusal of Judge Early to accept jurisdiction both on Tuesday, 18 and Thursday, 20 November.  That case is pending in the High Court.</P>
    <P>The procedures adopted in this case have on many previous occasions been successfully applied in court proceedings by the Garda Síochána and no difficulties have been encountered.  I am advised that the re-arrest of persons in accordance with statute and common law for the purpose of charging has not been the subject of the discharging of accused persons prior to this case.  I am also advised by the Garda authorities that whether or not the judge dealing with the extension of time originally &mdash; Judge Windle &mdash; had been nominated by the President of the District Court, as required by the 1996 Act, the same procedures would have been followed in relation to the re-arrest, that is, procedures followed in other cases.  On this basis, the issues which are now before the High Court would have arisen in any event.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts available to me.  What finally happens in relation to the decisions made by the District Court is now a matter for the High Court and it would be wrong of me to speculate as to what these decisions might be or to say anything about the merits or otherwise of the decisions already reached.</P>
    <P>However, there are other matters &mdash; not bearing on the law &mdash; on which the House is entitled to comment.  Last Thursday I gave the House, both in the debate on the annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and in response to Private Notice Questions, the information which was available to me then in relation to these matters, which I could stand over and which I could properly disclose to the House at that stage.</P>
    <P>Some Members of this House, and some commentators outside, expressed dissatisfaction with the information which I was in a position to make available.  It is important, therefore, to put on the record the constraints under which I had to operate. Central to these, as I have said more than once, is the fact that the issues in question arose in the context of court proceedings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> Certain issues arise from that.  First, it has never been the practice of Minister for Justice to comment on judicial decisions.  It would have profound implications for the operation of our democracy if it were to be otherwise.  Of course, it would be tempting as a short-term political expedient for a Minister for Justice to express dissatisfaction with a court ruling when facing questioning in this House.  However, a Minister for Justice, irrespective of the criticism, who would respond in that way would not, on a more sober analysis of the situation, have acted either properly or wisely.  To the best of my knowledge, it would be unprecedented for this House to discuss issues arising in court proceedings which were ongoing.  It may be the case that last Thursday I did not place sufficient emphasis on those constraints which were upon me.</P>
    <P>Further points need to be made about the context in which matters such as this are discussed in the House.  They may be basic but in the context of what has been said in recent days they are worth repeating.  As legislators we are responsible for enacting legislation.  It is then solely a matter for the courts to interpret that legislation.  From time to time some of us might not be happy about the interpretation a court puts on specific legislation. That may be perfectly understandable but that is the price we pay &mdash; and a price well worth paying &mdash; for having an independent Judiciary.</P>
    <P>Decisions in the lower courts are appealable to higher courts.  To seek to rush to judgment about the proper interpretation of legislation in the light of a particular court decision before appeal procedures, which in practice in some cases find that decisions of lower courts have been wrongfully decided, is not the way to proceed.  I know that Deputies agree on this point.  I am underlining it, not because the point is doubted by the vast majority here but because it is important that I put on record the very clear distinction between our role as legislators and the role of the courts as the interpreters of the law.  While respecting and accepting the separation of powers it is still reasonable to ask whether I could have given more information to the House last Thursday.  On that day, and for some time before that, the Garda who would be in a position to give a detailed report of all aspects of the case were involved in pursuing their primary operational objective of trying to ensure the persons suspected of the offences in question were brought before the courts.  These matters had to be dealt with under extreme pressure and I believed, and still do, that for me to have sought to divert those resources into the preparation of detailed reports for my information would have meant I was insisting that my concern that I should be able to answer fully and immediately to the House should be placed above that of ensuring the difficulties <Col N="532" /> which had arisen in these cases be addressed immediately by the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Even at the expense of political and media criticism of me I believed it right, and still do, that the gardaí dealing with the case should have been allowed to continue the process of trying to resolve the issues which had arisen.  I am not attempting to understate the significance of fully informing the House at the earliest possible opportunity in regard to matters of public concern as it is vitally important that this House should have information.  It was not possible to obtain information that I could stand over fully while all concerned were engaged in what I regarded, and still regard, as the vitally important task of attempting to rectify the difficulties which arose.</P>
      <P>From the time my Department first became aware that there were difficulties, the position taken was that the resolution of these difficulties should have priority.  The Secretary General of the Department was first contacted on the matter by a Deputy Commissioner of the Garda at about 7 p.m. on Tuesday and was advised that a legal problem had arisen concerning the detention of the accused persons and that, on the instructions of the DPP, the Garda were in the process of obtaining arrest warrants.  He was also advised that they were proceeding to resolve the issue so that the matter could be regularised.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General, who was attending a meeting at the time in connection with an unrelated matter, said to the Deputy Commissioner that while acknowledging the gardaí immediately involved in the matter were then fully engaged in attempting to resolve the situation, it would be important to have clarification as soon as possible about the legal issues arising so that these could be discussed with the Department's law division and the Minister could be briefed on the exact difficulty involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following day my Department was in contact with the DPP's office and the Garda to find out exactly what were issues.  I do not propose to comment in any detail on the legal issues which have arisen in the course of the proceedings in question for the reasons I have mentioned. However, if ultimately it is found that the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, is not operating in the manner which the House would wish then the matter will have to be addressed as <Col N="533" /> a matter of urgency by it.  I assure the House that should further legislation be necessary the Government will bring it forward as a matter of urgency, but no one is in a position yet to say whether that will be required.</P>
    <P>In this context I should refer to the fact that the text of the Bill submitted to the previous Government for approval prior to presentation the Dáil would, for what were stated to be practical reasons, have authorised all judges of the District Court to make orders continuing the detention of persons under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, without having to be nominated by the President of the District Court. The Bill as published by the then Minister included a nomination requirement.  It is not a matter for me to explain why the then Government decided to include the requirement in relation to the nomination of judges in the Bill as published, without which the difficulties about nomination &mdash; which are not now the core difficulties &mdash; would have been avoided.  Aside from the present difficulties, the Act has generally worked well and proved valuable in the fight against drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not involved in any way in the prosecution of individual criminal cases.  Investigation of crime is a matter for the Garda and it would be wrong for a politician to interfere.  In that regard section 8(1) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The general direction and control of the amalgamated force shall, subject to regulations made under or continued in force by this Act, be vested in the Commissioner of the amalgamated force who shall be styled and known as the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Garda conducts its investigations is laid down in law and the law provides that it is to the Director of Public Prosecutions that the Garda must look for directions in these matters.</P>
    <P>A further issue which arose last Thursday was whether a representative of the Chief State Solicitor's Office was present last Saturday when the application for further detention was made before Judge Windle.  It is not in accordance with normal practice for the Garda to have legal representation for an application of this kind.  The application then made by the Garda was granted. If, when the details of this case are fully reviewed, it appears there is a need for changes of practice, those changes will be made.  In the light of what has now transpired I have asked the Garda Commissioner to consult the Chief State Solicitor and review the issue of representation in such cases.</P>
    <P>What is important now is to calmly and sensibly assess what lessons might be learned from what has happened.  All of those lessons may not be clear at this stage but, without prejudice to the ultimate conclusion of judicial proceedings, at least three issues arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> The first is that the nomination of District Court judges for the purposes of the Drug Trafficking Act, 1996 and everything to do with the process is a matter for the President of the District Court.  Without impinging on that statutory function, I propose to discuss with the President of the District Court the procedures his Office might put in place to ensure that those who need to know who is nominated for the purposes of the Act are made so aware.  I will be glad to make the services of my Department available to assist him should he so desire.  The Secretary General of my Department has already been in touch with the President of the District Court and, without going into the details of the matter pending further discussions with the President, I can say that the President has certain concerns about the matter of nominations which will require further discussion with him.  Incidentally, when the 1994 Extradition (Amendment) Act was passed it contained provision for the nomination by the President of the District Court of judges to deal with extradition matters.  On that occasion, because of the direct role of the Minister in extradition matters, my Department sought and obtained information from the President of the District Court as to whom he has nominated.  As there is no corresponding role in the case of the drug trafficking legislation, this procedure was not invoked by the previous Minister following the enactment of that Act.</P>
    <P>The second issue relates to comments to the effect that the level of criminal law reform has been such that it is difficult for people who have to operate it to keep fully abreast of all developments. There is substance in this.  However, once legislation is enacted it is a matter for the courts to interpret it.  For that reason there has been a reluctance on the part of my Department to take any action in relation to explaining the effects of that legislation.  There is undoubtedly a difficulty involved in this regard &mdash; again having to do with the separation of powers &mdash; but I have instructed my Department to examine what might usefully be done in this regard.  This will involve consultations with the judiciary, branches of the legal profession and the Garda Commissioner. I would also welcome any views Members of this House have on this matter.</P>
    <P>The third issue is that despite what I have said about the separate roles of the Garda, the State prosecution service, the Judiciary and my Department &mdash; in this I have said nothing other than what has long been accepted in this regard &mdash; there is still understandable confusion in working out who is responsible for what.  The justice system is a complex one where the doctrine of separation of powers in highly relevant.  The Minister has a duty to explain, and I accept this duty. However, apportionment of blame is not something I am prepared to embark upon, particularly as these matters are still before the courts.  The difficulties of knowing who is or should be responsible for various matters strongly underlies the need for the structural changes now under <Col N="535" /> way in the justice system, for example, whether a separate and independent courts agency will be established.  This development will not absolve the Minister from the duty to answer to this House &mdash; when matters go wrong the House is entitled to answers from an elected representative of the people &mdash; but it should at least mark out lines of responsibility more clearly.</P>
    <P>I have given as full an account to the House as I am now in a position to do.  I will endeavour to answer any questions Deputies may wish to raise while emphasising the need to avoid anything which might impact on proceedings currently before the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Mayo</i>): Will the Minister apologise to the House for the unprecedented discourtesy he showed it last week when all the information he imparted today was or should have been at his fingertips?  All of the facts were known, yet he engaged in bluster, filibuster and an act of gross discourtesy to the House.  Does he recall that one of his first acts as Minister for Justice was, on 9 July, to continue in operation by way of a motion before the House sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act?  He stated: &ldquo;In my view the operation of the relevant sections of the Act for the relatively short period in question has made a substantial contribution to the fight against the drugs menace&rdquo;. Is he confirming this today by virtue of the fact that 255 people have been detained and 33 convictions have been brought?</P>
      <P>Why did Judge Windle not know he was not a nominated judge for the purpose of this Act?  Was the list of approved or nominated judges circulated to the Department of Justice or the Garda by him when he renewed the order on 9 July? Notwithstanding his statement that it is unusual, was it not the obligation and duty of his Department to have somebody in court to advise the Garda, for example, the Director of Public Prosecutions, his office, the Chief State Solicitor or somebody from that office?  Is the Minister aware of what section 11 says?</P>

      <P>On whether the question was mishandled, the members of the Garda Síochána at the centre of the fight against drugs, together with the law officers of the State and the courts, were working under considerable pressure attempting to resolve the very serious and difficult operational issues that had arisen.  The Garda had been working on this case for a considerable period of time.  That work was continuing apace at that time and in those circumstances I was not in a position to give the information required.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins asked why the Garda and Judge Windle did not know that he had been nominated.  The wording of the warrant issued by Judge Windle reassured the Garda in their belief that Judge Windle had been nominated.  When doubt was first raised about the nomination on Monday, 17 November, Chief Superintendent Carty contacted Judge Windle in his home and he was told there was no cause for concern.  I want to make this very clear.</P>

      <P>When there was a doubt about the nomination on Monday, 17 November, <Col N="537" /> Chief Superintendent Carty contacted Judge Windle in his home and was told by Judge Windle that there was no cause for concern.  On whether District Court judges should have been nominated by me, under legislation the nomination of a district justice is a matter for the president of the District Court.  That legislation was proposed by the then Minister for Justice and passed by this House.  In legislation which I previously brought before the House I suggested it would be best if the matter were brought before Circuit Court judges, but the Government decided in its wisdom that the president of the District Court should make the nominations.  The president of the District Court, therefore, had responsibility to make those nominations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins asked whether the judges nominated should have been informed by the Department that they had been so nominated and whether other judges should have been informed by the Department that they were not so nominated. I was not Minister for Justice, nor was I in Government when the nominations were made.</P>

      <P>Deputies should make up their minds about whether something was wrong. Even if Judge Windle had not appeared on the scene, the issues which must be dealt with by the High Court relate to matters which arise from the decision of a different judge, Judge Early.  Those are clearly matters for the High Court.  The Garda did not seek to have legal representation in court on the date on which the extension of detention was sought or on the date of the re-arrest or recharging.  The Garda consider those matters to be straightforward court procedures and they have been followed on numerous occasions without legal representation for the Garda being present.  Even in serious murder cases the Garda would not have legal representation present during the arrest charging procedures. The accused had legal representation present, but that was not unusual.</P>

      <P>I admit there was previous legislation.  There was the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, in which there was provision for the nomination by the President of the District Court of District Court judges in Dublin to deal with extradition cases.  The Minister for Justice, in accordance with that legislation, has a role in extradition cases.  Obviously the Minister of the day would require information as to who the judges were to discharge his or her functions adequately.  In that instance, the President supplied the information sought, and it was conveyed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda.  There is no similar function in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.  When one asks about appointments, it was left to the President of the District Court under the legislation to deal with the arrangements for the nomination of judges and, to the best of my knowledge, the dissemination of that information.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that 255 persons were detained under the provisions of this Act.  Of those, extensions of time were granted in 33 cases.  In relation to either the 255 or 33 cases, how many of these people were convicted?  How many of those convictions were sanctioned by custodial sentences?  Is the Minister prepared to assure the House the convictions of all those convicted or currently serving sentences are sound and safe?</P>

      <P>Regarding the concept of swinging from the rafters, let us address that matter honestly.  Are we discussing the release of the five people charged with very serious offences or the record of the Minister for Justice in Opposition which I will gladly discuss with any Member of the House?  I introduced 13 Bills, one of which dealt with freezing the assets of drugs barons, some of the most innovative legislation ever introduced in the House.  The Members who are not of the view that this issue should be used as pay-back time should ask the relevant questions.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept we have heard a remarkable story of bungling incompetence and ignorance that began with what should have been a simple procedure of the Garda going into court.  The State was the only player in this that did not have legal representation when the Garda went into court to seek an extension of the detention order.  The five men arrested had legal representation but the State did not.  When the Garda went into court they had a copy of the Bill which clearly states that judges will be nominated to have this power.  The judge did not know he did not have this power.</P>

      <P>For the second time I will try to get accurate information from the Minister.  Is it the case that when the detention order was sought the judge, the Garda or the Department did not know the judge did not have the power? The bewildered public would like a simple answer to a simple question.  How were the Garda and the judge supposed to know this, given there was no procedure for telling them?  Is the Minister responsible?  It is clearly stated in his Department's SMI report that he is responsible for procedures in the court and management of administration. Is the Minister saying the Garda and the judges had to guess whether they had this authority, or were they to figure it out in some way? Does the Minister have no role to play in this?  It is unacceptable to the public that the Minister is not taking responsibility for what is a major administrative function&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I repeat for the umpteenth time that the wording of the warrant issued by Judge Windle reassured the Garda in their belief that he had been nominated.  Judges had been nominated by the President of the District Court in 1996.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motions:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital Gains) (Republic of South Africa) Order, 1997.</P>
      <P>A copy of which Order was laid before the House on 17 November, l997.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital Gains) United States of America) Order, 1997.</P>
      <P>A copy of which Order was laid before the House on 17 November, 1997.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> The new convention between Ireland and the United States for the avoidance of double taxation of income and capital gains was signed in Dublin on 28 July 1997.  It replaces an existing convention which was ratified in 1951 and is the oldest treaty both countries have.  The new convention is comprehensive in scope and generally follows the OECD Model Convention.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of a double taxation convention is to eliminate the double taxation of income or gains which arise in one country and are paid to a resident of the other country.  The convention achieves this by either giving one country, normally the country of residence of the taxpayer, the sole taxing right for items of income or gains or, where income or gains remain taxable in both countries, by providing that the country of residence will grant credit against its tax for tax paid in the source country on the same income or gains.</P>
    <P>There are several important provisions in the new convention that were not included in the old one.  First, the new convention covers Irish capital gains tax, which was introduced after the old convention came into force.  That will avoid situations of double taxation arising in the taxation of capital gains.</P>
    <P>The new convention also includes provisions for the settlement of disputes concerning its interpretation. This is an important remedy which allows taxpayers to request their Revenue authorities to take up grievances concerning the interpretation of the convention with the Revenue authorities of the other country.</P>
    <P>There are also provisions in the new convention which preserve Irish taxing rights in relation to offshore oil and gas exploration.  The new convention also exempts Irish recipients of US social security pensions from US withholding tax on such pensions.  This will be a most welcome benefit, particularly for the many people of Irish descent who have returned from the US to Ireland for their retirement.  It means such pensioners will no longer be subject to the 25.5 per cent US withholding tax currently imposed.</P>
    <P>The new convention not only seeks to avoid double taxation but also to prevent fiscal evasion. There are enhanced provisions governing the exchange of information between the tax authorities of both countries.  However, the most significant change is the inclusion of an extensive Limitation on Benefits Article which, in accordance with US tax policy, is included in all modern US tax conventions.  Its purpose is to limit the persons who can avail of benefits under the convention to those that have a qualifying nexus with Ireland or the US.  It therefore seeks to restrict the benefits available to certain foreign-owned entities established in either country.</P>
    <P>While the limitation on benefits provisions in the new convention are similar in concept to those contained in other recent US treaties, there are some important differences which recognise Ireland's position as a small open economy heavily dependent on inward investment.  Thus, ownership of companies established in Ireland by <Col N="551" /> EU and NAFTA country residents is expressly recognised and is known as derivative benefits. Also, the benefits of the convention do not generally depend on income being taxed at normal rates.  This meets a key Irish goal of protecting companies benefiting from our incentive regimes. The new convention is expected to have a generally positive impact on US companies investing in Ireland.  It will also facilitate the continuation of investment into the US from Ireland for the majority of investors established in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The US has for many years been Ireland's largest single source of inward investment.  The investment comes from a wide range of sectors, including electronics, consumer products, pharmaceutical-health care, financial services, software and other internationally-traded services.  There are more than 450 companies established by US investors in Ireland employing more than 65,000 people.  US companies account for a quarter of the workforce employed in manufacturing activities. In 1996, US investment accounted for almost 70 per cent of new jobs created in IDA assisted companies.  These statistics speak for themselves and underline the importance of US investment for Ireland.  Ireland values the commitment that US companies have shown to Ireland and the Irish Government will do everything possible to assist and safeguard their investment.</P>
    <P>The new convention will enter into force in both countries for the tax periods beginning next year.  Where the provisions of the existing convention would have afforded greater relief from tax than this convention, they will continue to have effect until 1999.  A longer transition period of three years is provided before the provisions of the Limitation on Benefits Article become fully operative.</P>
    <P>The convention between Ireland and South Africa for the avoidance of double taxation of income and capital gains was signed in Pretoria on 7 October 1997.  It is the first such convention between both countries.  Once again, the new convention is comprehensive in scope and generally follows the OECD model convention.  It covers Irish income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  Important features of the convention are that it provides for exemption from tax in the source country for payments of dividends, interest and royalties to residents of the other country.  This will greatly encourage investment and trade between the two countries.  There is also provision for exemption for lease payments in the source country, which will assist the Irish aircraft leasing sector.</P>
    <P>Another important feature is the granting of tax sparing by Ireland to South Africa.  South Africa is an emerging economy.  To promote economic investment and development, the South African Government introduced tax incentives for manufacturing companies which are planned to last until the end of 2009.</P>
    <P>The convention recognises these incentives by providing for a limited form of tax sparing, subject <Col N="552" /> to a number of conditions.  This means 75 per cent of dividend income paid by a South African company to an Irish direct investor, out of profits that have been relieved from tax in South Africa under the incentive provisions specified in the convention, will also be exempted from tax in Ireland.  Because South Africa operates a territorial tax system, that is, it does not generally tax foreign source income, the tax sparing granted by Ireland is effectively reciprocated by South Africa.  Thus, the benefits of Irish tax incentives are preserved for South African investors.  The convention expressly includes trusts within the definition of persons covered by it.  This will be of particular benefit to Irish collective investment undertakings that are constituted as unit trusts as it should remove doubts concerning their eligibility for treaty benefits.</P>
    <P>The convention also preserves Irish taxing rights in relation to offshore oil and gas exploration.</P>
    <P>Other important articles in the convention include the non-discrimination provisions, which protect nationals of each country from discriminatory tax provisions in the other, and the exchange of information provisions, which are necessary to counter fiscal evasion.  The new convention will enter into force in both countries for the tax periods beginning next year.</P>
    <P>The putting in place of modern tax conventions between Ireland, the United States and South Africa is an important contribution to the fiscal infrastructure that investors require in order to give certainty in relation to the taxation of their investments.  As such, these conventions will facilitate the growth of trade and investment between Ireland and both countries.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I commend both of these important new tax conventions to the House and I formally move the resolutions for the passing by Dáil Éireann of the draft orders containing both conventions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for going beyond the explanatory memorandum in explaining the effect of the double taxation conventions, particularly in respect of the United States.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is hard working and I would not be surprised to see him here next Wednesday reading the budget statement.  We all aspire to permanency in politics so I suppose the Minister for Finance has become one of the Department's permanent staff and that is why he is not appearing in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Minister is preparing an interesting budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State who appears here on all occasions.  We rarely see the Minister but, no doubt, that will be corrected next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the double taxation treaty with the United States.  The treaty was negotiated and <Col N="553" /> approved by the rainbow Government, of which I was a member, and it is generally perceived in a favourable light by business people and the professions who will be advising those who benefit from its provisions.</P>
    <P>The main new item in the treaty is the limitation of benefits or LOB clause.  In essence, this clause stops Third World businesses using Ireland solely because we have better tax treaty arrangements with the United States of America than their own countries.  It stops profits being laundered through Ireland solely for USA tax arbitrage reasons.  All modern double taxation agreements with the USA have LOB articles or clauses.  However, our negotiators at the Revenue Commissioners have succeeded in negotiating an article in our treaty which is more favourable than the generality.  I compliment them on that.</P>
    <P>The treaty should be ratified as a matter of urgency.  I recall that in respect of previous inter-State treaties, particularly on extradition, even when there was no direct charge on the Exchequer, we were told we had to make sure such treaties were ratified.  I am glad it is now the practice that interstate treaties such as this one concerning taxation, are debated in the House.</P>
    <P>The debate is timely because of the Government's hesitancy in confirming the new 12.5 per cent corporate tax announced by the previous Government, of which I was a member, with the agreement of the European Commission.  The Government has seriously bungled matters in respect of the 12.5 per cent tax rate.  The fact that it is still bogged down with that issue in Brussels will be further magnified if it becomes an issue with the United States of America prior to the ratification of this treaty.  The treaty should be ratified before whatever announcement is made on budget day.</P>
    <P>The United States is the most important source of foreign direct investment in Ireland.  US companies are vital to the increase in jobs in manufacturing industry that we have experienced in recent years.  The US is also an important contributor to the financial services sector, even though the impact in financial services is less than that in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that 450 manufacturing plants in Ireland are of US origin and 70 per cent of all total direct foreign investment is sourced in the United States.  That shows the importance of clearly defined law on taxation in terms of money earned in Ireland to the corporate sector and to American businesses, in particular, which have located here and whose parent companies are in the United States.</P>
    <P>Traffic is not all one way, however.  It is a measure of our success as a modern economy that there is a growing number of Irish controlled businesses operating in the United States.  This treaty is as important to those businesses as it is to American businesses operating here, although on a smaller scale.  I am sure the scene has changed dramatically since the first treaty was negotiated and agreed in 1951.  On that occasion, <Col N="554" /> few Irish controlled businesses operated in the United States.  However, in recent years it has become a significant outlet for Irish businesses which want to expand beyond the borders of our small economy.</P>
    <P>It has been public knowledge for a number of years that the Irish US treaty was being renegotiated. The approval of the treaty by the Houses of the Oireachtas will give certainty not only to Irish and American businesses which have invested in both jurisdictions, but also to those contemplating further investment.  Often when a law or treaty is being renegotiated, people stall on making decisions until they see what the outcome will be.  It is important to remove any uncertainty which may have arisen about the details. Although the agreement was signed earlier this year, it is now going through its final stage of enactment in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Although the original treaty with the United States was 46 years old, it served its purpose well. However, like everything else, it has become out-dated. I understand from the explanatory memorandum that it no longer corresponds to the OECD model conventions, but the new treaty does.</P>
    <P>I welcome the ratification of this new convention and I support a number of its features.  The limitation of benefits clause recognises Ireland as a small open economy which is more dependent than others on foreign direct investment.  So-called LOB clauses are a feature of all double taxation agreements into which the United States has entered in recent years.  However, they are not all identical.  I compliment the negotiators who framed and got agreement on this article in the treaty because it is more favourable to Ireland than those in other agreements.  I also welcome the relaxing of the tests necessary to avail of the exemption or amelioration of the 30 per cent US withholding tax on interest dividends and royalties. These are critical elements in the conduct of international business.</P>
    <P>For the first time the US treaty also addresses the issue of capital gains arising in Ireland.  This is desirable as the realisation of capital gains is an increasingly common feature of business activity. It is time to take this into account in the double taxation agreement.  We are often criticised in this House for conducting business irrelevant to the citizens.  I am sure if someone made a list of such business, double taxation agreements would be at the top as people believe they only relate to multinational companies, their shareholders and senior management teams which have invested abroad.</P>
    <P>I am especially pleased with one very practical provision in this treaty which deals with one of the long-standing anomalies for personal taxpayers, that is, it exempts Irish citizens from the 25.5 per cent US withholding tax on US social security pensions.  The removal of this double taxation will benefit many who retired to Ireland after working a lifetime in the USA.  It has an added social impact, which is worthy of comment <Col N="555" /> with regard to the relevance of this House in that the rights and concerns of the small man were taken into account by our negotiators, the Revenue Commissioners and the Government of the day, in agreeing this treaty.  While there may not be a huge number of persons who have retired in Ireland from the USA with social security pensions, there is a significant number.  Persons in every parish, who will be known by Deputies and Senators, will benefit from this.  While it is important that it be included from a democratic point of view, it is also important from the point of view of the individual beneficiary.  It is a good signal from the Revenue and the Department of Finance that the concerns of the less powerful in the economy are taken into account even in international negotiations.</P>
    <P>As financial markets become more complex and there is free movement of funds between jurisdictions, it is essential that revenue authorities can exchange information.  This convention contains provision for such exchanges and I hope it will be used in the interests of tax compliance.</P>
    <P>I welcome this convention and the provisions being made in the treaty with the Republic of South Africa, the strongest emerging economy in Africa.  I am delighted that we now have a treaty with that country and that Irish citizens who invest in the Republic of South Africa or <i>vice versa</i> may receive 75 per cent of the profits tax free without the fear of being taxed in the other jurisdiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to contribute as Finance spokesperson for the Labour Party and I must confess that I would have preferred had it been on a subject less complex and esoteric.  I hope the Minister will bear with me and respond to some of my questions because most of my contribution will be in the form of questions rather than comments.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Ireland now has a double taxation agreement with the Republic of South Africa.  Business has bloomed in the five or six years since democracy returned to the South Africa and trade between our two countries has increased significantly.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could let me have some figures in relation to trade with the Republic of South Africa and investment by Irish people there and <i>vice versa.</i>  It seems that these provisions, at least in the first instance, are more likely to be of benefit to citizens or residents of the Republic of South Africa than to citizens or residents of the State.  Is it not the case that there are more Irish people and Irish companies investing in the Republic of South Africa than there are South Africans investing in Ireland? That is my understanding, although I may be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that the fact that the Republic of South Africa does not tax income which is earned outside of that state will <Col N="556" /> not work to Ireland's disadvantage in future years?  I am aware, and I am sure others have heard suggestions too, of Irish citizens, of whom there are many living in the Republic of South Africa, using the relatively beneficial rates of taxation there to their benefit and our disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I want to ask a few precise questions in relation to the United States of America, but I broadly welcome the updating after 46 years of the treaty with the US.  The Minister set out cogently and persuasively in his speech the level of direct investment in Ireland by American companies.  If we needed a reminder of our dependence on FDI, and particularly FDI which comes from the US, the figures which the Minister set out are very persuasive indeed.  Can he give me a brief lesson as to the exact taxation position in relation to profits which are repatriated from Ireland by American multinationals to the US?  Some years ago the US tax authorities were very anxious to ensure that those repatriated profits were taxed in the US.  I join Deputy Noonan in welcoming the LOB clause that is included in the treaty with the US.  I take the Minister's point that it is more beneficial to Ireland than similar clauses in treaties with other countries.</P>
    <P>Articles 11 of the conventions, which deal with interest arising in the contracting state and beneficially owned by a resident of the other contracting state which may only be taxed in that other state.  Does this provision exclude the Government from imposing DIRT on deposit accounts held here by residents of the Republic of South Africa or the US?  I see no reason why Irish depositors should be subject to DIRT while foreign nationals living here should not.  Will the Minister clarify the point?</P>
    <P>Articles 20 of the conventions provide that students or business trainees attending recognised educational institutions in either state are exempt from tax on income provided for their maintenance and education.  It is a welcome provision and one from which, in relation to Germany, I have benefited.  There appears to be a discrepancy between the two conventions in that in the case of South Africa the exemption for tax on such maintenance income is not time limited, but in the case of the draft convention with the US the provision appears to extend for one year only. Will the Minister indicate why that is the case?</P>
    <P>Articles 7 of the conventions deal with business profits and the deductions for expenses incurred for the purposes of permanent establishment including a reasonable allocation of executive and general administrative expenses.  In determining these deductions the relevant authority in each country should pay particular attention to the savings which information technology can make to administrative costs within an organisation, particularly when that organisation must conduct business on an international level.  The advent of e-mail, the Internet and other modes of information exchange must reduce substantially the costs incurred heretofore.  We must encourage investment in information technology but it is <Col N="557" /> also necessary for the tax authorities to bear in mind the reductions in administrative costs which such technology can achieve and to ensure this is reflected in calculating business profits.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and I hope he will respond to the questions I raised.  I welcome these conventions.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their constructive contributions.  I agree with Deputy Noonan on the importance of bringing matters such as these to the House.  I congratulate Deputy McDowell on becoming Finance spokesman for his party.  It is an interesting brief and given his vast experience and abilities I have no doubt he will master it as he has most others.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan's points on the LOB provisions, which are significant from an Irish perspective.  I join in congratulating the officials involved in the difficult negotiations.  I have learned more about the negotiations through my discussions with them and extraordinary efforts were made.  The way the convention was framed took account of the Irish situation and our relationship with the US.  Credit is due to the officials in that regard because it is slightly different to the conventions with other countries. The provisions will be beneficial to us given the level of involvement we have with the US.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell raised specific and complex issues and I will not have time to deal with all of them.  I will, however, send him a note on the points he raised and if more clarification is required, I will consult him.  South Africa is an emerging nation.  There is obvious interest in South Africa from an Irish perspective and in creating the conditions for that relationship to flourish.  I do not know the balance of trade between the two countries or what is happening but I will get those figures for the Deputy.  We are trying to create investment opportunities for Irish companies and we have noted entities in Ireland who wish to go down that route.  This convention creates a clarity and structure in which they may work that will benefit both South Africa and Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised a question on repatriated profits in relation to the US.  Those profits are taxable in the normal way and always have been. Obviously, credit is given for taxation paid here. It is fairly straightforward and there is no mystery in this regard.  I will send Deputy McDowell a note on the points he made and if anything else emerges, I will deal with it.</P>
      <P>I echo what has been said about the importance of these conventions.  It is important we continue to create conditions to ensure certainty in the future for our trading arrangements with various countries.  Obviously, the US is an important factor and South Africa may become even more important than it is at present.  It is sensible to have foresight in this regard and I congratulate the previous Government and Minister in moving these important matters on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> On numerous occasions I heard Deputy Noonan raise the question of a corporation tax and ask about the views in Brussels.  I will not give an explanation on behalf of the Minister for Finance but I was with him at the ECOFIN meeting last week and I confirm what he said to the House.  I ask Deputy Noonan, an experienced Member and, indeed, a former Minister for Finance, to take what the Minister said as fact.  I was present at a number of meetings and, as the Minister said, on no occasion was there any discussion on a specific low rate of tax, whether 12.5 or 10 per cent.  The question did not arise and the Minister confirmed this.  What is at issue is the framing of and timeframe within which we reach this.  I ask the Deputy to accept that in good faith as this involves a number of matters.  It is wrong to suggest that it in itself is an issue because it is not and I do not expect it to become one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence pursuant to section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, I wish to report to the House on Irish military participation in United Nations missions in 1996.  The compilation of this report has afford me a welcome opportunity to put before the House the contribution made by our troops in the various UN missions around the world, a contribution of which we are all immensely proud.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak about the United Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, which is our largest single overseas commitment and which has been much to the fore in the light of tragic events in south Lebanon earlier this year.  I refer to the incident when a landmine exploded injuring a number of Irish troops.  I wish Private Gary Moloney, who was seriously injured in the explosion, a speedy recovery and every success in the future which lies ahead of his young life. Those soldiers who were injured were able to return to duty shortly afterwards.  I propose to speak later about the general issue of landmines and our efforts to secure a global ban on landmines for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after the landmine incident came the tragic death of Sergeant John Lynch in a helicopter crash in which four Italian peacekeepers were also killed.  I convey my deepest sympathy to the bereaved Lynch family.  On behalf of the Government <Col N="559" /> I also convey our appreciation of the tremendous job done by our troops in a very trying and hazardous environment in south Lebanon.</P>
    <P>For most of 1996 the contingent strength was 624, consisting of a battalion of 542 personnel and 82 personnel at UNIFIL headquarters.  As part of a UN decision to reduce the overall strength of UNIFIL, in which eight other countries participate, the Irish contingent strength was reduced by seven in October 1996 when the 80th Battalion took up duty.</P>
    <P>The Irish Battalion is deployed in south Lebanon near Tibnin.  Irish troops have served there since 1978.  During 1996 the battalion continued to carry out its mission by operating observation posts and checkpoints, conducting extensive patrolling, maintaining a village presence and providing humanitarian assistance to a variety of worthy causes such as the Tibnin orphanage and medical clinics in the local villages.</P>
    <P>The earlier part of the year was generally quiet but the situation became tense during April 1996 because of an upsurge in activity by armed elements and an escalation in retaliatory fire by the Israeli defence forces and Israeli backed <i>de facto</i> forces.  The upsurge in activity was as a result of a roadside bomb in Brachit village, in which one young person was killed and three children injured.  There was also an incident in Yatar where two civilians were killed.  The Hizbollah accused the Israelis of carrying out these attacks and of breaching the July agreement with the Hizbollah which stated that, if the Israelis did not attack civilian targets in south Lebanon, the Hizbollah would not fire Katyusha rockets into Israel.</P>
    <P>As a result, the Hizbollah resumed the firing of Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.  One of these landed in the town of Qiryat Shemona injuring a number of civilians.  The Israelis responded with heavy artillery and air attacks on south Lebanese villages including villages inside the Irish Battalion area of operation.  They warned the civilian population to leave their villages as they were likely to come under attack. They also ordered the population of Tyre to evacuate and move north.  This meant the eventual displacement of up to 400,000 people.  The cities of Tyre and Sidon were attacked as well as specific targets in southern Beirut including electricity stations and targets in the Bekaa Valley. Cross-border hostilities continued until the ceasefire came into effect on 27 April.</P>
    <P>Throughout the April Offensive or, as it was commonly known by the Israelis, Operation Grapes of Wrath, Irish Battalion personnel continued to carry out their duties of manning observation posts, patrolling, reporting and rendering humanitarian assistance to the local population. An Irish medical team and Irish members of the force mobile reserve were involved in the recovery operation in Qana, when the Israeli defence forces shelled the battalion headquarters of the <Col N="560" /> Fijian contingent on 18 April 1996 killing 85 Lebanese refugees and injuring approximately 100 more.  Some four Fijian Battalion personnel were seriously injured in the incident.  The horror of this incident shocked the world.  No Irish personnel were injured during this troubled period.  The Irish Battalion troop rotation was delayed by one week due to the security situation in south Lebanon arising from the April Offensive.  The rotation commenced on 23 April 1996 and was completed on 7 May 1996.</P>
    <P>During this period Irish troops were heavily engaged in humanitarian tasks in the area giving much needed relief to the local inhabitants.  These humanitarian missions included searching for missing bodies and participating in the destruction of unexploded war debris.  They were also involved in collecting essential hardware such as tents, containers, pumps and blankets from Tyre and delivering them to villages within the Irish Battalion area of operations.  An Irish Battalion convoy, which included a Lebanese Red Cross ambulance, distributed food to villages within the area.  The convoy also successfully evacuated injured civilians from Shaqra village despite an Israeli defence forces shell warning for the village.</P>
    <P>While many of the population in the Irish Battalion area of operations evacuated, a considerable number took refuge in Irish posts.  At one time there were as many as 1,000 civilians sheltering in Irish positions.  Each battalion is given an allocation of £20,000 for humanitarian assistance during its tour of duty.  Following Operation Grapes of Wrath, the Department of Foreign Affairs allotted an additional £75,000 from Ireland's overseas development aid budget to Irish battalions for humanitarian assistance during that difficult period.</P>
    <P>Ireland provides 30 military personnel to UNFICYP.  Six officers and 24 NCOs have been serving with the contingent.  Three officers and five NCOs are filling staff appointments at force headquarters and a camp command component of three officers and 19 NCOs has been serving with the mission since February 1994.</P>
    <P>The UNFICYP mandate is &ldquo;to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting and, as necessary, to contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return to normal conditions&rdquo;.  The principal task of UNFICYP is the maintenance of a buffer zone between the line of the Cypriot National Guard and the Turkish-Cypriot forces.  The force is also involved in humanitarian activities.  In August 1996, Greek Cypriots organised political demonstrations against the division of Cyprus, which also involved participation from European countries. The demonstrations were held near the UN buffer zone and resulted in confrontations within the buffer zone between Greek Cypriots and others and Turkish Cypriots and Turkish military personnel.  The disturbances resulted in the deaths of two Greek Cypriot civilians; one was beaten to death, the other shot.  No member of <Col N="561" /> the Irish Defence Forces contingent was involved. There are 15 members of the Garda Síochána attached to this mission.  Garda members sought to rescue the civilian who was beaten to death.</P>
    <P>Our commitment of 14 officers to UNTSO was reduced to 12 in September 1996 in line with a strength reduction programme being implemented by the UN.  We have participated in this mission since 1958.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other missions including an observer force, UNDOF, of which Major General David Stapleton, from Tipperary, is commander. There is also UNSMA, a senior military adviser to the Secretary General's special representative. This mission is concerned with confirming violations of the Geneva accords on the settlement of the situation relating to Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>Ireland provided five officers to UNIKOM.</P>
    <P>UNIKOM's mandate involves monitoring the demilitarised zone established on the Iraq-Kuwait border following the Gulf War.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment of two officers to UNMIH ended in March 1996.  In 1996, we provided eight officers for MINURSO.  During the year the officers continued their tasks at the force headquarters in Laayoune.</P>
    <P>A number of missions were created in the former Yugoslavia following the closure of the UNPROFOR mission in January 1996; the UN Transition Administration Eastern Slavonia, UNTAES, to which Ireland supplied three officers in 1996; and UNMOP, to which Ireland continued to supply one officer in 1996.  Two lieutenant colonels continue to fill the appointments of Personnel Officer and Supply Officer in the United Nations headquarters, New York. Ireland is currently contributing to the stabilisation force, SFOR, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are also contributing the services of one officer for a three month period as an inspector with UNSCOM.</P>
    <P>The amount owed to this country by the UN is £12 million, approximately.  Arrears totalling £4.8 million, approximately, were paid in 1996, leaving a total of £12 million, approximately, owed at the 31 December 1996.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the subject of landmines. As the culmination of a year long process known as the Ottawa process, a diplomatic conference in Oslo at the beginning of September 1997 adopted the text of a convention banning the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel landmines.  This country has called for a global ban on anti-personnel landmines as a matter of priority and Ireland was closely involved with the efforts to conclude this convention.  The convention will be opened for signature on 3 December 1997.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs intends to travel to Ottawa to sign it and in this regard he has moved a motion before the House to approve its terms.  Following <Col N="562" /> signature of the convention, Ireland will proceed to ratify it.</P>
    <P>As part of Ireland's commitment to this process, policy in relation to the use of antipersonnel landmines by the Defence Forces has been reviewed.  While the Defence Forces have never used landmines either for offensive or defensive purposes, it is now stated policy that they will not use antipersonnel landmines operationally.  They will, however, continue to hold a small quantity for the purposes of training and research which are important factors in ensuring the protection and safety of Defence Forces personnel serving on overseas missions.  Article 3 of the Oslo Convention provides for such an exemption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the work of the Defence Forces overseas. The Minister outlined the impressive international peacekeeping record of the Defence Forces.  It is striking how difficult, dangerous and demanding are the tasks our Defence Forces are undertaking abroad.</P>
      <P>It would be good for us to discuss this report in our committee on defence and I hope we will have a further opportunity to further examine some of the details outlined by the Minister.  This is the first time I have seen this report and I know the Minister and others when in Opposition made the point that it would be helpful to have a detailed report circulated to Members before debates on this issue.  The issue is worthy of this and of spending time on discussing it and the committee is the place we can do that in an ongoing manner.</P>
      <P>I join the Minister in his focus on banning landmines and I applaud the Government's intention to sign the convention later in the year.  It will have the support of Fine Gael in so doing.</P>
      <P>There are strategic issues in relation to peacekeeping missions undertaken by our Defence Forces which must be addressed.  It is important that Ireland in a changing world environment of peacekeeping and peace enforcement is in a position to remain involved in a range of peacekeeping missions and that the Defence Forces be provided by the Minister with a defence policy that encourages these developments to take place and makes them strategically possible.  We do not want to become the carriers of an old-fashioned peacekeeping no longer suited or needed due to changing world events and the increasing incidence of intra-state rather than inter-state conflicts and the very different demands these make on defence forces and peacekeepers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An examination of our involvement in SFOR in the former Yugoslavia will reveal interesting lessons on how we have coped with the transition to this type of work.  It would appear that our experienced staff who have been sent there have coped well and made a major contribution in running a successful mission.  The demands of the winter will now become relevant and that force will have to get the proper equipment to deal with conditions there.  I am sure the necessary <Col N="563" /> support will be forthcoming from the Defence Forces and the Minister, including backup resources and proper remuneration.</P>
    <P>Taking part in Partnership for Peace initiatives needs to be examined further if we are serious about developing the peacekeeping role.  We could determine how and to what degree we would like to be involved in missions under the Partnership for Peace.  The important issue is that the opportunities are not limited because taking part in peacekeeping missions plays a very important role in our Defence Forces.  It is very important for the experience it offers, the contribution people can make and the boosting of morale.</P>
    <P>Our record in peacekeeping missions has been second to none, something which is clear from the description given by the Minister.  This has been seen in the field and in UN headquarters over many years and the reputation of Irish soldiers abroad is that of professional soldiers carrying out their job in an impartial manner.  Ireland has been a member of the UN since 1955 and first contributed to peacekeeping in 1958 when 50 officers were assigned to the UN observer group in Lebanon.  Since then, there has been a continuous Irish Defence Force presence on peacekeeping missions throughout the world.  Unfortunately, a total of 75 Defence Force personnel have died to date while serving overseas on peacekeeping missions.  We should pay tribute to the families who have lost loved ones in the service of peace.  Tribute must also be paid to the families of those currently serving overseas.  Overseas service is very demanding on families and when things become difficult, as they have done on occasion, it can be a time of great anxiety for them.  I join the Minister in wishing Private Gary Moloney, who was seriously injured in the recent explosion, a speedy recovery and success in his future life.</P>
    <P>A debate such as this raises a range of questions about the developing role of peacekeeping and peace enforcement throughout the world.  It also raises the issue of conventions; I am glad the Minister addressed the issue of the Convention on the Safety and Security of UN Personnel. When does he intend to introduce legislation in order that we can sign up to that convention? This debate also raises questions about the safety of our troops and the resources our Defence Forces require in the areas of personnel training and equipment to tackle the tasks allocated to them. If we do not tackle the issue of resources for the Defence Forces, participation in international peacekeeping missions will be jeopardised.  If the UN does not reassess its approach, only richer countries will be able to engage in peacekeeping. That is something we must consider.</P>
    <P>Peacekeeping is expensive and places demands on resources.  It is essential that provision is made in this year's budget for ongoing recruitment and updating of equipment.  If the issue of recruitment is not tackled seriously we will experience difficulties <Col N="564" /> in having the required personnel for overseas missions.  I am sure the Minister will agree that some strain has been experienced in providing the numbers demanded for some operations recently.  We must be careful not to place overly onerous demands and tours of duty on personnel. Some of the concerns expressed at home about morale, stretching resources and low numbers to carry out the tasks allocated to the Defence Forces will affect overseas work if not tackled properly.</P>
    <P>We must look in detail at our experience in the former Yugoslavia.  We must have a debate on the changing role of peacekeeping and the changing implications that has for training within the Defence Forces.  There are many such implications as the new type of peacekeeping demands a range of skills such as supporting humanitarian efforts, linking with NGOs, placing emphasis on human rights training, interaction with the local legal system and aiming to create a secure environment leading to long-term solutions to problems.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Defence Forces on the work which has been undertaken and I urge the Minister to provide the ongoing environment, by way of defence policy and support, which will enable the Defence Forces to continue to make the contribution he has outlined tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>When one considers that Ireland has been involved in peacekeeping operations since 1958, including some 30 UN missions and missions for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the EU, one can see very clearly that we have a great deal to be proud of.  During the period of our involvement in the UN, 75 people died on peacekeeping missions during overseas service.  I, too, wish Private Gary Moloney a full and complete recovery and I sympathise with the family of Sergeant John Lynch on his untimely death in very tragic circumstances during the year.  During the short time I was spokesman on Defence I realised this is a very exciting time for the Army.  It is a time of change, of gearing up the Army to be a more effective and modern unit and of equipping it to take on further peacekeeping tasks.  The involvement of the Irish forces in the SFOR operation in former Yugoslavia, although the operation is at military police level, involves a new and wide-ranging approach which has had very good effects on what was a very dire and difficult situation.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Government on its support of the convention on the banning of the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel landmines.  It is good the world is moving in that direction.  We have seen how people, often children, can be maimed or suffer the loss of limbs as a result of those horrible devices.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I compliment the Defence Forces on representing this country so well in very difficult situations throughout the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Frances Fitzgerald and Brian O'Shea for their complimentary remarks, particularly those directed at our Defence Forces and the number of missions so ably served by our troops in many parts of the world.  I accept we have very limited time to discuss such a wide-ranging matter and I hope one of the Dáil committees will have the opportunity to discuss in greater detail our involvement in United Nations spheres generally.</P>
      <P>We have already made the announcement in regard to recruitment which will take place in two tranches in March and June 1998, at which time I will review whether maintaining our full complement requires additional numbers due to the voluntary early retirement scheme and other retirements.</P>
      <P>We are constantly improving equipment.  There has been major investment in systems of communications for the Army so that we can be better placed to identify problems and reduce the risk to our troops to a minimum.  I accept that more could be done and I hope over time, as resources are made available, to tell the House of further positive developments in these areas.</P>
      <P>I am glad both Deputies, even in the short time available, paid some attention to what is happening on the landmines issue.  There are 100 million landmines in 60 countries lying treacherously in wait to carry out the most inhumane acts one can imagine on innocent and other peoples.  I am grateful for the compliments paid to the Government but, to be honest, nobody should have to be complimented on ratifying conventions and introducing other measures to safeguard innocent people from the ravages of landmines.  We are glad to have the opportunity shortly to sign the convention and to fully ratify it two days later.  In so doing we will join a number of countries which are tackling the issue, once and for all, and mobilising world opinion against countries which still have a distance to come in terms of banning outright the use and manufacture of landmines.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is an honour for me to introduce this Bill, which provides one of the most essential safeguards for workers as the economy develops.  I am also honoured to introduce the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.  It is my first experience of introducing a Bill to the House and I am gratified that it constitutes important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom <Col N="566" /> Kitt, will be aware that the Bill is almost identical to the legislation he introduced to the House last November which was debated in March.  Given his appointment as Minister of State with special responsibility for labour affairs, why did he not reintroduce his Bill?  Failing that, why does he not accept this Bill?</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that it has fallen to the Labour Party to introduce, in the form of legislation, a core principle which Fianna Fáil espoused when in Opposition.  At that time, the Minister of State met and discussed widely with all the bodies involved, including RGDATA, business organisations such as IBEC and the trade unions, including MANDATE and SIPTU.  It is extraordinary, therefore, that the introduction of this legislation is not his priority.  In drafting the Bill I took account of the Organisation of Working Time Act, which my colleague, Eithne Fitzgerald, introduced to the Dáil last year.</P>
    <P>The Government has been only five months in office yet it has already engaged in U-turns on a range of issues across the political spectrum.  My colleague, Deputy Quinn, noted last week that the Labour Party in Government was castigated by Fianna Fáil when in Opposition regarding public spending, yet it has now made a remarkable U-turn in that area.  Similar U-turns have occurred on hospital waiting lists and crime.  What is the position of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform on zero tolerance?</P>
    <P>In failing to introduce his own Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has made the most cynical and hard hearted U-turn.  During the debate on the Bill last March, Deputies Kitt and Cullen, both of them now Ministers of State, castigated the then Government and the then Minister of State, Eithne FitzGerald, despite her acceptance of the Bill.  It was immediately referred to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy where there would have been a full scale debate to allow for necessary amendments to the Bill and core legislation would have been on the Statute Book.  The Minister of State accused the former Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the rainbow Government of reneging on their commitments to provide the necessary legal protection for employees in the retail sector.  He spoke of the rainbow Government turning its back on thousands of workers in this sector.</P>
    <P>He has blatantly, coldly and callously turned his back on retail workers, some of our most vulnerable people, having consulted them and introduced legislation.  In the same debate the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, lamented the fact that only Fianna Fáil had its finger on the pulse of the nation.  One must contemplate the crass impudence of that remark considering what has happened over the past five months and that the Labour Party has forced the Minister of State to live up to his words.  How cynical and barefaced the comments by the present Fianna Fáil Ministers of State seem six months later.  Their betrayal of retail workers is even more scandalous given the <Col N="567" /> clear commitments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to MANDATE and SIPTU and the workers they represent.</P>
    <P>A few months before the general election, seven Labour Deputies met their MANDATE colleagues in Wynn's Hotel, Abbey Street, Dublin, while the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, represented Fianna Fáil.  He was the only non-Labour Party Deputy at the meeting where he pledged to put a protection of workers Bill on the Statute Book and made a firm commitment on a referendum on Sunday trading.</P>

Deputy Fitzgerald was criticised on this issue and glib comments were made by the Minister of State regarding the introduction of a referendum.  More than seven months later and after five months in Government he has shamefully abandoned his promises and has shown once again that a commitment from a Fianna Fáil spokesperson is not worth the paper it is written on.</P>

    <P>In the past couple of months workers in TEAM Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann brought to our attention documents signed by the present Taoiseach containing promises &mdash; in the case of the TEAM Aer Lingus workers by the Minister's constituency colleague, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Séamus Brennan, a number of years ago when TEAM <Col N="568" /> Aer Lingus was established.  Now these promises seem to have been disgracefully abandoned, just like the promise to legislate in this case.  Tonight the Labour Party is giving the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, a chance to keep their pledge.  We have brought back their own Bill because it contains a vital principle of protection for retail workers, namely, the principle of consent, of workers being requested to work on Sundays only on a voluntary basis and protection against discrimination for workers who choose not to work on Sunday.</P>
    <P>Throughout our State's history workers in many sectors have been required to work on Sundays. In the areas of health and hospitals, public transport and entertainment, workers have traditionally carried out essential Sunday work for our society, and the Labour movement and our trade union colleagues have, throughout that long period, endeavoured to protect those workers through the Joint Labour Committee regulations and decisions, by local or company agreements and, above all, in the past ten or 11 years, by national agreements.  The refusal to bring forward this Bill is a dreadful indictment of the Fianna Fáil Party's attitude to Partnership 2000 and to any future extension of the partnership developed over the past ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with it through partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will.  What could be the attitude of the Minister of State and his Government to partnership agreements if, on a very basic issue such as this, they require retail workers to enter into national agreements and on one basic principle of civil and working rights, namely, the right to opt out of Sunday working, they are absolutely refusing to proceed?  By his crass refusal to act, to adopt this Bill and put it into law, the Minister is endangering one of the central achievements in the management of our economy over the past ten or 11 years.  When their representatives go to the table to discuss the next national pay and conditions agreement, workers in the retail sector will certainly be justified in feeling that the Minister's performance on this matter does not give much cause for hope for a continuation of partnership.  The partnership approach has been essential to the development of the Celtic tiger.  Traditionally, workers have been protected regarding Sunday work by joint labour agreements and local and national agreements. Traditionally small corner shops and sole traders have facilitated consumers with a basic Sunday service.  It is the expansion of the large retail multiples such as the Irish-owned Dunnes Stores and Superquinn and the foreign-owned Tesco, and the determination of the management of some of those companies to make almost every Sunday just another trading day, which has drastically changed the traditional pattern of Sunday working in the retail trade.  It was the action of <Col N="569" /> Dunnes Stores in 1994 in effectively dictating to their workers that they had to work on Sundays which was the beginning of the present considerable difficulties.  Over the past five years especially, workers have been under enormous pressure to work on Sunday, as is clearly shown by the long struggle between Dunnes Stores and their workers represented by the MANDATE trade union.</P>
      <P>Sunday working has placed an enormous strain on the personal and family lives of many workers in the retail and other sectors.  Other major developments, for example zero hour contracts, have also increased the stress on them.  I commend the former Minister, Eithne Fitzgerald, for effectively bringing to an end in the legislation enacted before the general election the notorious practice of zero hour contracts.  Workers have been forced to go on strike for their basic civil rights.  The refusal by many companies to give a premium rate for Sunday working is another step in eroding the rights of workers.</P>
      <P>Many of these developments are synonymous with the introduction of temporary and casual working.  The living standards and family life of many workers have been put under dire threat by some of these developments.  The workers with whom I spoke today reminded me that even in Thatcherite Britain the Government believed it was essential to give workers the right to opt out of Sunday working.  Why is the Minister so hesitant to introduce this key principle here?</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Shea, with whom I wish to share my time, will deal with the damage caused to small traders.  The pendulum has swung too far in the direction of major companies and their management.  The long discussions Eithne Fitzgerald entered into in an effort to introduce fundamental reform in this area were well worthwhile. The organisation of working time legislation proves this.</P>
      <P>I had to twice ask the Minister to debate this matter in the House.  During a previous debate he said I was not present during all the Committee Stage debate on the Organisation of Working Time Act.  I was a member of four committees in the previous Dáil, including the Committee of Public Accounts, and at times I found it difficult to attend all of them and to also be present in the House.  Nevertheless, I have always had a profound interest in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost 30 years ago in my native area of Clondalkin my father and most of my uncles were forced to go on strike as a result of a proposal by the management of the paper mill to introduce compulsory working on Sunday.  This proposal eventually led to a two centuries old tradition of paper making in Clondalkin coming to an end. The management insisted on Sunday working without giving workers a premium rate or time off.  I remember the great sadness felt by the members of my family at this proposal.  People who played for the local Round Towers GAA team, Clondalkin Celtic football team and the rugby club had their social life seriously disrupted <Col N="570" /> by Sunday working.  While the workers stood up to management they were beaten into submission, so to speak.  Less than a decade later the company was liquidated.  This left a deep mark on my family and I am proud it has fallen to me to bring forward this legislation on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>My former colleague, Eithne Fitzgerald, must be commended on introducing the concept of minimum extra compensation for workers. Section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act provides a premium rate for all employees, regardless of whether they are covered by a collective agreement or joint labour committee decision.  She modelled this Act closely on the European Working Time Directive and has provided considerable protection for Sunday workers.  Under that Act Sundays must be included in the 35 hours weekly rest period to which employees are entitled, unless otherwise provided for in the contract of employment.  The Organisation of Working Time Act provides for opting out of Sunday work by employees whose contract of employment does not state they must work on Sundays.  Our trade union colleagues believe that Act should go much further, but the then Minister, Eithne Fitzgerald, intended to bring forward specific legislation.  If a person works only on Sunday, under the Organisation of Working Time Act they are entitled to premium time off in lieu of pay.</P>
    <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act repealed and improved existing legislation on holidays by increasing the basic entitlement from 15 to 20 days per annum and by making an equally significant improvement for part-time and contract workers by way of a <i>pro rata</i> increase in holiday entitlements.  In effect, therefore, the Organisation of Working Time Act offered considerable improvement for working on Sundays, not least of which was it outlawed zero hour contracts.</P>
    <P>My former colleague, Eithne Fitzgerald, noted last March in her contribution to the Protection of Workers (Shops) Bill, 1996, Deputy Tom Kitt's original Bill, that great difficulties are presented to legislators in attempting to protect Sunday workers.  In her lengthy period as Minister of State responsible for labour she explored in great detail the possibility of introducing a referendum to ban Sunday opening by large multiples.  The advice she received from the then Attorney General indicated that it was not possible to ban Sunday trading in large retail units and to leave the traditional small corner shop operating as before without taking the issue to the country by way of referendum.  The former Minister held lengthy consultations with MANDATE, SIPTU and our other union colleagues as well as with the large retail chains and their representatives such as IBEC.</P>
    <P>In the context of the difficulty of proceeding with constitutional change, on which the then Minister had embarked, she decided to implement the comprehensive Organisation of Working Time Act which greatly improved conditions <Col N="571" /> for all workers, including those who work on Sundays.  When the Minister, Deputy Tom Kitt, introduced the Protection of Workers (Shops) Bill, 1996, my colleague, Eithne Fitzgerald, immediately accepted it and it went to the Select Committee on Enterprise and Employment, chaired by Deputy Bell.  From talking to representatives of workers and business interests concerned, further consultation was necessary on some aspects of the Bill.  The central principle of optional Sunday work was a valuable advance for retail Sunday workers.</P>
    <P>If the general election had not intervened, the Protection of Workers (Shops), Bill, 1996, would be on the Statute Book.  If we had a November general election, as I advocated &mdash; I would like to have waited for a November election &mdash; Fianna Fáil would not have been able to garner considerable support from Sunday shop workers because the principle of voluntary Sunday working would be enshrined in law.  The Fianna Fáil Party, lead in this instance by the Minister, Deputy Tom Kitt, has betrayed one of the most vulnerable sectors of the workforce.  The workers whom the Labour Party are seeking to protect are primarily women, often on low pay, casual workers or those on short-term contracts.</P>
    <P>The participation rate of part-time employees has increased from 8.5 per cent to almost 14 per cent in the past eight years.  In many aspects of modern society it is essential for both partners in a relationship to work if the family is to afford the basic necessities to survive.  In our information clinics we often come in contact with part-time workers, including Sunday workers, in the retail trade who are desperately trying to maintain a mortgage, in many cases a local authority mortgage.  For many such workers there is no choice about working on Sundays.  They are compelled by the harsh circumstances of modern economic life to take whatever work is available, even under harsh conditions.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Ministers, Deputies Harney and Kitt, to support those families by accepting this Bill.  I have made the minimum possible changes to the Bill as introduced by the Minister, Deputy Kitt.  Essentially I took into account the passage of the Organisation of Working Time Bill.  As in the earlier Bill, section 3 of this Bill does not apply to the relatives or owners of a shop, employees normally expected to work less than eight hours per week and employees who have been in the continual service of an employer for less than one month.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is the core of the Bill and the reason we in the Labour Party demand the legislation should be enacted.  Under this section an employee will not be obliged to work on a Sunday without his or her consent and it will be unlawful for an employer to require an employee to work on a Sunday without that consent. Section 5 provides that an employee who opts out of Sunday work for religious, family or other reasons shall not be discriminated against in <Col N="572" /> terms of salary, rotation of overtime, promotion or any other condition of employment.  An employee who performs Sunday work under section 6 will be entitled to a whole or half day off the following week.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for adequate notice of four working days to the employee from the employer and of three working days to the employer before the employee engages in Sunday work.  Under section 8 an employer cannot contract out of the provisions of the Bill.  This is also an important provision because it makes it impossible to draw up a contract which would negate the central principle of section 4.  Section 9 allows an employee to present complaints about any aspect of Sunday work to a rights commissioner whose recommendations shall be binding.  There is also provision for a right of appeal to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>I commend the Protection of Workers (Shops) Bill, 1997 to the House.  Its central principle of voluntary Sunday work would be a clear advance for retail workers.  The rainbow Government was correct to accept this Bill and to send it to committee for necessary amendment.  The appalling, uncaring and cynical attitude of the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to his Bill is a slap in the face for shop workers.  On their behalf, I implore him to have a change of heart and to accept the Bill tonight.  He has often spoken of the need for partnership in the House and across the social spectrum. A central principle of partnership should be to ensure the essential rights of workers are respected, in this case the basic right to opt out of Sunday work.</P>
    <P>I wish to share time with Deputies O'Shea and Gormley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Broughan, on introducing this important legislation.  While deliberating on how I would contribute to the debate, I recalled the time we attended secondary school for a half day on Saturday morning and the postal delivery on Saturdays. We appear to be moving from the five day week put in place not long ago to making workers work on the Sabbath.  For moral reasons working on Sunday is repugnant to some people.  Sunday is generally a day of rest, a day for the family. The family is no longer a strong unit and society is poorer for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was growing up there were many small shops in Waterford city, some of which provided a living for entire families and others which provided a substantial addition to the income of the main earner.  They were part of the community. Corner shops often carried families through financially difficult times until they cleared their debts.  These shops were part of the social fabric. Unfortunately, I do not see the supermarkets which form large multiples knitting into the community as the corner shops and small supermarkets once did.  However, during my period in the Department of Agriculture it became clear that the standard of layout, range of goods and <Col N="573" /> hygiene in smaller supermarkets and shops has improved in the past decade.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides balance, and I compliment Deputy Tom Kitt on being its author in a former incarnation.  However, nothing has changed.  The Deputy is in Government and nothing has been done on this issue.  The promises made in Opposition should be delivered on now.  We must accept the competition in the marketplace; today we saw the fallout from the amalgamation of Waterford Foods and Avonmore.  That happened in the context of changes across the retail sector. Approximately 60 per cent of groceries in the EU are sold through the multiples.  That is the reality of the marketplace.</P>
    <P>However, the rights of individuals must also be looked after.  The Labour Party came from the trade union movement and will always look after the rights of workers.  We are introducing this legislation because it is in line with the ethos of our party.  It gives people a choice.  If someone decides they want their Sunday for religious, family, sporting or leisure reasons, they will not be discriminated against by their employer.  Difficulties may arise in this matter, but this should not deter us from doing what is right.</P>
    <P>The employee has the right not to work on Sunday, but he or she must give proper notice to the employer under this Act, which only relates to those in the retail area.  If the employee does not give due notice to the employer, that is tantamount to agreeing to work on Sunday.  The arguments have been cogently marshalled by Deputy Broughan, and I will not repeat them.  However, it will be gross hypocrisy on the Minister of State's part if he does not accept this legislation. He must ensure it passes speedily into law to deal in a balanced way with the rights of the individual worker and the realities of the employer in the marketplace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stagg for sharing his time and I commend Deputy Broughan and the Labour Party for this legislation.  What I say may be branded conservative or even old-fashioned, but it must be said.  Sunday is a day of worship and reflection.  It is devoted to spirituality, when for once we can avoid the ugly spirit of consumerism and materialism which has infected society.  Margaret Thatcher once said that there was no such thing as society, only individuals. In the late 1990s we can extend that premise by saying there is no such thing as society, only consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sunday trading is the logical extension of the consumerist ethic.  There was a time when Sunday was a family day but materialism has undermined the family.  Now the family day out no longer consists of a walk in the countryside, rather a visit to a ghastly shopping mall where children are fed junk food and everyone goes on an orgy of shopping. Shopping affirms the modern human being. As Eric Fromm put it, &ldquo;If you are what you have, then the more you have the more of a human being you are&rdquo;.  Conversely, if you have less you <Col N="574" /> are less of a human being.  That is the capitalist consumerist ethic which leads to such terrible discontentment in society.  It is a philosophy based on unhappiness.  Our society is based on an economic model which fosters greed and discontentment. If people were to say they were happy with their lot and did not require any more material possessions, the system would collapse.  Therefore, we need more markets, more consumers, more advertising, discontentment and Sunday trading.</P>
    <P>It is time somebody shouted halt.  I commend Deputy Broughan's legislation because it questions this ethic.  As politicians we have a duty to examine the way society is heading.  Why is it that in a time of unprecedented economic prosperity we have more family breakdowns, drug addiction, crime and more suicides?  Politicians and the church have not done their duty by questioning materialism.  The present incumbent in the Vatican seems to endorse monopoly capitalism, which is the root cause of consumerism.  The early essays of de Valera and Collins, the founding fathers of the State, question materialism.  As we moved into the 1960s it became less fashionable to do so.  We are now at a stage when we must look at issues such as the quality of life.  Sunday trading has ruined the peaceful atmosphere of villages such as Sandymount, Rathmines and Donnybrook.  Recently I attended a residents' association meeting at Nutley and it was pointed out that Sunday shopping in Merrion has ruined the peaceful day Sunday once was.</P>
    <P>In Opposition Fianna Fáil gave a commitment to MANDATE that they would look at the issue of Sunday trading.  They also gave a commitment to meet IBEC, ICTU and MANDATE.  I hope that process has begun, but the key issue is that there is a voluntary opt-out for shop workers.  If they do not want to work on Sunday, they should not have to work.  Last December the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, promised at a press conference to introduce statutory rights for shop workers so that they would not have to work on Sundays.  I ask the Minister of State to honour those commitments and support the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Bill before us, which represents no more than a retabling of the measure introduced by me while in Opposition in December last year, must be viewed in the context of developments since that time.  The major development has been the enactment of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, which was signed by the President in May 1997.</P>

    <P>The Bill raises nothing new &mdash; all the issues mentioned by the Deputy were raised in the earlier debate.  The eventual outcome of those discussions was reflected in the treatment of the Sunday working issue in the organisation of working time legislation.  At the time I introduced my Private Members' Bill it was my view, following a number of discussions with the interests concerned &mdash; and, particularly with MANDATE, the shopworkers' union &mdash; that legislation to provide protection for those employed in shops which trade on Sundays by making Sunday working <Col N="577" /> voluntary for those employees and creating a minimum entitlement of time and a half for Sunday work was a feasible proposition.</P>

The transposing legislation, as enacted, provides that every employee, not just those in the retail trade, is entitled to one day off per week which must be Sunday unless Sunday working is specified in the employee's contract of employment.</P>

      <P>If the employee is required to work on Sunday he or she must be rewarded with a Sunday premium unless Sunday working is otherwise built into the pay structure, for example, a shift premium for those working on a rotating shift.  The level of this premium should be set at the going rate in the particular business sector. The Act describes a mechanism for arriving at this rate.  The intention is that the statutory guarantee of an entitlement to a premium for Sunday working with the combination of maximum weekly working hours and minimum daily and weekly rest periods should ensure the development of Sunday trading will not be at the <Col N="578" /> expense of the health and safety considerations of the workers concerned.</P>

I have offered my fullest assistance in this process by appointing a chairperson to preside over the discussions if this is considered to prove helpful.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain the rationale behind my approaching this issue in this way.  Following my meetings with IBEC and ICTU, it was clear to me that significant obstacles stood in the way of progress on this sensitive and delicate issue.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should avail of this opportunity to place on the record some further background to the approach adopted in the 1997 Act on the issue of Sunday working.  As Members will be aware, Sunday working always has been a feature of a broad range of sectors.  Public utilities, health care, media and entertainment, hotels and catering, security and agriculture are just some with a longstanding tradition of Sunday working.  In recent years the numbers working on Sundays and the sectors in which Sunday working is commonplace have been increasing.  Continuous processing and round-the-clock production are typical features of our major industries where cost and competitive pressures require the optimum use of all resources.  Inevitably, this has led to increased operating times for many industries. Statistics show that the number of employees working on Sundays in manufacturing and commerce generally has increased by 20 per cent in the past three years alone and that a total of 36 <Col N="581" /> per cent of the labour force now work on Sundays.</P>
      <P>Sunday working is already recognised as premium time in many employments and, typically, is rewarded by an overtime rate or shift premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about shop workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Rates of pay for Sunday work within the Joint Labour Committee system provide for premium pay for Sunday work in many sectors.  The Labour Court, in its adjudication on the issue of Sunday working, has also recommended premium rates for Sunday working in a number of recent cases.</P>
      <P>Thus, section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, is designed to put this accepted feature of rewarding work done on Sunday at a premium rate on a statutory footing for all employees, not merely those based in the retail trade.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's point that the resources available to people in Opposition are fairly limited; we must all use the Library, write our own speeches and so on.  The principle of volunteerism is enshrined in this Bill in that it gives workers the basic right to refuse to do Sunday work.  I commend the Minister of State on introducing that Bill on his own initiative. He enshrined that principle in it, but now appears to be reneging on it.  He is disappointing the House by being untrue to himself in reneging on a central principle in a Bill he introduced.</P>
      <P>He referred to the difference between being in Government and in Opposition, but since his party went into Government it has allowed the large multiples, such as Tesco, to come here and dictate to our people what they will do on Sunday afternoons and under what conditions their staff will work.  Is that not deplorable?  There is a suspicion, to put it mildly, that the Fianna Fáil party is beholden to those multiples.</P>

    <P>I discussed my view on this with representatives of MANDATE and, I believe, they will accept it, but they have to make their position clear.  There is a view that Sunday trading is here to stay.  One need only note the number of cars in the carpark of Cornelscourt on a Sunday to <Col N="586" /> know that.

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Broughan on introducing this Bill, the core provision of which is that an employee should not be obliged to work on Sunday without his or her consent.  Deputy Gormley addressed this issue succinctly when he said Sunday is traditionally a day of worship, a day for God.  God was not mentioned tonight but for many people, including workers, it is an important concept.</P>
      <P>I said the Minister was sincere in bringing forward this Bill.  However, I am amazed that something as simple as this cannot be incorporated in what he says is his consensus approach and that he is not in a position to accept his Bill which was a sensible one at the time it was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only two countries in Europe that do not have restrictions on Sunday trading &mdash; Ireland and Sweden.  In Germany no Sunday trading <Col N="588" /> is allowed, except for shops at train stations. In France only food shops open and there is no Sunday trading in Belgium.  We are out of step with the majority of countries in Europe.  It is time we get in step before the free for all in the retail trade takes off.  We will not be able to stop it.  The Minister said it is perhaps too late and that shopping centres are open on Sunday.  The last time the Minister spoke on this he said shoppers were voting with their feet.</P>
    <P>I represent a rural area in east Cork where there are three medium-sized towns.  The family-owned businesses there are under increasing pressure to compete with mainly foreign multiples. They cannot compete.  Those in family businesses must work seven days a week because they cannot afford to take on extra staff.  Statistics show that these businesses, which are important in rural areas, are declining in number.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State is dealing with the various social partners he should seriously take this into account.  On more than one occasion, concern has been expressed in this House about rural decline.  I fear for the future if shops in rural areas have to close because they cannot compete, in particular due to Sunday trading.  The argument has been made that people will spend more if shops are open on Sundays, but people only have a fixed amount of money to spend.  Therefore, it does not make that much difference whether shops open on Sundays.</P>
    <P>The problem of drugs in society was alluded to earlier.  As a former career guidance counsellor who last June was dealing with suicidal students in various schools, I can tell the Minister of State that unless we start organising society so that families can spend more time together we will really go down the slippery slope.  Mention was made of the fact that nowadays families are attracted to shopping malls on Sundays, but that is not healthy for society.  Toys and all the other elements of consumerism are available in such malls.  It is up to us to examine that issue.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State is taking the matter seriously but I urge him to move before it is too late.  The Minister of State said he was concerned about workers and the public generally. I would also stress the need to be concerned about small rural shops.  We are witnessing an increase in the number of multiples.  I represent a rural farming area where if the multiples become too powerful they will put pressure on suppliers who will be told to deal with the multiples under their conditions or else.  The Minister of State must look at that matter also.  Sandwiches, for example, are being flown in from Britain by some of these multiples, instead of being made in Ireland and jobs are being lost as a result.  Seven day working has also led to an increase in casualisation of the work force.  People need secure jobs and pressure will be put on families if there are only part-time jobs because they are low paid.</P>
    <P>Sunday shopping is not an essential service. People do not have to shop on Sundays for food or clothes.  The Minister of State mentioned other <Col N="589" /> services and compared them with shopping but there is no comparison.  Nurses and doctors provide an essential service and have to work on Sundays, as do the fire brigade and the police. However, there is no reason for large shops to open on Sundays because they have six other days in the week during which to do so.  In Germany shopping is even restricted on Saturdays, so where are we going?  Traditionally, small corner shops opened on Sundays.  That was how they made a few bob to survive.  Large multiples, however, are selling everything so we will see more and more small shops closing down.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides an essential opt out for workers who do not wish to work on Sundays. The Minister of State is right in saying that it is a first step but he has been a long time in taking it. If he is talking about rejecting this Bill then he is taking a step backwards.  Sunday trading has resulted in very few new jobs being created as was shown by the Irish Productivity Centre in a recent study commissioned by the Minister of State's Department.  Pension rights will be affected if there is too much casualisation.  The Minister for Finance recently explained the problems in this regard.  The social welfare system will come under increasing pressure if there are too many part-time jobs.</P>
    <P>This is the fourth year in a row that Sunday trading has caused confrontation and it is time action was taken.  People accepted that shops opened on Sundays coming up to Christmas. However, this is now an all year round practice. Last year shops wanted to open on Easter Sunday but, fortunately, that did not happen.  Our legislation does not prevent shops from opening on such days.  If a large store decides to open on Easter Sunday or Christmas day, the other large shops will be under pressure to follow their example.  There is a danger that the small traditional shops in our towns and villages will be squeezed out in the war between the big supermarkets.</P>
    <P>The Minister is one of the few people who has the power to act in this regard.  I urge him to accept this Bill.  If he introduces his own Bill, it will be a signal to the workers and the large stores that Fianna Fáil in Government will do another U-turn.  We all know Fianna Fáil's record on U-turns.</P>

I hope that does not mean he was irresponsible when in Opposition.  I would hate to think he wasted our time by introducing a Bill about which he was not serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Organisation of Working Time Act is on the Statute Book but I ask the Minister to accept this Bill which gives workers the right not to work on a Sunday.  There must be an onus on <Col N="590" /> the Minister to respect that right even on religious grounds.</P>
    <P>In the 1960s Fine Gael published The Just Society which sowed the seeds for many of the conditions we enjoy today.  It was the catalyst where free education was concerned.  This Bill attempts to take that a step further.  I ask the Minister to accept it before the hypermarkets close all the small shops in our towns and villages. We cannot have consensus between a lion and a lamb and it is up to the Minister to take a stand on this issue.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: When Gilbert and Sullivan produced the line &ldquo;a policeman's lot is not a happy one&rdquo; they never heard of an Opposition Member who became a Minister in a few short months and suddenly found that his lot was not a happy one having to hear his Bill being thrown back at him.</P>
      <P>I find it unacceptable that people should be compelled to work on Sunday.  It has been described here as a day of rest even if one leaves religion out of it, and there is no reason to do so. If one looks at Europe where religion is not very important, they seem to be more civilised than we are.</P>
      <P>Sunday was always a day families spent together, and I feel sorry for parents or single members of a family who would do something which is in keeping with Sunday and the end of the week than simply working in a shop.  For that reason, I would have little time for forcing anybody to work on Sunday.</P>
      <P>I am not sure there is a need for Sunday opening. No doubt if one opens on Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and somebody decides to stay open until 9 p.m., one will find cars in that shop's car park. If somebody decides to go one better and open until midnight, one will find people there also. There is no end to what people do.  There is no time when a shop can close and have nobody there for the last hour; people will always go shopping at the last minute.  They will always want something else.  If shops were open 24 hours a day there would always be somebody who forgot milk, butter, etc.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of Christmas Day.  People would go shopping on Christmas Day if the shops were open but that does not mean the shops should be open to serve them.  People should be more disciplined.  It is not very difficult to plan shopping well in advance, as most housewives do.</P>

When people did not have money, such shops gave many people food before they paid for it; often some of them did not get paid in full.  These are the people for whom we should say enough is enough.  The supermarkets can compete with them all week but there is no reason for them to compete with small shops on Sunday because small shopkeepers provided the facilities over the years.  Such shops may be a little more expensive but they have a friendly atmosphere, they know the people and they can help them.</P>
    <P>If Europe can give us a lead in most matters, I cannot see why we will not follow its example by simply leaving things as they are.  I do not know who is applying the pressure.  I think it is simply greed.  Because the larger supermarkets have more space, more capacity, more goods and more staff, they want to keep selling.</P>
    <P>There is another question: are the larger supermarkets paying wages to compensate for the time people must work?  It is not enough to argue that if people work on Sundays, they will receive overtime payments.  That does not compensate the people who have no choice.  If somebody wants to work on a Sunday, that is fine.  I remember working in England as a student almost 40 years ago.  We only wanted enough to keep going and to get away on Sundays to see as much of London as possible.  However, the real workers who were looking for more money would not take a job unless it offered work on Sunday.  They could get double time for working on a Sunday which was a fair option for them.  However, it is not enough to give double time to somebody who simply does not want to work on a Sunday.  I would hate to have to give up my Sunday to work.  It can be awkward having to take the odd 'phone call on a Sunday but having to go out to do a day's work is another matter.  An opt out must be available.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill which was originally introduced by the Minister of State.  He may have been an irresponsible youth, according to one of his colleagues, but he will have to take a responsible approach now.  I do not see why he cannot allow people to make a decision on Sunday working for themselves rather than compelling them to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the points made by Deputies Stanton, Browne and Broughan.  The Bill introduced by the Minister of State is important in the context of this debate.  He may <Col N="592" /> find himself in a difficult position but it does not help the political process and its reputation when a Member who proposed a certain measure questions it a few months later.  I presume the Minister of State was sincere when he brought forward his Bill a few months ago but it now appears he is finding difficulty with this legislation.  That does no service to the political process.</P>
      <P>The substantive issue is Sunday trading and the protection of workers.  I concur with Deputies' sentiments that we must ensure that those who do not wish to work on Sundays should not be forced to do so.  The retail trade has changed substantially over the past few years and the future of small retailers in towns and villages is under threat.  Deputy Stanton referred to the move beyond supermarkets to hypermarkets and that development will hold no commercial advantage as there is only so much money available to be spent on household provisions.  The more hypermarkets and other large retail units there are the fewer people will be employed in the grocery and allied trades.  In the long-term that will be bad for the rural economy in particular.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that Sunday trading is kept to a minimal level.  Deputy Stanton is aware of the wider European context and it appears that our interpretation of Sunday trading is comparatively liberal.  Ireland may be generally conservative but as far as Sunday trading is concerned it appears that anything goes.  That is not good for workers or the social environment.  It is improper that so many people must work on Sundays.  Given that modern society puts extra stresses on families we must not limit our view to the commercial aspects but must take into account the wider social context. Many families do not spend time together because both parents or one parent must work on a Sunday.  There is an old saying that the family which prays together stays together and a family which speaks and eats together has some chance of staying together.  We are allowing society to develop in a way which does not allow families to spend time together as in the past.  We must look at decisions on Sunday trading, commercial law and the development of hyper markets from a social as well as a commercial and retail viewpoint.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Broughan on his initiative. Although the Minister tried to explain why this legislation may not be appropriate at this time, politically he is sending a negative message not only in relation to the Bill but the political process in that legislation which was politically acceptable a number of months ago is no longer acceptable.  The Minister should be courageous and brave enough to accept this Bill on Second Stage.  If there are difficulties, the Bill may be amended on Committee Stage as the Minister sees fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's announcement that 750 jobs will be shed by the Avonmore-Waterford Group as a result of the merger of the two constituent companies, Waterford and Avonmore Co-operatives, represents a major blow to the south-east region, in particular County Waterford. The news means that the company's plant at Dungarvan will be closed and the workforce in Kilmeaden will be reduced, but the plant will not be closed.  Outside Waterford, the merger will also result in job losses in Rathfarnham, Castlelyons, Clonmel, and Dundalk.  The reverberations of the merger will be felt throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The announcement will result in great economic difficulty for Dungarvan and Kilmeaden and for many individual workers.  It is a devastating blow for any family so close to Christmas.  The closure of the plant will have a damaging effect on Dungarvan's local economy because of the number of firms and businesses which depend on spin-off trade from the co-operative.  Approximately 200 people are employed at the milk processing plant which is the main source of employment in the town.  There has been a processing plant in Dungarvan for the past 90 years.  Not only is a considerable number of the town's workforce working at the plant, but it is part and parcel of the town's history.  It is evident that Waterford will lose considerably as a result of the merger sanctioned by the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>When the merger was first mooted, members of Waterford Co-operative were justifiably concerned that their plant would lose out as a result. It is evident that Waterford will now be a junior partner in the new operation and Avonmore will play a leading role.  It is imperative that the company begins immediate negotiations with trade union representatives about the proposed closures. Failure to do so will inevitably lead to industrial action and all that entails.  Tonight's announcement by the trade unions that they will oppose involuntary redundancies is welcome.  The company failed to consult fully with the unions when the rationalisation plan was being drawn up.  Government and Opposition must ensure that the company will enter into meaningful and worthwhile negotiations with the trade unions representing the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in conjunction with the IDA and Forbairt, must ensure that replacement industries and employment be quickly found for the towns and regions which have been hardest hit by the fallout from this merger.  A task force comprising all relevant Government agencies <Col N="594" /> akin to that which has proven so successful in Tallaght must be put in place to ensure workers who lose their jobs will be provided with training and reskilling to help them find alternative employment. Avonmore-Waterford Group has grown and developed thanks, in part, to the loyalty and commitment of its workforce through the years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation of £5 million to establish an investment fund and a development fund but in the context of the unfortunate lack of appropriate consultation in deciding to close the plants, this measure may only be seen as a sop by a disgruntled workforce.  It is up to the company and the Government to demonstrate that this is not the case.  Any rationalisation plan should be introduced on a voluntary and agreed basis.  The company should make every effort to retain the maximum number of jobs at all the plants and it should also make every effort to develop new product lines.  The Government and the Minister should commit every possible resource to minimise the impact of the situation and to provide worthwhile and decently paid alternative employment.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for sharing his valuable time and the Minister for coming here.  As this affects his constituency as well as mine we are both interested in what happens. When I spoke with company representatives today, they gave their reasons for the job losses. An amalgamation of two major companies is bound to lead to job losses.  The losses in this case are not confined to Dublin and Waterford; they also affect my constituency.  We have lost an integral part of the Avonmore Group at Suir Island in Clonmel with job losses for about 35 people.</P>
      <P>The company hopes to retrain and relocate some of these workers.  It has committed £7 million with the Government and Forbairt to a programme of retraining, replacement and redevelopment of the company.  I hope every effort will be made to negotiate properly with the trade union movement, which is not unreasonable in these cases if its members are to be properly cared for.  There is no compensation for the loss of a job.  Money in the hand is great today but it will be gone by Christmas.  A job is more important.</P>

      <P>As we suspected months ago, this is not a merger but a takeover and has been since the beginning.  The part of the country where Deputy O'Shea and I live has suffered inordinately in this so-called merger.  Will the Tánaiste and the Minister of State reassess the situation because I believe they were not told the full story by the company?  The Tánaiste realised that last week when she met with the unions who had not been appraised of this disgraceful situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 250 jobs are being lost in Dungarvan, a small provincial market town which, with Mitchelstown, is the home of the dairy industry in <Col N="595" /> Ireland.  The facility in Dungarvan is the best in the group and is second to none.  There is no reason it should be closed other than favouritism by the parent group.  This is appalling.  The workers are shellshocked and one cannot blame them for feeling that way.  It is not their fault.  The management made some imprudent decisions, such as purchasing major operations abroad about which they did not know anything and which lost heavily and the workforces in Dungarvan and Kilmeaden are suffering because of this.</P>
    <P>I ask the Tánaiste and the Minister of State to reassess the situation because the Tánaiste gave the so-called merger her endorsement last July.  It is not a merger; it is a takeover.  The treatment of the workers has not been even handed because the people in County Waterford have been victimised. I want the Tánaiste to intervene to ensure fair play.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concerns about the announcement today at the Avonmore Waterford Group of the major job losses of 750 which are expected to arise in Ireland from the major reorganisation programme which the group intends to implement in order to achieve world class competitiveness. The scale of the job losses envisaged is substantial by any measure and I accept that the group rationalisation will have a very serious impact on employees, their families and local communities in several areas of the country, including Rathfarnham in my constituency.</P>
      <P>The Avonmore-Waterford Group has indicated that the scale of the reorganisation proposed reflects the seriousness of the issues facing the entire dairy industry which prompted the merger of Avonmore and Waterford.  The reorganisation programme is expected to be completed in 1998.  While the costs involved in human terms are substantial, the group is satisfied that such a comprehensive restructuring is essential to optimise efficiency and competitiveness and consolidate its significant international position.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the programme is designed to achieve competitive advantage in key sectors of the food industry, such as consumer dairy and meat products and dairy food ingredients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment urged the Avonmore-Waterford Group to seek to ensure that jobs losses arising from the merger were kept to the minimum possible while recognising that the objective was to create a major global player in the food processing industry and secure employment and growth in the long-term.  In this context, in her recent meetings with management and trade unions, she strongly encouraged both sides to deal with restructuring on the basis of dialogue and partnership.  The group acknowledges the serious impact which the rationalisation programme will have on employees and local communities <Col N="596" /> and is putting in place a comprehensive range of measures to alleviate or reduce the hardships which are likely to arise.  These measures include attractive redundancy terms, a programme of retraining, reskilling and relocation support and a task force, in association with Forbairt, to identify and secure replacement employment projects.</P>
    <P>In addition, the group is providing substantial resources for the establishment of support funds which are designed to attract jobs to the affected areas and ease the adverse social and economic impacts arising from closures or reductions in plant size.  The Tánaiste has secured the agreement of the Avonmore-Waterford Group that it will establish a programme to deal with the retraining and counselling of workers who opt for redundancy.</P>
    <P>Forbairt and other industrial development agencies will be working closely with the Avonmore-Waterford Group to lessen the impact of the closures and redundancies and will do everything possible to assist redundant workers through initiatives such as training and retraining, identification of alternative job opportunities and the attraction of replacement industries.  The response from the group should take full cognisance of the scale and impact of job losses envisaged in this rationalisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  Punitive, penal and anti-small business is how I would describe the commercial rate increases applied to all business, particularly those which have worked to develop and improve their trade.  The new commercial rate will mean an increase of 200 per cent in some cases.  Businesses which attempt to show initiative by upgrading premises and improving customer facilities and services are being penalised by vast rate increases.</P>
      <P>Business people know they must pay rates. They do not mind paying balanced and fair rates but this is not happening.  Instead, they are facing revaluations which are leading to substantially increased rate demands which are supposed to include council services, such as refuse collection, water supply and sewerage facilities.  At least that is what the rate demand states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the financial reality is that business people are not only paying vastly inflated rates, they are also paying twice for some services.  For example, refuse collections have been privatised by most, if not all, local authorities and must be paid for separately.  In addition to rates, rural businesses also receive demands for water charges.  Is this fair? <Col N="597" /> To compound matters, county councils are meeting to strike a rate.  Most rate increases are between 4 per cent and 9 per cent while the rate of inflation is 1.2 per cent.  How can businesses pay these enormous increases while employing the same number of people, selling to the same customer base, maintaining the same business level and selling the same products?  How can increases of 200 per cent be explained or justified?  What benchmark does the Commissioner in the Valuations Office use to arrive at these figures?  These are the questions small businesses are asking.  I have an example from one person in my home town who paid a rate of £1,300 last year.  Following a revaluation this year the demand was £6,000.  This company had made a profit of £1,000.  The business cannot survive.  This action is criminal.</P>
    <P>Small businesses and industries are the social and economic backbone of the country.  They have survived in times of recession, providing employment and essential services.  Like the post offices and the Garda, they play vital roles in local communities and towns, often providing a service and credit line to customers that no multinational or faceless corporate body would ever provide.  It is hard to believe that while we are encouraging people to start their own businesses we are also crippling businesses which attempt to improve or develop.  It is ludicrous and demands immediate action, otherwise, we will soon have no small businesses.</P>
    <P>If a small business wants to appeal a rate valuation increase it has to pay an extra £400.  This too is ludicrous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for sharing time on this important issue.  It is coincidental that Sunday trading was discussed during Private Members' business.  This Adjournment Matter is of concern to small businesses and is related to the big business versus small business agenda. This is not an issue about which Quinnsworth, Dunnes Stores or any of the large multiples often express concern, but it is an issue that strikes terror into the heart of small businesses when they see the officials from the Valuation Office touring the country revaluing property.  Very often these revised valuations have little or no connection with the capacity of the business to generate income.  This has to be a critical factor in any review by the Valuation Office.</P>
      <P>I suggest some consideration be given to devolving the powers of the Valuation Office to local authorities to ensure there is some degree of local knowledge when revaluations are being carried out.  There is a perception down the country that employees of the Valuation Office come from Dublin and do not have a clue about the valuation of properties in rural Ireland.  There is a significant difference between property valuations in Dublin compared with those in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some mechanism has to be put in place whereby valuations imposed on properties have <Col N="598" /> some connection to the capacity of businesses to repay the revised valuation.  Otherwise we are forcing small businesses, which are the backbone of rural communities, out of business.  I would like to hear the Minister's thinking on this issue.  I feel there is some merit in devolving responsibility to local authorities thereby ensuring valuation has some relationship to the reality on the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for raising this issue and Deputy Creed for contributing. I am delighted to come to the House and have the opportunity of allaying the concerns of Deputies at the effect of the rateable valuation on small businesses.  As Deputies will be aware, the setting of rateable valuations is the responsibility of the Commissioner of Valuation.  The commissioner and his staff in the Valuations Office are assigned the task of setting up and maintaining the valuation lists and these valuations are the basis on which local authorities assess the rates payable by the business community. Rates form a significant part of the funding of local authorities and the take in 1997 will be in the order of £360 million.</P>
      <P>The commissioner is independent of the Minister for Finance, the rating authorities and rate payers in carrying out his statutory functions under the Valuation Acts.  The underlying principle and cornerstone which guides the work of the commissioner and his staff is that there should be uniformity and equity between rateable valuations. This means that the occupier of a property should pay a comparable amount of rates to the occupier of a comparable property and the amount of rates should be fair and reasonable having regard to the benefits of occupation of the property.  To achieve this objective, the Valuation Office assesses what is called the rateable valuation of the property.  The rateable valuation is based on the net annual value, or in simpler terms, the rental value of the property.</P>
      <P>To preserve the equity and uniformity I referred to, there is a provision in the Valuation Acts that the rating authority or the ratepayer may apply to have the rateable valuation of any property reassessed by the Valuation Office.  This is called the annual revision process and it would be fair to say that it is availed of more often by the rating authority than by the ratepayer.  Applications for revision would be made, for instance, to add new properties to the valuation list, to delete properties which have been demolished and to correct any valuation which was considered to be out of line with comparable properties. This could happen, for instance, because of market changes, renovations, extensions and so on.  Approximately 12,000 valuations are reassessed under the revision process each year.</P>
      <P>The revision cycle works as follows.  When an application for a revision is received in the Valuation Office, a valuer is appointed to inspect the property, interview the occupier and research and analyse the relevant market rental information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> Then, taking all the factors which influence property value into account, the valuer puts a rateable valuation on the property.  Lists of revised valuations are published four times a year in February, May, August and November.  The main publication is in November and the process of striking the rate in the pound by the relevant rating authority follows this publication.  Where a ratepayer considers the valuation assessment on his or her premises to be excessive, there is a right of appeal.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, the ratepayer makes the appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation.  A valuer, other than the valuer who handled the revision, known as an appeal valuer, is appointed to investigate the ratepayer's appeal, inspect the premises, consult with the ratepayer and report back to the commissioner.  The commissioner considers the appeal valuer's report and may raise, lower or confirm the valuation.  The rating authority has a similar right of appeal to the commissioner.</P>
    <P>Where a ratepayer or rating authority is dissatisfied with the commissioner's decision on the first appeal, there is a further right of appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  The members of the tribunal are appointed by the Minister for Finance and each appeal is heard and decided by three members.  At the tribunal, both sides, the ratepayer and the appeal valuer from the Valuation Office, are given the opportunity to present written and oral evidence on their valuation. The tribunal must issue a written judgment setting out the reasons for their decision.  The decision of the tribunal is final in relation to the amount of a valuation but there is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on points of law.</P>
    <P>I hope this outline of the independent status and functions of the Commissioner of Valuation and of the valuation revision and appeal cycle will reassure Deputies that the system is fair and accessible and that there are ample appeal provisions to protect the interests of traders and business people.  I would like to finish by saying that what the Deputy is referring to is the annual revision process undertaken by the Valuation Office on certain properties at the request of ratepayers or the local authorities and not a revaluation.</P>
    <P>A revaluation would entail the updating, on a systematic basis, of the valuation of every business property in the State.  The draft heads of a valuation Bill, providing for such a revaluation, are currently at an advanced stage of preparation in the Department of Finance, a role in which I am directly involved.  As soon as consideration of the draft heads are complete it will be necessary to obtain the views of other Departments.  As the proposed Bill is intended to update and overhaul the valuation code, the process of consultation with other Departments is likely to be complex and detailed.  As soon as the consultation process is complete and its results taken on board, it is <Col N="600" /> intended to bring a memorandum to the Government.</P>
    <P>I repeat, the Valuation Office has been engaged in the routine annual revision programme, a programme designed to ensure uniformity and equity between ratepayers, nothing else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise the matter and the Minister of State for giving his views.  I also thank the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for his lengthy reply to a parliamentary question I tabled last week.  Unfortunately, I was unable to put some questions to the Minister then but I am glad to have the opportunity to do so now.</P>
      <P>The Minister's address to the AGM of the International Monetary Fund in Hong Kong in September was a missed opportunity to raise the stakes on the debt initiative which applies to the highly indebted countries of the Third World. While he referred to the initiative, he did not take on the position of leadership which Ireland should show in this matter.</P>
      <P>As a small neutral country, we have a significant role to play.  We have a positive role because of our proud membership of the United Nations and the fact that we do not carry the political baggage of non-neutral countries on the world stage. Our neutral status gives us an element of objectivity when dealing with international affairs.</P>
      <P>We have a very proud tradition of overseas aid. Many of the worthy projects undertaken by Irish aid workers in HIPC countries are a positive indication of our role on the international stage.  We have come a long way as a State from the days of collecting pennies in schools for the black babies of the Third World.  We should follow through on that good work by taking the initiative on this HIPC issue.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of political will on the matter. We should apply political pressure on the appropriate financial institutions to move faster on the debt question.  Our overseas aid to Third World countries is in the form of non-repayable grants rather than loans.  We should look at the agencies which are issuing loans to Third World countries at very high interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IMF is not without blame in the matter of Third World debt.  On many occasions it encouraged poor countries to borrow, resulting in the present crisis.  Many of those IMF loans were advanced to corrupt regimes.  It advanced $1 billion to the former regime in Zaire, which is regarded as one of the most undemocratic and corrupt in the world.  That money must now be repaid with interest.  I hope some credit will be given to the changed Administration in Zaire and the efforts being undertaken to improve the democratic structures.  Creditors must take their share of the responsibility for the formation of this debt crisis.  It is not morally sustainable to <Col N="601" /> allow creditors walk away from their actions and mistakes.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a small country with a small but real voice.  We should call for the inclusion of social development indicators in the debt sustainability analysis.  All of the HIPC countries should receive notices of debt reduction by the year 2000.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, is aware of the petition Jubilee 2000, signed by thousands of citizens in every part of the country, calling for action on this debt to ensure that, by the end of the century, the low income countries can have a little more to look forward to than at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising an important issue and one in which I have a personal interest.  Ireland has been a supporter of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative from its earlier stages to the protracted and difficult process of the negotiation of its terms.  In the implementation of the HIPCS the Government is concerned that the initiative should offer a real exit from excessive debt to the countries concerned and allow them to regenerate their capacity for economic and social development. Ireland has, therefore, sought to ensure that, under the terms of the initiative, the number of beneficiary countries should be maximised, the level of debt relief to be delivered should be as generous as possible, expeditious decision making and implementation should drive the process and flexibility and pragmatism should inform each decision.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is Governor for Ireland at the IMF and the World Bank and has put these Irish concerns on the record of their annual meetings.  The Government believes that both Bretton Woods institutions should be congratulated on the progress that has been made on the implementation of HIPC.</P>
      <P>At this point, three countries have been approved for debt relief.  The first country to benefit financially will be Uganda, with a total package valued in nominal terms of more than $700 million.  The package, which is to be delivered by April 1998, will reduce Uganda's debt to a sustainable level.  The completion of the package has been warmly welcomed by the Ugandan Minister of Planning and Economic Development who described it as very welcome for all Ugandans.</P>
      <P>Bolivia and Burkina Faso have also qualified for assistance under the initiative, with final decisions expected soon on Cote d'Ivoire, Mozambique and Guyana.  Thirteen other countries are expected to qualify in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much comment on the debt initiative has focused on the structural adjustment necessary to underpinning economic reform.  In our view, such adjustment is a necessary step on the road to economic and social sustainability.  Ireland's experience from the middle 1980s to date shows the benefits to be derived from making the necessary <Col N="602" /> economic adjustments, however difficult these may be.</P>
    <P>The Government considers it imperative that economic development programmes prepared with the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank should take into account the impact which the adjustment process has on the poorer sectors in society and should be framed so as to mitigate undue hardship.</P>
    <P>In recent years the IMF and the World Bank have given much higher prominence to human resource development and social sector issues. There is increasing evidence, both in their literature and their actions on the ground, to suggest that these ideals have been internalised within the culture of both organisations.  The Government is especially pleased to note that the Government of Burkina Faso has, in the context of the debt initiative, committed itself to ensuring that the funds released as a result of the debt relief will be used to strengthen social development programmes.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised that this debt burden has been a major factor in curtailing the development of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries. The Government believes that economic development offers the best prospect of a real and sustained alleviation of the poverty which affects such large segments of society in these countries.  Reliance on any one measure on its own is not likely to produce long lasting results or the impact required for sustainable development. The debt initiative must, therefore, be regarded as but another, albeit important, instrument in the armoury of the multilateral doner community in the fight against poverty.  It would be unwise to burden the debt initiative with the sole responsibility for poverty reduction.</P>
    <P>I remind the House about the Government's position in regard to contributing to ESAF.  The enhanced structural adjustment facility is the vehicle by which the IMF channels its share of relief to beneficiary countries under the debt initiative.  Any decision to proceed with an Irish contribution to ESAF will be taken in the light of the findings of the external evaluation of ESAF which is currently under way and the IMF's response to it, particularly in regard to the social sector conditionality.</P>
    <P>As I stressed, in its involvement with the debt initiative Ireland remains committed to ensuring it provides a genuine exit from debt to beneficiary countries and that in its implementation the burden of adjustment does not bear down unduly on the poorer sections in society.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil as deis a thabhairt dom an t-ábhar seo a thógáil ar an athló.  Ba mhaith liom fosta buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit a bhfuil suim agus tuiscint aige ar an gceist seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is dócha go bhféadfadh duine a rá go mbeidh deireadh le ré an eastáit tionscail i nGaobh Dobhair <Col N="603" /> nuair a dhúnfar tionscal atá lonnaithe ar an eastát le 25 bliana agus nuair a chaillfidh 50 duine a bpostanna seachtain na Nollag.</P>
    <P>Is tionscal é seo a thug fostaíocht ó bunaíodh é i 1972.  Bhí uair amháin ann agus bhí suas le 100 duine fostaithe sa tionscal sin.  Le roinnt blianta anuas bhí deacrachtaí acu.  Bhí táirgí ag teacht isteach ón taobh amuigh go dtí an tír agus bhí postanna á gcailliúint go dtí i láthair na huaire go bhfuil 50 duine ansin.</P>
    <P>Bhí táirgeadh íontach speisialta agus íontach suimiúil á chur ar fáil acu, sé sin málaí plaisteacha do chomhlachtaí móra siopadóireachta na tíre seo cosúil le Dunnes Stores, Superquinn, Quinnsworth, Penneys, Aer Rianta agus comhlachtaí eile Stáit.  Caithfidh mé a rá go raibh na daoine a bhí fostaithe ansin íontach bródúil as an obair a bhí ar siúl acu.  D'fhéadfainn a rá chomh maith éinne as an ceantar a bhí ag iarraidh poist sna blianta thart bhí fonn orthu fostaíocht a fháil i Europlast.  Bhí coinníollacha maithe oibre ann, tionscal breá folláin ansin agus tuarastal maith.  Ón aithne agus ón eolas a bhí agam féin orthu, bhí sé cosúil le teaghlach mór sona sásta. Ach anois táimid ag an staid go bhfuil an tionscal sin ag teacht go dtí deireadh a ré.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé beidh Europlast ag dúnadh a ndóirse i ndiaidh 25 bliana ar 19 Nollag.  Beidh 50 oibrí a thug seirbhís fhada agus dílseacht as cuimse don tionscal ag cailleadh a slí beatha.  Fir is ea an chuid is mó acu sin agus dualgaisí teaghlaigh agus freagrachtaí morgáistí ar go leor acu.</P>
    <P>Is iad seo an buíon oibrithe a d'fhan leis an tionscal go deireadh, a thug an dílseacht is láidre agus an tseirbhís is faide.  Beidh siad ag cailleadh a slí beatha, a modh maireachtála seachtain roimh Fhéile mhór na Nollag.  Is truamhéilleach an bronntanas Nollag atá á bhronnadh orthu.</P>
    <P>Tá sé de dhualgas orainn uilig a bheith fial agus flaithiúil leo, aitheantas a thabhairt dóibh ar an méid atá déanta acu i rith na mblianta.  Ní leor ar chor ar bith íocaíochtaí iomarcaíochta reachtúla a thabhairt dóibh.  Is ionann sin agus cúpla míle punt a thabhairt do dhuine taréis breis agus fiche bliain oibre.  Cé eile sa tír a ghlacfadh le suim dá leithéid?  Daoine as an chomhlacht a d'éireodh as blianta anuas nuair a deineadh ath-structúr cheana air bhí a cheithre nó a chúig oiread airgid le fáil.  An gcaithfimid píonós a chur ar na daoine a d'fhan leis an chomhlacht go deireadh?  Ag cruinniú seachtain ó shin leag na hoibrithe síos coinniollacha íocaíocha iomarcaíochta fíor-réasúnta a rabhadar sásta glacadh leo.</P>
    <P>Ó tharla gur seo an tionscal deiridh sa tír gur le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta é, go bhfuil úinéireacht iomlán ag an Údarás air, sílim gur chóir don Údarás a bheith flaithiúil leo mar ní bheidh cás mar seo rompú go deo arís.</P>
    <P>Táim fosta ag iarraidh ar an Aire Stáit agus tuigeann sé cad é atá ag dul ar aghaidh.  Bhuail sé leis na hoibrithe, chas sé orm féin agus le hionadaithe poiblí eile agus phlé muid an scéal.  Tá fhios agam go dtuigeann sé an cás go maith.  Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit agus ar an chomhlacht féin <Col N="604" /> gach dícheall a dhéanamh a bheith flaithiúil ag an am seo.</P>
    <P>Tuigim go bhfuil na hacmhainní agus an t-airgead ansin, ach an toil a bheith ann, é a dháileadh amach go fiúntach.  Cé go mbeidh deireadh le fostaíocht ann seachtain na Nollag ar a laghad níor cheart dúinn a bheith fuar nó teann nó gortach go speisialta le linn séasúr na féile.</P>
    <P>Mar sin mar fhocal scoir, iarraim ar an Aire agus ar an Údarás agus ar an chomhlacht gach dícheall a dhéanamh caitheamh go flaithiúil agus go flúirseach leis na hoibrithe mar níl geallúint ar bith tugtha dóibh go mbeidh fostaíocht le fáil acu nuair a thiocfaidh an comhlacht nua isteach.  Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil comhlacht nua ag teacht isteach ach mar sin féin ba chóir dúinn a bheith flaitiúil agus aitheantas a thabhairt do na daoine a thug seirbhís chomh fada agus chomh dílis sin do Europlast.</P>

      <P>Is cúis áiféala agus imní dom an méid atá taréis tarlú do Europlast ach mar a thuigim ón Teachta is scéal é seo atá ag dul ar aghaidh le píosa fada agus a bhí romham nuair a tháinig mé isteach mar Aire Stáit.</P>
      <P>Tuigim ó Údarás na Gaeltachta go bhfuil cinneadh déanta ag Bord Europlast Teo éirí as trádáil ag deireadh na bliana.  Déanfar socruithe ansin chun na creidiúnaithe a íoc agus pá iomarcaíochta a íoc leis na fostaithe.  Ar ndóigh tá stair fhada ag an gcomhlacht seo a bunaíodh i nGaoth Dóbhair i 1972 chun málaí plaisteacha a tháirgeadh d'ollmhairgí agus do shiopaí eile.  Is fochuideachta faoi lánúinéireachta an Údaráis í Europlast agus tá cúnamh de níos mó ná £4 milliún, idir scaireanna agus deontais, curtha ar fáil don chomhlacht ón tús.  Is cúis dhíomá mar sin go bhfuil sé chun dúnadh.</P>
      <P>Bhí deacrachtaí trádála ag an gcomhlacht i rith an ama ar fad, beagnach, ó bunaíodh é.  Tá sé ag feidhmiú in earnáíl ghnó atá an-iomaíoch mar gheall ar iomportálacha ón gCian-Oirthear.  Tá tréan iarrachtaí déanta thar na blianta chun an comhlacht a shlánú.  Is easpa díolachán is chúis do dhroch-thoradh an chomhlachta i 1997 agus is de bharr drochthorthaí leanúnacha a chinn bord an chomhlachta a dhúnadh.</P>
      <P>Is cúis sásaimh dom go bhfuil togra ionaid aimsithe ag an Údarás chun dul i mbun gnó sa mhonarcha chéanna ar an Eastát Tionscail i nGaoth Dobhair ag déanamh raon beag de mhálaí plaisteacha. Is príomhaithe ón Iodáil atá taobh thiar den togra seo.  Ní bheidh an comhlacht nua seo in ann fostaithe uile Europlast a fhostú ag an tús ach tuigim go bhfuil sprioc fostaíochta de 50 duine ag an ngnó nua ach é a bheith faoi lánseol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le pá iomarcaíochta tuigim go bhfuil an cheist seo á plé i gcónaí idir an comhlacht, na fostaithe agus an tÚdarás.  Níl aon togra sonrach faighte ag mo Roinnse ón Údarás maidir le pá iomarcaíochta de bhreis ar phá iomarcaíochta reachtúil a íoc leis na hoibrithe.  Beidh togra chun na críche sin le plé leis an Roinn Airgeadais ag <Col N="605" /> féachaint do na treoracha atá i bhfeidhm maidir le híocaíochtaí den chineál sin.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a lua gur phléigh mé cheist na hiomarcaíochta le toscaireacht ón bhfoireann i mí Mheán Fómhair seo caite agus tuigim go maith na hiarrachtaí atá déanta acu chun an comhlacht a choimeád i mbun gnó thar na blianta trí ghlacadh le hísliú pá agus le hathruithe sa chóras seal oibre, srl.  Is mór an trua é, áfach, d'ainneoin na n-íobairtí sin go bhfuil an gnó chun dúnadh.  Ina dhiaidh sin féin is cúis dóchais é go bhfuil togra ionaid aimsithe ina áit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> Is féidir leis an Teachta bheith cinnte go bhfuil mé i gcomhairle leanúnach le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta faoin gceist seo ar fad agus go bhfuil gach iarracht ar bun le teacht ar shocrú chomh sásúil agus is féidir sna cuinsí atá ann.</P>
    <P>Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith dearfa go bhfuil obair ar bun leis an oiread agus is féidir a dhéanamh ar son na n-oibrithe.  Tá súil agam gur féidir linn teacht ar réiteach sásúil ag an deireadh.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 76, 237 and 291 together.</P>
      <P>The new urban renewal scheme which will come into operation on 1 August 1998 will be based on a more planned and targeted approach than earlier schemes.  Designations under the scheme will be considered on the basis of integrated area plans prepared by local authorities for areas of greatest priority in urban renewal terms.</P>
      <P>Last week, I approved the guidelines for the new urban renewal scheme and these have now been sent to local authorities.  These guidelines, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, set out the criteria which local authorities are asked to use in the selection of urban areas for which integrated area plans are to be prepared.  The document also provides guidance on the type of issues which those plans are expected to address.</P>
      <P>In the context of the criteria for selecting areas, the guidelines deal with the important issue of the size of urban areas likely to be suitable for consideration under the new scheme.  The point made in the guidelines is that very few towns of less than 6,000 population received designation under the schemes up to now and that such towns would be likely to have greater difficulty qualifying under the criteria for the new scheme.</P>
      <P>While this does not equate to setting a strict 6,000 population threshold, it reflects the fact that the scheme is concerned with urban renewal and that it must therefore, of its nature, be confined to areas with strong urban characteristics.  The indicative population level also reflects the fact that the successful implementation of a scheme of this nature in an urban area requires a minimum level of scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received representations seeking to have the 6,000 population guideline reduced.  This issue was considered by the expert advisory panel which I established to advise me on certain aspects of the new scheme as part of its overall consideration of the guidelines for the new scheme.  The panel's recommendations, which I accepted, was that the 6,000 guidelines should remain unchanged on the basis that, while it is only a guideline, it provides a reasonable baseline <Col N="609" /> indication of the minimum size of urban area likely to be able to meet the criteria for designation under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The designation of an area under the new scheme could only be considered if it falls within an urban area which the relevant local authority decides is a priority area for which an integrated area plan should be prepared.  In that context, if a town with a population of less than 6,000 was considered to be a priority, the relevant local authority would have to demostrate clearly how the town meets the criteria for the new scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 40 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that arrangements for transport management in Dublin would be improved by assigning responsibilities in this regard to a Minister of State or by establishing a ministerial task force.  On the contrary, I believe that the priority should be to support the recently established Dublin Transportation Office (DTO) in its task of co-ordinating and driving the implementation of the Dublin Transport Initiative; and to ensure also that the role of director of traffic, Dublin Corporation is fully operationalised.</P>
      <P>DTO has already secured high level and multiagency participation in its work, together with active input from local authorities and interested bodies.  Infrastructural and management initiatives are now well under way to implement the DTI strategy.  The director of traffic, Dublin Corporation is working towards new and intensified measures for traffic management and enforcement.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> In accordance with its mandate, DTO had recently commenced work on reviewing and updating the DTI strategy and expects to make an interim report within six months.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission recently announced its decision formally to open infringement procedures with regard to 13 member states, including Ireland, for failure to adopt and-or communicate to the Commission waste plans covering general waste, hazardous waste and packaging waste.  Detailed grounds for this decision in Ireland's case have not yet been notified by the Commission.</P>
      <P>There has been no failure to produce waste management plans here.  As I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 326 and 327 of 12 November 1997, all relevant local authorities have adopted waste and special waste plans as required under the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979 and the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous) Waste Regulations, 1982. However, these plans have not included a specific chapter on the management of packaging and packaging waste, as subsequently required under EU Directive 94/62/EC.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996 introduced significant new obligations on local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency with regard to waste management planning.  The EPA is now required to make a national hazardous waste management plan and each local authority is required to make a waste management plan in respect of its functional area, which will supersede those plans made under the 1978 and 1982 Regulations.  Detailed provisions in regard to the content of local waste management plans, including requirements arising from Directive 94/62/EC, are specified in the Waste Management (Planning) Regulation, 1997.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have been fully apprised of their obligations under the 1996 Act, including those relating to waste management planning, <i>inter alia</i>, in the course of two national seminars conducted by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that very good progress is being made in the development of the new national and local waste management plans.  The Environmental <Col N="611" /> Protection Agency and local authorities are now initiating, carrying out, or have completed, preparatory strategy studies.  Grant assistance towards the cost of these studies is available under the EU co-financed operational programme for environmental services, 1994-99.</P>
    <P>My Department has been promoting the carrying out of such studies on an inter-authority basis. I welcome the fact that most local authorities have adopted or are adopting a regional approach which will facilitate more rational, integrated waste management planning.  In all the circumstances, a meeting of the kind proposed would not serve any useful purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 45 and 84 together.  Under the electoral law, provision is made for the holding of two or more polls in respect of elections or referenda to be held on the same day.  I have no proposals to amend the law to restrict the number of polls which may be taken together.</P>
      <P>Under electoral and referendum law, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to appoint the polling day at an election or referendum.  The law provides that any day of the week may be appointed as polling day and that polling shall continue for a period of at least 12 hours, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10.30 p.m. I have no proposal to restrict the discretion of the Minister as to the day or hours of polling which may be appointed at an election or referendum.  The current legislation allows for decisions to be taken in each case having regard to all the constitutional and statutory requirements concerned.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the register of electors used at any poll should be as accurate as possible. Changes to the law relating to the registration of electors in recent years have helped to improve its accuracy.  The changes include the provision for the entry of persons who are omitted from the original register onto to a supplement to the register during the currency of that register.</P>
      <P>There were also changes to the arrangements relating to postal voting operating for the first time at the recent election and referendum. Under these changes new categories of electors are entitled to apply for entry in the postal voters list and to vote by post.  Any person who, because of the circumstances of his or her occupation, service or employment, is unlikely to be able to vote in person at the polling station is now eligible for entry in the postal voters' list and to vote by post. Third level students, living at an address other than that at which they are registered, qualify for entry in the postal voters' list.  In addition, the law also allows certain electors to apply for entry in a supplement to the postal voters' list during the lifetime of a register of electors.</P>
      <P>While voter turnout has been declining in recent years, it is difficult to establish the precise reasons which can vary for each individual.  I do not consider that it generally has much to do with choice of day, hours of polling, etc.  as no matter what day is chosen, it will not suit everybody.  It is a matter which affects other democracies, not just Ireland, and requires detailed consideration. I will keep it under review and welcome suggestions from Deputies which might improve the turnout at future elections/referenda.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>I am at present formulating a comprehensive package of measures relating to the funding of local authorities.</P>
      <P>Legislation giving effect to these measures, which will start from 1 January 1999, will be brought before this House as soon as possible and will primarily enable the establishment of a local government fund.</P>
      <P>In relation to 1998, the existing funding system, that is, the use of motor tax for general purposes, will remain in place.  Local authorities were notified on 25 September 1997 of the minimum allocations they could expect in 1998 to facilitate them in considering their 1998 estimates.  About half of all local authorities have, to date, adopted their estimates for 1998.</P>
      <P>I propose to require local authorities, using existing legislative powers, to limit increases in rates in conjunction with the introduction of the new funding system.  In the meantime I have requested local authorities, in preparing their 1998 estimates, to exercise restraint in relation to increases in rate poundages.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Road authorities are, however, empowered under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 to provide appropriate traffic calming measures for the purposes of restricting the speed of vehicles on particular roads.  Such measures are being gradually implemented, in many cases with assistance from the National Roads Authority or the Dublin Transportation Office.  In the light of further experience of traffic calming measures, it may be appropriate to consider re-enforcing them <Col N="614" /> by the application of speed limits lower than 30 mph.</P>

      <P>I accept that greater co-ordination between local authorities and health boards in relation to housing functions carried out by the health boards would be beneficial.</P>
      <P>The scale of health board involvement in the housing area has grown significantly in recent years with the increased level of activity of housing supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  In addition, health boards may also be involved in the assessment of the circumstances of individual applicants for local authority housing.  They are also involved particularly in providing services for homeless persons and with special category needs such as persons with disabilities or the elderly e.g. the provision of high support housing or through the special task force for the elderly which is financed by my Department.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking there is a considerable level of co-ordination between local authorities and health boards and, in this connection, I cite as a good example the homeless initiative involving the Eastern Health Board, local authorities and voluntary housing organisations in the Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare area.</P>
      <P>There are, I believe, sound practical reasons underlying the involvement of health boards in the housing area and I consider the appropriate course in this regard is to ensure maximum co-ordination between health boards and local authorities rather than to seek to integrate all housing functions into local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's overall policy in relation to waste management is outlined in our programme An Action Programme for the Millennium and related policy documents.  It is based on a commitment to the waste hierarchy, prioritising first prevention and minimisation; second, recovery, and third, environmentally sustainable disposal.</P>
      <P>In regard to landfill, our objectives include, in particular, the application of strict standards to the management of landfill sites and the diversion of 50 per cent of household waste away from landfill within 15 years.  A range of measures is being pursued or developed to achieve these objectives.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations, 1997 provide for the licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency of all public and private sector landfills and other significant waste disposal facilities.  All new facilities, and certain existing facilities, are licensable with effect from 1 May 1997, and all existing landfill facilities will become licensable on a phased basis in the period up to March 1999.  This licensing system will ensure that very high standards of environmental protection apply to the establishment, operation and aftercare of the facilities concerned.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are required under the Waste Management Act, 1996 to make waste management plans specifying measures aimed at giving effect to the waste hierarchy.  My Department is actively encouraging local authorities to carry out waste management strategy studies, preferably on an inter-authority basis, to provide a comprehensive, informed basis for waste management planning. The strategy studies provide a context for evaluating all the available options and for identifying the measures, or combination of measures, most likely to promote optimum waste management.</P>
      <P>Approximately £8.7 million is available in financial assistance under the operational programme for environmental services 1994-99, to support capital expenditure on the provision of waste recovery and recycling facilities by local authorities and the private sector, and to assist the preparation of waste management strategy studies by regional and local authorities.  Projects assisted include the development of civic amenity sites and sites for recyclables, home and municipal composting projects, and the provision of facilities for recycling waste plastic, paper, glass, textiles, green waste and construction and demolition waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 50 per cent diversion target over 15 years, to which I have referred, takes account of the <Col N="616" /> high proportion, that is 91 per cent of waste currently landfilled, and the unavoidable constraints on the immediate development of alternative infrastructure on the scale required.  It also allows for the development and implementation by REPAK, the industry sponsored organisation, of appropriate systems to meet our national packaging waste recovery targets and give practical effect to the principle of producer responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we are making, and will continue to make, satisfactory progress in developing our waste recovery infrastructure and reducing our relatively high dependence on the disposal of waste to landfills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing legislation, local authorities, as burial boards, are responsible for the management, regulation and control of burial grounds provided by them.  In the case of a privately owned burial ground which is not in decent order, other than one attached to a church or chapel, the local authority may serve notice on the owner to put the burial ground in decent order within a specified time.  If the owner fails to comply with the notice the local authority may itself put the burial ground into decent order.  The maintenance of a burial ground attached to a church or chapel cannot be undertaken by the local authority unless the owners agree to transfer management to the local authority. Where the owner of a burial ground cannot be ascertained, or a notice cannot be served, the local authority can also put the burial ground in good order.  A local authority can also undertake the maintenance of a burial ground at the owner's request.</P>
      <P>I remain to be convinced that amending the legislation to further strengthen the powers of local authorities would resolve the problems referred to by the Deputy without significant additional funding being made available to enable the local authorities to undertake the work involved.  I have no funds at my disposal which could be made available for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 253 and 300 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A range of measures are being undertaken in the light of increases in house prices.  Among the measures for which funding is provided in the 1998 Estimates of expenditure are: the establishment of a £15 million fund over three years, £5 million which will available next year, specifically for the purpose of providing water and sewerage which are required to open up land for housing and other development; the introduction of improvements to a range of social housing measures to improve affordability of housing for shared owners and other low income house purchasers and to enable the voluntary housing sector to meet increasing tender prices.  The cost of these improvements will be met, as appropriate, from the additional funding of £44.74 million provided in the 1998 Estimates for the social and local authority housing programmes; and the recently awarded consultancy study on house <Col N="620" /> prices, the findings of which I hope to have by March 1998.</P>
    <P>Provisional figures which are available to my Department suggest that there has been some moderation in the rate of increase of house prices in the quarter ending 30 September.  When the figures have been finalised, they will be published in the September Housing Statistics Bulletin.</P>

      <P>In 1996, local authorities started 3,728 houses and completed 3,573 houses, including, in both figures, houses purchased by authorities. Final outturn figures for 1997 will be published in the 1997 Housing Statistics Bulletin due to be published in March 1998; it is expected that &ldquo;starts&rdquo; and completions in 1997 will both be about 3,500, again including houses purchased by local authorities.</P>
      <P>The 1996 assessment of housing needs disclosed that the number of households assessed as in need of local authority housing at 29 March 1996 was 27,427.  Additional details of the assessment are given in my Department's housing statistics bulletin for 1996 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The provision in my Department's Estimates for the local authority housing programme will allow for 3,900 new houses to be started or purchased in 1998.  It is expected that about 3,700 houses will be completed or purchased in 1998.</P>

      <P>My Department's press statement of 21 October 1997, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, records in some detail the outcome of the special meeting convened to intensify action for road safety.</P>
      <P>In summary, the major initiative taken was to mandate the preparation of a national road safety strategy by the high level group on road safety, which is chaired by my Department, under my direction as Minister of State with responsibility for road safety.  In addition, a grant increase of £50,000 was allocated to the National Safety Council for increased promotional activity in late 1997; the National Roads Authority, in co-operation with local authorities, is to accelerate its programme for remedial measures at high accident locations; and operation lifesaver is to be continued by the Garda Síochána as a high profile enforcement initiative with particular emphasis on the key driving offences which cause deaths.</P>
      <P>Given the arrangements explained above for urgently preparing a national road safety strategy for approval by the Government, it is not proposed to establish a Cabinet sub-committee for this purpose.</P>

      <Col N="622" /> Car testing will be carried out at dedicated test centres under the control of a franchisee to be appointed on a national basis following an open competitive tendering process.  Test centres will be strategically located in a national network to minimise the travel distance for motorists; in addition consideration will be given to the use of mobile test centres in more remote areas.  Final decisions have yet to be made on the number of specific location of test centres.</P>
    <P>My Department will supervise the operation of the car testing system at national level.  Such supervision is likely to include annual reviews of the franchisee's performance, a detailed review midway through the ten year franchise period and comprehensive quality control monitoring of test centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Transport provides for investment of over £1.2 billion in development of the national road network in the period 1994-99.  This overall provision has been enhanced recently following completion of the mid-term review of the community support framework, with an extra £26 million to be invested in the network over the remainder of the programme period.</P>
      <P>Reflecting these expenditure plans, the recently-published abridged Estimates for Public Services provide for investment of over £263 million in 1998 on development of the national road network &mdash; an increase of more than 13 per cent on the 1997 figure and the highest ever such provision. Looking to the future, the national roads needs study, which will be finalised shortly, will provide a comprehensive assessment of the work required to complete the national road network; it will form an important input to negotiations on EU funding for Ireland post-1999 and to policy development in relation to national roads generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards non-national roads, it will be a major priority during my term of office to ensure that sufficient funding is provided to enable the <Col N="623" /> restoration programme to be completed by 2005, within the ten year period originally proposed.</P>
    <P>One of my first actions as Minister for the Environment and Local Government was to secure an additional £5 million from the Government for Class III county roads.  Moreover, the abridged Estimates for 1998 allocated a record amount of £199 million for non-national roads, an increase of over £26 million or 15 per cent on the original 1997 allocation.  I will be announcing grant allocations to individual local authorities as early as possible in 1998.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am satisfied that the investment under way and in prospect provide a basis for achieving a road network in Ireland which meets accepted international standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Alternative technology &mdash; electric, solar fuel cell, etc.  &mdash; automotive engines whose sale and use could be encouraged are not readily available on the automotive market internationally.  Research and development of alternatives to conventional technology is being carried out by the automotive industry worldwide.  Prototypes have been developed and some limited scale testing has been carried out. However, practical and cost effective applications for use in passenger cars are generally not developed sufficiently for successful marketing to be undertaken.</P>
      <P>The thrust of policies to reduce vehicle emissions within the EU since 1970 has been, and continues to be, based on vehicle type approval and emissions standards.  Successively more stringent standards for passenger and goods vehicles have been laid down, and the automotive industry complied with them through enhanced emission controls applied to existing engine technolgy in the absence of adequate alternative technologies. Ireland continues to comply with all EU vehicle emission control directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland also continues to support the developing EU auto oil programme as an appropriate means of addressing many of the environmental issues arising from vehicle emissions.  This programme will introduce further measures to reduce emissions from motor vehicles, including passenger cars, as well as more stringent fuel <Col N="628" /> standards to apply from the year 2000 and later from 2005.  Consideration of technical developments with regard to vehicle technologies as well as new propulsion techniques, for example, electric, fuel cells, and their market potential will be an intrinsic part of this process.</P>

The submissions received are currently being shortlisted by Dublin Corporation and it is expected that those companies to be shortlisted will be shortly invited to submit tenders for the proposed treatment works.

      <P>A comprehensive strategy is in place to address the contribution of nutrients, particularly phosphorus, to eutrophication problems in rivers and lakes.</P>
      <P>In so far as detergents are concerned, changes beneficial to the environment made over recent years include the reduction of the phosphate content from 35 per cent to 20 per cent and the introduction of a new range of phosphate-free concentrated products.  However, from an environmental perspective I am disappointed at the level of market penetration achieved by phosphate-free detergent products.  As a consequence, the potential reduction in phosphate losses from detergents has not been fully realised.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in discussions with the Irish Detergent and Allied Products Association about the matter with a view to the adoption of measures on a voluntary basis to enhance water quality protection.  I am currently awaiting firm proposals from the association in this regard. In the absence of an early and satisfactory outcome to these discussions, I will consider the imposition of statutory controls to achieve further reductions in the phosphorus input to waters from detergents.</P>
      <P>The installation of phosphorus reduction facilities in sewerage schemes, where appropriate, as part of the Department's major programme of investment in water services is, of course, making an important contribution to minimising phosphorus losses to waters, including those associated with the use of detergents.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the percentage of re-engagement of participants on community employment schemes in the north west region is being decreased from 25 per cent to 10 per cent in 1998; her views on whether 50 per cent or 60 per cent should apply in rural areas in view of the fact that it is extremely difficult to find new persons for the schemes and the people who come off the scheme usually have to go back on unemployment benefit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Community employment was restructured in 1996 following a detailed review of the programme and in response to recommendations contained in the report of the task force on long-term unemployment. Under the new structure approximately two-thirds of the available 40,000 places are allocated to the part-time integration option &mdash; open to persons over 21 years of age and over one year unemployed &mdash; while the remaining one-third of places are allocated to the part-time job option, open to persons over 35 years and over three years unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the part-time integration option up to 10 per cent of the participants may be re-engaged for further periods with the agreement of FÁS where they are key participants and no other suitable eligible person is available or where the participant would benefit from an additional period <Col N="634" /> on the programme.  Under the part-time job option participants usually have their contract renewed for up to three years.</P>
    <P>FÁS has operational responsibility for community employment and I believe it seeks to operate it on as fair a basis as possible throughout its regions, having due regard, as best it can, to local circumstances and demands and also to the programme's parameters.  In particular, it has to be understood that retaining people on the programme for longer than they are entitled can only be at the expense of other unemployed people who are waiting for a place.  In the circumstances I do not propose to alter the parameters of the programme at this time or to intervene in FÁS's operation of the programme.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 lays down minimum age limits for employment, sets rest intervals and maximum working hours and generally prohibits the employment of persons under 18 after 10 p.m. The Act prohibits the employment of persons who are under 16 years of age.  However, employers may employ 14 and 15 year olds on light work during the school holidays or as part of an approved work experience or educational programme.  Those over 15 may be employed part-time during the school term for up to eight hours a week.  A person found guilty of an offence under the young persons legislation is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £1,500.  Continuing contraventions can attract a fine of up to £250 per day.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, while there is no general statutory minimum wage in this country the Programme for Government contains, as a key priority in promoting an inclusive society, the introduction of a national minimum hourly wage.  To give effect to that commitment, I have established a national minimum wage commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing system of statutory minimum wages in Ireland operates on (1) an industry basis, through joint labour committees (JLCs) and (2) in respect of any class, type or group of workers through registered employment agreements (REAs) which are collective agreements registered with the Labour Court.  There are currently 15 industries covered under the JLC system and they employ approximately 161,850. There are five registered employment agreements <Col N="635" /> which cover approximately 80,000 workers.</P>
    <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department carries out routine inspections in premises covered by the EROs and REAs and also, among other issues, investigates complaints which are received under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996.  The inspectors are empowered to institute proceedings on behalf of employees against employers for non-compliance with the terms of EROs or REAs and are also involved in the enforcement of the 1996 Act.</P>

      <Quest>if the mid term review of the human resources programme under EU Structural and Cohesion Funds has been completed; if so, when it will be published; if he will indicate the areas to which extra moneys will be diverted in this regard; and the area from which these moneys will be taken.</Quest>

      <P>The review process on this operational programme is effectively complete.  Proposals resulting from it are at present with the European Commission for a necessary formal decision.  I expect this decision at around year's end.  This will formally finalise the operational programme mid-term review process.</P>
      <P>The changes decided to the programme by the Community Support Framework Monitoring Committee in its overall review, and by the Human Resources Development Monitoring Committee, reflect the relevant recommendations contained in the ESRI's mid-term evaluation of the community support framework which was published by the institute in July 1997.  That evaluation was also informed by a dedicated consultancy study of the human resources development operational programme which was undertaken by Goodbody Economic Consultants. No arrangements have been made at this time for the publication of this study.</P>
      <P>The changes involve a net increase of 32.8 million ECUs in EU support &mdash; 28.6 million ECUs from the European Social Fund and 4.2 million ECUs from the European regional development fund.  A total of 18.2 million ECUs of the extra funding will come from inflator moneys approved for the programme in respect of 1996 and 1997.  The balance of the extra money was reallocated from other operational programmes.  Existing resources totalling 17 million ECUs in EU aid within the human resources development operational programme were also reallocated to priority areas as part of the mid-term review package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> The main areas which will benefit from increased European support include a package of measures for early school leavers (26 million ECUs extra), training for industry (6 million ECUs), the national employment service (3.5 million ECUs), and capital investment to provide new or replacement equipment in FÁS training centres (4 million ECUs).  Smaller increases were decided for traineeships, language training in primary schools, training of ex-offenders and childcare infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Existing EU support within the programme was reduced for advanced technical skills (4 million ECUs), specific skills training (7 million ECUs), the vocational preparation and training scheme (2.5 million ECUs), capital funding for the Department of Education's vocational training infrastructure (2 million ECUs) and technical assistance (1.5 million ECUs).</P>

      <P>As there is no statutory requirement under the 1995 Act for local authorities to inform me of the number of licences issued by them, it is not possible for me to state the number of licences they have issued since that Act came into force on 1 May 1996.  No licences have been issued under the 1980 Act by my Department since then.  While there is no statutory requirement in the Act requiring them to inform me of their actions, I am aware that many local authorities have introduced by-laws but some remain to do so.  Under the 1995 Act, it is a matter for each local authority, it being a reserved function of elected members, to introduce such by-laws.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he will take to ensure Ireland gives support to international efforts to conserve the rain-forests; his views on the attitude of the public to, and the value of, rainforest hardwood imports into Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the national forestry policy is to increase the planting of temperate hard-woods or broadleaves, which will in the long-term produce timber which can substitute for tropical imports.  The national target level for broadleaf planting, as outlined in the strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector, under which an afforestation programme will continue up to the year 2030, is 20 per cent of all planting.</P>
      <P>The issue of trade in tropical timber is a complex one.  Tropical timber is the developing countries' third most important commodity after petroleum and coffee; it is not the major cause of damage to tropical forests, accounting for only about 20 per cent of timber felled, the balance being for fuelwood.  Trade is also subject to WTO rules and unilateral action by either Ireland or the EU would be inconsistent with them.</P>
      <P>Ireland's imports of tropical timber &mdash; logs, sawn wood, veneers and plywood &mdash; in 1996 came to about 56,000 tonnes, valued at £30 million. These came mainly from Brazil, Ghana and the Ivory Coast.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the destruction of tropical forests is one of today's major environmental issues. Ireland is already involved at international level in efforts in relation to the protection of tropical forests, and on import substitution in the long-term.</P>
      <P>International co-operation has the advantage of its large scale, pooling of resources and expertise, and possibilities for co-operation and consultation with producers.  The European Union plays an active role in the protection of tropical forests through initiatives such as the intergovernmental panel on forests, which reported to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development and its agreed international follow-up, the intergovernmental forum on forests, which was set up at the UN special assembly of the general assembly on sustainable development in June this year. Ireland will continue to play its part in such developments.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the public also plays a part in the protection of tropical timber, as trade is related to consumer demand.  An increasing public awareness of tropical deforestation and the origins of timber such as mahogany and teak could lead to a gradual drop in demand for these products, or at least for those which do not come from sustainably managed sources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The Central Fisheries Board membership, in accordance with the Fisheries Act, 1980, consists of the chairpersons of the seven Regional Fisheries Boards and six other persons appointed by the Minister of the day.  One of the six ministerial appointees is an official of my Department.</P>
      <P>The regional boards which are also constituted in accordance with the Fisheries Act, 1980, consist of elected members from the fisheries sector, including angling and commercial netsmen, in a region and seven ministerial appointees.</P>
      <P>As I advised the House last week, I am comprehensively reviewing the structures, services and organisation of the inland fisheries sector with a view to implementing the necessary degree of change, both legislative and organisational, to deliver on my strategic objectives for the inland fisheries resource.  My objective is to ensure effective and efficient delivery of service and best deployment of human and financial resources.</P>
      <P>On taking up office I requested the Central Fisheries Board to draw up, as a priority, a five year inland fisheries development plan.  I expect to receive its plan shortly.  My decisions on future strategic directions for inland fisheries, including the composition of the boards, will be fully informed by this plan, together with the Comptroller and Auditor General's recent report on the management of inland fisheries, the salmon management task force report and successive consultancy reports into the organisation and management of the inland fisheries service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the Central Fisheries Board commissioned Coopers &amp; Lybrand to carry out a review of operations of the central and regional boards.  The cost of this study and subsequent advice on the study was £64,849.</P>
      <P>A consultancy report was subsequently commissioned in 1995 to examine the entire fisheries service, encompassing sea fisheries, inland fisheries and relevant agencies.  As I have already informed the House, I am in the process of reviewing the structures, services and organisation of the inland fisheries sector with a view to implementing the necessary degree of change, both legislative and organisational, to deliver on my strategic objectives for the inland fisheries resource.</P>
      <P>These reports along with the Comptroller and Auditor General's helpful report on the management of inland fisheries, the salmon management task force report, published in June 1996, and the board's own five year development plan which will be launched shortly, will inform my decisions on future strategic directions for inland fisheries.</P>

      <P>There are ten fish counters currently operational in Irish rivers for quantifying salmon and sea trout stocks.  A significant capital programme of investment in fish counters is under way which will see the progressive installation of at least 14 additional fish counters on key catchment systems within two years, with the bulk of these to be in place by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Fish counters are an essential management tool in the quantifying and monitoring of salmon and sea trout stocks and spawning targets, which in turn informs ongoing management conservation and development strategies.  The present counter installation programme is designed to achieve a significantly enhanced level of regional catchment coverage.  This will be evaluated as the counters become operational with a view to further expansion of the counter network as necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 96 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The Department has provided over £13 million of Exchequer and EU funding this year to the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards to cover current, capital and EU tourism angling development expenditure.  In addition the Boards generate up to £2 million annually in own resources. Within the overall envelope of available funding which covers protection, development and water quality management as well as ongoing administative and operational costs, the boards engage in angling promotional activity including production of information leaflets and guides, attending overseas promotion and organising angling events.</P>
      <P>There is, however, general agreement that the overseas promotion of the tourism angling product needs to be significantly and urgently improved in terms of co-ordination, funding, research and focus.  Sustained promotion of the tourism angling product is essential in order to maximise the returns from the significant spend under way through the tourism angling measure of the tourism operational programme on the development of angling facilities around the country to the best international standards.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise therefore that in order to address the overseas marketing issue as a priority, it has been decided to transfer £300,000 from the tourism angling measure to a tourism marketing fund to promote angling market research and promotion overseas.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and all relevant agencies to ensure the success of this important initiative.</P>

      <P>I have had several discussions with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on our respective and complementary responsibilities in relation to water quality and pollution prevention.  In addition officials of both our Departments are liaising closely to ensure that from a policy and operational perspective, all of the State resources involved in <Col N="643" /> water quality monitoring and pollution prevention are deployed efficiently and effectively.</P>
      <P>I have also established the inland fisheries forum, under the aegis of the Central Fisheries Board which will bring together all the relevant agencies, including local authorities and fisheries boards, to facilitate and ensure improved co-ordination, resource deployment and data exchange on all water quality issues as they impinge on fish life and habitats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I announced in September, I have given the go-ahead to the development of six pilot fisheries catchment projects around the country.  These will bring together local fisheries, tourism, angling, industry and farming interests to plan comprehensive strategies for the catchment area, such as fishing activity, water quality, pollution prevention, protection of fish life, conservation of habitats and angling development.  I have asked the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards to take the lead in facilitating consultations between the various interested local groups, with a view to formulating local catchment <Col N="644" /> plans to cater for the specific needs of each catchment area.</P>
      <P>Central to the salmon management task force report's recommendations on catchment committees was its emphasis on co-operation, and this is fundamental also to my approach.  By involving all the relevant players in each area, I aim to build on the hard-won consensus on future directions for salmon management that constitutes one of the strengths of the task force report.  The immediate practical initiative of the pilot catchment projects will also critically inform and reinforce the development of a national catchment management strategy, in the medium-term.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, his Department is taking to amend the Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Powerboats) Regulations, 1992 in view of the fact that these proved legally unsound and were inoperable; when the appropriate regulatory mechanism will be put in place in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boat) Regulations, 1992 were introduced to enable local authorities, regional fisheries boards, harbour authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works to propose to the Department of the Marine that areas within, or in the seas adjoining, their jurisdiction be designated as unsuitable for the operation of these craft in the interests of the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants.</P>
      <P>The measures are available only for the proportion of pleasure craft and their occupants and do not extend to the protection of swimmers, bathers or the natural environment as these matters have been deemed to be beyond the scope of the statutory powers of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>My Department has been examining all legislative options available to determine the most appropriate and effective means of regulating these craft with a view to providing for the improvement of safety for all water users.</P>
      <P>In this regard consultations have taken place with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, whose Local Government Act, 1994 allows local authorities to make by-laws to deal with any nuisance that should be controlled or suppressed in the interests of the common good of the local community.</P>
      <P>In addition I have recently decided to establish a group to examine the question of regulation of the marine leisure area, including jet skis and fast power boats.  I can assure the Deputy that urgent consideration is being given by this group to dealing with such craft in the overall context of the expanding marine leisure sector.</P>

      <P>The National Bank of Hungary &mdash; the country's No. of Central Bank &mdash; in March 1997 ceased publicly Women quoting exchange rates of currencies, including the Irish pound, in which the volume of transactions was very small.  In the wake of this decision many of the commercial banks have been more reluctant than they were previously to change Irish currency into Hungarian and difficulties have been experienced by some Irish citizens, including at least one Irish patient visiting the Peto Institute in Budapest.  The Institute itself has never accepted payment in Irish currency.</P>
      <P>Following representations by the Embassy in Budapest in April 1997 the National Bank of Hungary has had consultations with the relevant commercial banks, some of which have since resumed dealings in Irish currency.  Any Irish person still encountering difficulties should contact the Embassy.</P>
      <P>The Embassy is continuing to keep the matter under review and if any further action is required it will again make representations to the National Bank of Hungary.</P>

      <P>Information on numbers of passports issued to naturalised Irish citizens is readily available only for the period from 1 September, 1993 when the Passport Office became fully computerised to 31 December, 1994.  The number of such passports issued in the period 1 September to 31 December, 1993 was 99; the number issued in the year 1994 was 439.</P>
      <P>In order to ascertain the number of such passports issued from 1 January, 1998 to 31 August, 1993 and the negligible number of applications from naturalised Irish citizens from 1988 to 1994 which did not result in passports being issued, the</P>
      <P>Passport Office would have to retrieve and check over a million files, some of which are in Embassies abroad.  The Department of Foreign Affairs does not have the resources to carry out such a task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware previous efforts to establish a European nuclear safety inspectorate have not been successful primarily becuase a considerable number of EU member states were opposed to the idea.  Some nuclear member states insist that an independent inspection force to inspect the safety of plants on their territory is an unacceptable undermining of national sovereignty.  Nonetheless it will continue to be Irish policy to favour in inspectorate.</P>
      <P>While the concept of a nuclear inspectorate has not received acceptance in the EU there have been some positive developments elsewhere.  Provision has been made in the International Energy Agency's Nuclear Safety Convention for &ldquo;peer review&rdquo;.  Under this process, each state will be able to review the legislative and regulatory framework that governs the safety of nuclear installations of other contracting parties, which would include all member states of the EU.  It also provides for a review of the operational and safety procedures for nuclear installations and emergency preparedness.</P>
      <P>In line with these enhancements relating to peer review, Ireland during its Presidency made proposals seeking to strengthen the health and safety provisions of the Euratom Treaty, including the establishment of a &ldquo;peer review&rdquo; process covering regulatory and supervision arrangements for nuclear installations in each member state.  However, as amendments of the Euratom Treaty require unanimity, the widely diverging member state views about nuclear power prevented progress on the matter.</P>
      <P>In the light of the Government's Action Programme which supports the establishment of an independent EU Agency for monitoring nuclear installations I will be seeking to establish the best way forward on this issue taking account of progress which has been made under the Nuclear Safety Convention.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann is conducting an internal inquiry into the accident near Roscommon on 8 November 1997.  As soon as that is completed it will be submitted to my railway inspecting officer and I will then consider whether further action is required.</P>
      <P>Day to day operational safety is a matter for Iarnrod Éireann who inspect all of their tracks at least twice a week.  I am assured by Iarnród Éireann that there is no question of a train being allowed to operate in a situation where the safety of the public or railway staff would be compromised.</P>
      <P>Following the incident near Killarney on 18 November 1997 I indicated that, in view of public concern, I intend, as quickly as possible to commission an independent review of Iarnród Éireann's safety standards and procedures. Officials in my Department are now drawing up the terms of reference for that review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 125 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>The matters referred to by the Deputy relate to a commercial transaction entered into by the parties concerned in which it would not be appropriate for my Department to become involved. The role of my Department in this matter was to ensure that the importer of the deer complied with relevant animal health controls.  An Bord Bia is involved in generic promotion of venison on the home market and is working with the industry to develop marketing experience for the export trade.  However it would not be appropriate for my Department or An Bord Bia to become involved in the purchase of deer for the venison market.</P>
      <P>As regards the award of grant aid, the company referred to did not receive FEOGA funding or aid under the producer group scheme.  However, a technical assistance grant of £3,893.18 was provided to the company under Leader 1 in May 1994 to investigate the feasibility of establishing a visitors' centre.  Payments of £4,000 and £8,000 were made to a principal in the company in question in April 1992, for the purchase of stock and fences following an application by that person for aid under the operational programme for agriculture and rural development 1989-93.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for 1997 suckler cow premium on 16 cows and 1997 special beef premium on four male animals both of which require a valid 1997 area aid application.  The forage area declared by the person named was initially recorded incorrectly as he did not complete his 1997 area aid form in full.  The result of this was that his 1997 suckler cow premium grants were stocking density restricted to 11.14 cows.  He was paid £937.29 on 5 November 1997.</P>
      <P>The correct acreage has since been recorded for the person named and he will be paid the balance of his advance within a week.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted a ten month application for three animals and a 22 month application for one animal under the 1997 special beef premium scheme on 28 October 1997.  Payments on the animals involved cannot be made until after expiry of the retention period and subject to the applications being found to be in order.</P>

      <P>Detailed statistical and epidemiological analysis of the cases of BSE which occurred this year is still being carried out by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Statistics in University College Dublin.  However, given the very low incidence of the disease here, it is difficult to make reliable forecasts on likely trends. Nevertheless, the reduction in cases in four year old animals this year compared to 1996 together with the fall-off in cases which now appears to be occurring in the second half of the year compared with the equivalent period for 1996, suggests that there will be a substantial reduction in BSE cases in Ireland next year.  The 1998 estimates have allocated £10 million towards the control and prevention of BSE next year.</P>

      <P>Payments are continuing to issue to farmers under all premium and headage schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of special beef premium is subject to EU regulations concerning the application of stocking density limits.</P>
      <P>An individual's stocking density is calculated by dividing his reckonable livestock units by his forage area.  Reckonable livestock units consist of animals submitted by an applicant for special beef, suckler cow and ewe premium schemes coupled with notional livestock units derived from any milk quota held.  Forage area is declared by way of an area aid application submitted by the individual.  Where no area aid application is submitted, and thus his individual stocking density cannot be calculated, entitlement is limited to 15 livestock units.</P>
      <P>In this instance the person named did not submit an area aid application, though he held a milk quota of 25,728 representing 26.68 livestock units. Thus his milk quota more than exhausted his 15 livestock units of entitlements.  Notwithstanding this, the person named submitted one 22 month and three ten month applications under the 1996 special beef premium scheme.  Under the regulations governing the special beef premium scheme, the animals applied for in such circumstances are specifically deemed to have received the premium applied for and not entitled to be re-submitted for that same instalment at any future time.  Thus the stamping and punching of the cards correctly reflects the premium position.</P>

      <Quest>the amount and percentage of 1997 headage and cow suckler grants paid to farmers in County Westmeath at 31 October 1997 and 25 November 1997; and the way in which these payments compare with the equivalent for 1996.</Quest>

      <P>The information requested in respect of payments to County Westmeath farmers at the dates specified or nearest available dates is outlined in the following tables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the EU regulations governing the suckler cow premium scheme allows for a 60 per cent advance payment of premium to <Col N="673" /> be made commencing on or after 1 November each year.  As a result, the payment position as at 31 October would not include payments in respect of this scheme.  By special concession an 80 per cent advance payment was allowed by the EU last year in respect of the 1996 suckler cow scheme so the amount paid at 28 November 1996 would reflect this increase.</P>
    <P>Almost 10 per cent of 1997 cattle headage-beef cow applications in County Westmeath cannot be <Col N="674" /> processed at local office because they are under query with the farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>Payments are continuing to issue to farmers under all premium and headage schemes. While the requirements of the land parcel identification system which is fully operational in 1997 under EU rules have been a complicating factor in processing the various premium and headage applications this year, it is expected that most remaining payments will be made in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Stamp duty on property has an important role to play in shifting some of the burden of taxation on wage and salary income to property.  There is already a full exemption from stamp duty for transfers of new houses with a floor area below 125 square metres.  Transfers of new houses with a larger floor area attract stamp duty based only on the site value, subject to a minimum site value of one-quarter of the full value of the house plus site.</P>
      <P>The stamp duty yield from the transfer of real property, including second hand houses, for 1996 was £194 million.  If the present level of stamp duty on second hand residential property was reduced or if first-time buyers were exempted there would be a significant ongoing cost to the Exchequer.  It seems likely that any such exemption would benefit sellers most and would become built into the level of house prices.  Apart from reducing Exchequer revenue, with no apparent benefit to the purchaser, such action could therefore further accelerate an already over-heated property market.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to phosphate-free detergents and similar products.</P>
      <P>The position in this regard is governed by European VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates that they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates.  As phosphate-free products as such were not zero rated at that time, it is not now open to the Government to apply such a rate.  Indeed, the introduction of new zero rates has been prohibited for some time.</P>
      <P>As regards a reduced rate, goods and services to which reduced rating may apply are listed in the EU Sixth VAT Directive.  In addition, items not listed, but which were at a reduced rate on 1 January 1991, may, if a member state so decides, be placed at a &ldquo;parking rate&rdquo;, i.e. a rate not less than 12 per cent, for the duration of this transitional regime.  As phosphate-free products are not listed in the directive as a reduced rated category, nor were they at a reduced rate here on 1 January 1991, the standard rate, currently 21 per cent, must be applied.</P>

      <Quest>the current position regarding the Ireland-US Double Taxation Treaty signed in July 1997; and the effects of this treaty on US social security pensions payable to Irish residents.</Quest>

      <P>The Ireland-US Double Taxation Treaty, which was signed on 28 July, 1997, comes into effect in the year after it has been ratified by both countries. It has since been ratified by the US and I have laid a Draft Government Order before the Dáil moving a resolution for approval of this treaty.  It has been agreed that this issue will come before the Dáil on 25 November, 1997.</P>
      <P>The absence from our current double taxation treaty with the US of a specific provision in regard to pensions has been a problem in recent years since the US introduced a withholding tax on social security pensions.  This resulted in persons resident in Ireland and in receipt of such a pension being subjected to US withholding tax while also being liable to tax in Ireland on the basis of their residence. In the context of renegotiating the treaty over the last number of years, the Revenue Commissioners have made every effort to have a provision dealing with the matter included, as in this way, double taxation could be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new treaty provides specifically for pensions, including payment made under social security legislation, and provides that, with the exception of governmental service pensions which are dealt with separately they will be taxable only in the State in which the recipient is resident.  This principle, which is bilateral, follows <Col N="678" /> the OECD model convention to which Ireland adheres.  It eliminates double taxation, as it awards the taxing right to either the US or Ireland, depending on which is the State of residence.</P>

      <P>The position is that the VAT treatment of schools is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish law must comply.  Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, schools and universities education is deemed to be exempt for VAT purposes.  This means that such bodies do not charge VAT on the services they supply but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services that they purchase in the course of their activities.  Generally speaking, VAT can only be recovered by registered businesses.</P>
      <P>In addition, it would not be legally possible to apply a zero rate to supplies of school equipment, whether purchased with EU funds or otherwise. Under EU VAT law, member states may retain the zero rates that they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates.  As school equipment was not zero rated at that time, it is not now open to the Government to apply such a rate.  Indeed, the introduction of new zero rates has been prohibited for some time.</P>

I understand that the Royal College of Physicians is making arrangements for the re-establishment of the committee and that it is hoped that it will meet shortly.  As the national immunisation committee is an autonomous committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, its membership is a matter for the college.  I anticipate, however, that as with the previous committee, its membership will include a wide range of experts in the field of immunisation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 234 together. <Col N="681" /> Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  Provision in the annual Estimates is not normally required when the guidelines are being indexed in this manner.  It should be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher for those aged 80 and over.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, he/she may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision it is felt that it is not justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>Nothwithstanding the arrangements referred to above the Government has identified as a key priority in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and my Department is currently making the necessary arrangements to advance the review with the health boards.

      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officer to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  When considering a person's medical card application, health boards exclude carer's allowance in assessing the applicant's income.  The guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income may exceed the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <P>The level of detail requested by the Deputy in respect of those who do not have a medical card is not readily available to the General Medical Services Board.  However, I can inform the Deputy that there are approximately 155,000 people over 65 years of age who are not medical card holders and it is estimated that the cost of extending eligibility to this group would cost in the region of £43 million.  Furthermore, should the percentage of the population covered by medical cards reach 40 per cent, the GMS as currently structured would become subject to automatic review with the medical organisations and may entail significant additional costs which are not quantifiable in advance of negotiations.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board who provides medical cards to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.

    <P>The number of people in the North-Western Health Board area awaiting ENT and hip replacement procedures is as follows: ear, nose and throat procedures, 787; hip replacements, 81.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional cardiac surgery facilities is a matter of national importance and one which will require significant capital and revenue investment over the next few years.  The question of the provision of cardiac care services overall is under review at present.  When this review is complete I will be making an announcement on the location of additional cardiac care services.</P>
    <P>I am committed to taking all possible steps to reduce waiting lists and waiting times for patients. In 1997 the Government allocated a total of £8 million towards the cost of waiting list work and I am confident that this money will have a positive impact on waiting lists by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may find it useful if I refer to the different functions of the Register of Births maintained under the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1963 to 1996 and the Adopted Children Register maintained under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>The function of the Register of Births is to record the particulars set down in law as they pertained on the date of birth.  The particulars to be recorded are determined principally by section 1 of the Registration of Births Act, 1996 and the particulars to be entered in the Birth Register with effect from 1 October, 1997, are set out in the Schedule to that Act.  These particulars include details in relation to the mother of the child and the father, if appropriate.</P>
      <P>Section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952 provides for the setting up of an Adopted Children Register and for it to be maintained by An tArd-Chlaraitheoir (Registrar-General).  When an adoption order is made in respect of a child, the Adoption Board notifies the Registrar-General of the particulars to be registered.  Although they are not birth certificates, certified copies issued by the Registrar-General in respect of entries in this register serve the same legal purpose as certificates of entries in the Register of Births, maintained under the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1963 to 1996.</P>
      <P>In a case, such as that referred to by Deputy Haughey, the mother's name only will appear on the birth certificate.  Both the mother's name and the adoptive father's name will appear on the certified copy of the entry in the Adopted Children Register as the mother has adopted her own child jointly with her husband.  The Deputy will appreciate it would not be possible to amend the birth certificate to include the adoptive father as he is not the natural father of the child and such an action would render the birth certificate factually incorrect.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that both the birth certificate and the certified copy of the entry in the Adopted Children Register can be obtained by the mother from the General Registrar's Office.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will understand that policies regarding the application of PRSI and income tax are matters for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners respectively.</P>
      <P>I understand that home helps are classified as non-PAYE employees and as such are treated as special contributors for PRSI purposes.  As the majority of home helps work part-time, their weekly income places them in a cateogry where the payment of PRSI contributions falls only on their employers i.e. the health boards or voluntary organisations.  I can confirm that, at the request of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, persons employed as home helps have been asked by the South-Eastern Health Board for their RSI number.</P>
      <P>The position as regards the taxation of these payments is that these payments are not subject to the PAYE code but were never exempt from tax.  I understand that no decision has been taken by the Revenue Commissioners to change the current tax treatment of these workers.</P>
      <P>As I have said in this House previously, the home help service does not come within the realm of conventional employment and the income in respect of home help services is a payment which is not intended to compensate fully for the nature of the task undertaken.  As I informed the House, my Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, is considering a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within the health boards for the provision of this service.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that related issues, such as rates of remuneration of home helps, will be considered as part of this process and such consideration would take into account any proposed changes in tax and PRSI treatment.</P>

      <P>The Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, which came into effect in September 1996, provides that a health board shall make available without charge to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the board, have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin-anti-D, or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion and to persons of such other classes (if any) as may be prescribed, the following services: (a) general practitioner medical and surgical services, in relation to all medical conditions, provided by registered medical practitioners (within the meaning of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978) chosen by the persons, (b) drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances, (c) the nursing service specified in section 60 of the Act of 1970, (d) the service specified in section 61 of the Act of 1970, (e) dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and dental, optical and aural appliances, (f) counselling services in respect of hepatitis C, and (g) such other services as may be prescribed.</P>
      <P>Each health board has appointed a liaison officer to ensure the smooth operation of the delivery of services under the Act and to serve as a contact point for individuals and with the various interest groups whose members avail of services under the Act.  I understand that, in this case, the liaison officer concerned has replied directly to the Deputy's representations of 3 November. The person concerned has recently applied for and been issued with a card showing eligibility for services under the Act and the liaison office will be writing to the person concerned giving details of the services available.</P>
      <P>I also understand that the person concerned made a claim on 14 November 1997 from the exgratia scheme administered by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  This claim was approved and a cheque for £244 was issued on 19 November.</P>

      <P>Cardiac surgery waiting lists are maintained at four centres: The Mater Hospital, St. James's <Col N="693" /> Hospital, Cork Unversity Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. Adult cardiac surgery is carried out at the Mater Hospital and Cork University Hospital.  Paediatric cardiac surgery is performed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>Public waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis.  At the end of September 1997, there were 1,586 patients on the cardiac surgery public waiting list as follows: Mater Hospital, 902; St. James's Hospital, 511; Cork University Hospital, 64; Crumlin Hospital, 109.</P>
      <P>The agencies have advised me that information concerning whether patients are medical card holders is not routinely collected by them. Patients are assessed solely on the basis of medical priority.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that I have recently approved a sum of £1.7 million under the 1997 waiting list initiative, specifically for cardiac surgery patients.  As in 1996, the aim is to reduce the existing national cardiac surgery lists; specifically the number of patients waiting over 12 months.  My Department's strategy for achieving this aim involves the purchase of additional cardiac procedures and the selection of suitable patients for medicial cardiac therapies.  I am confident that this will impact positively in the cardiac surgery waiting list.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional cardiac surgery facilities is a matter of national importance and one which will require significant capital and revenue investment over the next few years.  The question of the provision of cardiac care services overall is under review at the moment.  However, I hope to be in a position to bring my proposals to Government in this regard in the very near future.  An announcement will then be made on the location of additional cardiac care services.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses.  The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.  Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, includes a commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland.  My Department is now carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the issues involved in establishing this complex service.  It is my view that the immediate requirement is to examine whether the existing service being offered to Irish patients and their families in the UK can be improved. In this regard officials from my Department have raised this matter in recent discussions with the United Kingdom Transplant Support Service Authority which monitors activity across all UK transplant sites.  The issue is being examined as a matter of urgency by the UKTSSA.</P>
      <P>My officials have also had recent discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Health in London, and arrangements are now being made for appropriate site visits to transplant centres in the UK with a view to contracting work to a selected and proven centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> The overall assessment of the issues involved in setting up a lung and heart/lung facility in Ireland will have particular regard to the experience of other countries, including those with a population size similar to Ireland, which have previously examined the feasibility of establishing a successful lung or heart/lung transplant programme. My Department is drawing upon the expert views of key professionals in this field as part of the assessment.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the establishment of any successful transplant programme is an extremely complex and difficult task.  One of the critical factors in the successful delivery of a quality transplant programme is whether the level of transplant activity in an established programme is sufficient to maintain the level of expertise required to achieve successful outcomes.  It is also essential to have appropriately trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multi-disciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes.  A phased approach needs to be adopted, recognising the need to build expertise and to create a programme that is viable in terms of the outcome for patients, whether it be at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department have had a number of meetings with the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland to discuss the issues involved in setting up a transplant programme.  The association is being kept fully informed of developments in this area and I will meet representatives of the association in the near future to discuss the matter further.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental and orthodontic treatment services to eligible children in the Westmeath area and the maintenance of the waiting list is the statutory responsibility of the Midland Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Midland Health Board that there are no children at present on the waiting list for routine dental treatment in County Westmeath.  All schools are visited within an 18 month cycle and pupils from first class to sixth class are screened and provided with treatment as necessary.  Any child in pain will be seen almost immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected/handicapped.  Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment in accordance <Col N="696" /> with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity/handicap.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board has advised me that category A cases (the cases of greatest severity) receive immediate treatment.  There are 183 children on the orthodontic waiting list in County Westmeath.  The maximum waiting time is approximately three years.</P>
    <P>The board's orthodontic services will be further developed in accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan.  I understand that the board will arrange, through the Local Appointments Commission, to have the post of consultant orthodontist readvertised in the new year.</P>

    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I am committed to taking all possible steps to reduce waiting lists and waiting times for patients.  In 1997 the Government allocated £8 million towards the cost of waiting list work and I am confident that this money will have a positive impact on waiting lists by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be notifying health boards and hospitals of revised arrangements for implementing the waiting list initiative in 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 224 together. <Col N="697" /> A design team has been appointed and plans are currently being prepared for a significant expansion of cancer treatment facilities at Cork University Hospital.  These plans include the provision of an afterloading suite.  The precise cost of building and equipping this facility is yet to be determined but is expected to be finalised in the near future as the work of the design team develops.</P>
      <P>Patients travel from Cork University Hospital to St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin for remote after-loading brachytherapy.  The number of patients who travel varies but over the past few months the number has not exceeded 4 per month.</P>
      <P>When the expansion of cancer treatment services at Cork University Hospital has been completed this will eliminate the need for patients to travel to Dublin for radiotherapy treatment.</P>

      <P>I have received representations on behalf of the Irish Migraine Association regarding the need for a headache and migraine clinic.  I understand that the association has also been in communication with Beaumont Hospital on the matter.  However, to date I have received no specific proposals from the hospital in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> On receipt of such proposals, they will fall to be considered within the context of the hospital's own priorities and the many competing demands for resources within the acute health sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 22 September 1997 I met a delegation from the Independent Living Fund Committee of the Centre for Independent Living.  We had a wide ranging general discussion on the question of independent living for people with disabilities with particular reference to the personal assistance service.</P>
      <P>In relation to the development of the personal assistance service, I informed the delegation that my intention was that, as a transitionary measure, the health boards would supplement the service being provided by the Centre for Independent Living through the use of the FÁS Community Employment Scheme, with the medium term objective being the putting in place of a properly structured personal assistance service which would increase, on a gradual basis in accordance with the availability of the necessary funding, the number of people with disabilities receiving a personal assistance service.</P>
      <P>The basic thrust of my Department's policy for the development of services for people with disabilities is the provision of a comprehensive range of services enabling people with disabilities to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual.  Such services include respite care, day care, therapy services and home supports including personal assistants.  The Irish Wheelchair Association, which also provides independent living and personal assistance services, supports this policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 744 children in the Southern Health Board region awaiting assessment for speech and <Col N="709" /> language therapy, with a waiting time, depending on community care area, ranging from 3 to 6 months.  The number diagnosed and awaiting therapy is 1,742, with a waiting time ranging from 18 months to two years.</P>
    <P>Health boards regard the development of the speech and language therapy service as a priority and 31 additional therapists have been recruited in the past four years.  Notwithstanding these improvements, it is clear that the service requires further development and it will continue to be regarded as s priority.</P>

      <P>I might mention that the Government with the agreement of my colleague, Mr. Dermot Ahern, Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, recently made £4.325 million savings in that Department available for the purchase of aids and appliances for people with disabilities. This will have a knock-on effect on the supply of prostheses.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the widespread anger and concern expressed by the parents of children attending two schools and a day care centre (details supplied) in County Tipperary at the lack of proper funding in the 1998 Estimates to continue and improve speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, sensory integrationalist, occupational therapy, psychological and psychiatric services, for 1998; if his attention has been drawn to the vital importance of these services to the families concerned, the excellent quality of service already being provided on a restricted budget and the urgent need to have adequate funding available in a period of economic boom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of services, including those referred to by the Deputy, to persons with a mental handicap in the South Tipperary region is the responsibiity of the South Eastern Health Board.  I understand that the board has discussed, with voluntary groups and service providers concerned with the services referred to by the Deputy, the question of the <Col N="710" /> provision of an enhanced level of multi disciplinary professional support for children with a mental handicap.  In recognition of the importance of these services in maximising the children's full potential, the board has assured me that the enhancement of these services generally in the area has been identified as a priority by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee. This will be considered in the context of any additional funding which may be made available for services to persons with a mental handicap in 1998.</P>
      <P>I also understand that my colleague, the Minister for Education, has established a planning group to produce proposals for a national educational psychology service which is expected to submit its report early next year.  The establishment of this service will also assist the level of support available to children with special needs.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to the ongoing development of services to persons with mental handicap is clearly outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <P>The objective of the ten-year special restoration programme is to restore the network of regional and local roads in county areas, estimated at nearly 87,000 kms, to an acceptable standard by the year 2005.  In 1996, 6,600 or 7.6 per cent of this network was improved or maintained using restoration programme grants from my Department.  In 1997, it is expected that a further 7,600 kms or 8.8 per cent of the network will have benefited from this programme.</P>
      <P>While I expect further significant progress to be made in 1998, on foot of the record total of £199 million provided for all non-national roads in the Abridged Estimates, the physical progress anticipated for 1998 cannot be exactly quantified until the detailed mix of works to be assisted under the restoration programme has been determined. Grant allocations to individual local authorities will be announced as early as possible in 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 271 together.</P>
      <P>Local authority income is obtained from a number of sources including Government grants, commercial rates, motor taxation and fees and charges for goods and services.  It is a matter for each local authority, in the context of the preparation of its annual estimates, to determine its own spending priorities within the constraints of its available income.</P>
      <P>Funding is not made available by my Department for the preparation of air quality management plans by local authorities.  However, as an exceptional measure, my Department contributed £20,000 in 1996 towards an air quality management plan for the greater Dublin area.  This is estimated to cost in the region of £120,000 overall. The balance is being provided by the four Dublin local authorities directly concerned and in that context I consider my Department's contribution to be adequate.</P>
      <P>All mandatory national and EU ambient air quality standards were complied with in Dublin in 1996 and overall air quality is good.  However, in view of new EU proposals to revise certain of these standards and to introduce standards for additional pollutants, and of increasing traffic pressures, the preparation of the air quality management plan for Dublin is timely.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department has assessed whether the lead pipes which are used in many parts of Dublin city to deliver water to households represent a health hazard in view of the growing evidence of hazards from lead; the action or financial support, if any, he has to encourage people to replace lead pipes with a more suitable material; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>At the Environment Council on 16 October 1997, Ministers reached political agreement on the proposed revision of the Drinking Water Directive (80/778/EEC).  In so far as the lead standard is concerned, the proposal provides for a reduction from the current value of 50 ug/l to 10 ug/l to be achieved within a 15 year timeframe.  An interim value of 25 ug/l will apply after five years.  This can generally be achieved by the use of appropriate water treatment techniques by sanitary authorities, where warranted.</P>
      <P>Preliminary assessment of the implications of the new lead standard suggest that, where lead services are in place in Dublin, a high level of compliance is currently being achieved with the more stringent value of 10 ug/l.  Further assessment of the situation in relation to lead, including possible cost implications, must await definition of an appropriate sampling regime for lead.  The results of a EU Commission study on this matter are due to be published shortly.</P>

      <P>Integrated pollution control (IPC) licensing has been commenced for all new activities, including intensive agricultural activities, covered under the First Schedule to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 and is being progressively <Col N="725" /> phased-in for established activities.  In the case of intensive pig rearing, commencement dates have already been set for established activities above 10,000 and 7,000 units from 10 March 1998 and 9 June 1998 respectively.  An orderly phase-in is appropriate to meet the comprehensive requirements of the IPC licensing system fully, having regard to the volume of activity in the sector and the build up of Agency experience and organisation. Phase-in of licensing for established intensive pig rearing activities will be completed as rapidly as possible.</P>
      <P>Administration of the IPC licensing system, including the provision of statistics generally and on individual categories of licensable activity, is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>The total Estimates provision for the Environmental Protection Agency in the current year and 1998 is £5.840 million and £6.859 million respectively. This substantial increase for 1998 reflects the Government's commitment to the ongoing build up of the Agency and its functions.  In addition to its Exchequer grant, the Agency has substantial own-resources income, primarily from integrated pollution control licensing and from services provided to local authorities.  Overall, I am satisfied that the Environmental Protection Agency has appropriate resources to effectively carry out its duties.</P>

      <P>To date, the following Regulations have been made under the Waste Management Act, 1996: the Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations, 1997; the Waste Management (Planning) Regulations, 1997; the Waste Management (Register) Regulations, 1997; the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, and the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations, 1997.</P>
      <P>It is primarily a matter for local authorities, in the context of the adoption of waste management plans, under section 22 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, to determine the measures to be taken to encourage and support the recovery of waste. For this purpose, local authorities are required, under the Waste Management (Planning) Regulations 1997, to have regard to the segregation and separate collection of recoverable wastes, which would include the organic fraction of municipal waste, and to have regard to home composting of organic household waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a stated objective of national recycling policy to divert some 100,000 tonnes of organic waste away from landfill by means of composting by 1999.  Local authorities are already engaged in <Col N="727" /> activities to promote and support composting. Financial assistance has been allocated to some local authorities under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99, for the provision of composting facilities and in one instance, towards the development of a pilot project to collect organic waste from households for composting.</P>
    <P>The National Waste Database Report published by the Environmental Protection Agency indicates that, in 1995 some 32 per cent of household and commercial waste was compostable, including some 40 per cent in urban areas and 29 per cent in rural areas.</P>

      <P>Information available from fire authorities in respect of fires attended by fire brigades indicates that chimney fires are the most common cause of domestic fires.  Other significant causes indicated concern the use of electrical appliances for cooking and heating, electrical wiring, and mishaps in regard to children playing with matches, fires and cigarrette lighters.  This information indicates also that the incidence of fires in domestic buildings is decreasing.  While there was an annual average of 17,130 such fires in the 1980s, this had dropped to an average of 14,523 so far in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>The causes of house fires indicates that better awareness of the dangers of fire and of fire hazards, together with simple common sense fire prevention practices on the part of householders, can do much to prevent such fires and alleviate the consequent tragic fatalities and injuries.  Accordingly, the National Safety Council actively encourages fire safety in the home as part of its ongoing fire safety education and publicity campaigns such as the recent National Fire Safety Week.  I understand that the focus of its pre-Christmas media campaign will be on the main fire dangers at Christmas; this campaign is to run from 11 to 24 December.</P>
      <P>Particular stress has been placed in media campaigns on the routine tasks to be carried out nightly to guard against fire and on the value of smoke alarms which, if properly installed and maintained, can provide early warning of fire.  In addition, local authorities have been asked by my Department to consider the provision of smoke alarms in all their rented dwellings.</P>

      <P>: There is no record of the receipt of an application for a thatching grant from the person named at the address given.  There is, however, an application from a person with a slightly different name of the same address; in that case, a further inspection is now being arranged to establish if the house is eligible under the scheme.</P>

Evidence of this commitment is contained in the recently published 1998 Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version) and Summary Public Capital Programme which include a record provision of over £184 million for water and sewerage services in 1998.  This represents an increase of £34 million, or over 22 per cent, on the 1997 provision and will facilitate a considerable increase in the level of activity under the investment programme in 1998, including continued progress in the construction of major water and sewerage schemes, the expansion of the rural water programme, the provision of water and sewerage services to open up land for residential and other development, the carrying out of works under the water conservation and other sub-programmes, and continued investment in technical initiatives to improve the cost-effectiveness of works carried out under the investment programme.</P>

      <P>Social housing needs are met through the provision of local authority housing supplemented by a range of other social housing measures.  It is for housing authorities to develop the full potential of the various measures open to them to respond to housing needs in their areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the local authority housing programme for the coming year the provision in my Department's Estimates will allow for 3,900 new houses to be started or purchased in 1998.  I announced recently significant improvements in the range of social housing measures in order to ensure their continued and expanded use.  It is estimated that the housing needs of some 10,000 households will be catered for in 1998 when account is taken of the accommodation provided by the various social housing measures in addition to the local authority housing programme.</P>

      <P>Local authorities operate the scheme to provide low cost housing sites which is designed to assist people in need of housing to obtain sites from their local authority at low cost and to provide for their housing need, either individually, with the help, if necessary, of the other social housing measures available, or collectively through voluntary housing schemes, special group shared ownership housing projects or housing co-operatives.</P>
      <P>The local authority may determine the appropriate sale price of sites in the light of the circumstances of the applicant.  A price as low as £100 per site may be charged.  Where sites require specialist development works, a local authority may make a financial contribution towards the costs of such works.</P>

    <P>Improvements which I recently announced in the income eligibility criteria of the various social housing measures should facilitate low income potential house purchasers to avail of the measures, including the low cost sites scheme.

      <P>The introduction of Class A PRSI for community employment &mdash; CE &mdash; workers commencing such employment on or after 6 April 1996, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996.  Provision was also made for existing CE workers, that is those who had commenced their scheme prior to 6 April 1996, to be given the option of paying class A PRSI, if they wished, or of continuing with their existing class J PRSI.</P>
      <P>I understand that the person concerned was awarded three one year CE contracts by FÁS commencing in August 1994 and finishing in August 1997.  Since he was on the second of those contracts when class A was introduced, he was given the option of continuing on class J and chose to do so.  However, when he commenced the third year of CE on 5 August 1996, my Department was obliged to take account of the notification by FÁS that this represented a new contract.  Accordingly the appropriate rate of PRSI payable with effect from the commencement of this contract was class A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the effects of the introduction of class A PRSI for CE workers is that those workers who revert to the live register may qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit as a result of having paid at least 13 class A PRSI contributions. In such cases, the earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether he receives a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.  The social welfare secondary benefits, comprising the <Col N="745" /> Christmas bonus, free fuel allowance and butter vouchers, are payable only with long-term social welfare payments.  Unemployment benefit claimants do not therefore have an entitlement to these benefits.</P>
    <P>Since the individual circumstances of CE workers will vary from case to case, it is not possible to say how many people will come into the same category as the person concerned.</P>

      <P>The group were referred to the then Department of Health and the health boards on 14 May 1997 on the grounds that provision of services for the elderly was the responsibility of that Department.

      <P>The other free schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare systems operating here and in the UK are not identical and direct comparison are thus difficult to make.  For illustrative purposes, the child dependant allowances (CDAs) paid with a range of social welfare payments in the UK and the analgous payments here are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>It will be seen that, in relation to insurance based payments, the level of CDAs payable is higher in Ireland in all cases.  In relation to means-tested payments, however, the rates in the UK vary with the age of the child and are generally higher than CDAs paid with social assistance in Ireland.  It should also be noted, however, that personal rates of payment tend to be higher in Ireland than in the UK, so that the higher rates of CDAs would not always lead to a higher total payment to a specific family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards reasons for the differences, the two systems have evolved independently and the Irish <Col N="747" /> social welfare system has been designed to meet the specific contingencies arising here.  For instance, the Deputy will be aware that the loss of child dependant allowance by social welfare recipients on taking up employment has been recognised for some time as creating a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. Policy direction in relation to child income support in recent years has, therefore, focused on targeting resources towards the provision of substantial increases in child benefit, instead of providing annual increases in child dependant <Col N="748" /> allowances.  This approach, which centres on making child income support more neutral <i>vis-àvis</i> the employment status of the parent, has the effect of reducing work disincentives.</P>
    <P>Child benefit remains one of the most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes and because it is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies given to Question No. 87 of 29 April 1997 and Question No. 35 of 8 May 1997.  Works yet to be completed include repairs to the fire-place and the musicians gallery, electrical works, landscaping and the provision of windows, doors and furniture.  It is also intended to convert the former cottage to a visitor reception and guides facility.  It is expected that the works to the castle itself will be completed by early 1999.  The amount expended in 1997 is £116,802, to date.</P>
      <P>When completed, the castle will be open to the public during the tourist season with guided tours of the site.  The site will be marketed along with other sites in the region.</P>

      <P>A number of submissions was made to my Department relating to this site, ranging from single letters to quite large documents with many pages, and it would be impractical to furnish copies to the Deputy in this context.

      <P>Changes to the special areas of conservation &mdash; SAC &mdash; designation proposals which were advertised earlier this year are only countenanced where the National Parks and Wildlife Service &mdash; NPWS &mdash; considers this to be justified on scientific grounds.  In some cases, NPWS has indicated to affected persons that boundary changes appear to be justified, but these have not yet been collated into a single list. Consequently, the list requested by the Deputy is not available at this time.  However, before any formal change is made to the proposed site boundaries already published, new maps, showing the extent of the revised proposals, will be publicly advertised and notified to individuals thought to be affected.</P>
      <P>The published boundaries of special protection areas have not been changed to date.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that NPWS is involved with many hundreds of sites and species all over the country and it would not be practicable to compile such a list.  If the Deputy would like to indicate a specific area of interest, however, I will seek to provide any relevant information as can reasonably be collated.</P>

      <P>It would appear that the Deputy is referring to the operation of the rural community policing scheme in Newcastle West, County Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Garda Commissioner that, as part of the evaluation and review of the rural community policing scheme, he intends to introduce trial modifications to the scheme, under a pilot test arrangement, in two of the existing 14 Garda districts in which the scheme currently operates.  The Garda districts selected by the <Col N="756" /> Commissioner for this purpose are Nenagh and Newcastle West.</P>
    <P>The trial changes proposed relate to the creation of community policing teams to provide for improvements in continuity of service to the community and more flexibility in relation to opening hours of stations involving an evaluation of local policing needs and consultation with local communities.  The changes being introduced are to facilitate further study of the community policing initiative in the context of the general review of the entire scheme.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that with the exception of one investigation relating to a seizure of videos featuring pornographic material, there is no evidence available to the Garda which indicates that a paedophile ring exists or has existed in the State.

      <P>The Deputy will already be aware that the advisory committee established by the Garda Commissioner was set up to examine the future of closed circuit television-systems as an aid to policing.  While their main objective was to evaluate the potential crime prevention capacity of each of the applications received, they were also required to evaluate each application <Col N="761" /> from a technical and telecommunications perspective while also taking into consideration the level of finance available from my Department and from local business-community sources.</P>
      <P>I understand that a total of 25 applications were received for the installation of Garda closed circuit television-systems.  This includes full and comprehensive proposals which were submitted in respect of eight locations, including Bray.  I can appreciate the disappointment expressed by local interests that Bray was not listed among the four priority locations for the installation of closed circuit television-systems.  However, I must point out that all of the remaining applications on hands are still under consideration by the advisory committee and will be scheduled as resources become available.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it must be understood that closed circuit television-systems are not in any way a replacement for Garda personnel but are an aid to existing resources.  The extension of these systems to other areas must be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and must be carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.

      <P>I assure the Deputy that safety is of <Col N="767" /> paramount importance to both my Department and Bus Éireann, who act as agents for my Department in the operation of the school transport scheme.  In this regard a wide range of checking procedures is in place to ensure a safe and reliable service.  All aspects of safety, including carrying capacity, are monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Under the Department of the Environment road traffic regulations, the licensed carrying capacity of school transport vehicles is three pupils to every two seats.  Bus Éireann complies fully with this and all other safety legislation.  The aisles on school buses should, of course, be kept clear for safety reasons.  All bags should be stowed away under seats, on the bag racks provided, or, if necessary, in the boot.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann undertakes promotions at regular intervals so as to alert teachers, parents and children to safety aspects of the service.  Its inspectors also speak to groups of pupils on the subject of safety, as part of their normal duties.</P>

As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate to reveal details of the estimated cost of the project in advance of tendering.</P>

    <P>The Government's commitment in this area of education is evident in the Government Action Programme for the Millennium undertaking to provide equitable support of students attending PLC courses; the significant role played by PLC courses in the Government's response to meeting the skill needs of the Irish economy, particularly the recent initiative in international teleservices, <Col N="773" /> which is accompanied by substantial capital investment and a new student support scheme for the cost of overseas placement; the increase of a minimum of 1,000 additional places on Youthreach and in senior traveller training centre places which is being provided in 1998, allied with a new measure to provide counselling, guidance and psychological services for participants on these programmes; the decision to have a Green Paper on Adult Education which will make recommendations on future developments in the context of expanding access to lifelong learning; and the ongoing investment in the work of the National Council for Vocational Awards and TEASTAS in providing national certification and assessment for this important sector, streamlining and regulating standards in line with industry needs.</P>

The report indicates that the windows are in an unsatisfactory condition and require replacement.  The capital funding available this year for works of this nature was allocated in full by my predecessor and it is not possible to take on additional commitments.  The project will be considered in the context of the 1998 Estimates.  I would not be happy to publicise estimated costs in advance of a possible tender process.</P>

      <P>The question of providing satisfactory alternative accommodation for gaelscoil Sheáin Uí Éigeartaigh, in Cobh, is being pursued by my Department as a matter of urgency.  Generally, there are two options for the provision of such accommodation.  One option would be to secure existing school accommodation which has become surplus to requirements due to falling enrolments.  The other option would be to provide a new school building on a new site.  These options are currently being considered.  There is no requirement for a mediator.  I have met with parents and a support committee.  I am also prepared to meet with the board of management of the school and have undertaken to consult with all interested parties concerning the matter.</P>

      <P>The lead responsibility for the provision of psychological services to children in national schools is held by the relevant health board directors of community care.</P>
      <P>The psychological service provided by my Department is currently available to a limited number of national schools, with priority given to schools serving disadvantaged areas in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Members of my Department's psychological service who are deployed in primary schools carry out assessments as the resources of time and personnel allow.  Each school is contacted regularly and a time allocation for the current school term is agreed.  Psychologists try to ensure that each school receives some service each term but, depending on current needs, some schools will have more time allocated than others in any particular year.  In consultation with the psychologist, each school principal prioritises those pupils who are to be seen individually.  Referrals deemed to be urgent are dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the future provision of psychological services for children, I announced in July 1997 that I intend to develop a national psychological service which will be available to all primary and secondary schools as well as to pre-school children.  The development stage in this <Col N="777" /> process is now beginning.  I have set up a planning group, representatives of the partners in education, which will report to me early in 1998.</P>
    <P>The report of the planning group, which will inform my long-term plans for the provision of psychological services to schools, will include consideration of issues such as liaison with the health authorities in relation to procedures for referral and reporting and waiting times for appointments.</P>

      <P>My Department has had discussions with the Higher Education Authority, Bord na Gaeilge and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in relation to furthering the study and use of Irish in higher education institutions. The discussions centred on three broad strands, the teaching of Irish, teaching through the medium of Irish and the promotion of the wider use of the Irish language and related activities within the institutions among the staff and students.  This approach is aimed at generating improvement in all aspects of the teaching and learning of Irish.  In relation to the development of spoken Irish special mention has been made of harnessing new information technologies and the desirability that each institution should have active links with Gaeltacht areas.  The question of providing additional resources for the development of spoken Irish in the universities is a matter in the first instance for the Higher Education Authority in the light of the 1998 allocation to the authority.</P>

This condition may be waived by the local authorities in exceptional circumstances such as cases of certified serious illness.

      <P>The architectural planning of the extension project at the school in question is at an early stage of the architectural planning process.  The new building comprises general classrooms, specialist rooms and ancillary accommodation.  At this stage of design a cost plan has not yet been prepared.  In any event it is my policy not to divulge the estimated cost of projects prior to the tendering process as to do so may compromise the tendering procedure.  The question of proceeding to construction will not arise until the architectural design process has been successfully completed.</P>

      <P>My Department is at present actively considering the development of a points-based system which would be designed, taking all relevant factors into consideration, to rank school building projects in order of priority for capital funding.  The system would apply to both primary and post-primary capital projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> I have already discussed the matter with some teacher and parent organisations and their response has been positive.  However, before any such system is put in place, there will be full and continued consultation with all the education partners.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy lives 0.7 miles from the pick-up point of the school transport service.  As a rule primary school transport routes are planned so that no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point.  Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.  Home collections were never intended to be a feature of the school transport scheme.  Accordingly, in the context of the general operation of the scheme, I regret that the present arrangement is the most that can be offered.</P>

      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is a one teacher school with a current enrolment <Col N="784" /> of 17 pupils.  In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the current school year with the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.  I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to one teacher schools.</P>

      <P>The manner in which standard basic resources are provided to second level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for voluntary secondary schools, vocational education committee schools and community and comprehensive schools.  Consequently, direct comparison between the funding arrangements of the three sectors is difficult.</P>
      <P>The financial allocations for vocational education committee schools are included as part of a block grant which also covers the vocational education committee overheads and other activities apart from the second level programme.  Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis while the annual budget for community and comprehensive schools takes into account factors which vary from school to school such as age of buildings, size of school, location and levels of vandalism.</P>
      <P>The matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second level is currently being examined by a steering group on funding, which is representative of all the partners in education. Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools.</P>

      <P>The details requested by the Deputy concerning one teacher schools in County Mayo are as follows.  The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, there are 103 one teacher primary schools throughout the country which have ten or more pupils.  A further 24 primary schools were due to become one teacher schools from September 1997.  However, following my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I made special arrangements to ensure that these <Col N="793" /> schools would retain their two teacher status for the 1997-98 school year.  I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to all one teacher schools with ten or more pupils.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The abridged Estimates which have been published recently do not generally represent the total planned provision for public expenditure.  It is normal practice for the Government to review and adjust the expenditure provisions in the context of finalising the budget and in the light of more up-to-date outturn figures.  Moreover, the Estimates provisions are only the first stage in the process of determining specific allocations, improvements and initiatives across all sectors of education.  This process will extend over the next <Col N="796" /> number of months and I will convey the necessary details as decisions are taken.</P>

      <Quest>the cost of the higher education grant in 1997 and in 1998 had it not been decided to bring forward a sum of £68 million into 1997; the reason this has been done; and the effect, if any, on future years in this regard.</Quest>

      <P>I will be seeking a sum of approximately £70 million by way of a Supplementary Estimate for 1997 to enable me to bring the recoupment of payments made by the local authorities under the higher education grants scheme to a current year basis.</P>
      <P>I am proposing to take this approach to bring practice into line with the provisions under the Local Authority (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968-92, and to alleviate cash flow shortages which the authorities currently experience as a result of the present arrangements for recoupment in the year following that in which the payments are incurred.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Supplementary Estimate, I am also proposing to put local authorities in funds to enable them to issue maintenance grant payments to students before the end of this year in respect of the second term.  This action is in response to difficulties being encountered by students at the beginning of each term and is intended to facilitate the alleviation of such problems.</P>
      <P>The steps I am taking to bring recoupment to local authorities onto a current year basis will ensure that the Exchequer is not carrying a significant liability to the authorities at the end of each financial year.</P>

      <P>The scheme of early retirement, under which teachers may apply to retire before reaching the usual retirement thresholds, was negotiated with the teachers' unions and school management representatives under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i><Col N="797" /> The scheme is a voluntary one and provides for the early retirement of up to 400 teachers per year.  The scheme was notified to schools generally in June 1997 and applications were invited. The number of applications received, 185, was much below the annual quota provided for.</P>
      <P>In view of this, and at the request of the teacher unions, my Department invited further applications for early retirement in October 1997. Sixty-three further applications have been received and these are being processed.</P>
      <P>Early retirement under the scheme agreed is available to three categories of teachers.  These are: those in posts which are surplus to requirements; those with not less than 15 years service who are consistently experiencing professional difficulties in their teaching duties; and those who have reached the age of 55, have at least 20 years service and whose school management verifies that their retirement would provide an opportunity to enhance the education service provided by the school.</P>
      <P>It has been agreed that the scheme will operate on a pilot basis pending review in the light of the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>

      <P>The project at the school to which the Deputy refers was executed without prior departmental approval.  In July this year, my Department sought information from the school in respect of tax clearance on the contract for the work.  To date, this information has not been provided.</P>

      <Quest>if an official of his Department (details supplied) received correspondence from a representative (details supplied) of parents of children suffering from severe and profound mental handicap which she posted on 8 October 1997; if his Department will acknowledge receipt of the correspondence and reply to the correspondence in this regard; the necessary steps, if any, he will take to ensure that all correspondence in future is responded to in accordance with the Ombudsman's Guide to Standards of Best Practice for Public Servants, that is, promptly and with undue delay.</Quest>

      <P>The correspondence to which the Deputy refers was received in my Department on 13 October 1997.  I understand that the matters raised in the correspondence had earlier been the subject of a discussion between the parents' representative and the official concerned.  I further understand that arising from that discussion, the official in question wrote to the parents' representative on 9 October 1997 addressing the issues raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the prompt follow-up on this matter by the official concerned, the letters crossed in the post, and since the points raised by the parents' representative in her letter of 8 October 1997 had <Col N="799" /> already been dealt with in writing, it was considered that no further response was required.  I have asked my officials to formally acknowledge receipt of the letter to which the Deputy refers. I would also like to assure the Deputy that my Department makes every effort to respond to correspondence in as prompt a manner as possible.</P>
