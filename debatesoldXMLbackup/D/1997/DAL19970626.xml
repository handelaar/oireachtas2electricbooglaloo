    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cléireach na Dála Cléireach na Dála">
      <NameTxt>Cléireach na Dála</NameTxt>
      <P>Dé réir na mBuan Ordui-the, is é an chéad ghnó eile ná Ceann Comhairle a thoghadh.  Glacfaidh mé anois le tairiscintí.  In accordance with Standing Orders, the next business is the election of a Ceann Comhairle and I shall now receive motions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to propose the name of Deputy Séamus Pattison as candidate for the office of Ceann Comhairle.  Although he is only 61 years of age, Séamus is the longest serving Member of this House and one of its most distinguished. He was first nominated to contest a Dáil election at the age of 23 and fought that contest, a by-election, in 1960.  His father, James, had been a long serving member of the Dáil, representing the people of his constituency for a total of 21 years.</P>
      <P>From the moment of his own election in 1961 until today, Deputy Séamus Pattison has had an unbroken and unrivalled career of public service. He is respected and admired on all sides of the House, and especially so by the people of Carlow-Kilkenny whom he has served faithfully and diligently for the past 36 years.  He has served them as a Member of the Dáil, for three terms as mayor of Kilkenny city and two as chairman of Kilkenny County Council.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Séamus Pattison first walked into this Chamber Seán Lemass was Taoiseach. Many of the founding fathers of this State, men like Dan Breen, Seán McEntee, Seán Mac Eoin, James Dillon and Frank Aiken, were here at that time.  The leader of his own party was Brendan Corish who the previous year had taken over from Bill Norton.  In the intervening years a great deal has changed.  Personalities have come and gone and history has been made many times over. Through it all Deputy Séamus Pattison has been a loyal servant of the people and a proud Member of this democratic assembly.  He has also served in Government as Minister of State in the Department of Social Welfare from 1983-7 and in the European Parliament where he was vicechairman of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment.  In the last Dáil he was a particularly effective chair of the Select Committee on Social Affairs.</P>
      <P>In short, Deputy Séamus Pattison has served an illustrious apprenticeship for the position of Ceann Comhairle.  I have no doubt whatsoever that he will grace that office, if selected by the House today.  Those of us who know him and have worked with him can tell the House that he is one of its most fair-minded Members, a person who will see his first and last duty as being to advance the interests of Members and to protect their rights.  We also know &mdash; I suppose I offer this as a warning to the House &mdash; that beneath Séamus's mild exterior there is a strong and resilient character, a person of absolute integrity and determination.  People have underestimated him before and have done so at their peril.</P>
      <P>Séamus Pattison will add lustre to the list of people who have held the important and prestigious office of Ceann Comhairle and I have no hesitation in commending his appointment to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to second the proposal that Séamus Pattison be nominated as Ceann Comhairle.  I do so in the full knowledge of the long record of service which he and his family have given to the country, their constituency and Dáil Éireann.  To have survived 12 general elections and 36 years in Dáil Éireann is a record in itself.  The common-sense he has garnered over those years and the faith and trust shown by the electorate in him and he in them will stand the Dáil in good stead.  I am pleased to second the proposal that Séamus Pattison be nominated as Ceann Comhairle.</P>

Is mór an onóir domsa é agus geallaim libh go leir go ndéanfaidh mé mo dhícheall chun cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt do gach uile Theachta anseo agus iarraim oraibh cabharú liomsa chun dualgas na hoifige seo a chomhlíonadh mar is cóir.</P>
      <P>Fellow Deputies, Members of the House, I thank you for the great honour you have conferred upon me in electing me Ceann Comhairle today.  I wish most sincerely to convey to all Deputies in the various parties which comprise this great democratic Assembly my profound gratitude for the confidence you have reposed in me.  I assure you all that I will strive earnestly to prove worthy of this great honour now conferred upon me.</P>
      <P>As my proposer said, I have been a Member of the House since 1961 and have long since valued highly the history and traditions of the House.  In keeping with the traditions of my illustrious predecessors I will endeavour to preserve and uphold the dignity and decorum of the House at all times.  As Ceann Comhairle, I see it as my task and duty to administer and apply the rules of this House as laid down by this House with utter impartiality, fairness and equality between parties and Deputies.</P>
      <P>My aim will be to carry out the work of the Chair in such a manner as to give full expression to all Members consistent with our Standing Orders and the due business of the House before us.  I realise it is impossible to carry out the work of the House without the full co-operation of all Members and, because of this, I humbly seek that co-operation.  I trust and feel sure this co-operation will be readily forthcoming at all times from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>In seeking to uphold the best traditions of this House I am mindful of my many illustrious predecessors. It would be remiss of me if I did not mention, in particular, my immediate predecessor, former Deputy Seán Treacy.  As outgoing Ceann Comhairle he will be remembered by all for the invaluable contribution he made in upholding the dignity and the decorum of this House.</P>

As a fellow Kilkenny Member of this House and someone who has served with you at local and national level for the past number of years, you were and remain a good friend of mine and we worked very well together at local and national level in the interest of the constituents of Carlow-Kilkenny. As the Tánaiste in proposing you stated, the Pattison name has been synonymous with the Labour Party and politics in Kilkenny since l932. There is no more fitting tribute I can pay to you than to say that since l932 the people of Carlow-Kilkenny have expressed the wish that the Pattison name be in this Parliament, except for a brief interlude from l957 to l961.  I wish you well, Sir, and you can be assured that I and fellow Deputies from Carlow-Kilkenny send you sincere congratulations on your elevation to this important constitutional office.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann nominate Deputy John Bruton for appointment by the President to be Taoiseach.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I propose the outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, for the office of Taoiseach in this Dáil.  I do so because I have been honoured to serve as Deputy Bruton's Tánaiste for the past two and a half years and I have no doubt whatsoever that he is fitted for the post.  He led a good Government well and his courtesy, competence and efficiency will be part of an enduring legacy.  My party will be voting for Deputy Bruton today because he has already proved himself able for the highest executive office in this land.  I say that without any disrespect for Deputy Bertie Ahern whom I will be among the first to congratulate should he win this contest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton has been an outstanding Taoiseach.  His contribution to policy in relation to Northern Ireland will stand the test of time, and it is a mark of the man that up to yesterday he has worked to sow the seeds of an inclusive peace and a fair settlement.  His work in Europe <Col N="29" /> will be remembered for a long time.  The success of the Irish Presidency in the second half of last year was due in no small measure to his patience and skill and to the respect he has earned on the international stage.  Above all, he welded together a team of strong individuals into a coherent and cohesive unit to provide two and a half years of the most effective Government this country has seen.  The strength of the economy we are handing over, the rebuilding of good and efficient social services, the decent balance that has been struck between the needs of a compassionate society on the one hand and the legitimate demands of taxpayers on the other, the investment in education, training and skill, and the turning of the corner in the battle against crime are all testament to an outstandingly successful Taoiseach.  My nomination of Deputy Bruton as Taoiseach is my last act as a member of the rainbow Government, but not, I can assure the House, my last act.  We now, in all probability, go into Opposition, but we can do so as an independent party, proud of our achievements and determined to rebuild our strength.</P>
    <P>I will reserve the rest of what I have to say until I see the shape of the new Government.  For now I wish to commend the name of Deputy John Bruton to the House.  He has earned the respect of everyone in this House.  I know he will honour the trust reposed in him to the full as he has always done in the past.</P>

      <P>Ar dtus báire comhghairdeachas os ucht an post nua ata agat inniu.  Is onóir mhór é duit fhéin agus dod chlann agus dod páirtí.</P>
      <P>I wish to support the nomination of Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach and, thereby, the work of the rainbow Coalition over the past two and a half years.  When I stood in this House on 15 December 1994 to support his nomination as Taoiseach I referred to our different backgrounds and said that I had come to admire and respect him during our period in Opposition and that I particularly respected the position he had taken on Northern Ireland.  After two and a half years in Government with him my respect for John Bruton has increased.  His public stature has grown.  He is the person who should be Taoiseach. He has the qualities of political courage and vision necessary to lead this country into the next century.</P>
      <P>John Bruton has been an outstanding Taoiseach. In office, he has confounded his strongest critics.  As a serious political thinker he has shown himself to be open to and interested in new ideas. He has never been afraid to change his mind when the facts have changed, and this is an absolutely essential requirement for a genuine statesman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John Bruton has successfully presided over the first multi-party Government since the 1950s.  He always led by example, showing great energy and enthusiasm for the job and displaying particular skills around the Cabinet table.  His capacity for <Col N="30" /> work was enormous.  He had an ability to be on top of virtually every item that came before Government but was always willing to delegate and to trust Ministers to get on with their own work.  The Irish people owe the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, a debt of gratitude for the political leadership he has shown, often in very difficult circumstances, over the past 30 months.</P>
    <P>In the event that John Bruton is not elected and the Fianna Fáil-PD Coalition is elected, it may be that we are facing into a different type of Government and a different set of policies.  The people have cast their vote in the general election and as democrats we accept the outcome without question, but we leave Government with our heads high, satisfied that we have served the people of this country well if not perfectly, pleased with what the rainbow Government has achieved while acknowledging that with more time much more could have been achieved, particularly for the disadvantaged and the marginalised who are not sharing the current prosperity.</P>
    <P>I am proud too of the performance of Democratic Left Ministers and backbenchers.  Notwithstanding the outcome of the election the fact is that the outgoing Government is one of the best Administrations this country has had.  The country is being passed, temporarily, to the care of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in far better condition than when Fianna Fáil last left office.  More than 120,000 new jobs were created; the numbers on the live register were reduced to their lowest level for six years; real progress was made in regard to reform and integration of the tax and social welfare systems; the structural mechanisms for the implementation of a national anti-poverty strategy were put in place; housing was revitalised; mortgage rates and inflation were kept low; the most comprehensive anti-crime package ever was introduced; local communities were given real resources to fight the drugs menace; and responsible and effective leadership was provided in the continuing search for peace and a political solution to the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I give notice to the incoming Administration that Democratic Left will bring to the Opposition the same innovative thinking, commitment, energy and enthusiasm it showed in Government. It can expect vigorous, principled and responsible opposition from Democratic Left.  Based on the Programme for Government published by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats vigorous opposition is what the incoming Government will deserve.  While there are some positive commitments in the programme, especially where it pledges to build on the work done by the outgoing Government, it also contains many vague, unspecific and in some cases dangerous proposals. In general, Fianna Fáil appears to have dictated most of the policy positions, but in the area of taxation Deputy Bertie Ahern appears to have surrendered to Deputy Harney or perhaps to Deputy McCreevy, we do not know yet.</P>

      <P>Slashing the upper tax rate while maintaining tax allowances at existing levels in real terms will do nothing to ease the burden on the majority of the people.  Furthermore, this approach will bring at least 20,000 low paid workers into the tax net for the first time.  This formula was tried by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats during their previous term in Government and resulted in a 17 per cent increase in the average tax paid by PAYE workers during the three years they were in office.  The tax policies of the new Government may represent pay back time for those who control the <i>Irish Independent</i> or dictate its editorial policy, but for most workers it will be a case of &ldquo;pay as you were&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am pleased Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have apparently abandoned their threat to scrap the electoral Act which provides for open disclosure of political donations, but the Progressive Democrats have made a serious error in agreeing to Fianna Fáil's demands for a review of the electoral system.  Fianna Fáil made no secret of its desire to see an end to our existing system of proportional representation and Deputy Harney has given it the opening it was seeking. Our electoral system is one of the fairest and most representative in the world.  Without it smaller parties would find it difficult to secure representation in the Dáil.  By agreeing to this review Deputy Harney appears to acknowledge the doubts about the future of the Progressive Democrats and implicitly accept that its future may lie in a return to the Fianna Fáil family.  I put down a clear marker that Democratic Left will vigorously oppose any attempt to make our electoral system less fair, less proportional or less representative. We will oppose all attempts to do away with the single transferable vote and multiseat constituencies.</P>
      <P>There are many items to which I could refer, but I make a particular appeal to the incoming Government.  Will it build on the progress made by the outgoing rainbow Coalition in providing services for children and adults with a mental handicap?  That serious problem must be dealt with urgently.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that the PD-Fianna Fáil Programme for Government does not contain a commitment to the implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy which was painfully constructed in partnership with the voluntary sector and to which there is a commitment in Partnership 2000 by all the social partners. Failure to commit itself to reaching the targets set in the national anti-poverty strategy with regard to reducing poverty and disadvantage, in tandem with its proposal to penalise low paid workers through the tax package it proposes, brings into <Col N="32" /> grave doubt the capacity of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats coalition to retain the support of Independents for very long.</P>

They expect him to choose his Government on the basis of ability with a clear vision of what will be required of our Government for the next number of years.

      <P>Fifteen years ago Bertie Ahern was Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach.  Fifteen years on we believe he is set to be Taoiseach. There is no doubt that in the challenging years which lie ahead both nationally and internationally, a person of the calibre and character of Bertie Ahern is someone this country can be and will be justly proud of.  He has both vision and stamina but most of all he is understanding. It is that understanding which led the people of this country to put their trust in him.  I know he will pay back that trust in full measure.  I have real pleasure in seconding my colleague, Deputy David Andrews, and I know that in Bertie Ahern the people of this country will have a Taoiseach of whom they will be proud.</P>

      <P>I thank the Tánaiste and the Labour Party for putting forward Deputy Pattison.  In doing that, they have played their part in helping the establishment of stable government.  That should be acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Today is a very special day, particularly for the new Members of the House.  I welcome them and their families.  Many of them have seen their political ambitions realised and perhaps their dreams fulfilled.  They are coming into the 28th Dáil at a very exciting time because this Dáil will take our country into the next century.  The honour to serve is a great one and should never be taken lightly.  It is also a huge responsibility on all our parts to ensure that whether we are in Government or in Opposition we do what is required to sustain our democracy.</P>
      <P>I remember saying here on 15 May when I set out on the election campaign that politics would be on trial.  By the time the election was over I think I was on trial.  I intend to prove over the next few years that nurses, teachers and gardaí have nothing to fear.  I want to see a dynamic public service serving our country.</P>

I pay tribute to the Government who all worked extremely hard, particularly the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare.  I admire the fact that right up to the end the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste sought to have peace restored in Northern Ireland.  I would like to congratulate them and the British Government on the initiatives which have been agreed between our two countries.  At last it forces the republican movement to make a stark choice between peace and democratic politics on the one hand or violence on the other.  I hope we never again have to look at the scenes on our television screens last week when we saw the young Johnston and Graham children wonder what they deserved to have to face that kind of tragedy.

      <P>I want to be part of a Government that tackles the crime crisis.  Today it is worth remembering that it is exactly a year since the tragic murder of Veronica Guerin, a woman apart who pursued the truth.  The greatest thing we can do in memory of her name is to ensure we rid our society of the kind of crime that caused her tragic and premature death.</P>
      <P>I want to be part of a Government that tackles our two tier society.  So many in our country are marginalised with no opportunity to work, no hope and a poor standard of education.  They have a right to participate in the economic development of our country.  The challenge for the next Government is to ensure we have less marginalisation, more hope and that people will have dignity and self respect.  That is a central feature of the programme for Government.</P>

I regret that very much. They were all outstanding Deputies and great parliamentarians who worked extremely hard.</P>
      <P>I say to the Minister for Social Welfare that I would not change the electoral system in any way that would handicap smaller parties, but smaller parties did very badly in this election notwithstanding our existing electoral system.  That is a fact.  I thank those Deputies in my party who were not re-elected.  Their absence takes away from any sense of excitement I might feel about other matters.  However, good Deputies from every party lost their seats, some of whom worked very hard as Ministers and Ministers of State.  We should not forget them today.  They are probably watching these proceedings and feeling somewhat sad not to be a part of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats entered into negotiations with the Fianna Fáil Party and concluded a programme for Government.  The spirit in which those negotiations were carried out was refreshing.  I welcome that very much and it augurs well for the new Government.

The programme for Government is clearly significant but it is equally important for parties to understand each other's needs.  In coalition Governments things can be achieved by putting guns to people's heads, but where things are achieved in that way they are pyrrhic victories because they damage relationships and undermine the kind of confidence and trust that is essential if a Government is to be stable, policy driven and focused on the issues. We are only interested in participating in a Government that is policy driven, stable from the outset and focused on the needs of our people. That is what we must be determined to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be as relevant to the motion as the previous speakers.  Ba mhaith liom, i dtosach, mo comhghairdeachas pearsanta a chur in iúl duitse, a Cheann Comhairle, as an bpost rí-thábhachtach a bhaint amach.  Tá mé cinnte go leanfaidh tú le traidisiún an neamhspleáchais sa Teach seo mar baineann neamhspleáchas go speisialta leis an bpost sin agus go dtabharfaidh tú, mar a dúirt tú, cothrom na Féinne do gach Teachta.  Tá a lán fhios agam gur sin atá i gceist agat.</P>
      <P>Before stating the manner in which I intend to vote on the nomination of Taoiseach, I take this opportunity to thank all those who voted and campaigned for me in my seventh successive general election.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the constituency of Dublin Central, in which I was elected, had one of the lowest turnouts in the State.  Out of an electorate of almost 64,000, a little more than 36,000 turned out to vote.  In Dublin Central nearly 28,000 people did not believe it was worth while to vote at all.  This may not be surprising given that Dublin Central has some of the most disadvantaged communities, socially and economically, any-where in the country.  A recent study found that Dublin 1 and Dublin 10 postal districts, both of which are in Dublin Central, have the lowest access rate to third level education.  Approximately 4 per cent of children, compared to 54 per cent in affluent Dublin 4, go to college or university.</P>
      <P>Unemployment statistics show parts of Dublin 10 are the worst unemployment blackspots with in excess of 50 per cent unemployment.  Other smaller more localised inner city neighbourhoods have even higher and endemic unemployment levels.  These are the areas where the heroin drug problem was ignored, allowed to fester and spread out of control for 15 years destroying hundreds of young lives and demoralising once proud communities.  The crime problem associated with heroin undermines normal life and drug dealers took effective control of whole neighbourhoods. Decent people lived in constant fear in their homes in the centre of our capital city.  Heroin was even sold openly on O'Connell Street.  This was, and is, the reality of social exclusion in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Few voices were raised to give leadership to the people or to draw attention to these issues. Veronica Guerin who raised her voice was murdered a year ago today.  Not one of the principals involved in that crime &mdash; those who ordered and carried out the crime &mdash; has so far been charged with her murder.  The total loss of confidence of <Col N="37" /> people in the institutions of the State was recently dramatically seen in the anti-drugs marches when people organised to regain control of their communities from drug dealers.  The anti-drugs marches transformed parts of Dublin which had become virtual drug-infested no go areas.  Local people in Cabra, Ballyfermot and the inner city stood up to be counted and turned the tide against the drug bosses.  Some of these people, to whom we are all indebted, are now brought before the courts on the evidence of persons who are the scourge of decent people, evidence which should have no credibility.  The Judiciary presiding over these cases are totally out of touch with the issues on which they are passing judgment. This is injustice heaped on injustice and, if it continues, will only aggravate social tensions.  An amnesty must be seriously considered for anti-drugs campaigners.</P>
    <P>Social exclusion and the heroin crime problem are the legacy of neglect of the main political parties in successive Governments.  That is the appalling record of those who have failed the people of Dublin Central, which is, of course, only a microcosm of an increasingly divided society, whose architects were, and are in the main political parties.</P>
    <P>All of that to which I have referred is set against a background of a booming economy which presents the incoming Taoiseach and Government with the greatest single opportunity to concentrate resources in the areas of most need and make a genuine attempt to end social exclusion and create a more equal society. However, the record of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil does not inspire any confidence that this will happen.  The last occasion a Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil coalition was in Government homeless people died of cold on the streets of Dublin.  If a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government is elected on this occasion, I trust and hope it will not mean a continuation of a divided society or that the great opportunity presented by the economic boom will be squandered.  Only time will tell if that is to be the case, but many vulnerable people fear the influence of the Progressive Democrats over the incoming Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the election of many independent Deputies and members of small parties and express the hope that they can work together in the incoming Dáil as an effective counterbalance against the Progressive Democrats.  I will vote today against both leaders of both conservative parties.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, ní raibh sé i gceist agam labhairt ag an bpointe seo agus tuigim do chás nuair a deir tú nár cheart dúinn a bheith ag caint níos faide ach theastaigh uaim nuair a bhí daoine eile ag labhairt comhghairdeachas a ghabháil leatsa as an bpost atá bainte amach agat.  Is léir gur post an-deacair é agus go bhfuil an-mhisneach agat tabhairt faoi.  Is cinnte nach mbeadh gach éinne sásta tabhairt faoi ach <Col N="38" /> cinnte tá sé tuilte agat agus guím gach rath ort. Ar an dara dul síos ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh mo chomhleacaí John Gormley atá tofa don chéad uair.  Ní duine neamhspleách i saol an Tí seo a thuilleadh mé ach is duine de pháirtí mé anois, an Chomhaontas Glas, sa teach.  Tá an bheirt againn ann.</P>
      <P>Níl aon dabht agam ach go bhfuil an bheirt atá roghnaithe anseo mar ábhar Thaoisigh an-mhaith mar dhaoine agus go ndéanfaidh siad pé leas ar son na tíre agus is féidir má tá seans acu.  Maidir leis an Chomhaontas Glas ní féidir linn ach a rá gur beag difríocht ata idir an cineál rialtais a bheidh ann má tá duine amháin i gceannas nó duine eile.  Is cinnte go bhfuil difríochtaí agus tá pearsantachtaí difriúila ann agus is cinnte go bhfuil rudaí láidre agus rudaí laga ag baint leo go léir, mar atá againn uilig.  Fós féin ar na comhairlí contae timpeall na tíre ta na páirtithe uilig atá anseo ag comhoibriú le chéile agus caithfidh mé a rá mar bhall den Chomhaontas Glas go mbíonn sé mar an gcéanna dá bharr go bhfuilimid ag leanúint ar aghaidh le polasaithe eacnamaíochta go háirithe atá mar an gcéanna sa dhá chás.  Má bhí aon duine ag éisteacht, agus ceapaim go raibh go leor, leis an dTaoiseach i Nua Eabhrac is cinnte go raibh an-teachtaireacht ag na daoine a bhí ag caint cúig bhliain tar éis an rud ar a thugtar The Earth Summit i Rio.  Bhí na daoine a bhí ag caint ansin ag rá go gcaithfimid go léir comhoibriú le chéile, go gcaithfimid a bheith ag déanamh rudaí an-difriúil ar fad amach anseo faoi mar atá déanta faoi láthair.  Sa chlár rialtais atá foilsithe ag Fianna Fáil agus na Progressive Democrats, áfach, níl aon rud suntasach a bheadh mar dhif-ríocht idir an rialtas nua atá ag teacht agus an rialtas eile atá imithe.  Is mór an trua don Chomhaontas Glas nach raibh ceist curtha orainn roimhe chun ár dtuairimí a nochtadh maidir leis an chlár rialtais nua.  Idir an dá linn tá muid mar pháirtí sa bhfreasúra agus beidh muid sásta comhoibriú leis na páirtithe eile agus na daoine neamhspleácha eile a bheidh sa bhfreasúra.  Beidh siad ag déanamh a ndícheall chomh maith linn agus chuige sin tá mé ag rá go mbeidh an Comhaontas Glas ag staonadh ar ainm John Bruton sa chinneadh atá le déanamh.  Beidh muid ag vótáil in aghaidh an rialtais mar tá seans caillte acu tabhairt faoi chlár a bheadh oiriúnach don aois seo chugainn agus a bheadh ag teastáil agus de dhíth orainn.  Chuige sin tá muid ag súil amach anseo gur féidir leas na tíre a bhaint amach trí athrú suntasach sna polasaithe eacnamaíochta a bheidh á leanúint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I congratulate you on your elevation to the position of Ceann Comhairle.  As the father of the House, it is fitting that you should hold this position of honour and responsibility.  I wish you a happy and successful term as Ceann Comhairle.  I take this opportunity to wish Séan Treacy a happy and peaceful retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the privilege bestowed on me by the people of Wicklow and east Carlow to be <Col N="39" /> their voice in Dáil Éireann.  I am equally conscious of the responsibility of public office at local and national level.  Decisions taken in this House affect the lives and livelihoods of every person in this State.</P>
    <P>In deciding how to cast my vote for Taoiseach I considered a number of issues.  I studied the new Fianna Fáil-PD Programme for Government in detail and I sincerely hope the new Government will be able to deliver on many of the proposals outlined in it.  In particular, I welcome some of its proposals on crime.  Today being Veronica Guerin's anniversary, the issue of crime is at the back of everyone's mind.  I sincerely hope those two parties can deliver on some of those proposals.</P>
    <P>The vote for Taoiseach will be one of the most important decisions taken by this House and will determine which Government will take us into the next millennium.  The Taoiseach for whom I will vote must be somebody I can trust, who can deliver on his promises, not merely to me and my constituents but to the electorate in general.  He must be aware of the needs of young people, devise and implement policies that will make it easier for them to further their education and retain a greater proportion of their pay when they take up employment.  For far too long they have been neglected.  We must also provide employment for young people in the field in which they have been trained.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of having been elected as an Independent Member and emphasise that I will remain so.  However, I am under no illusion that I now risk being aligned to a political party. In these circumstances, I need to be reassured that certain issues will be dealt with and projects delivered in my constituency in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>As an Independent Member I have been subjected to and endured the type of criticism inherent in that role.  However, I emphasise that I am just as interested as any other Member of the House or of the general public in having a stable Government.  While I do not intend to cause the fall of any Government like all other Members, I shall face the electorate five years hence.  The issues I support will have to be addressed.  I have an agreement that a certain number of them will be dealt with as a matter of priority.  One such is the construction of a secondary school to cope with the rapidly growing population of north-east Wicklow, a site for which is available in Kilcoole.  I have received an undertaking that the planning process will be initiated immediately and its building commence not later than next year.</P>
    <P>County Wicklow is one of only two counties without a district veterinary office.  I have been assured that such an office will be provided in the east Wicklow area.  As a county, Wicklow suffers the disadvantage of having its western part cut off from its eastern part by a broad mountain range making it very difficult for those resident in the west to negotiate with Wicklow County Council <Col N="40" /> whose offices are located in the east.  Those from the western part wanting to lodge planning applications or tax cars should be able to do so with the minimum of inconvenience.  I have been given an undertaking that a sub-office of Wicklow County Council will be opened in Blessington as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I have been given undertakings on many other matters which will benefit all communities, some of which are not costly or of great national importance but are of enormous importance to Wicklow and east Carlow.</P>
      <P>Politics is about listening to people and implementing the policies they advocate.  The Member for whom I will vote as Taoiseach must listen to people, understand their needs and, more importantly, respond to them.  I shall vote for Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach and wish him and his incoming Government well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Having been honoured by the support of substantial numbers of the ordinary people of Dublin West to represent them in the 28th Dáil, it is my intention in this and future debates to bring to the fore real issues affecting them, their concerns, problems and aspirations for a changed and better society.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Socialist Party, I am confronted by a nominee from the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties, both of which have dominated political life here since the foundation of the State.  Therefore they and their nominees must carry a major share of responsibility for the present shape of our society.  From the shape of that society we can gauge the shape of society that will result from their election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a judgment on personalities but on political parties and political records.  Politically, the parties that have put forward nominees stand condemned for their abject failure over decades, including recent times, to create the conditions where the marvellous resources and talents of our people could be harnessed to guarantee a life free from want, unemployment and many of the problems we face.  Both candidates worship the new god of the market, which is not a democratic <Col N="41" /> organisation of society but an economic dictatorship by which a tiny minority wield massive power, affecting the lives of millions of people, as tragically 600 workers in United Technologies in Derry have discovered, as did workers in Packard Electric, Semperit and other companies.</P>
    <P>The parties that have nominated potential leaders today are responsible for the fact that one million people, including tens of thousands of our youth, have been forced into involuntary exile on foreign shores.  Those parties are responsible for the criminal neglect of many working class communities by allowing long-term unemployment to blight those communities.  As a result of an abysmal lack of facilities, life is an enormous struggle for many people.  That neglect over decades is directly responsible for the heroin crisis that bedevils many communities and the crime that follows from that.  I blame the establishment for the suffering of drug addicts, their parents and heartbroken families and the resulting problems in communities.  Were it not for the fact that ordinary people have come out against the brutal drug pusher, the political establishment and today's nominees would still be in the dark.</P>
    <P>I blame those parties for the plight of thousands of people on waiting lists for local authority houses.  We are on the verge of a major housing crisis, exacerbated by the insane increase in house prices in the past two years, a consequence of a market gone mad.  How can this problem be acknowledged, particularly by Deputy Ahern and his side, when the aspiring Tánaiste on whose votes he clearly relies believes that working class families live in mansions and that unexpected additions to the family can be catered for by opening up some unused extension or other?</P>
    <P>The proposal of the nominees to cut a few percentage points off the tax rate at the lower level does not, by itself, constitute taxation justice for the PAYE worker, the workhorse of the tax system for so long.  Taxation justice would involve the levying of taxes on the massively profitable banks, financial institutions and powerful corporations at a level approximating that of the PAYE worker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how the system works in North Korea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> What hope is there of tax justice when the five parties vying for power today stood aside while thousands of decent householders, the backbone of the PAYE system, were dragged through the courts by local authorities for arrears of a discredited double tax on water, now abolished as a result of a magnificent demonstration of people power?  Incredibly, next Wednesday Fingal County Council will move in the Circuit Court to confirm orders for water disconnection against some of those householders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By contrast, one of the nominees, Deputy Ahern, backed shamefully by the Labour Party, presided over the writing off of £500 million in a <Col N="42" /> tax amnesty for the most privileged and powerful sections of society, not one of whom darkened the doorway of a courthouse, in sharp contrast to the way ordinary people are treated for opposing an unjust tax.  What hope of tax justice from these nominees when one of our highest profile semi-State companies &mdash; TEAM Aer Lingus &mdash; regularly employs thousands of workers from abroad on a casual basis, paying their wages, without deducting tax, into off-shore bank accounts to undermine the working conditions and confidence of Irish employees of that company who have built it up through their sacrifices and pay the maximum amount of tax?  What hope of taxation justice from these nominees when their parties, and the three parties which support them, have their hands permanently outstretched to the wealthiest and most powerful sections of Irish society for donations to oil their political machines and maintain their political careers?</P>
    <P>With regard to the tragic situation in Northern Ireland, does anyone believe that a political establishment in the Republic which treats its citizens in this way can inspire confidence among ordinary people in the North, a section of whom are already deeply suspicious of this State, or help overcome the sectarian chasm that exists there? An immediate ceasefire is 30 years overdue and the tragedy of paramilitary violence and violence on the part of the British state must be brought to an immediate end.  However, the peace process must be built not by deals between politicians at the top but by fostering the unity of working class communities to tackle the major problems they face.</P>
    <P>I hope to be a voice for many inadequately cared for and catered for people in our society, including those with disabilities, the friends and families of those with mental handicaps who at present have no respite, those who require heart and lung transplants and those seeking refuge who, in the course of the general election campaign, were disgracefully scapegoated by some politicians in a cynical bid to gain votes.</P>
    <P>Some pundits would state that a Deputy representing a small party or an independent Deputy must support one or other nominee from the major parties to make any difference.  I do not subscribe to that view.  In the past, these pundits advised the parties of the left to sink into coalitionism with the parties of the right.  That has been the traditional route of the Labour Party, with disastrous consequences for the left and a total failure to build the left as a credible force in our society, leading supporters up the hill of hopeless compromise.  Following a number of years, that party has been booted down again by a disappointed electorate.  Unfortunately, that has been the role of Labour and Democratic Left when they could have built and provided for our people a real alternative to the establishment.</P>
    <P>I stand for the building of a strong and independent left, the only agenda of which should be the powerful movement of ordinary people, independent of the clutches of the conservative establishment, <Col N="43" /> to fight on all the issues and lobby for democratic socialist change in our society whereby material resources and talents can be utilised for the benefit of all people rather than for the obscene greed of a small minority.</P>
    <P>It is my privilege to quote James Connolly, one of the great founders of the Labour movement and socialism in our society.  He outlined that the resources of society must be developed for the benefit of all people and referred to &ldquo;.a system of society in which the whole human race will be secured against the fear of want for all time, a system in which all men and women will be joint heirs and owners of all the intellectual and material conquests made possible by associated effort.&rdquo; My vote will be to ensure the independence of the left.  I will give no credibility to any of the establishment parties and I will vote against them.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil muinín ar bith agamsa i cheachtar den bheirt Teachta atá ainmnithe anseo do phost an Taoisigh.  Níl muinín agam ionta nó ina bpáirtithe polaitíochta.  Is iad na pearsain seo agus na páirtithe a mbaineann siad leo agus na rialtais in a raibh siad páirteach roimhe seo atá freagrach as neamh-réiteach na bhfadhbanna géara atá ag cur isteach ar chuid mhór de mhuintir na tíre.  Táim ag cur san áireamh ansin mí-chothromaíocht i gcúrsaí cánach ó thaobh lucht PAYE de, di-fhostaíocht fad-théarmach agus an géarchéim i measc cosmhuintir Bhaile Atha Cliath go mor-mhór.  Is iad atá freagrach as neamh-réiteach na bhfadhbanna agus is cinnte nach bhfuil aon pholasaí nua acu a chuir-feadh leigheas ar fáil ar na fadhbanna.</P>

      <P>We cannot expect young people to work in a sector which is seasonal.  This causes problems for employers looking for staff. The Government must invest more money in tourism so that rural areas such as south Kerry can have a year round tourist season.</P>
      <P>I have called for immediate assistance for farmers, in particular hill farmers, whose income has fallen dramatically over the past 12 months.  Live cattle exports must be resumed immediately.  The farm development grants must be reintroduced to enable farmers to avail of modern farming methods.

A derelict four wheel drive tractor drives out to meet the boats and bring in the catch so that these men can maintain their livelihoods. This cannot and will not prevail in future.</P>
      <P>I want stable and viable employment for the young people in south Kerry, not dead end schemes.  I want access to educational courses that are relevant to modern industry.  In particular, I want a reduction in the cost of car insurance for under 25s; this must be done.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo comhghairdeas a ghabháil leat.  Glacaim an suíochán sa chomhdháil seo inniu go bródúil mar Theachta ó mhuintir an Chabháin agus Muinea-cháin agus is ar a son agus ar son mo pháirtí Sinn Féin atáim anseo mar ionadaí.  Is stairiúil an lá é dár bpáirtí.  Is stairiúil freisin an ócáid í don chomhdháil seo.</P>
      <P>Is páirtí poblachtach é Sinn Féin agus i bhfocail Fhorógra na Poblachta 1916 &ldquo;dearbhaimid gur ceart ceannasach do-chloíte ceart mhuintir na hÉireann chun tír na hÉireann, agus fós chun dála na hÉireann a stiúradh gan chosc gan toirmeasc&rdquo;. Níl an cheannasacht iomlán fós ag muintir na hÉireann agus is é bunchuspóir mo pháirtí an Phoblacht uile-Éireannach a chur ar bun.</P>
      <P>Tagaim anseo mar ionadaí ó cheantar atá imeallach le fada an lá mar gheall ar chríchdheighilt ar dtíre agus mar gheall ar neamhaird ag rialtais i ndiaidh rialtais sa stát seo.  Mar Theachta beidh sé mar bhunaidhm agam deireadh a chur leis an neamhaird sin agus mo cheantar a chur ar ais i lár pholaitíocht na tíre seo.</P>
      <P>I am honoured to stand here today, a Cheann Comhairle and fellow Deputies, as a Deputy for the people of Cavan and Monaghan and as a representative of Sinn Féin, the party of which I am proud to be a member.  I represent an all-Ireland party that enjoys a significant mandate in both parts of our divided island and I welcome the presence here today of my colleagues, Gerry Adams, MP for West Belfast, and Martin McGuinness, MP for Mid-Ulster.  I look forward to the day when I will join them and all the others elected by the Irish people as a whole in a national parliament for the 32 Counties.</P>
      <P>In the recent election voters were offered a choice between two sets of coalition partners with virtually identical social and economic policies. From the composition of the House today it is obvious that the electorate resented being forced to make such a choice.  This reality is reflected in the growing strength of the smaller parties and independents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the general election Sinn Féin stood as a party for change.  Our vision is of a new Ireland, of people united in shared prosperity.  We note the failure of successive Administrations in this <Col N="47" /> State to fulfil the aim of the democratic programme of the first Dáil Eireann which declared the right of every citizen to an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour.</P>

      <P>This ongoing failure is evident in every town and village in Ireland and can be seen in the high level of long-term unemployment, rural decline and the growing drugs crisis.  Promoting the interests of my constituents in Cavan and Monaghan and advancing the case for a fairer social and economic order based on equality will be my priorities during the course of the term before us.  The partition of our country and Britain's occupation of the six north-eastern counties is the single greatest problem facing us as a people.  The most important task for us all is to rebuild the peace process.  This must include the full recognition of Sinn Féin's electoral man-date by both Governments.  The way to lasting peace is through inclusive negotiations leading to political and constitutional change.  The intense and positive engagement of the new Government and all the representatives in this House will be needed to bring that historic change about.  On the vote for Taoiseach, therefore, Sinn Féin's priority is the rebuilding of the peace process. Accordingly, I will be casting my vote for Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach.  I am doing so solely on the basis of his and his party's positive disposition towards a genuine and inclusive process.</P>

      <P>I congratulate you, a Cheann Comhairle, on your election and look forward to co-operating with you for the duration of the 28th Dáil.  I am honoured to be an Independent Fianna Fáil Member of Dáil Éireann and thank my organisation workers, director of elections and voters for making this possible.  On coming into the House I was reminded that it is 70 years since my father was first elected to the Dáil in 1927.  That tradition has continued uninterrupted except for a short hiccup in the last by-election in north-east Donegal just over one year ago.  I am honoured to carry it on, following in the footsteps of my late brother, Neil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> Independents have an important role to play in the formation of a Government and hope to play a positive and constructive role in the workings of this House for the duration of the 28th Dáil.  The new Government will face many problems, the most urgent of which is to secure a genuine and lasting peace on this island based on justice for all the people of the nation. I hope to play some part in helping it to bring this about.</P>
    <P>There are many other problems, including unemployment, rural decline, crime, drugs and taxation.  The loss of our young educated people to emigration is a festering sore.  There is marginalisation and depopulation of the west.  Added to this is the neglected corridor straddling both sides of the Border from Lough Foyle to Carling-ford Lough.  This has left my county of Donegal marginalised more than any other.  At 33 per cent, it has the highest rate of unemployment in the country and the lowest income per head of population. One of the main reasons for this is the neglect of the county by all Governments and State agencies in recent years.  We have not been getting our fair share of funds from central Government or the European Union.  I will be urging the incoming Government to address this.</P>
    <P>I have been approached in recent weeks by the leaders of the two main political parties seeking my support in the election of Taoiseach.  I discussed with them the serious situation that exists in the six north-eastern counties.  On the abortion issue, the current position is unsatisfactory and cannot be allowed to continue.  I will, therefore, be pressing the new Government to put a properly worded amendment to the electorate in a referendum so that a clear and unequivocal decision can be reached.  I also discussed with both leaders the urgent problems in my own county and made certain proposals.  I was assured they would give the matter serious attention and their response has been treated with respect and will remain confidential.  I thank both leaders for the manner in which they treated my proposals.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with my organisation, our task was to evaluate who could best in the long-term realistically deliver on my proposals.  I had no doubt about the genuine interest of both leaders and their sincerity about the future of the State and the success of the 28th Dáil.  I have come to the decision that the electorate wants a stable Government and that the best means of achieving this is through the election of a Fianna Fáil-led coalition Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach The Taoiseach">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the incoming Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on being chosen as Taoiseach by the Dáil.  He brings to office a wealth of ministerial experience.  He has served with distinction in many offices.  He also brings to high office a personality that will help him a great deal in working with colleagues and doing the business of Government in an effective, fair and decent way.  He also benefits from the support of a large and experienced political party, Fianna Fáil, which has served this country well over many years.  I wish him and his colleague, Deputy Harney, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, well in the task that lies in front of them.</P>
      <P>The economic conditions in which this new Government will enter office in a few hours are exceptional in historic terms.  Never before have we seen such rapid growth in employment.  Never before have mortgage and interest rates been at such a low level.  The Government also comes into office at a time when the foundations have been laid for major moves towards a settlement in Northern Ireland.  The talks process is open to all.  The principal difficulty in those talks &mdash; the issue of decommissioning &mdash; has been one on which in recent days the Irish and British Governments have reached agreement on a way forward. I believe this creates good conditions in which the new Government can give the necessary impetus to the talks and enable matters to move forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously there are many challenges facing this country in the years ahead.  There is an increasing gap between those who are well off in our society and those who are not &mdash; those who are excluded by technology or lack of education from participation in society.  There is a growth in consumerist attitudes in our society which damages care for others, which is the essence of politics just as it is the essence of good personal living. Political decisions should represent and reflect what we regard as good, honourable behaviour in our personal lives.  It is important, <Col N="55" /> therefore, to have a Government that cares about everybody in our society.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, on foot of the Amsterdam summit, we will shortly have a debate on the development of Europe, which faces many challenges.  We will have a single European currency on time but it is important to have a similar political consensus in Europe if the necessary supporting decisions are to be taken to make that currency work.  The political will for that must be created in Europe. That may be lacking at present and it is a challenge that will face the new Government.</P>
    <P>The social partnership has been a great success and I am proud the outgoing Government has been successful in negotiating the new Programme 2000.  Virulent global forces will increasingly affect our economy and people.  We see this all the time.  We are physically an island but in no other sense because we are affected by what happens elsewhere.  The Government must reconcile itself to the great increasing pressures in the world.</P>
    <P>It is important to reflect on the fact that there are 450 million more people on this earth now than at the time of the last general election.  They need to be fed and they create many more demands on our environment.  We should think globally and act locally to ensure we have a sustainable society for all our people.</P>
    <P>I hope the new Government will put extreme emphasis on the development of education which is the key to Ireland's competitive economic success. I also hope the new Government will not abandon proposals the outgoing Government put forward to decentralise education.  Our education system must decentralise decision making if it is to achieve its full potential.  Centralisation is not the answer for the future.</P>
    <P>I again congratulate Deputy Bertie Ahern on being selected for the highest office this House can bestow.  I wish him exceptional good fortune in the job.  He has known both the good days and the bad ones.  He has experienced disappointment as well as success, and that is necessary for anyone to be successful in politics.  That has prepared him well for the task he will now undertake.  I wish him well and all those who care for him, in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>I also wish you well, a Cheann Comhairle, on your appointment.  I join with all those who have spoken so highly of you and who have said how deserving you are of the office you now hold.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude on a personal note.  In my entire life I cannot remember a period I have enjoyed more than the last two and a half years working with my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and in Democratic Left. It genuinely was a pleasure to work with Deputy Spring and Deputy De Rossa as well as with all my other colleagues.  It was a great pleasure to <Col N="56" /> work with a highly professional public service that assists all of us as Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are lucky to have a public service that is above suspicion in terms of any undue influence being exercised upon it.  There are many reasons why Ireland is an economic success but one of them is that we get investment from overseas.  We would not get such investment were it not for the fact that everybody the world over knows that the Irish public service is above undue influence from any quarter and applies the laws of the land without fear or favour.  That is a great support to any Government and it is a great guarantor of the successful future of our country.</P>
      <P>With those words I wish Deputy Ahern all the best.</P>

      <P>Is cúis mór áthais domsa seasamh anseo inniu ós chomhair na Dála mar Thaoiseach ainmnithe ar Phoblacht na hÉireann. Is mór an onóir, an phribhléid agus an dualgas atá orm ceart a dhéanamh ar son muintir na hÉireann agus cuirfidh an rialtas nua seo chun oibre le fuinneamh.</P>
      <P>I express my deep gratitude and appreciation to the Dáil for the great honour it has conferred on me by electing me Taoiseach.  I am deeply conscious of the important responsibility this honour places on me.</P>
      <P>I congratulate you, a Cheann Comhairle, on your election and I promise you, on behalf of myself, my party and the Government, that we will give you the fullest possible co-operation in the discharge of your duties.  I wish you a long and happy stay.  Over the years we have talked about fathers of the House but you stand as the true father of the House because nobody is within four years of you.  We have argued here before about who was first elected at various elections but it is a sign of how things change that you stand alone from the class of 1961.  I wish you well and hope, given your relatively young age which I will not mention, that you will be here for a long time.</P>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, a Chathaoirligh, Teachtaí Dála, distinguished visitors, it is my honour to stand here this evening at the commencement of the 28th Dáil as the person nominated to be Taoiseach.  I am conscious of that honour and the privilege and responsibility placed on me to lead this partnership Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats into a comprehensive Government programme which will address the great challenges faced by our nation. Those challenges have been well aired today by a number of speakers and we all understand what we must do for the people.  We are all elected to this House by the people and we must work for them in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> The Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney, our Government team and I will work long and hard and to the best of our ability to provide sound, stable and productive Government. We will concentrate on the primary needs and concerns of the nation at home and abroad. Many of the best Governments have been minority ones.  This will be the first to be both a minority Government and a coalition.  The situation will require the incoming Government to pay particular attention to all views expressed in this House.  We will try to work constructively with other parties and Independent Members wherever possible.  There is a duty on us all to ensure the Dáil functions effectively in the interests of the people for the full length of its natural term or as near to that as possible.</P>
    <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his kind remarks today which are important to me.  I thank him for the telephone conversation earlier today and for the way both of us were able to work during the election campaign.  Although we appeared to fight our causes in total hostility, we were courteous when we met and I appreciate that.  I also thank him for the assistance and briefing he authorised and provided for me and a number of colleagues during the three week interregnum, especially in relation to Northern Ireland, budgetary matters and the European Council summit in Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>The last Dáil was unique because for the first time there was a change of Government without a general election, although I hope that is not repeated in the near future.  It is healthy for our democracy that all the larger parties and many of the small ones have had experience of Government and of working together in different combinations in the past ten years.  That has been good for this House.  I came here in another period when the choice was black and white but that has since changed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and his colleagues have every right to look back with satisfaction and pride on many aspects of their stewardship during their comparatively short period of two and a half years in Government.  I think the average term of office since the foundation of the State is about two years and eight months.  Needless to say, I do not intend to keep to such a period; it will be far longer than that.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work done by the Taoiseach and his colleagues. The Irish Presidency of the European Union Council was handled with great efficiency and professionalism.  I said that on the conclusion of the Presidency and I meant it.  Ireland's essential interests in Europe have been well defended by and large in the negotiations on the Amsterdam Treaty, which we must bring to the people for ratification, and, as the Taoiseach stated, we must debate the report of the Summit in the House.</P>
    <P>While the breakdown in the ceasefire was a <Col N="58" /> serious setback, useful rules, structures and guidelines have been put in place by the outgoing Government to advance the peace process.  The new procedures for dealing with decommissioning announced yesterday should prove, I hope, to be a most positive step toward inclusive all party talks.  Throughout the past five years the Tánaiste and his Department have played a special and important role spanning two Governments and providing continuity, and that deserves to be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>A new start has been made in tackling crime, particularly since the tragic murder of Veronica Guerin which has been mentioned by many people here today on her anniversary.  The work must be carried on to the next stage in a co-ordinated and comprehensive way.  The battle against crime must continue through many future Dálaí to bring safety and security to our citizens.</P>
    <P>The leaders of the Rainbow Coalition, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social Welfare and others, have by and large served the country with great distinction and to the best their ability and I congratulate them on what they have achieved.  It can be reasonably said that the Rainbow Coalition did not lose the election; it was more a case of the Opposition winning it.  This shows that solid and constructive work in bringing forward well considered and relevant policy positions and Private Members' Bills can provide a good preparation for Government and make this Dáil an interesting place in which to work.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said we are from the school of politics which understands hard knocks, the ups and downs, almost being there and the good and bad days.  We both know what it is like to have the cup dashed from one's lips at short notice but, more importantly, how to survive, not to take it too seriously and to live and learn from the experience with a reasonably constructive frame of mind.  I have had to do that and, I agree with the Taoiseach, that I am a better person for it.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition should have a professional relationship and be able, when the national interest demands it, to close ranks and to co-operate.  An example of this during the last Dáil was when the IRA ceasefire broke down.</P>
    <P>That night the Taoiseach and I discussed the matter and we had many discussions that weekend. I thank him for the courtesy he afforded me in Opposition.  I hope our relationship will continue in the same spirit and that I will have similar relationships with the leaders of the other parties. That is essential for the good order of this House. It does not, of course, diminish the necessary parliamentary vigour on either side which forms part of our duties.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members of Fianna Fáil, the parliamentary party and the organisation throughout the country, for the great honour they did me in <Col N="59" /> supporting me and asking their colleagues and elected representatives to nominate me for the high office of Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I offer my sincere thanks to my partners in the new Government, the Progressive Democrats.  I thank Deputy Harney for all her work over the past number of weeks, many of which were difficult for her.  I thank Deputy Harney and all the Progressive Democrats for their co-operation in the negotiations, which were successful, and the efficiency with which we produced this programme.</P>
    <P>I express my thanks to the Independent Members who supported my nomination today.  I greatly appreciate that support.  I assure the wider public that I have an honour which has been bestowed on only a handful of people.  It carries responsibility and is a job at which a person must work extremely hard.  I like working hard, but this job is harder than any other and I look forward to it.  I also look forward to the co-operation of the Independents and all other Members of the House.  I appreciate the respect and the comments made during the past years.  I look forward to representing this House in the capacity of Taoiseach to the best of my ability.</P>
    <P>Having spent 20 years here and having had an interest in politics from a very young age, it is hard to put into words the honour of this position. The only way I can repay it is to work every hour of every day to show I merit it.  I will do that on behalf of my party, the Dáil and the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I thank everyone for the faith and confidence they have placed in me.  I thank my family, my extended family and my friends who have worked with me for two decades to help me stay in this House.</P>
    <P>I congratulate every Member elected, particularly the new ones, as this is a huge honour for them.  They worked extremely hard to get elected to this House and many of them consider this the pinnacle of their career.  Some people elected to this House today will go on perhaps to hold the <Col N="60" /> position to which I have been elected.  Others will be appointed Ministers or Ministers of State in the future, leaders of Opposition parties and to other positions.  I wish them well at the outset of their career as they assume the great dignity that is part of being a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>I understand it has been agreed by the Whips that the House should adjourn until 7.30 p.m.  and sit not later than 10 p.m.  tonight.</P>
    <P>I thank everybody and look forward, with all the vigour and energy I can give, to doing a good job as Taoiseach.  Go raibh míle maith agaibh.</P>

    <P>It has been the practice at this stage to indicate the Departments to which members of the Government will be assigned.  I propose, using the old Departments structure, to assign as follows:</P>
    <P>Department of Enterprise and Employment to Mary Harney,</P>
    <P>Department of the Marine to Michael Woods,</P>
    <P>Department of Foreign Affairs to Ray Burke,</P>
    <P>Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to Mary O'Rourke,</P>
    <P>Department of Defence to David Andrews,</P>
    <P>Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to Joe Walsh,</P>
    <P>Department of Finance to Charlie McCreevy,</P>
    <P>Department of Health to Brian Cowen,</P>
    <P>Department of the Environment to Noel Dempsey,</P>
    <P>Department of Social Welfare to Dermot Ahern,</P>
    <P>Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to Síle de Valera,</P>
    <P>Department of Justice and the Department of Equality and Law Reform to John O'Donoghue,</P>
    <P>Department of Tourism and Trade to Jim McDaid,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>Department of Education to Micheál Martin.</P>
    <P>I also propose to nominate Deputy Séamus Brennan for appointment by the Government as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, with special responsibility as Government Chief Whip.  He will also be Minister of State at the Department of Defence.  I propose to nominate Deputy Bobby Molloy for appointment as Minister of State to the Government and Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and it is my intention that he will attend Government meetings in the same way as the Chief Whip does.  As seven of my 14 nominees have not been in Cabinet before, I wish them, and the others, every success in the future.  I propose to nominate Mr. David Byrne, Senior Counsel, for appointment by the President to be the Attorney General and I will propose the other Ministers of State for appointment by the Government at an early date.</P>
    <P>I have allocated the members of the Government to Departments on the basis of existing divisions of responsibility.  There are, however, substantial changes which I propose to make in departmental responsibilities and organisation to reflect or to emphasise new priorities in Government. The full details of these changes will be worked out over the coming days.</P>
    <P>I propose to return Trade to the Department of Enterprise and Employment, with which it more logically fits.  Foreign trade is the lifeblood of our economy and is inseparable from the companies engaged in industry and commerce.  I am essentially reuniting functions that naturally belong together.</P>
    <P>I will be broadening the title and remit of Health, so that it becomes the Department of Health and Children.  The full implementation of child care legislation is a very important priority, and this will be reflected in the description of the Department's responsibilities.  I acknowledge the significant advances made during Deputy Currie's tenure of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare will become the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The broader remit will reflect that social inclusion means more than just income support, vital though that may be.  Working with voluntary and community organisations can make a lot of <Col N="63" /> difference to improving opportunities for self-help and for employment in the more disadvantaged areas.  The family unit is the foundation of social cohesion and needs to be supported at a policy level.  The implications of decisions for the family need to be taken into account at the Cabinet table.  Community and family affairs, as well as various issues of social inclusion, can best be dealt with by revamping the old Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has become <i>de facto</i> responsible for most of our larger commercial semi-State companies and for much of the State's direct involvement in the economy.  I propose to recognise this explicitly by renaming the Department and establishing it as the Department of Public Enterprise.  This will have the benefit of underlining our commitment to a dynamic State sector.  In the words of our programme, we intend &ldquo;to enable them to be competitive and cost-effective as providers of vital public services to the benefit of the consumer&rdquo;.  This innovation will provide important and welcome recognition and encouragement to all those who work in the commercial public sector, which includes some of the country's best companies.  It may be objected to on the grounds that some of the responsibilities of the existing Department such as some parts of telecommunications mainly involve the private sector. That may be true, but it is the State or some delegated public authority on its behalf that issues the licences, as the wavelengths are in the first instance the property of the State.  &lsquo;Public enterprise&rsquo; should be understood not only to include the public sector, but also those fields of enterprise that are allocated by the public domain for private sector operation.</P>
    <P>I am making an alteration to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and propose to rename it the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  Within the Department, the Gaeltacht and the Islands will preserve their separate identity, and I will give a Minister of State responsibility for them.  The arts in this State have progressed from benign neglect, to enlightened cultural patronage in the days when Charles Haughey was Taoiseach, then to systematic organisation under a Government Department carrying full Cabinet rank.  I acknowledge the important pioneering contribution by Deputy Michael D. Higgins as the first such Minister, even if some of our priorities may be different.</P>
    <P>I regard heritage as a very important ingredient in the new Department, which I would like to highlight and upgrade.  It is about fostering our cultural identity both for our own benefit and for the benefit of those who visit our shores in search of the features that are distinctively Irish.  Some of our offshore islands have been badly neglected in the past.  The inhabitants have needs which must be met if we wish to see the islands continue to support the critical mass of population.  The islands are an important facet of our cultural <Col N="64" /> identity and none of us should begrudge the measures, which are not particularly costly in overall terms, which will prevent further depopulation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Equality and Law Reform had responsibility for the passage of the divorce referendum and accompanying legislation and also for equality legislation which will have to be revisited following judgments in the Supreme Court.  I pay tribute to the work of the retired Deputy Taylor, a Minister for whom we all had great respect.  However, law reform is a natural complement to law enforcement and belongs with the Department of Justice whose functions should include equality, or put another way, the prohibition of discrimination.  The function of equality and law reform should be highlighted rather than subordinated and, therefore, I will expand the remit of the Minister and the Department and call it the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Science and technology was given a new political impetus when Fianna Fáil returned to Government in 1987 which it has tended to lose gradually in the l990s, notwithstanding the best efforts of Deputy Rabbitte and his predecessors. While applied technology is an integral part of industrial development, teaching, training and much important research takes place in the universities and colleges, and clearly belongs with the education remit.  Continuing expansion will require us to meet the educational, training and research needs of new industries setting up in Ireland and the Minister for Education, Science and Technology will need to liaise closely with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who will continue to handle the industrial research side of Forbairt.  Ireland needs to be at the cutting edge of scientific advance as we draw level with other countries in terms of living standards. Science and research needs more priority in terms of resources.  For the first time, we are raising it to full Cabinet level.  It will be the responsibility of a Minister of State in the Department of Education who will co-operate with and co-ordinate necessary activities with the Department of Enterprise, Employment and Trade.</P>
    <P>I will continue to combine agriculture and food to emphasise that our agri-food industry needs to be market and consumer-driven, not only production driven.  However, as indicated in our Programme for Government, to ensure full confidence in the quality of our food from a health point of view, responsibility for a statutory independent science-based food safety and quality authority will be placed on the Department of Health and Children.  I will create a new Department of Natural Resources, which will include mining, marine and forestry.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment will add rural development to its name and its responsibilities will also include western development. There is a great need for development to maintain the fabric of rural life and the population to underpin the provision of vital services and, as <Col N="65" /> a party, Fianna Fáil published a detailed policy discussion document setting out what is required.</P>
    <P>There will also be a new Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, to which I also propose to transfer responsibility for local development, subject to further consideration and consultation.  Sport is for the first time being given full Cabinet status.  I feel strongly that sport has the same importance for national well-being as, for example, arts and culture.  Recent successes have given us an international profile, which is also helpful to the promotion of our tourism industry.  Tourism is now one of the country's largest employers.  Along with the issues we raised in the broader area of sport and recreation, they have the related advantage of helping the disadvantaged and less well off in our society achieve personal betterment, about which I feel strongly.  We are not only talking about elite sports people who tend to receive the commentary but about giving people the opportunity to reach their potential.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence in addition to his normal responsibilities, will have a responsibility under the direction of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for European affairs.  Modern Ministers for Foreign Affairs have a heavy schedule of meetings on Northern Ireland, Europe and internationally. The Minister for Foreign Affairs needs to be able to share the burden of attending numerous important meetings without loss of function or overall policy direction, with another colleague of Cabinet rank.  The Minister for Defence and European Affairs will not remove any function from Foreign Affairs where he will have a second office, but will share in the work. I also envisage his assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in representing the Government at the Northern Ireland peace talks, so there will be less need to rotate attendance which multiplies the number of Ministers to be briefed.  Deputy John Bruton will know that many of those involved in the talks process want the same people involved all the time and this is a way to do that.</P>
    <P>Our action programme has been published and will form the basis for our work in Government. Much of the detail is contained in our respective manifestos, our joint statements during the election and the background policy discussion documents. Our priorities coming into Government are clear.</P>
    <P>Restoring peace in Northern Ireland, defusing conflict and making progress towards a settlement with the new British Government and the parties is a vital priority.  I will at all times safeguard our democracy and give leadership to the Irish nation as we try to build confidence, reconciliation, trust and co-operation between people on this island.  There is now a real opportunity for peace and progress towards a political settlement, which I hope will be promoted and facilitated by all parties.  I will contribute with the British Government to providing the necessary momentum. I will try to help avoid confrontation so that <Col N="66" /> we move away from the destructive zero sum politics of the past by which everyone lost, to a politics by which everyone gains.  I would like to be judged by an improvement in human and community relations during my period in office and the ability to move to a less contentious and more productive agenda.  To borrow a phrase, if I can help to make Northern Ireland a kinder and gentler place over the next five years, I will be well pleased.</P>
    <P>My Government will seek to maintain rapid economic progress, increase employment, raise living standards and continue co-operation with the social partners.  We believe tighter economic management is needed to safeguard the gains of recent years and maximise further growth so it will pay dividends for all.  We need to correct course so the dynamism of the Irish economy does not go off the rails.  We will show political responsibility at all times.  We must make a safe and careful transition to monetary union and provide for the eventuality of some tapering off of EU funding.  We would also like to be judged on our ability to make major inroads into poverty, disadvantage, social exclusion and long-term unemployment.  Reducing the grip of drugs addiction and violent crime on certain parts of the community will be an integral part of that programme.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats come to office with the most comprehensive, farreaching and progressive environmental policies ever put forward by parties coming into Government. They are integrated into our other policies. Those who share a commitment to green policies should take note of what we are endeavouring to do.  We intend to implement those policies in a way that will transform habits and attitudes.  We hope to make the next five years a period of exciting national progress, building on all that has been achieved by successive Governments since 1987.  We look forward to active and constructive engagement with the Dáil in our work.</P>
    <P>I commend the new Government to the Dáil and wish my colleagues every success in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of the following Deputies for appointment by the President to be Members of the Government&rdquo;:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Ministers whose appointments were announced today well in their task.  Many of them bring considerable ministerial experience to their work.  Some of the new appointees have a proven record of ability which I hope will be of benefit to them, their Departments and the country in the coming months.</P>
      <P>It is worth making the point that these Ministers come into office at a time of unprecedented economic growth.  For the past three to four years we have had rates of growth which have not been equalled in our history and are not being equalled by any other European nation.  This growth has meant there are 120,000 more people at work in Ireland than there were two and a half years ago. Economic growth also means we have choices to make.  The availability of money and the options on how to spend it means we are more severely put to the test in a moral sense than we would be in times of straitened circumstances when frequently there is no choice to be made and one has to live within one's means.  On the other hand, at a time when money is available there are real choices to be made as to on which desirable object one will spend the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Government will recollect fundamental human values in the way it spends its money.  I do not agree with the Government's policy on reducing tax rates.  The effect of this will be to help those who are better off more than those who are less well off.  Concentrating on reducing tax rates rather than increasing tax allowances and widening tax bands is a fundamental error which the Government has made at its foundation.  The effect of that fundamental error will be to make this a more divided society. At every level &mdash; the level of political wisdom and normal human respect for other people, that is a fundamental mistake.  It is not just a mistake in tax policy but in terms of what is good for the country in forming a united society.  By that decision, this Government commits itself to a course which will not ultimately be in its interest or that of the nation.  We face a choice as to what sort of Ireland we will have in the years ahead. <Col N="68" /> The choice I have referred to is adverse to our long-term interests.</P>
    <P>However, there are many things I hope will be continued in a beneficial light.  I have no doubt the new Government will be committed to social partnership, as was the outgoing Government. This means working in conjunction and consultation with trade unions, employers, farming and other organisations in a widened social partnership. That is important because it creates a cement which enables us to cope with problems in a partnership fashion which we might not otherwise be able to do.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the House recognises the country faces very significant challenges from outside this island.  We live in a truly global economy. As a result of decisions taken recently, all markets are open to all other producers.  The Irish market is part of the European Union and will be open to imports of goods and services from all over the world.  This will mean the idea that we can protect ourselves, or particular forms of employment or activities from international competition is anachronistic.  It is not possible for us to do so.  There must, therefore, be a constant process of improvement in our competitiveness in every aspect of life.  We must recognise that the public service, our educational system and our health system are as much a part of the Irish competitive economy as are our information technology, pharmaceutical and agriculture industries. Everything we do will impinge on our capacity to rise or fall relative to other countries in terms of production and, through production, to provide a good living for our people.  It is important the Government understands that.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise that as part of the global community we face fundamental choices. As I pointed out when I congratulated the Taoiseach on his appointment, there are 450 million more people on earth than there were at the time of the 1992 election.  By the end of the natural term of a Dáil there will be a similar increase in population.  That trend will continue well into the beginning of the next century.  Growth in population will be a major challenge in terms of public health and the protection of the environment.  We have seen the effects of growth in world population in the number of refugees seeking refuge here, an issue that arose during the general election campaign.  In that phenomenon we see evidence of the pressure of the world's population on the limited resources of the earth.  It is important this issue is borne in mind.  The Government should, in its work in the years ahead, bear in mind that we are just a rich small part of a large poor world, a world which faces many severe challenges that we do not experience in our daily lives.  As is the case in the management of our society, it is important we act in a caring way <i>vis-à-vis</i> the wider world and exercise our responsibilities fully.</P>
    <P>I will address some of the changes announced by the Taoiseach.  A number of matters are not easily explicable.  The Taoiseach announced, for <Col N="69" /> example, that the Department of Health will become the Department of Health and Children. He also intends to establish a separate Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. In other words, he intends to separate responsibility for the family from responsibility for children. I cannot understand the concept of separating responsibility for children from responsibility for the family.  It does not appear to have been thought out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is due to Deputy Harney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is foolish to separate responsibility for children from responsibility for the family.</P>
      <P>We seem to be engaged in a cosmetic activity, in so far as we are simply adding titles to Departments without including substance in the titles. What additional responsibilities is the Minister for Social Welfare being given to enable him to have responsibility for family affairs in a meaningful way?  That has not been outlined.  Why is responsibility for children separate?</P>
      <P>We are told the Minister for Social Welfare will be responsible for social, community and family affairs, but the most important contribution the State makes to community development is through the local development scheme which was pioneered by my predecessor and which I continued. Although the Minister for Social Welfare will now also be Minister for community affairs, responsibility for local development has been transferred to the Minister for Tourism.  Where is the sense in making the Minister for Social Welfare responsible for community affairs if local development is transferred to a different Minister? This change also does not appear to have been thought out.</P>
      <P>The decision to rechristen the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications as the Department of Public Enterprise is equally difficult to understand.  The function of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is to provide transport and communications for consumers.  The orientation of the Department should be on consumers of the services provided and not the legal format of the services.  By christening it the Department of Public Enterprise it appears the Government is more concerned with who owns the services rather than their quality or whether they meet their purpose.</P>
      <P>The title of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications was cumbersome but at least it told us what the Department was supposed to do, which was to provide transport, energy and communications.  All we will know in the future is that the Department deals with public enterprise.  What does that mean to people other than those employed in it?</P>

      <P>It does not have a meaning in terms of consumers who are supposed to be the object of its work.  The approach adopted to the services under the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications should be to bring them closer to consumers.  The rechristening of the Department appears to focus on issues of ownership rather than services to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a mistake which derives from lack of thought.  One might say that is entirely justifiable because the Taoiseach had only two hours between his appointment and the announcement of the Ministries.  However, that is not the case because the Taoiseach anticipated his office for the last two and a half years.  He had that time to prepare and if he had thought more about the matter, he would have come up with more meaningful allocations of responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Another matter is serious in terms of the functioning of the Cabinet.  The Minister for Defence, who is a full Cabinet member, will be junior to the Minister for Foreign Affairs with regard to European affairs.  I am not aware of any case in the past where a full Cabinet member was in effect subordinate to another Minister.  The basis of Government by Cabinet has been equality of the Ministers involved. However, the proposal is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be the boss of another Minister at the Cabinet table with regard to most of his responsibilities.  Deputy Burke will be Deputy Andrews' boss with regard to European affairs while supposedly equal to him in other matters of Cabinet deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is no reflection on the personalities involved.  Their positions could be interchangeable and I am not commenting on either individual.  Each is capable of being equal or superior to the other; they are both qualified to hold any office.  However, the Taoiseach has made a serious mistake by creating such a position within the Cabinet.  Given the nature of Cabinet decision making, it should operate by consensus. However, two Ministers will be sitting at the table and one will be superior to the other although they are supposedly equal in terms of Cabinet decision making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a fundamental error in Cabinet construction and it will have serious consequences.  It is a grave mistake on the Taoiseach's part and he should not have done it.  He has displayed inexperience which he should not have displayed.  It is surprising given his background of considerable ministerial experience in the past.  It was not a good move but I will not dwell on it in the future. Perhaps it will work but I doubt it.  The evidence <Col N="71" /> of that will be more at the Cabinet table than outside.  It is not a good idea to have Ministers at Cabinet who are not equal to each other.  The Taoiseach's decision has created inequality in the Cabinet between two individuals where one will be the boss of the other for part of his work.  That is a mistake.</P>
    <P>Having made those points about the make up of the Government, I congratulate all those involved.  I wish them well in their work.  They will be the subject of vigilant scrutiny from this side and particularly the Fine Gael Party, which has been reinvigorated by a substantial number of new Deputies.  Unlike the parties going into office, whose votes either stagnated or fell away the Fine Gael Party's vote rose.  Its confidence has also risen and its vigilance and ability will also increase.</P>

He played to his strengths throughout the campaign and has also worked very hard for many years since 1977 even though I note he gets credit for having done many things before 1977 also.</P>
      <P>I congratulate all the Members who have been returned to this House.  I wish all the new Members well for whatever number of months we are together.  I pay tribute to some of the Deputies who lost out in the election.  Politics is a very difficult business and I have lost a number of very close colleagues and friends.  I record my appreciation of their work over the past four years.  Many hardworking Deputies were not returned after the election and in some cases Ministers and Ministers of State lost their seats.  I record my thanks for their outstanding service. They all work very hard on behalf of the Labour Party and on behalf of the people they represent. I look forward to the day when they will have an opportunity to return to this House.  There are many Members here today who have not been here for years and who have been returned by reason of their interest in their communities and their continuing work for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I offer my genuine congratulations to each Member of the new Cabinet.  I am pleased to see there are three women in it and I applaud that decision.  I wish each of them every success.  The new Members of Cabinet are people of high calibre who are taking on an enormous challenge at an interesting time.  I am sure they will all bring their considerable talents to bear on the jobs they have been given.  The Labour Party intends to <Col N="72" /> provide strong and effective opposition as that is our function.  It is the oldest democratic party in the State and it has a proud and independent tradition. There have been times in the history of the House when the Labour Party provided Opposition on its own &mdash; and I am not talking about recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has never seen any shame or disgrace in performing the work of Opposition and we look forward to marking the Government day in and day out.  I promise the Taoiseach that our opposition will be vigilant, total and constructive and that it will be based on policy and principle not on personalities or name calling.  We will harry and pursue the Government over economic and social policy and we will demand and expect the highest standards of accountability from it.  We intend to ensure the Government keeps its promises and carries on the work of building an inclusive and tolerant society.  We will attack lip-service but we will frankly acknowledge achievement.</P>
      <P>The composition of the Cabinet is lacking in thought and imagination.  As Deputy Bruton said, the Taoiseach had quite some time to prepare for this but he has, by and large, selected people who gave many hostages to fortune when in Opposition. They will come back to haunt them.  They will require careful and detailed scrutiny in the light of their explicit record and everything they said over the past two and a half years.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is deliberate or otherwise but in the composition of the Cabinet the Taoiseach has ignored many parts of the country such as the south-east of Ireland; north and south County Tipperary and Limerick city and county have been completely neglected.  The entire North West is hardly represented at all in the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDaid is so far north and west one would almost miss him but I congratulate him on his appointment.  The programme for Government places a heavy emphasis on inclusion and social disadvantage and that is proper. I am disappointed there will not be a Department of Equality and Law Reform.  I acknowledge what the Taoiseach said about former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, but neither fine words nor cosmetic exercises can disguise the fact that the cause of people with disability is being regressed.  I regret this decision.  Many groups on the margins of society who received recognition over the past four years will see this as a set back. The Government will regret the decision to abolish the Department and I do not know how it will reassure people with disability.  I have great respect for Deputy John O'Donoghue, a colleague from the same county, but I do not see how issues of equality fit in with his priorities in <Col N="73" /> the Department of Justice.  It is a fundamental mistake that should be reconsidered.  We have given those on the margins of society a voice over the past number of years and that is now being taken away.  People with disabilities are not sick and do not need to be represented by a Minister of State at the Department of Health.  They have been discriminated against in the past and will never be adequately represented by the Department of Justice in its present format.  I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider this matter.</P>
      <P>Society has built barriers against those with disabilities. Much work has been done in empowering them to tear down those barriers and most Members are genuine supporters of our efforts over the past number of years.  However, that empowerment has now been weakened and I regret one more barrier has been created.  The Taoiseach's silence on the equal status and employment equality legislation is an indication that those who have suffered discrimination in the past must now wait a long time for redress.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy de Valera on her elevation to high office.  The Taoiseach has graciously acknowledged the success of my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  However, I am worried that the cultural industries to which we have given much stimulus in recent years, will lose out in the proposed format.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will have an opportunity to explain the change in that Department.  For example, where will responsibility for broadcasting lie?</P>
      <P>One decision, referred to by Deputy Bruton, astounds me.  My comments on it do not reflect on Deputies Burke or Andrews, both strong willed and able politicians.  Will the Taoiseach inform us whether he intends introducing legislation, because I do not believe it is constitutionally possible to have one Minister subordinate to another?  This will not work.  I do not have access to the ministers and secretaries legislation of 1924 but I will have before the first Question Time. The proposed structure poses a legislative problem and it will be necessary to introduce legislation if Deputy Andrews as Minister for Defence is to operate within the Department of Foreign Affairs in a subordinate role to Deputy Burke as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I think it is illegal under the present legislative framework and will require an amendment to the ministers and secretaries legislation.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will inform the House if this is what he has in mind. Members of Cabinet are collectively responsible. Departments of State are given special functions in law which are vested in the Minister as head of the Department.  When the row takes place in that gracious building on St. Stephen's Green, I hope the Minister for Defence does not decide to bring all his tanks with him to convince the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a point.  This will pose a serious constitutional problem if proceeded with because functions given under the ministers and secretaries legislation cannot be carried out under the direction of two different Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach wishes to create a Department <Col N="74" /> of European Affairs, then responsibility must be assigned to the Minister in charge of that Department. Perhaps Deputies Andrews and Burke will work this out between themselves in their inimitable style.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In analysing the promises made by the Government, I am struck by the vagueness of most of them as expressed in its programme.  I am particularly struck by the section purporting to outline the seven key concerns of the people. Jobs and employment do not merit a separate heading and are hardly mentioned throughout the document.  One has to wonder about a Government which regards reductions in the top rate of tax as being of more importance than the continuing crisis of unemployment which affects far too many families in our community.</P>
      <P>I wondered whether the vagueness in many parts of the document was designed to conceal a more fundamental intention.  I will mention one example which the Taoiseach may like to explain. The programme for government makes the following, innocuously expressed commitment: &ldquo;the utilisation of the tax system, including capital taxes, to encourage entrepreneurship&rdquo;.  What does this mean?  The Taoiseach will be well aware &mdash; although I am not sure Deputy Harney is &mdash; that a small group of wealthy individuals, one of whom is the proprietor of a near-monopoly of the media industry, has in the past used its political access to try to secure a cash ceiling on the amount of capital acquisitions tax payable by an individual.  A case was made to me that such an idea would attract wealthy foreign entrepreneurs to live in Ireland and encourage home-grown entrepreneurs to spend their declining years here, with untold and unspecified advantages for the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Ever since I rejected that proposal I have had the uneasy feeling that I may have lost friends in a section of the media.  Perhaps the Taoiseach may wish to elaborate but I can find no parallel references to this commitment in the election manifestos of either Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats and there is no explanation of what it might be intended to mean.  No doubt we can return to this subject during Question Time if the Taoiseach does not want to clarify it before the end of the debate.</P>
      <P>The Government will be judged on the degree to which it has protected and embellished the fabric it has been given.  I do not say that in a grudging way but it is necessary to speak briefly about some of the crucial issues which lie ahead and for which the Government has inherited a sound foundation on which to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Northern Ireland the previous Government carried through the work of peace building in every way possible &mdash; Deputy Harney was kind enough to pay a tribute this afternoon &mdash; but it remains a task unfinished.  Only one organisation is to blame for any lack of progress, the IRA. <Col N="75" /> When the new Government takes office it will find a team of public servants, the best in the world, ready to assist in the work of peace building; a set of documents containing the outline of a fair and lasting settlement of the problem; ground rules laid down and broadly agreed for the conduct of negotiations; solutions already broadly agreed for the intractable problem of decommissioning; strong and supportive international relationships; an Anglo-Irish relationship which is as good as it could possibly be, with a British Government committed to progress, and an IRA which still lacks the vision and foresight to allow its political wing to join the negotiations.</P>
    <P>As one who, throughout my political career, has worked for the most inclusive process possible, I urge the Government not to give up on inclusion but never to allow a veto to the IRA. It can never be allowed to bomb its way to the negotiating table.  It is the IRA and no one else who prevents Sinn Féin and the people it represents from taking part in negotiations.  Having regard to the broad support given to us, I confidently call on the Government never to give in to the bomb and bullet or the threat of violence in the peace process.  It must immediately get involved in the work of peace building and do so without fear or favour.  It may well find, as some of us have, that its efforts are not appreciated by some on the Unionist side of the debate.  That ought not to matter; no one has a veto on reasonable progress and no one will if the Government is sufficiently resolute and its actions are dictated by established principles.  One of those principles is that no settlement can last if the process excludes any significant element of the community. For that reason I hope the Government will be given the opportunity of an IRA ceasefire, which will enable Sinn Féin to enter the process for good.  If there is any assistance which I, my party and other colleagues in the former Government can give, it will be given and it will be constructive.</P>
    <P>The next issue is the economy and the various promises made by the incoming Government.  It cannot do what it has promised over recent months and it must have known that when drawing up the programme for government.  It will have choices to make and they will not be easy. It has an obligation to this House to say as soon as possible whether it will choose greed or inclusion and in what areas of public spending it will make cuts to meet the targets set by Deputy McCreevy in his radio interview last Sunday.  If I see the slightest sign of a return to the days when education, health and housing services bore the brunt of all cutbacks, we will fight the Government every step of the way in this House.  There is no doubt that the Government will have to make these choices if it is to honour the excessive tax promises it has made, and it will meet stern opposition.  If the Government implements the tax package it has agreed it will skew almost all benefits towards the better off and widen the gap <Col N="76" /> between families on low and moderate incomes and those on higher incomes.  There is simply no case for going as far and as fast as the Government proposes and even less a case for making those who depend on State services bear the cost of those promises.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government talks about making an all out assault on disadvantage.  I do not doubt the sincerity of those intentions. However, many of the elements in that programme will have the opposite effect.  I urge a major rethink before the budget in the autumn.</P>
    <P>One could talk for a long time on an occasion such as this about issues and personalities.  I do not intend to do so because this is, by and large, an occasion of congratulations.  The Government has won the election and the honour is its.  On behalf of everybody I again congratulate them, their families and those who support and work with them.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has to rebuild and regain its strength but we will provide vigilant and strong opposition.  We will dedicate ourselves to those tasks.  I look forward to fighting the next election on a modern, independent platform.</P>
    <P>The interests of our community and economy depend on stable Government.  They also depend on a Government which has clear priorities and genuinely places the interests of people before politics &mdash; now is the time for this Government to prove that was more than an election slogan.  I wish the Taoiseach and his Cabinet well.  I look forward to getting answers in the days and weeks ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in congratulating the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and in acknowledging that his success is well earned.  In the interests of the country, I wish him every success. I also congratulate each Minister in the new Cabinet, even if they are members of a fairly rickety coalition.  Nonetheless, each of them deserves our congratulations and best wishes.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak about the structural changes which the Taoiseach has announced he intends to implement.  It makes sense to bring trade back into the Department of Enterprise and Employment. Trade was always intended to be part of that Department and it makes much more coherent sense to include it there.  However, I have much greater difficulties with the other proposed structural changes.</P>
      <P>The removal of science and technology to the Department of Education is a regressive step. There was a Department of Education and Science across the water for many years but it was found that, since science and technology is the driving force of any modern economy at the leading edge of industrial development, it ought to be connected to the Department of Enterprise and Employment rather than the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would make much more sense to transfer the old Department of Labour into the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The Taoiseach has <Col N="77" /> made a great mistake in effectively downgrading and abolishing the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  It is not the case, as he stated in his speech, that law reform is driven by law enforcement and that that Department should be part of the Department of Justice.  With the ultimate respect to the Department of Justice, I do not think it has been characterised over the years by a wish to modernise the law.</P>
    <P>There is an affinity between the Department of Equality and Law Reform and the old Department of Labour.  It would have made a great deal more sense to amalgamate those Departments rather than rhetorically promising to upgrade the value of science and technology but, in effect, having it play the poor relation to the Department of Education, which I have no doubt will be the case.  The Taoiseach advocates closer contact between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Education for this purpose but I do not believe that will happen in practice.  I note that responsibility for industrial research carried out by Forbairt has been left with the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  That has not been well thought out and ought to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>I notice the same conflict Deputy John Bruton has identified between the new Department for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Health regarding responsibility for children.  I commend the Taoiseach on his choice of somebody with the sensitive touch of Deputy Cowen to bear responsibility for the children of the nation.  With his deft touch, no doubt they will be in safe hands but it does not make sense and cannot be reconciled with the role of the Department for which Deputy Dermot Ahern will be responsible.</P>
    <P>If it is not churlish of me to say so, I notice there was no mention in the Taoiseach's announcement of ministerial appointments of the role promised for Deputy Albert Reynolds. Deputy Reynolds himself appeared to be of the impression that that role would be included in the Cabinet, but obviously we shall have to await another day before hearing that announcement.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed that the Taoiseach has opted to combine agriculture and food within the one portfolio.  Following all the debates on food controversies, on the health and safety of consumers, I had hoped there would be a commitment by this Government to examine the question of restoring food, one of our most significant industries, to the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Why should the food industry be different from any other?  It is very significant and, I submit, proper to the Department of Enterprise and Employment rather than to the Department of Agriculture.  The farming organisations now acknowledge that, while we may produce the best quality food product in Europe, if consumers vote with their feet, that is a matter of considerable concern to producers.  The appropriate way to deal with that is to remove food from the Department of Agriculture and relocate <Col N="78" /> it in the Department of Enterprise and Employment. That would ensure the continuation of the moves initiated by the outgoing Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, in terms of the statutory Food Safety Authority and go a very long way to restoring confidence in a major industry and the safety of its produce.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting that Deputy Molloy can adequately fill the seat he now occupies but I will give him my full support in endeavouring to do the best he can with it.</P>
      <P>No incoming Government in the history of this State has inherited from its immediate predecessor a country or economy in the condition of that being handed over today.  There has been and continues to be unprecedented economic growth and historically low interest rates that have attracted investment and led to very low mortgage repayments.  Forced emigration is a thing of the past.  Annually an additional 50,000 of our people are at work and paying tax.  That is a legacy no other Government has inherited. Notwithstanding the propitious economic circumstances about which I have spoken, I do not know whether this particularly rickety coalition Government will, as the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, prophesied, lead this country into the new millennium.  I do not believe it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two parties that set out as an alliance of convenience &mdash; there was no other alliance available prior to the general election &mdash; an alliance between the largest party in the State and a party of a very different political character, have ended up as an alliance of grossly unequals.  It seems the Progressive Democrat Party is the wren on the tail of the Fianna Fáil eagle, an eagle that is soaring high on a wind of transfers that were unreciprocated in the recent general election.  For parties that lectured the people about how unstable would be an arrangement whereby the outgoing rainbow coalition Government was dependent on a gaggle of Independents, they have ended up in precisely that arrangement.  Why would such an arrangement be unstable for the outgoing coalition Government but stable for this combination <Col N="79" /> of parties?  Considering the cohesive and stable reputation of the outgoing Government as distinct from the very unhappy history of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, and their inability to coexist, this is a very tentative arrangement indeed.</P>
    <P>I suggest that Kilgarvan and Kilcoole will have more influence in this Government than will the Progressive Democrats, and in the interests of the country one must ask whether that is healthy.  I am very pleased the people of Kilcoole will get their second level school, and if I am sceptical about the Taoiseach's capacity to deliver longer summers in Kilgarvan and South Kerry, one can imagine the discomfiture of the Progressive Democrats.  The ability of the Taoiseach to deliver longer evenings in Kerry is certainly not a recipe for stable, strong Government committed to fiscal rectitude, as promised by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats during the election campaign.</P>
    <P>This is a most unlikely coalition comprising Fianna Fáil and a faction of Fianna Fáil that broke away in disgust and frustration with the party some years ago on fundamental issues of low standards in high places and playing politics with Northern Ireland.  The new Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, assures us that all has changed, and perhaps it has, but what is the <i>raison d'e tre</i> of the Progressive Democrats?  If there are no real policy distinctions with Fianna Fáil, why remain outside the fold?  The departure of Michael McDowell, one of the most able Deputies ever elected to this House, has deprived the party of the ideological drive and cutting edge that was the Progressive Democrats.  The ground is probably being assiduously prepared to monitor the reentry of the Progressive Democrats to Fianna Fáil and to join with those who would in other circumstances stand by the Republic.</P>
    <P>There is no sign in the new Government's programme of fundamental Progressive Democrats policy positions.  For example, none of the fundamental issues of difference enunciated during the election campaign, such as EMU privatisation, cuts in the public service and Northern Ireland, appears in the programme.  Nor is there any trace of a commitment to implement the anti-poverty strategy devised by the former Minister of Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa.  There are many omissions and several contradictions in the programme.  As Deputy Bruton and Deputy Spring said, how is it possible to reconcile tax cuts for the best off in society with a rhetorical commitment to an inclusive society?  It appears social equity will be abandoned in favour of pay back time for the better off.  It is unfortunate the direction of the major programme of equitable integrated tax and social welfare system reform initiated by the outgoing Government is to be abandoned and replaced with a set of promises that will benefit only the better off.  Nor is it possible to reconcile the new Administration's commitment to zero tolerance with its parallel pledge <Col N="80" /> in respect of drug courts.  The two policies are again opposites, one illiberal and the other liberal. One must ask which approach will win through?  I suspect that neither will do so.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that Deputy O'Donoghue has been appointed as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is not often that someone from, as Deputy Healy-Rae stated, a constituency as neglected as Kerry South obtains a senior Cabinet ministry.  There must be other reasons that the Taoiseach recognised Deputy O'Donoghue's inherent qualities to appoint him to that position.  However, the Deputy has left a terrible legacy in Kerry South.  I listened in amazement earlier as Deputy Healy-Rae listed the defects and handicaps under which people in that constituency have laboured for so long.  I have no doubt that, following Deputy Healy-Rae's election to the House, we will see tremendous improvements in Kerry South.  I am happy about that and I propose to visit the area in the near future.</P>

      <P>I wish the Taoiseach well in his new role.  I know he has anticipated entering office for some time.  To anyone who is working towards a goal, one cannot but say that he has gained his just deserts.  I wish the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, every success.  For the good of this country, their respective parties must form a co-operative Government that will listen to the people and introduce long overdue measures, some of which are contained in the Government's programme but others are sadly lacking.  I thank the outgoing Government and I wish Deputy John Bruton well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cabinet revealed to the House contains Members with a track record in different ministries in addition to some new faces.  Noting what was said by previous speakers, it is certain that there must be clarification with regard to the intentions of the new Government in areas of great concern to the House and the party I represent, the Green Party.  It is good that the Department of Social Welfare will have a role in community affairs.  However, it displays a rather shallow view of community development when community affairs are seen as primarily a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.  The Green Party would argue that a Department should be established to deal solely with community affairs because the role of community life here has been relegated for a long period.  The Department of the Environment, to which the Taoiseach sought to make particular reference in respect of the <Col N="81" /> Green Party, if it were to be given its proper name should be called the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>There is a need to clarify the role of An Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta maidir leis na hoileáin.  Does the Taoiseach expect that the Irish language will recede further into the Atlantic ocean?  Is that why na hoileáin are being singled out as areas where the language will remain?  I remind him that many areas in Dublin are as vibrant, if not more so, than many of the Gaeltacht areas and na hoileáin.  The people of na hoileáin would acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>After all the scandals related to food and despite the often repeated advice about the mistake of giving the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry responsibility for food matters, it is unfortunate that the arrangement is to continue.  There was an opportunity to place responsibility for food matters with a Department which does not have its agenda dictated by the vested interests of the producers, whether that was good or bad in terms of public confidence which has repercussions for all given the importance of the food industry.  I hope this matter will be addressed because public confidence in food products and public health will not be served in the long term by maintaining the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>I am glad that two Deputies from north Dublin have been nominated as Ministers.  I offer good wishes to Deputy Burke on his nomination as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The task ahead of him is difficult and I look forward to his efforts with regard to Northern Ireland being fruitful. Satisfactory results in that regard have eluded many former Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  I offer support in the search for an end to violence.  We often talk of the terrorism, bombs and the heart-break of bereavement which results from the tragic circumstances in the North, but in the matter of non-violence we often overlook the traditional manner by which we make decisions and take action.  It has a bearing on reaching a solution based on non-violence.</P>
    <P>The culture of majority rule has been played out in this House with a skill learned over many years of parliamentary life.  However, it has failed to produce the result needed for a divided society.  There is a large minority on this side of the House which will be excluded from decision-making during the term of this Dáil.  It is a sad reminder of the ineffectiveness and dangers of the politics of majority rule.  We should examine this matter if we are not to be considered hypocritical in lecturing others on managing their affairs in a non-violent fashion.</P>
    <P>The last few weeks have been stressful and frustrating for the Green Party &mdash; I do not just refer to the long count in Dublin South-East, on the result of which Deputies have different views. I understand Deputy Harney's disappointment but that is the system under which we operate and, as she said, it is one which has provided good results for small parties.  The most frustrating experience, however is other parties' belief that <Col N="82" /> they understand what the Green Party stands for. The Taoiseach referred to the Department of the Environment and the environment policy of Fianna Fáil.  We have read and studied it carefully. It is a document which is unfortunately very short on the integrated policies needed in areas that will ultimately deliver a sustainable economy. Over the past five years since the Earth Summit in Rio De Janeiro in which most parties had a role in Government, there have been many sad environment related problems.  We still need to be reminded of them.  In that time 154 plant species, eight bird species and three fish and amphibian species have been under threat or in danger of extinction here.  Ireland still has the lowest tree cover in Europe.  Because of Sella-field, technetium 99 levels in Balbriggan increased by 500 per cent between 1993 and 1995. Lobsters have 30 times the legal permitted level of radioactive technetium 99.  British Nuclear Fuels intends to release additional waste into the Irish Sea.  Ireland has become the second highest emitter of CO² <i>gas per capita</i> after the Netherlands. Levels of nitrogen oxides, the main contributor to acid rain, have increased by 50 per cent since 1982.  Traffic, the main source of CO2 and nitrogen oxide emissions, has increased drastically. Last year, 109,333 new cars were bought, the highest number ever.  That is unequivocally welcomed all too often by Government spokes-persons. We have allowed a third of our drinking water supply from private group schemes to be contaminated by micro-organisms while 4 per cent of public water supplies is contaminated by faeces.  The Environmental Protection Agency report stated there were too many breaches of fluoride levels in drinking water.  Even in that narrow focus, which is not sufficient, there is a huge problem.</P>
    <P>We still only produce 1 per cent of energy from renewable forms, such as hydro power.  The remaining 99 per cent comes principally from imported fossil fuels, the main contributor to global warming.  If there is to be action, it must be action with understanding because without that action is costly and futile.  To be effective there must be action on tax reform which would see the shift of tax away from income, a view endorsed by Government parties and those in Opposition. However, the concept of taxing polluters and waste still has not been grasped.  Ecological enterprise must be rewarded.  Unfortunately, it is not yet, as evidenced by Ireland's failure to reach recycling targets.  We will have to name the Department of the Environment the Department of Local Government until we begin to see effective action in those areas.</P>
    <P>When talking about long careers in politics it is important to look at them in the context of life on this planet which we are here to judge and deal with, often in a harsh way.  They must be measured against the length of time there has been life on this planet &mdash; ten million years.  This is difficult for anybody in parliamentary life to even contemplate, no matter how long they have <Col N="83" /> been in the Dáil.  If one equates life on this planet to one year, then human activity begins at a quarter to midnight on new year's eve and in the context of life on this planet, the damage has been caused in the length of time it takes to blow out a candle.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Green Party is to ensure that candle is not blown out.  If others are serious they will have to start looking at the root of our problems which are economic ones.  The Green Party will continue to say, until the message gets through, that GNP and GDP are insufficient to measure economic progress and well-being. Priority will have to be given to indicators which measure the quality of life.  Mike Cooley, a systems analyst and industrial philosopher, asked why it is that if we grow our own food and repair our own cars GNP goes down whereas if a pile-up occurs on a motorway, there is carnage, a whole range of cars is destroyed, people are maimed and end up in hospital, probably at the end of long waiting queues, GNP goes up.</P>
    <P>These are the areas which will indicate whether we are prepared to make the changes outlined at Rio, by which the Taoiseach was obviously inspired when he spoke here today.  If these changes need to be made, we need to focus more on sustainable economics which, according to the ESRI, will make us more competitive and create further employment, given the tax reform the Green Party is seeking.</P>
    <P>People should not depend on Dáil Éireann for all the answers.  How one spends the pound in one's pocket will have as much effect on society as decisions taken in this House, as evidenced by the dominance of transnational corporations around the world.  Some 70 per cent of world trade is undertaken by the top 500 companies in the world who are not Irish.  The Green Party is about transforming society and parliamentary life is only part of the process to bring about sustainable life for future generations.</P>

      <P>My party has a number of good candidates whom we will look after first.  I congratulate Deputy Bertie Ahern on his appointment as Taoiseach.  In politics one needs a certain amount of luck to get along.  In his case he has had luck and, as mentioned earlier, he has had much bad luck too but has been able to live and work with it and use it to best advantage.  Above all what we are seeing today in the appointment of Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach is that his hard work has been rewarded.  I do not think any of the 166 Deputies has worked as hard in the past ten or 20 years as Deputy Bertie Ahern.  He assumed leadership of the party when it was going through a difficult period and transformed it in a short time.  We are optimistic about the future and delighted to have the opportunity to go back into Government.  We always looked after the country well and I see no reason it should be any different in the future.  We are entering Government with the Progressive Democrats with Deputy Mary Harney as Tánaiste.  I wish her well.  It was a difficult election for her and the Progressive Democrats are now smaller in number.  Nevertheless, that party has a big responsibility and I wish it well in its efforts.</P>
      <P>I congratulate in particular my county colleague, Deputy Charlie McCreevy.  In recent weeks the media was not sure if he would be given the Finance portfolio but I am glad he has been given this responsibility.  He lectured various Ministers for Finance about where they were going wrong.  He will now have an opportunity to do what he has always told us he would do.  While we have made promises in the programme for Government, difficult decisions will have to be made but with Deputy McCreevy in charge of the Department of Finance we need not worry about the state of the nation's finances.  As Deputy Dukes is aware, a number of projects in south Kildare are in need of immediate attention.  I hope they can be advanced in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>I am delighted Deputy Andrews has been appointed Minister for Defence.  The <Col N="85" /> restructuring of the Defence Forces has created enormous difficulties for soldiers and their families. Action will have to be taken immediately. There is much uncertainty and soldiers and their families are fearful of the changes, many of which have been forced upon them without consultation. The new Minister should sit down with the representative bodies immediately and agree a plan for the restructuring of the Defence Forces. While restructuring is necessary, the matter has been dealt with in a shoddy manner.  This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>The hearing claims currently being processed will have serious financial implications.  Millions of pounds have already been paid out.  I have called for the establishment of a tribunal to deal with the matter.  It is madness to pay out vast sums in legal expenses to the legal eagles.  If soldiers' hearing has been impaired due to the negligence of the State, they should be compensated. I appeal to the new Minister to deal with the matter immediately.</P>
      <P>There has been a smooth transition of power from the previous Administration to the incoming Government and I compliment all those involved.  I wish the Taoiseach, Deputy Harney and the other members of the Cabinet every success. They will need all our help.  Governments tend to ignore the views expressed by the Opposition.

When the Fianna Fáil Members of the Cabinet were Front Bench Opposition spokes-persons they worked very hard.  They deserve their appointments and I wish them well.  The success achieved by Fianna Fáil in the general election was due to the work done by them and the visits made by the Taoiseach to all corners of the country.  He visited some constituencies many times in his efforts to reorganise Fianna Fáil and, as can be seen from the general election results, he was very successful.  The Taoiseach visited my constituency shortly after his election as leader of the party.  This was the first of many visits and marked the beginning of the reorganisation of the party.</P>
      <P>It may not be widely known that the Tánaiste is a native of my parish in County Galway.

My late father was first elected to the Dáil in the same year, l948, as Deputy Blaney's late brother Neil.  We do not have the same record of service as the Blaney family but we are getting there.</P>
    <P>On the comments about the way some Departments are organised, I do not understand the criticism of the decision that the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht should also deal with the islands.  During Question Time the former Minister, Deputy Higgins, dealt with issues relating to the islands and the Gaeltacht.  I pay tribute to the former Minister of State, Deputy Carey, for the work he carried out on behalf of people who live on the islands.  I hope the new Minister, Deputy de Valera, is committed to continuing this work.  It is very important that the people who live on islands are not neglected.  It was very encouraging that some of the issues raised by them were responded to by the previous Government.  I hope the new Government will continue this work.  I recently received an invitation to visit Kilrush and the Aran Islands next weekend to see the renaming of new ferries.  This is a very positive development and I would like to see similar developments on all islands.  The former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, and the former Minister of State, Deputy Carey, worked hard to ensure that people who live on the islands were not discriminated against.  It is only logical that the incoming Government should continue this work and that the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht should deal with the islands.</P>

      <P>It is logical that science and technology should be linked to the Department of Education.  As the father of a leaving certificate student, I am interested in the type of courses being offered students.  The holding of the election prior to the leaving certificate examination was of help to the parents of students.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, referred to the creation of a new Department, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  That is a welcome move.  As the Taoiseach said, many recent successes in the sports area have given us an international profile which, in turn, helped to promote our tourism industry.  Not long before the election we were celebrating Ken Doherty's success in snooker, and recently we have seen the success of our under 21 soccer team.  These successes in sport will promote tourism but they are important in their own right, as are the successes we had in the past in the areas of arts and culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's debate has been constructive and relevant to the handover of Government from three parties to two.  It says a great deal for the proceedings of this House that this has been done without any of the bitterness which attended the <Col N="87" /> breakdown of the Government in 1994.  I hope we will continue to be positive in the future and that this Government, with the action programme it has published, will have a successful term in office.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Bertie Ahern on his election as Taoiseach in charge of the 28th Dáil.  It is a happy day for him as he has achieved something he almost achieved two and a half years ago.  It is a happy day also for his family, relatives and friends who, I am sure, will enjoy the celebrations, perhaps even more than the Taoiseach who must immediately immerse himself in the job.  I am sure the celebrations will continue long into the summer.</P>
      <P>I regret my party leader, Deputy John Bruton is not Taoiseach, but as somebody who comes from north of the Liffey, I am glad the incumbent comes from that area.  That is good for Dublin and for the area north of the Liffey.  I hope that trend will continue; who knows what life has to offer?</P>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach well in a difficult job but it is a great honour for him.  He has announced his Cabinet and I congratulate all the new Ministers. The word &ldquo;new&rdquo; may not be appropriate in some cases because the people concerned have been Ministers.  To those returning to Government and those who are coming into Government for the first time, I wish them well.</P>
      <P>The day one goes into Government is very exciting and two and a half years have not diminished my memory of becoming a Minister.  I am now battered and bruised with welts and scars from the two and a half years I spent in the Department of Justice but it was a great honour to represent this country.  Despite the difficult times I endured I was glad to have been given the honour of being a Minister, particularly Minister for Justice.  I hope those who are prepared to examine my record during the past two and a half years in Justice and of this Government will see that much has been done.</P>
      <P>When the Dáil dissolved some weeks ago the then Government was very well regarded by the people.  That sense of satisfaction was reiterated during the campaign to the point where the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste came out on top in the televised debates.  However, the electorate has spoken, the dust has settled and Deputy Ahern is now Taoiseach, with the help of some Independents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I listened this afternoon to Deputy Mildred Fox outline her reason for supporting the election of Deputy Ahern as Taoiseach I was reminded of the song from &ldquo;The Mikado&rdquo; about having a little list, none of which will be missed.  Deputy Fox must have felt sick when she heard Deputy Healy-Rae's much longer list of what he had achieved, despite saying on the lunch time news, in what was perhaps his only moment of coyness, that he would not tell anybody what he had got, that the people of south Kerry would know.  My <Col N="88" /> family came from south Kerry and I hope what Deputy Healy-Rae has brought to south Kerry will benefit the members of my family who still live there.  I suppose the Minister, Deputy John O'Donoghue, will be able to call on the Deputy's help whenever he runs into difficulty with the Minister for Finance and cannot get the money for his portfolio; Deputy Healy-Rae might lend him some of the money he has been promised for the roads, the fishermen and tourism.  It sounded as if he wanted the many hours of daylight enjoyed by the people living in Norway, Sweden or Iceland &mdash; at certain times of the year there is no night in Iceland &mdash; to be a feature of life in south Kerry and so extend the tourist season there.</P>
    <P>The lists of the Independent Deputies who have indicated their support for the Taoiseach today came as a surprise not only to those who are now in Opposition but to those who are in Government.  When they saw one or two Deputies getting all the goodies they must have wondered what would be left for them.  The other Deputies in the constituencies of Wicklow and Kerry South should get behind those two Deputies and claim in advance all the things that have been promised so that they can get a piece of the action.  We will wait to see just how much is delivered to the Independent Deputies.</P>
    <P>Faces have changed here, and we have changed places, but what matters is that the good work which has been done over the past two and a half years should continue.  The work towards an inclusive society will, I hope, be continued by the incoming Government.  That policy underpinned everything we did, no matter which Department was involved.  Two strands of the outgoing Government's policy, which are aspects of the same central issue, were economic security and tackling crime.  We have a budget surplus and can afford to choose how to spend that money.  Do we want to see reductions in the numbers of gardaí, nurses, teachers and employees in other public service areas?  I do not believe we do.  The farcical proposal during the election campaign, which was dropped as the day of the election drew near, to lay off 25,000 public servants, was a public insult to the thousands of people who a provide good service to the State.</P>
    <P>What we need is a fair distribution of the benefits of our economic success and, at the same time, a guarantee of financial control.  That is what the Government led by Deputy John Bruton was delivering.  We heard a great deal of rhetoric in recent weeks from Fianna Fáil and from the party described by my party colleague, Deputy Noonan, as the mudguard on the Fianna Fáil bike.  Despite all this, this House should call for this inclusive economic progress to continue. I agree that, during an election campaign, the taxation debates may not be as clear or as subtle as they will be when a party is in Government. However, the race is over and we must acknowledge what independent economists said about the taxation policies of the two groupings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> A reduction in the taxation rates would benefit those who are already better off while widening the allowances and the bands spreads the benefits more evenly.  We have a choice.  The incoming Government should consider what independent economists have said to ensure our tax policy does not help the better off and the well off and exclude those on middle and low incomes.  It has time to do that before the November budget.</P>
    <P>We need to give Ireland its greatest economic security &mdash; a strong currency.  That was one of the themes of our EU Presidency.  No Government can afford the luxury of openly questioning its currency policy as if its members were chatting on bar stools or around the fireside.  It is not a matter of which is the right or wrong course. Indecisiveness in itself is a problem.  Money has been invested in this country because of the expectation that we will enter economic and monetary union and, if the doubt cast during the election campaign continues, we will face severe difficulties. As night follows day, it would push up interest rates and we would be back in the earlier vicious circle.  The Government &mdash; particularly the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Harney &mdash; should forget its inde-cisiveness about entry into EMU and unambiguously commit Ireland to this great step forward which will be good for the country.</P>
    <P>If crime levels continue to increase inexorably many will be unable to enjoy the benefits of our economic growth.  The House should turn its back on sloganising which gets in the way of real debate.  Prior to the election we witnessed the meaninglessness of what Fianna Fáil referred to as zero tolerance.  To Deputy O'Dea it means hanging plaques around people's necks stating &ldquo;I am a criminal&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am a drug addict&rdquo; or &ldquo;I stole twopence&rdquo;.  That gets in the way of serious debate.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, will be watched carefully by me and others on the Opposition benches in view of all he said as Opposition spokesperson on Justice.  I promise he will have a difficult time.  I also promise that if he is constructive and helpful in the fight against crime I &mdash; or whoever is Justice spokesperson for our party &mdash; will act likewise.  What matters is that the thorough reform of our criminal justice system that started only two and a half years ago is maintained at the brisk pace set by our Government. If the Government maintains that pace Fine Gael will play a constructive role in the process. However, if it returns to the days of inertia which existed in the eight or nine years Fianna Fáil had charge of that Department, we will vigorously oppose it.  A great deal has been done in the past two and a half years and at times the then Opposition supported our moves.</P>
    <P>It is a year since the appalling murders of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin and many who were involved in criminal activity at that time are now on the run.  The reaction of the Opposition at that time was to foolishly call for a state of emergency.  In the past two and a half years we targeted areas that had <Col N="90" /> previously been neglected.  Effective action was taken against organised criminals and to deal with the scourge of drugs, but I would be foolish to claim that everything has been done.  I urge the Taoiseach to continue that work and not to allow things to slip again.  Many measures are in place. The Taoiseach will have the advantage of being able to fill most of the 800 prison places which are almost ready.  He will have the advantage of the legislation I put through this House.  I hope the Taoiseach will see them as advantages and continue the work that has started.</P>
    <P>It is time we dealt with the crime issue in a more unilateral and non-divisive manner.  There was much divisiveness and headline-grabbing in the past two and a half years with some Members saying, &ldquo;I am tougher than you.&rdquo; That is not good enough and is not the way to get answers to our crime problem.</P>
    <P>The outgoing Government adopted multifaceted policies.  It is not enough just to build prisons and introduce tough legislation.  We must tackle the problems in areas from which many people who occupy our jails come, by providing the probation and welfare services and drug addiction clinics that will make a difference to their lives.  If not the problems will grow and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue will face them in the coming years.  I hope history will record the work I carried out as Minister, and that of the outgoing Government, as the turning point in tackling our crime problems and dealing with the disadvantaged and marginalised in our society.  The ambition to have a job was taken from them perhaps as a result of them dropping out of school early.</P>
    <P>I do not think &mdash; I may be proved wrong &mdash; some of the changes the Taoiseach made in Departments will do anything for the marginalised communities.  I do not understand how the Minister for Health and Children will sit across the Cabinet table from the Minister for Social Welfare who now has responsibility for &ldquo;social, community and family&rdquo; affairs.  That change represents expanding the title without any thought as to how the portfolios will deliver services or bring about a sharing of our economic benefits among all our people equally.  This is what we want to see and the Government has an opportunity to do something about it.  It is taking charge of a very fine country and it will be judged on how it continues the good work of the past two and a half years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Ahern on taking office today.  If I may say so without appearing to be other than what Deputy Ahern knows me to be &mdash; an implacable enemy of Fianna Fáil &mdash; I would like to compliment him on his acceptance speech.  I have great hope as a result of the way he approached that.  He showed a very deep understanding and care for the function he has taken on and I wish him well with it. As a citizen, I hope this Government continues in office for the full constitutional and statutory period.  As a politician, I doubt it will.  I am not sure where to come down between the two.  For the 3.5 million of us living in the Republic, I hope the former is true.</P>
      <P>I wish to offer a small piece of well meaning advice to the Taoiseach.  He has displayed through his political career an impressive capacity to mediate and resolve problems.  I caution him, however, not to do so always in the same way as he has done up to now, which is by using somebody else's money, usually the taxpayers'.  That is a bad way of doing it.  I hope he finds a way of using that talent to mediate and resolve without it costing the rest of us money.  That is a major part of the obligation he now has.</P>
      <P>One of his predecessors was also known as a problem solver.  There was a famous case where we found people were employed in jobs at the public expense, which the rest of us did not know about for quite some time afterwards.  It created problems in industrial relations which the current Taoiseach had to resolve later.</P>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach well because I know he is a person of conviction and goodwill.  He is somebody who likes to have peace and happiness all around him.  I wish him well all the more because I was struck today by the demeanour of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney.  The Tánaiste looked to me like someone who had received the worst news of her life and I wondered why that was.  I feel it may be because she is rather shocked and I can understand why.  She now finds herself in Government, completely against the run of play, having lost a huge part of her parliamentary party and apparently still under the threat that, if I may say so, de Valera rides again.  I am not at all sure that the Taoiseach and his party have given up the idea of trying to abolish the proportional representation system, which they tried to do a couple of times in the past.</P>
      <P>At one stage this afternoon Deputy Harney and her party colleagues were trying to say that this has gone out of the Government programme. They are not sure how they feel about it, however, because they did not do well under the current system of proportional representation.  I caution the Tánaiste against giving too much reign to that feeling of disenchantment with an electoral system that has seen her party being mauled in this election.  The electoral system is not at fault.  People did not like what the Progressive Democrats were saying during the election and the Tánaiste and her party have paid the inevitable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> The Tánaiste said something very interesting to me on the last day of the previous Dáil.  She commented: &ldquo;I know Minister Dukes does not like soundbites, but if it can't be said in a soundbite it is not worth saying&rdquo;.  She should reflect on that because the electorate told her that in spades during the election.  She was clobbered by soundbites and she is now a very junior partner in Government because of soundbites.  People decided they did not want to fire 25,000 public servants, or oppress single mothers whose families are too numerous for them to live at home with their parents with another baby they did not expect, and so on.  I hope for the sake of good government, if not for the sake of the parties in government, and for the kind of politics the Progressive Democrats is supposed to stand for &mdash; the party is supposed to be policy driven &mdash; that the Tánaiste has learned the lesson that soundbites are inimical to good politics.  Life is more complicated than a soundbite and I hope she has found that out.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is in charge of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I may be underestimating the extent of her responsibilities because a couple of bits were slipped in by the Taoiseach in his reorganisation of Departments, which was not what I wanted to see.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a few soundbites about trade in the speeches.  I hope the Tánaiste realises that the Department of Enterprise, Employment and Trade amounts to more than soundbites because in the past two and a half years the Department of Enterprise and Employment has been much more than soundbites.  It has meant 120,000 extra jobs.  One does not get extra jobs by having soundbites but by having good, sensible and well thought out economic and fiscal policies. Soundbites are inimical to good government and I hope the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach remember that.  Life is more complicated than a soundbite and the Tánaiste should know that more than anyone else after her experience in the general election.  I hope her party colleagues understand it too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In congratulating the Taoiseach, I also wish him well in his choice of Minister for Finance. It is a position to which I have a longstanding emotional attachment.  I can think of few people to whom I would wish better than the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.  However, he will have a few headaches.  He must now follow up an impressive economic performance.  He must deliver on the most wrong-headed tax policies I have ever seen two parties pursuing in an election.  He must deliver on a continuation of budget surpluses and on the most ill-quantified collection of aspirations, promises, nods, winks, nudges, suggestions, reorientations, redirections and restimulations that I have ever seen in any Government programme.  He must do this at a time when the Tánaiste and her party might find themselves going into a single currency if they can make up <Col N="93" /> their minds on that.  I know the Taoiseach has the right religion, but I am not sure the Tánaiste has adopted this yet.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance must do all these things which are in the Government programme, run a budget surplus, keep inflation down, keep interest rates at their current level and deliver on all these weird and wonderful &ldquo;maybes&rdquo; and &ldquo;supposed to be's&rdquo; in terms of expenditure.  I fear that it will be beyond even the renowned capacity for plausibility of our current Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Where I was reared, in Drimnagh, we had a name for people like the Minister for Finance. We called them &ldquo;plausible jaws&rdquo;.  They could get away with anything because they had words at will.  However, he is much more than that.  He really believes he will deliver on all of these things simultaneously but it will be almost an impossible job.  When it comes to a choice between giving effect to what they say are their tax plans and giving effect to what they say are their expenditure plans, that is, their overall fiscal targets, and these vague promises they have in umpteen areas of expenditure, the Tánaiste should be delighted to hear me strongly urge the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and her to find in favour of fiscal responsibility, of keeping public expenditure within the limits they have set, and not adopt what I fear might be the Taoiseach's inclination, the tendency to resolve all these problems without worrying too much about costs.</P>
    <P>On the appointment of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I know my good friend, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, will agree with me when I, with great personal warmth and sincerity, wish Síle de Valera well in that responsibility.  I am sure she will bring a great deal of wisdom and balance to it.  Without seeking to offend Deputy Michael D. Higgins, I ask the Taoiseach to reflect a little on the range of responsibilities in that Department.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht should not also have to be concerned about wildlife and the ability and freedom of the people to ride horses along the banks of our canals.  The Office of Public Works has taken the most extraordinarily blinkered view of whether we should be permitted to ride horses along our canals.  Only the other day, a good friend told me the Office of Public Works has caused barriers to be erected on the banks of the canal between Monasterevin, County Kildare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>My final point to my successor in what was the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is that the Taoiseach has given the wrong signal in calling it the Department of Public Enterprise.  He said he wanted a Department <Col N="94" /> which would promote competitiveness.  Calling it the Department of Public Enterprise gives the wrong signal because, as the Tánaiste would tell the Taoiseach, it tells people they can get out of it more than they put into it.  Public enterprise should give us, as citizens, more than we put into it.  This name is wrong and I am afraid Deputy O'Rourke will have a difficult problem in dealing with it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and members of the Government every success.  There are one or two points that are appropriate to make on the first night as one wishes the new Government well.  I have had the opportunity of working with some <Col N="95" /> of its Members.  I wish all its Members success in dealing with topics that must be faced immediately. I wish my constituency colleague, Deputy Molloy, well.  He has considerable experience in politics and he is the only Deputy from Galway who will be a member of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his generous reference to my work as the first Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  There is immense significance in the dropping of the term &ldquo;culture&rdquo; from the title of the ministry.  It will now be the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  When the ministry was negotiated and included in a programme for Government for the first time, the significance of culture was that it was the binding force.  Culture was that which spoke about diversity, carried the debate between private art expression and public consumption of it and carried the argument about access.  It was what enabled an argument to be made beyond commerce about broadcasting.  Culture was to be the place where the Irish language was to be launched as something larnach mar bunchloc.  It was in the definition of culture that the Irish language would be placed.</P>
    <P>I was criticised as the first Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht by the Irish language organisations.  With respect to Deputy Dukes, they said that the Department moved from being one with a staff of 70 to 1,700, including those with responsibility for the banks of canals.  I was happy to establish that Department and for it to include the different areas, with the assistance of the person who is now Taoiseach during his time as Minister for Finance, my colleague on the right who succeeded him as Minister for Finance and others.  That was done deliberately to put together a strong and cohesive Department.</P>
    <P>However, the significance of the loss of the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and its binding element raises questions which may be answered in the reply to <Col N="96" /> this debate.  Where lies responsibility for broadcasting or Teilifis na Gaelige now?  Where lies responsibility for spoken Irish outside the Gaeltacht and for the Irish language within culture generally?  Who is responsible for cultural expression outside the country?  Has culture shrunk to cover only those areas funded by the Arts Council?</P>
    <P>In a spirit of generosity on the opening evening of this Dáil, I must say that I had the benefit of listening to Deputy de Valera ask me questions regularly and I congratulate her and wish her well.  She will have my co-operation and enthusiastic support.  I congratulate her on one achievement already, on including a £26 million provision for the Arts Council, which will enable the plan I had said could be achieved over five years to be achieved in three years.  The Minister will have my support for that, but I recall when the first ministry for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and its territory was defined and I know all of the arguments that took place subsequently on the transfer of functions and the definition of what is important.</P>
    <P>Let no one ever say again that the Irish language has been neglected.  It features strongly within our culture, yet the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; has been omitted from the title of the Department.  What will that omission tell us in the days, months and years ahead when there will be many debates?</P>
    <P>I wish everybody forming the new Government well.  I congratulate them on their public service and promise them my co-operation, particularly the Taoiseach who has served in so many different ministries.  I pay tribute to him and his family and wish them well.</P>
