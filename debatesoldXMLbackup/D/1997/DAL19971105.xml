      <P>Before proceeding further I wish to welcome to Dáil Éireann a parliamentary delegation from Singapore who are present in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery.  On my behalf, and on behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann, I extend to you, Mr. Speaker, and your delegation a most sincere welcome to our country. I express the hope that you will find your visit to Ireland interesting, successful and to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific matter of public interest, namely, the crisis in the courts following the decision of a number of District Court judges to dismiss hundreds of court cases yesterday following the recent High Court judgment regarding the validity of the appointment of District Court clerks and the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take immediate action to deal with the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Government's plans for the publication of the Juvenile Justice Bill, which was brought to Committee Stage by the previous Administration?  In preparation for debate on this Bill, will the Taoiseach agree to a debate on the report published today on the level of drug addiction among children and young people which suggests that we have the youngest drug addicts in Europe?  Data on drug addiction in Ireland is deficient in many respects and the House needs to debate this urgently, given the risk that addiction will blight an entire generation of young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is being restored to the Stage it was at before the dissolution of the last Dáil, and should be dealt with speedily.  The EU report regarding drug addiction among young people could be discussed here with the agreement of the Whips or in committee.  I agree with the Deputy that the report's findings are alarming.  It is something we have been aware of for some time. A number of initiatives have been taken in this area such as the action programme on drugs, the various task forces, the community groupings and the action plans.  The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, is dealing with these issues but I would welcome debate on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been a maiden speech, or perhaps Deputies feel oratory coming on.  I can see Deputy O'Dea, the Cicero of the Dáil, is present.  Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a particular problem in that the vast bulk of drug addicts are young males, and that the majority of suicides among young people are also among young males?  There is a particular problem in society with males in their late teens that needs to be addressed not just in terms of the symptoms, such as drug abuse, but also in the context of the social forces causing problems for <Col N="675" /> these young people.  The House needs to address this problem, which could get worse before it gets better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of social exclusion appears from statistical evidence to affect young males particularly.  This is evident from research published on suicide and drug abuse.  Often these people are the victims of modern society.</P>
      <P>The report, which covers a number of years, shows cannabis addiction here is particularly high compared to that in Europe.  A number of mechanisms have been put in place and a considerable amount of resources has been spent on dealing with the problem of drug addiction in the community. Eleven groups, one in Cork and ten in Dublin, have been set up in the past year or so to help attack the problem.  Much, however, remains to be done.  I would welcome the opportunity to debate the report either in committee, perhaps the social and family affairs committee which will be set up shortly, or in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the matter was raised yesterday in the House I understand the Taoiseach has had a discussion with French Prime Minister Jospin. Is he confident there will be an early resolution of the difficult problem in France?  Did he get any assurances from the Prime Minister that the outstanding money due to Irish truck drivers from last year's dispute will be paid at an early date?  If not, will he press the Commission to stop receipts being paid to France so the money owed may be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not spoken to Prime Minister Jospin but have sent a detailed letter outlining our concerns.  We have also been in touch with the Commission and I asked our embassy to highlight the problems.  I am satisfied our concerns, and those of many other countries, have been conveyed to the French Government and a number of other initiatives will be taken today to continue to highlight them.  I hope the talks which commenced today will lead to a satisfactory conclusion.  This is an internal French problem which is affecting other European countries. That is the message we must convey to the French authorities, and one of which I believe they are already aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Taoiseach make an effort to contact Prime Minister Jospin by telephone. The actions of the French are making a mockery of free movement and are causing disruption to Irish business.  The Taoiseach should also raise with the Commission the question of stopping receipts because otherwise I do not believe our truckers and companies will be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certain the Taoiseach will want to express his great relief at the good news that our colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae, has returned to full health and wish him an early <Col N="676" /> return to the House in the event the Government intends to bring forward legislation before Christmas.  I do not know if his regular driver, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has been dispatched with fruit and flowers yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy John Bruton on the latest drugs report, will the Taoiseach agree to a debate within the next week to ten days on this issue given that the committees have not yet been set up?  A proper debate on this important issue could take place on a Thursday.  If the Taoiseach would agree to that now, we could settle the matter this evening at the Whips meeting.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Who am I to come between friends or pretenders?  Given that yesterday the Dáil and Seanad passed amending legislation to plug a major loophole in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, is it proposed to introduce similar legislation to address the problems which have arisen in relation to the issuing of summonses by District Court clerks who have not been properly appointed and which casts a major doubt on convictions already obtained and summonses for cases currently before the courts?</P>

      <P>As I can no longer ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, for your vote I will ask the Taoiseach a question.  The Report and Final Stages of the Taxes Consolidation Bill were taken in the House yesterday.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that, like the previous Government, it is the Government's intention to publish the Bill on CD-ROM so that the entire industry can have access to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the intention but I am not sure of the timescale.  The matter was discussed some time ago and I will ascertain how soon this can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned at the Government's complacent attitude to the pending chaos in regard to the appointment of District Court clerks.  Is the same complacency attached to the court services Bill or can we expect to see it shortly?  The Bill has been published and I would like to know when it will be brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as the High Court made its decision on Friday the Minister acted immediately to reappoint the 185 clerks.  The Courts and Court Officers Bill will be presented to the House shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In putting together committees of the House does the Taoiseach intend to have parliamentary scrutiny of non-commercial executive State agencies?  We have seen from previous cases, such as the one involving the BTSB, the extent to which matters can go wrong.  Is it proposed to have regular parliamentary scrutiny of the many executive agencies which often do very important work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an idea worthy of some consideration.  The terms of reference of the committees will be discussed tomorrow and that matter can also be discussed by the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party were in Government when the House passed the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  During the weeks leading up to Hallowe'en the Taoiseach's constituency and my constituency witnessed again the plague of joyriding where citizens were threatened and communities were put under siege.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to implement the 1994 Act which contains extensive powers to deal with this menace?  When the Minister was in Opposition he lectured us every morning for three years on what should be done about these matters.  Yet now that he is in power he will not <Col N="678" /> take action or implement the legislation.  Will action be taken on this important Dublin issue?</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The Eastern Health Board set a target to accommodate all heroin addicts on programmes by the end of the year.  However, it is now clear that thousands of unfortunate heroin addicts will not be accommodated on programmes by that time.  Will the Taoiseach bring forward emergency measures to end the scandal whereby sick people are desperate in that they are denied treatment?  In representations he makes to the French Prime Minister, will the Taoiseach highlight the disgracefully long hours and unacceptable working conditions which French truck drivers have to endure and which has forced them out on strike?  Will he seek to bring an immediate end to this strike?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 30, to delete &ldquo;23,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are similar to amendments tabled by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin on Committee Stage.  As initiated section 1 provided that with the exception of section 11 and Part III which are subject to commencement provisions, the Bill will come into operation one month after the date of its passing.  Section 11 inserts as many as 12 new sections - sections 19 to 30 - into the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  On Committee Stage I amended the Bill to provide that new sections 19, 24, 25, 27 and 30 will not be the subject of a commencement order and will come into operation one month after the passing of the Bill. Amendment No. 7 from Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, <Col N="680" /> which I am accepting, and my amendment No. 8 will provide additionally that new section 23 will not be subject to a commencement order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's amendments Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 9, with which I cannot agree, would result in the provisions relating to counselling, mediation and certain provisions relating to the evidence of children coming into effect one month after the passing of the Bill.  In addition, her amendment is proposing that all the provisions of section 11 and Part III be brought into effect not later than 18 months from the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that the provisions being introduced by section 11, which relate to mediation and counselling, social reports and guardian <i>ad litem,</i> will require consultation with the Probation and Welfare Service, health boards, the Family Mediation Service and the relevant Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Finance.  I said it was only following proper consultation that the provisions can be brought successfully into effect.  I reiterate that view.</P>
    <P>One of the matters of concern to the Minister and I is that section 47 of the Family Law Act, 1995, giving the Circuit Court power to order social reports in family law proceedings, although brought into effect in August 1996 by a commencement order, was not matched with the necessary resources for the Probation and Welfare Service and the health boards.  That section was extended to divorce proceedings by the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, which came into effect in February 1997.</P>
    <P>It is my Department's intention that any additional funding that may be provided for 1998 will go towards enabling the Probation and Welfare Service to provide a service to the courts to meet the needs of family law legislation.  Recruitment of the professional staff concerned will inevitably take time and it will be essential initially to address the immediate needs under the 1995 and 1996 legislation and then to address needs under the Children Bill provisions.</P>
    <P>Additional demand placed on mediation services and, indirectly, counselling services will also have to be assessed.  In all the circumstances the reality is that without proper resources the new provisions in the Bill cannot be operated.  The 1995 and 1996 legislation is proof of that.  The commencement provision is essential to allow time to properly fund and to recruit the necessary staff and, in effect, it takes into account the responsibilities which already exist in relation to the 1995 and 1996 Acts.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 13, in the name of Deputy McManus, and amendment No. 16, in the name of Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, are related to amendment No. 12.  Therefore, amendments No. 12, 13 and 16 can be taken together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 47 and 48 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;The Act of 1964 is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;2A.&mdash;In relation to cases in which section 2(4) would have applied but for the fact that the mother has withheld her consent, the court may order her to do so if it decides it was unreasonably withheld.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the removal of the provision that the father must go to court to become a joint guardian of his child or children and that this can now be done by agreement between the father and the mother.  However, the Bill falls short of what is required to address the position of single fathers who wish to play a full role in the rearing and development of their children and carry out their responsibilities as parents and fathers.  Single fathers should be entitled to a relationship with their children.  To date the presumption in law has been that single fathers do not have such a right and must seek to obtain agreement to that right. The requirement to arrange to have access to their children, as a precondition to availing of the benefits of the section, could give rise to a catch 22 situation.  The absence of guardianship rights could be detrimental to their prospects of obtaining satisfactory custody and access rights, but single fathers cannot obtain guardianship unless custody and access arrangements have been agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes outlined in the Bill do not render it any easier for a single father to establish guardianship or joint guardianship because in cases where the mother agrees to joint guardianship, the courts would also probably grant guardianship. Agreement can be reached without going to court.  Under the law as it stands, children of single parents are discriminated against in comparison to those of married couples.  Their relationship with their fathers has an inferior status in the eyes of the law and society in general.  The thrust of the Committee Stage debate was to shift recognition of the relationship with the father closer to where it should be, in other words, the father's <Col N="683" /> relationship should have a similar status in law to the relationship with the mother.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 stipulates that the court may order a mother to grant consent if it decides it was unreasonably withheld.  In other words, the decision of the mother to withhold consent could be scrutinised and the court could decide the mother unreasonably withheld consent.  In my interpretation of the law, the mother can decide, by withholding her consent, that the father should not have access or joint custody of his child or children.  The thrust of my amendment would allow the courts to examine the mother's reason for withholding consent and, if she withheld it unreasonably, grant joint guardianship to the father.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are similar to those tabled by Deputies Neville, Moynihan-Cronin and McManus on Committee Stage. In general, their effect would provide that, where an unmarried father applies to the court for guardianship, he shall be made a guardian of the child or children jointly with the mother unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.  In the course of Committee Stage debate, I outlined the position generally in relation to guardianship under the law as it stands.  It is essential to focus attention on that law again.  I stated that an unmarried father is not automatically a guardian of his child or children, but he may apply to the court under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 to become a joint guardian with the mother.  Section 6A, as inserted by the Status of Children Act, 1987, provides that where the father and mother of an infant are not married, the court may, on application by the father, by order appoint him to be guardian of the infant. In arriving at all decisions regarding children, the court must, under section 3 of the 1964 Act, regard the welfare of the child as paramount.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I outlined the views expressed in the 1996 report of the Constitution Review Group on the question of guardianship rights of unmarried fathers.  The review group stated that a natural father has no personal right in regard to his child, which the State is bound to protect under Article 43 of the Constitution.  It also stated that criticism of the fact that a natural father does not have a constitutionally protected personal right in relation to his child can be readily understood in the case of natural fathers who live in a stable relationship with the natural mother or who have established a relationship with the child.  It states, however, that there does not appear to be justification for giving constitutional rights to every natural father simply by reason of biological links.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 there were approximately 12,500 children born to unmarried parents.  In that year some 700 applications for guardianship were made to the courts by unmarried fathers and approximately 90 per cent of them were granted. Of those 700 cases, some 400 were granted with <Col N="684" /> the agreement of the mother.  Those statistics are strong evidence that in very many cases unmarried fathers are not prepared to take on the responsibility of guardianship of their children. Much of the criticism of the position of unmarried fathers under the law as it stands stems from the common belief that unmarried fathers who apply to the court to be made joint guardians of their children are discriminated against and if the mother opposes the application the father has little chance of success.  I know Deputy Neville has particular concerns about this aspect. However, that is not the case.  The position in practice is that the courts will refuse guardianship to an unmarried father only in cases where a father is clearly unsuitable to be a guardian.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendments tabled by Deputies Neville, Moynihan-Cronin and McManus would be to create a presumption in favour of the unmarried father in all cases irrespective of the relationship, stable or otherwise, that exists between him and the mother of the child.  I indicated on Committee Stage that the mother would then have the onus of displacing or refuting such a presumption.  Given the very vulnerable position in which many unmarried mothers find themselves, particularly where they have taken on responsibilities for their children, neither I nor the Minister believe mothers should be placed in that position.  It is precisely because the law is operating currently in the courts without apparent difficulty that there is no need for the fundamental and unnecessary contentious changes proposed by these amendments.  The change proposed in the amendments would not only affect applications to the courts, it would also affect many situations outside the courts because unmarried mothers would feel compelled to agree guardianship rather than have to refute a strong presumption in the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill improves on the existing position of unmarried fathers and mothers by allowing joint guardianship by agreement without the need to go to court as at present.  Our law on that basis would be broadly similar to that in the UK.  On Committee Stage section 9 was amended to provide that a court in considering whether to grant guardianship to an unmarried father must have regard to whether the child's or children's best interest would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with the father and mother on a regular basis.  That provision which is inspired by a provision in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child will have a bearing on the practice of the courts in those cases where an unmarried father seeks guardianship and the mother is in dispute.</P>
    <P>Advances are being made in the Bill on the position of unmarried fathers and mothers and their children, not only on the position where the parties are in a stable relationship but also where they are in dispute.  I do not believe the evidence in relation to those many cases where unmarried fathers do not concern themselves with their children suggests a fundamental change should be <Col N="685" /> made to the law in favour of those fathers.  That would be the effect of the amendments tabled by the Deputies and for that reason I do not support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We covered this matter at length on Committee Stage and I do not want to repeat too much of what I already said.  I note the Minister of State made points she made previously on this issue and I feel I have a duty to respond to them again.  The Minister of State made the essential point that 12,500 children were born to unmarried parents, 700 applications for guardianship were made to the court by unmarried fathers and 400 were accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is right.  I want to concentrate on the gap between the 12,500 children born to unmarried parents and the 700 applications for guardianship by unmarried fathers.  I reject the Minister of State's presumption that is an indication unmarried fathers do not want to have an interest in or a concern for their children.  There are many unmarried fathers who do not want to be connected with their children, but many want to be.  Until there is full and adequate research into why this is happening, it is dangerous to make presumptions because we are simply reinforcing a trend that excludes unmarried fathers from guardianship and care of their children.</P>
      <P>What concerns me about the response of the Minister of State is that the child is almost peripheral to the debate.  We must get back to the basic point that a child needs to know his or her parents. We cannot simply go along with the position where sole responsibility for many of the children born is being given to the mother.  That is not an adequate arrangement.  It is not fair to the child, the unmarried father or mother.  There must be cultural as well as legal changes.  If in legislation we simply support the present cultural trend we will reinforce it.  That is my concern about the Bill.  We are reinforcing the principle that a baby born outside marriage is the sole responsibility of the mother and, if she chooses, the father can have a role to play.  That position is unsustainable in the longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Points were made on the Order of Business about young Irish males who feel disconnected from society.  This position reinforces a feeling of such disconnection.  Males, who are primarily young, who father children outside marriage are being denied responsibility for their children in law and practice.  That is not an easy problem to overcome.  I do not believe that if guardianship was given to unmarried fathers it would make men more responsible or caring.  That is not the way of life.  If we state in law that responsibility for children born outside marriage will continue to be the responsibility of unmarried mothers and <Col N="686" /> the system will be made easier for the courts - I suspect that is probably part of the agenda - we will reinforce that message.  I cannot accept that. I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to reconsider this view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville's amendment contains a modest proposal which would go some way towards establishing a different framework and set of priorities in law.  If my amendment is not acceptable and is too radical a step, at least Deputy Neville's opens a door to assessing how to consider relationships between parents and their children. The Minister has a concern for the area of children, but I believe the legal arguments rather than the needs on the ground are being presented to her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with Deputy McManus.  As 12,500 children were born to unmarried parents and 700 applications were made by unmarried fathers for guardianship of their children, we must consider seriously what is in our culture that determines the majority of fathers of children born outside marriage do not have a relationship with their children.  It is important to recognise that one in five children, and one in four children in some parts of the country, are born outside marriage.  We must consider how we should cope with that position to ensure that the children of unmarried parents have as stable a relationship as children born within marriage.  One of the key aspects of a stable relationship is knowing and being influenced by one's father and mother.</P>
      <P>We must do everything we can to show society this State recognises the strong role of the father in influencing the upbringing of a child, whether or not he is married to the mother.  We cannot turn back the clock and make society what it was 15 or 50 years ago.  The births of children outside marriage will continue and the trend is increasing. The State must recognise this and say that children should know their fathers and their extended family on that side.  They should know their fathers' values and should ensure these influence the children.  A child should grow up to recognise that both male and female, father and mother have a role to play in his or her upbringing. The figures quoted by the Minister show that the 20 per cent of children born outside marriage do not have a relationship with their fathers.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides an opportunity to send a strong message that the State recognises that fathers, whether married or unmarried, have a key role to play in the upbringing, influencing, supporting and guiding of their children, in or outside marriage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to what Deputies have said.  There is a feeling abroad that a father in most instances has few rights.  It would be a step in the right direction to ensure a greater realisation of a father's rights.  Many fathers from all socio-economic groups feel excluded from the upbringing of their children and in many <Col N="687" /> instances there is no real access.  Any help we can give will benefit the child.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to give this matter careful consideration.  Having discussed matters of this nature with unmarried parents it is clear that, particularly in later years, there is sadness that the father has not had a greater input into the upbringing of his child.  This amendment would be a significant, correct and judicious step.</P>

      <P>We have given this matter much consideration since Committee Stage.  The Minister and I are concerned about the vulnerable position of many unmarried mothers, particularly where they have taken on all responsibilities regarding their children.  We are concerned about the mother where the onus is on her to change the automatic situation.  The figures highlight this.  If the father is interested and there is agreement, the court may, on his application, appoint him guardian of the infant.  Even where the mother disputes the application, statistics show that approximately 90 per cent are granted. We have seriously considered the matter but we are not in a position to accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 13, after &ldquo;section 2(4),&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or where the father was a guardian of the child by virtue of a declaration under section 2(4) but was removed from office under section 8(4),&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are to the new section 6A as inserted in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, by section 6 of the Bill.  Section 8(4) of the 1964 Act as inserted by section 7 provides that a court can remove guardianship from an unmarried father who becomes a guardian by virtue of a declaration under new section 2(4) of the 1964 Act. New section 6A of the 1964 Act as it stands in the Bill could be interpreted as not allowing an <Col N="688" /> unmarried father whose guardianship rights as required under new section 2(4) are removed by the court to subsequently apply for guardianship.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 removes doubt on the matter and provides that where an unmarried father's guardianship rights have been removed by a court, the father may subsequently apply to have his guardianship rights restored.  Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's amendment No. 15 is intended to achieve the same result.  However, it is technically imprecise and does not achieve the desired result. Therefore, we have put forward better wording. I cannot support the wording of the amendment proposed by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin.

      <P>&ldquo;11A.&mdash;For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the court, in making an order under section 11 shall grant custody of a child to the child's father and mother jointly unless there are compelling reasons affecting the child's best interest, for not doing so.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to respond favourably to this amendment.  We have to establish joint parenting as the norm, in practice and law.  We cannot reach that point unless we clearly state that it takes two to produce and rear a child.  If we continue to reinforce the principle that the mother rears the child and the father may only be allowed to do so, we are not serving the children of this nation well.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that she wants to protect the unmarried mother from further burden. However, that will not happen.  This provision will only reinforce a parenting imbalance. Joint custody should be the norm.  We should ensure that parenting is recognised as the responsibility of two people.  Marriage allows for that but the nature of that responsibility should not be changed if a marriage breaks down or a couple is not married.  I ask the Minister to be brave and to face up to what is happening and not to what we would like to happen.  We are reinforcing the imbalance of one parent families. There is no such thing as a one parent family because there must be two parents to produce children.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>My amendment has the same objective as that of Deputy McManus.  We want <Col N="689" /> to send a strong signal that co-operation between parents should be the norm so that single parents do not have to go to court to decide who gets custody or the level of access.  We must send a signal that the State recognises changes in society. Over 20 per cent of children are born outside marriage.  The State should signal that co-operation between both parents is expected and that the law is there to facilitate that.</P>
      <P>My amendment proposes that special regard will be given to parents through the ability and willingness of each parent to encourage and facilitate the continued involvement of the other in the upbringing of their children.  We want to establish a norm so that the involvement of both parents is the way forward.  The State expects that both the father and mother should be fully involved in rearing children.  As Deputy McManus said, there is no such thing as a one parent family.  Every child has two parents so we must ensure they are both involved in the child's upbringing.  Otherwise, a large number of people in our society will grow up without their father's influence or involvement.</P>

      <P>These amendments should be accepted, although I appreciate the difficulties which could arise if one parent becomes involved in a new relationship.  Such a situation could be traumatic for both parties and for the child.  We want to ensure the father does not feel excluded. I have met many fathers who have had great difficulty gaining access to and arranging times to meet the child.  This is made worse if there is a conflict between the father and mother.  The child will benefit in the long term if it has proper access to both parents.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure the continued involvement of the other parent in the child's upbringing.  There is a one parent syndrome in every town and village.  We want to ensure it is broken so that both parents are involved in rearing the child, which is not happening at present. Acceptance of this amendment would show that this House is making an effort to ensure that both parents have an input into the child's upbringing.</P>

      <P>The courts seem to forget that the welfare of children should be of paramount importance in cases of marital breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very conscious there is a group of school-children in the Visitors' Gallery.  The key issue in such situations should be the welfare of the children of any marriage or relationship.  We can talk about rights, obligations, access and custody, but let us not forget that any child has a right to know his or her parents and to be influenced by them. That is the ideal situation.  Of course, difficulties can arise leading to the breakdown of marriages <Col N="690" /> and relationships, and unfortunately children can get hurt in such situations.</P>
    <P>These amendments deal with parents' access to their children.  However, in addition to a right to access to their children, parents also have an obligation to look after them.  Our court system has until now tended to give custody rights almost exclusively to mothers.  We need a sea change in our approach to such matters and how our courts deal with such difficulties.  Many fathers are told by the courts that they must provide money to maintain their families and pay the mortgage and that they can bring their children to the Zoo or McDonalds for a day every fortnight.  That is not satisfactory from the point of view of the father or the children, who have a right to know their parents.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I outlined the very sad situation of a man I know whose marriage broke down.  I will not attribute blame for the breakdown but neither he nor his wife has entered another relationship.  There was a court hearing to decide custody of the children and other matters. This man has a very modest income with a take home pay of less than £250 a week.  The court decided he should continue to pay the mortgage on the family home, pay £100 a week to his wife to maintain the family home and their three children and that he should leave the family home.  When he went to collect his belongings he found them in suitcases outside the door and he was not allowed inside the house.  He can only afford to live in a small one bedroom flat 15 miles from his family home.  He has access to his children every second weekend.</P>
    <P>How can that man look after his 15 year old daughter and two younger children in a one bedroom flat?  His children no longer want to spend every second weekend with him.  Why should they have to put up with very inferior living accommodation every second weekend, removed from the familiarity of their home and its creature comforts such as a television and computer?  Let us bear in mind that he has a 15 year old daughter.  That situation is totally unsatisfactory and, while I do not want to criticise any court or judge, it is also unjust.  That man and his children are being treated unfairly.</P>
    <P>The Minister might ask what solution I have.  I do not have all the answers but we need to have much more discussion on this matter and examine how other countries cope with such situations. Given that our overriding consideration must be the welfare of the child, we should have a revolving parent system where instead of the children moving out of the family home to visit their father he would move into the home and his wife would move out when it is his turn to look after the family.  In that way, the children would remain in their familiar surroundings with access to their friends and the adults, who should be better able to cope with such situations, could make their own arrangements.</P>
    <P>It will be said that such a system is unworkable. It would be difficult, of course.  Perhaps <Col N="691" /> the husband might not do the hoovering or clean the cooker over the weekend.  The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, was very amused when I mentioned that the last day.  Difficulties can arise over who does the hoovering in stable relationships also.  The husband might be unhappy with the condition of the house. However, the overriding consideration is not whether the parents are content but the children's welfare.  This system works to a limited extent in Spain and Denmark.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the mother is invariably granted custody of the children with the father given limited access.  The situation is slightly better for the well off who can take their children to reasonable surroundings when they have access to them.  I support these amendments because we must face up to the fact that we need a change in our courts. The existing legislation does not indicate to which parent custody should be given but leaves it to the discretion of the courts.  I am in favour of the strong matriarchal influence in Ireland.  However, given the changes in society, we must review what is happening within these courts and how their decisions affect people's lives.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Bill does not include greater direction to the courts to look at the responsibilities of the parents on the basis that each parent has equal responsibilities and the child has the right to know his or her parents and to be influenced by them.  Earlier in the debate, the Minister of State mentioned that an overriding concern was the requirement of the UN document on the status of children, which contains a statement on the rights of children, including their right to know their parents.  That must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State reconsider the situation and look again at how the wishes of many fathers who have been badly treated can be accommodated?  It may not be a macho thing to say, but men also have feelings and can feel cut off from their children and worthless when they do not have access to give them the kind of attention they need.</P>
    <P>All Members of this House know that children need our attention, even if we can only telephone home when we are in Dublin.  The Minister of State does not yet have any children dealing with homework.  It gets worse when they enter secondary school.  I was a teacher for 20 years and I know how difficult it can be to tutor young people on their homework over the telephone.</P>
    <P>The right of children to have access to their parents can be lost if the courts do not adopt a fair approach to the question of custody.  I support these amendments and I hope that, even at this late stage, the Minister of State may decide to accept them.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGrath referred to the presence of school pupils in the Visitors' Gallery. <Col N="692" /> They are from Ashbourne, County Meath and I welcome them to the House.</P>
      <P>These amendments are similar to those put down by Deputies Neville, Moynihan-Cronin and McManus on Committee Stage which were debated at length.  To help focus the debate on issues raised in the amendments I wish to mention the effect of section 9 and the effect which various amendments would have on the operation of the 1964 Act.</P>
      <P>Section 9 inserts three new sections - 11A, 11B and 11C - into the 1964 Act.  As it stands, section 11 empowers the court to give any direction it thinks proper in disputes concerning custody of or access to children.  In the making of any such orders the court must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  In this context, we have looked again at this issue in detail since Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The new section 11A intends to make clear that a court may award custody of a child to a father and mother jointly.  It states:</P>
      <P>For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the court, in making an order under section 11, may, if it thinks it appropriate, grant custody of a child to the child's father and mother jointly.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 in the name of Deputy Neville purport to declare for the avoidance of doubt that the court, in making an order under section 11, may, if it thinks it appropriate, grant custody of a child to the child's father or mother solely if exceptional circumstances warrant it.  Amendment No. 18 in the name of Deputy McManus and amendment No. 19 in the name of Deputy Moynihan-Cronin are similar.</P>
      <P>Having seriously considered the matter, I remain of the view that the amendments are an attempt to fundamentally alter the powers of the courts to give directions under section 11 on who should have custody of the child.  It would appear that the court would be required as a matter of course to award custody to the father and mother jointly.  It would only award sole custody to the father or mother in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned on Committee Stage, amendment No. 18 in the name of Deputy McManus is flawed in declaring that, for the avoidance of doubt, the court may operate on that basis.  The court does not operate on that basis and because the 1964 Act is not framed to operate on that basis it is wrong to suggest that it does by attempting to remove doubts on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the House agreed to the Minister's amendment of section 9 by inserting a new section 11D into the 1964 Act.  This new section provides that in considering whether to make an order relating to guardianship, custody or access under sections 6A, 11, 14 or 16 of the 1964 Act, the court &ldquo;shall have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by <Col N="693" /> maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis&rdquo;.  This provision goes a long way to meeting the point which underlies the Deputies' concerns and those of certain interest groups without at the same time sacrificing what is fundamental to the operation of the 1964 Act, namely, the principle of what is in the best interest of the child.  It was inspired by the provision in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is intended to direct the court's attention in exercising its discretion in making guardianship, custody and access orders to the desirability of ensuring that the children have ongoing and close contacts with both of their parents.</P>
    <P>The reality which I asked Deputies to appreciate on Committee Stage is that courts are and should be seen to be a last resort in so far as settlement of disputes regarding children are concerned. That is why this Bill encourages the use of counselling and mediation.  However, if cases must come to court, the court will inevitably have to make hard and difficult decisions based on the evidence before it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath referred to an individual case.  The court has all of the evidence before it and takes a decision in the light of that evidence. In cases involving children it is necessary to have all the evidence.  The court will make a decision on sole custody if that is the best solution in terms of the welfare of the child when all of the facts are known.  If the evidence is that joint custody is in the interest of the child the court will make an order for the parents to share custody.</P>
    <P>The courts should not be compelled to award joint custody orders because to do so would be a departure from the principle that decisions in relation to guardianship, custody, access and upbringing must be made on the basis that the welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration.  I am satisfied that these amendments which I am unable to accept would substantially change the rules of evidence in 1964 Act proceedings and in a way that would unnecessarily depart from the child-centred provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath should bear in mind that there is a distinction between guardianship and custody.  It is important in cases where the parents were married that the parent who is not granted joint custody - in the case to which the Deputy referred the mother was granted sole custody &mdash; leaves the court knowing that they are still their child's guardian.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister of State's point that we should not try to direct the courts to act in a certain way, we have reached the stage where we must try to influence them. The Minister of State can tell me that the courts make decisions based on the information before them but the thinking is that there is no other way except to grant custody to the mother.  We have to take a broader focus and somehow inform the courts that there is another way.  We <Col N="694" /> can do this through legislation.  Why, in 97 per cent of cases, is custody granted to the mother? This appears to suggest that in the majority of cases of marital breakdown the father is the erring partner, should be penalised and have his knuckles rapped.  What is best for the children is of paramount importance.  We have to get this point across to the courts.  Perhaps the Minister of State will communicate with family law judges and convey the message that their decisions have been noted and that there is a need for a sea change in approach.  We could find ourselves in trouble if we suggested they attend a refresher course but there is a need for a change of approach.  The Minister of State should take the initiative.</P>

      <P>The amendments reflect the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which states that the rights of the child separated from one or both parents to maintain a personal relationship and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis should be respected unless this is contrary to his or her best interests.</P>

      <P>This is a complex question, particularly having regard to the Constitution. The Constitution Review Group identified a number of issues under Article 41 of the Constitution which concerns the family.  They include an expanded constitutional guarantee for the rights of the child and the relative balance between parental and children's rights.  The Constitution Review Group, in its deliberations, considered the provisions in relation to family and marriage in other constitutions and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It points out that the focus of Article 41 of the Constitution is on the rights of the family as a unit as distinct from the rights of individual members of the family.  It considers that the focus of Article 41 emphasises the rights of the family as a unit to the possible detriment of individual members and that the best approach in any revised form of Article 41 would be to recognise the family as a primary or fundamental unit in society entitled to the special protection of the State or society but recognising also that the rights and duties which derive from marriage, family, parenthood or as a child are guaranteed to or imposed on the individuals.  It recommends the express inclusion of a number of rights of a child.  Among these should be a right, as far as practicable, to be cared for by both parents.  It is also desirable to insert in the Constitution an express obligation to treat the best interests of the child as a paramount consideration in any actions relating to children.</P>
      <P>In making its recommendations in relation to children the Constitution Review Group took into account in particular the various provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Those provisions concern the child's right to be cared for by his or her parents and the desirability of continuity in a child's upbringing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> Deputies will appreciate that the area under discussion in the Bill is complex, involving, as it must, the question of what is provided for in the Constitution.  What we know, as the Constitution Review Group indicated, is that the rights of a child are not expressly referred to in Article 41, rather the focus is on the rights of the family, not the individual members.  For this reason the new section 11D of the 1964 Act, as inserted by section 9 of the Bill, is drafted in a way that coheres with Article 41 of the Constitution, as it stands.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath said the courts should be directed to act in a certain way.  The new section 11A - this is progress - states:</P>
    <P>For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the court, in making an order under section 11, may, if it thinks it appropriate, grant custody of a child to the child's father and mother jointly.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 25 in the name of Deputy Neville.  I observe that amendment No. 29 is related and, with the agreement <Col N="696" /> of the House, I suggest they be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 8, after &ldquo;appropriate.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The court may, in the event of a custodial parent being in breach of an access order &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) grant joint custody to the parents or</P>
      <P>(b) grant sole custody to the parent who is not in breach of the access order.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In endeavouring to enforce an access order, the lesser the involvement of custodial or other penalties the better.  Indeed the lesser the involvement of prisons in the overall area of family law the better.  Even in exceptional circumstances I do not contend somebody should be sent to prison for a breach of an access order; rather there should be strong deterrents in place.</P>
      <P>I propose that, whenever an access order is breached, the court may decide - reverting to the premise that a child has a right to the company, knowledge of and relationship with both parents - to grant joint custody to the parents, which is one option, or allow the <i>status quo</i>, which is custody being granted to the mother.  A court should have the option of granting joint custody to the parents or of granting sole custody to the parent not in breach of the access order, which would be easier to enforce.</P>
      <P>Obtaining redress for breaches of agreements under contract law is slow, tortuous and totally unsuited to dealing with breaches of access orders or other matters relating to children's welfare.  In practice no sanction is imposed on custodial parents for breaches of access orders, with the consequence that many such orders are totally ineffective.  The penalty of imprisonment for breaches of access orders is usually not imposed.  In practice judges do not impose a prison sentence on a lone custodial parent.</P>
      <P>The Minister contends that the penalty for breaches of access orders should be a fine of £1,500 or 12 months imprisonment.  I find that contention quite strange in that, in the course of our previous discussions, she expressed herself unhappy with joint or sole custody as an option in the case of breaches of access orders whereas she says now she wants to have the option of sending a parent, who is in breach of an access order, to prison for 12 months.  In such circumstances a child will not have access to the parent in question, in most cases the mother.  I suggest that the Minister should not provide for the imposition of a prison sentence but rather consider the option of joint custody - depending on how the court responds - or sole custody which, in most cases, will involve a change of custody from the mother to the father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the Minister's acceptance of that suggestion would be a more responsible approach by the parent who has custody of the child in <Col N="697" /> allowing access to the other parent, thereby facilitating the overall thrust of the Bill, which is to improve access to and relationship with the noncustodial parent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment tabled by Deputy Neville and await the Minister's response with bated breath in the hope that she will be in generous mood and accept it.</P>
      <P>The concept enshrined in Deputy Neville's amendment is a very good one.  In essence what he is saying is that, whenever somebody breaches a custodial or visiting order, the imposition of a prison sentence confers no benefit.  We should endeavour to insert some provision which will ensure that a court order is adhered to.</P>
      <P>I appear to come across all the hardship cases. One man I know very well left the family home and entered into a new relationship having already had a number of children who are now adults, in addition to a teenage daughter, by his first marriage.  The court granted him access visiting hours to that daughter.  He was very conscientious in his parental duties to her.  However, his estranged wife would not co-operate with him in regard to those visiting hours.  Usually on a Saturday when he was to gain access to the daughter the mother would have had her taken somewhere else or some other difficulty or excuse would be advanced as to why she was not available.  The order of the court was continually ignored by the mother.</P>
      <P>The man in question went back to the court on a number of occasions to lodge his complaint about those visiting hours only to be told continually that a new order had been affirmed, which had to be adhered to.  Ultimately, on going back to court, the judge said his only option was to put the estranged wife in jail, to which the man concerned replied that he did not want her sent to jail.  In that case the court order was in place and there was nothing the court could do about it.  The man who could not get access to his child was unfairly treated and left in a terrible position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville's proposals will ease matters somewhat in that the courts can award joint custody or impose a fine, thereby removing the option of a jail sentence.  Nobody would want a jail sentence to be an option in circumstances such as those I have described, but that idea may have arisen in respect of errant fathers.  If an errant father was in breach of a court order in relation to visitation rights or whatever, the courts would not have much difficulty in sending him to jail but they would be reluctant to do that in the case of a mother.  Is a different approach taken to fathers in such cases?  Is there equality of treatment before the courts for the two genders? I am quite sure there is not.  The whole thrust of my argument over the past number of weeks is that we must alter our approach to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In asking the Minister of State to respond to these amendments, I hope we will see a generous <Col N="698" /> spirit and an overriding consideration that if we are to enforce court orders in relation to custody and guardianship, the possibility of a prison sentence will not be an option and that more practical penalties will be imposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 25 is, to a large extent, a repeat of an amendment discussed on Committee Stage.  The aim of the amendment is that, where the parent who has custody of a child contravenes the terms of an access order, that person should be penalised by the court by making a joint custody order or taking custody from that parent and giving it to the other parent.</P>
      <P>The amendment is misconceived for a number of reasons.  First, there should not be any question of using the welfare of a child as a means of getting back at one of the parents for the contravention of a court order.  It is wrong to suggest that the penalty for breach of a court order should be the loss of the custody of a child in one form or another.  I remind Deputies that decisions by courts in relation to custody and access must, under current law, be made on the basis that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. The amendment does not reflect that type of framework because it is not child-centred.</P>
      <P>Second, the law as it stands is well capable of addressing the situation where the terms of an access order are not being observed by the custodial parent.  It is open to either parent at all times to seek the direction of the courts under section 11 of the 1964 Act on any matter affecting the child.  The court can vary any orders it has made where there is a change in circumstances. Any court orders made under section 11 or varied by the courts must be made on the basis of the best interests of the child.  The courts can do what the Deputies want them to do but only when all the facts have been put forward and having regard to the best interests of the child.</P>
      <P>Third, as I indicated on Committee Stage, penalties already exist in law for breaches of access orders and the amendment would add a further layer of penalties for such breaches.</P>
      <P>It appears the attempt in amendment No. 29 is to leave the maximum sanctions which exist under the 1986 legislation for breaches of access and custody orders at their current levels and not allow for increases to bring them into line with the present day jurisdiction of the District Court. I do not accept that the message should go out that in serious cases of breaches of custody and access orders, the District Court should be specially limited in relation to the sanctions it can apply.  Those sanctions are the maximum the courts can impose.  Even if they cannot be invoked often, in exceptional cases such necessary powers may be required.  I am unable, therefore, to accept the two amendments from the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am using the two minutes available to me.  I am disappointed with the response of the Minister of State.  The debate on this side of the House has been concerned with respecting the rights of the child who is separated from one or both parents and maintaining contact with both parents on a regular basis.  We must allow the courts to determine that matter where access to one of the parents is being refused by the other.  Deputy McGrath outlined a case where a father had to abandon his children rather than see the mother of those children go to prison. Most fathers would do that if they were faced with such circumstances.  They would not deprive a child of its mother by allowing her go to prison, but that was the option presented to the father in question.  He had to choose between sending the mother to prison or walking away from the child and he chose to walk away from the child.</P>
      <P>The proposals in these amendments should not be introduced as a sanction.  I am not saying the current sanctions should be changed; they should not have been increased.  In cases where access is being denied, and in respecting the rights of the child under the UN convention, the courts should have the facility to allow joint custody or, if that is not possible, award custody to either the mother or the father.  The courts should be in a position, taking all circumstances into account and in the interests of the child, to change the access order.  That would not be a sanction but a solution in the interests of the child and the parent who is not allowed access to the child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The way in which the Minister of State views Deputy Neville's amendment is important.  We do not want to send somebody to jail but we must remind the courts that they have to be in a position to impose some sanction.  In the case to which I referred earlier, the courts did not want to send the errant mother to prison, but I wonder if she would have taken a different view if she had been told by the courts that if she did not abide by the court order she would go to prison. It is important for the courts to be reminded that they could impose some other sanction in such cases.  That is the tenor of what we have been saying.  We are asking the Minister to put other signposts in the legislation, to give the court the option of granting joint custody over the head of a parent who will not obey its rulings.  If that were done, errant parents might take a different approach.  The other penalties would still stand and could be imposed as a last resort.  The problem is that there are no real sanctions at the moment.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to soften her approach to this amendment.</P>

      <P>In the example quoted by Deputy Neville, the father had the choice of walking away from the child or putting the mother in prison.  A third option, which the Deputy did not mention, is for the father to go back to the court and seek a variation of the <Col N="700" /> arrangements which were made in the interests of the child because they are not working.</P>

      <P>The gentleman in question went back to the court several times to have the order in relation to visitation hours changed.  Each time the mother ignored the order of the court and found some reason for not making the child available.  It was not just a question of Saturday afternoon not suiting the mother because the child had horse riding or dancing lessons.  The judge then told the father that the only option he had was to send the mother to jail.  Had there been the possibility of the judge granting joint custody or granting sole custody to the father, the mother's approach might have changed.  However, I do not think the judge thought of that.  What we are trying to do is to signal to judges that there are other options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to move away from individual cases, for obvious reasons.  In a situation like that, it is up to the parent to put forward his case in court.  The judge can award joint custody or otherwise change the custody order.  Deputies should bear in mind that fathers sometimes do not turn up to collect their children when expected, and mothers may have arrangements to go to work etc., on that day.  Where the arrangements are not working the parents should go back to court and put all the facts before it.  All the options mentioned by the Deputies are available to the judge.  I am convinced that this is the correct way to deal with such matters, bearing in mind that the rights of children are paramount.  We could stay here all day talking about individual cases but this is not the place to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>This is the place to solve the problem and it is our duty to do so.  I am pleased the Minister has moved significantly from her original position and has accepted that the judge can take a decision to make an order for joint custody or to grant sole custody to the father, as I proposed. That should be written into this legislation as a signal that this is the way to go rather than putting the mother in jail for 12 months as proposed by the Minister.  I take exception to my suggestion being regarded as a sanction.  It is an option for the court to exercise in the best interests of the child and having heard all the facts.  This Bill should signal to the court that when the parent who has custody is brought back to court three, four or five times because the other parent cannot get access to his child which he has been duly granted by the court, it can consider options other than putting a parent in jail for 12 months.  The Minister of State has stated specifically that she wants to increase the jail penalty from six months to 12 months.  Prison should not enter into this.  Although I was tempted to do so, I did not table an amendment to have the option of imposing a prison sentence removed but was happy for the <i>status quo</i> to remain. Increasing the penalty to 12 months is giving the wrong signal to the courts and saying that a custodial <Col N="701" /> sentence for the parent, in 99 per cent of cases the mother, is the way forward.  The answer is for the court to grant joint custody to the parents to get over the problem of access or, in extreme situations where the father cannot get access and where it is deemed to be in the best interests of the child, to make an order for the father to have sole custody with access by the <Col N="702" /> mother.  The preferred option, if the mother repeatedly fails to allow access, is joint custody. However, the two options should be available in place of the Minister's proposal to send the mother to jail for 12 months.</P>

      <P>I welcome the passage of the Bill, which is important in that it recognises, for the first time, the rights of fathers in 99 per cent of cases as well as those of extended families.  This did not arise on Report Stage because we were satisfied with the provisions made, but it is important that grandparents, who often have a special relationship with children, have a right of access as provided by the Bill.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's letter to me dated 31 October regarding other problems in the Bill, such as sanction for perjury on the part of a child, on which there was much debate.  I note that the Children Bill, 1996, is to be restored and debated from Committee Stage.  The Minister of State should take into account our concerns that currently a child of eight to 12 years of age who does not tell the truth in court can be sent away to an institution for a period.  I did not table an amendment on this matter because of the Minister of State's letter and because we can debate it fully when we return to the Children Bill, 1996.  I thank the Minister of State for introducing this Bill and I also acknowledge the work done by the Minister responsible for this area in the last Government.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; I am pleased to have the opportunity to open this debate on the Second Stage of this Bill.  It will provide an opportunity for Deputies to consider the performance of Bord Scannán na hÉireann/the Irish Film Board since its re-establishment in 1993, the last occasion when a Bill dealing with the board's activities came before the House.  It will also provide Deputies with an opportunity to express their views on the future of the Irish film and television production industry and I look forward to hearing those views with considerable interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill specifically relates to one of the State bodies which operates under the aegis of my Department - Bord Scannán na hÉireann/the Irish Film Board.  I propose to concentrate my remarks on the activities and the performance of the board since its re-establishment in 1993. However, while the Irish Film Board is a central plank in nurturing and developing the Irish indigenous film industry as an important input to both the cultural and the economic development <Col N="705" /> of the State, I regard the tax incentive scheme for investment in film and television projects under section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, as amended &mdash; an incentive administered efficiently by my Department - as being of equal importance in achieving those goals.</P>
    <P>Since its introduction by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1987, section 35 has played a central and critical role in mobilising private sector investment in the development of the industry.  It has also been instrumental in attracting significant non-indigenous film and television productions to locate their shooting in Ireland, and this activity represents a critical input to the development of the indigenous industry.  I welcome the fact that the measure is firmly in place up to 1999 and will sympathetically examine its influence on the industry when it comes up for review.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 1997, is straightforward technical legislation that does not imply any policy change.  It is standard practice that, under their legislation, non-commercial State bodies operate within a limit on the amount of loans, grants, etc., they can issue.  This figure is increased by the Oireachtas every three to four years by amending legislation, and this process rightly provides the Oireachtas with an opportunity to discuss the activities of such bodies and their sectors.</P>
    <P>Section 1 proposes to amend section 10 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, which sets a limit on the aggregate amount of any loans, investments, grants or moneys provided by the board, together with the aggregate amount of principal and interest which the board may be liable to repay or has previously paid on foot of guarantees for the time being in force.  The original limit provided in the 1980 Act was £4.1 million.  This limit was increased to £15 million under the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Act, 1993, and this Bill proposes to further increase the limit to £30 million.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the amounts to be allocated to the Irish Film Board for loans in each year will be decided in the annual Estimates for my Department, which must be approved by the Dáil.  Accordingly, the amendment proposed in section 1 is a necessary enabling provision to ensure the board can receive and allocate the resources which will be provided by the Dáil in the coming years.  The annual allocations provided to the Irish Film Board since 1993 have by now almost exhausted the limit of £15 million provided under the 1993 Irish Film Board (Amendment) Act.  The capital provision for the board for 1997 is £3.721 million which, if expended in full, will bring the aggregate amount of loans, investments, etc., provided by the board to some £15.126 million - in excess of the current statutory limit.</P>
    <P>The second measure deals with the subject of the officers and servants of the board.  These provisions, which propose to amend section 27 of the 1980 Act, are designed to bring the Irish Film Board's provisions in this area up to date and in line with statutory provisions applicable to other non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  Since, <Col N="706" /> by their nature, non-commercial State-sponsored bodies have an ongoing dependence on grants-in-aid from moneys voted in the Estimates each year, Deputies will fully accept the rationale behind these provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that board decisions relating to the number of persons to be appointed as officers and servants; their rates of remuneration and allowances for expenses; the terms and conditions of employment with the board; the grades and the number of persons in each grade and the removal of an officer or servant of the board shall be subject to the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Minister for Finance.  The purpose of these provisions is, principally, to ensure that the board does not, without due approval of the two Ministers, take decisions which could have cost implications for the Exchequer or be contrary to Government policy in relation to pay and conditions in the non-commercial public sector generally.</P>
    <P>Thus two further general provisions are included in section 2.  These require the board to have regard to any nationally agreed guidelines and Government policy on remuneration, allowances for expenses and conditions of employment in determining these matters and to comply with any directives from the two Ministers in regard to these matters.  The underlying principle of section 2 is that the board of a State body, which is dependent on an ongoing basis on Exchequer support, should not be free to take decisions which have Exchequer implications unless these decisions have been approved by the two Ministers mentioned.</P>
    <P>Turning to the activities and the performance of the Irish Film Board since its re-establishment in 1993, I am satisfied with the performance of the board over those years.  I commend my predecessor as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, on his role over those years in promoting the development of the film and television production industry in the State.  In doing so, however, it is important not to be selective in acknowledging such major achievements.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that the range of incentives introduced to develop the film and television production industry owe much to the commitment of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government appointed in January 1993; to the earlier initiative of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in establishing the Special Working Group on the Film Production Industry in late 1992, whose recommendations underpinned most of the new incentives, and to the highly enlightened approach of the current Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who radically overhauled the section 35 tax incentive for investment in the industry in 1993 and 1994 and agreed to provide funding for the Irish Film Board.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations of the then Taoiseach's Special Working Group on the Film Production Industry was the establishment of a designated agency to provide funding for film <Col N="707" /> production in the State.  Since the legislation for the Irish Film Board remained on the Statute Book, it was entirely appropriate to implement this recommendation by re-establishing the Irish Film Board, which was done in April 1993.</P>
    <P>The broad function of the Irish Film Board, as set out in section 4 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, is to assist and encourage by any means it considers appropriate the making of films in the State and the development of an industry in the State for the making of films.  I welcome the fact that the 1980 legislation provides that, in so far as it considers it appropriate, the board shall have regard to the need for the expression of national culture through the medium of film.  In this regard, it is important that we do not become mesmerised by what I might describe as the glitzy image of film-making, mostly epitomised by Hollywood, but rather that we place on the record this Government's determination that its incentives for the industry will enable Irish film makers to tell Irish stories in a more professional and entertaining way and with greater impact, and thus contribute to Irish cultural expression at a national and international level.  The Irish Film Board has a critical role to play in this process.</P>
    <P>The board exercises its function mainly by the provision of development loans and production loans for film makers.  Feature film development loans are intended for research, development and feasibility - up to a maximum of £25,000 - and are repayable on the first day of principal photography. Of the 98 film projects which have been offered development funding by the board since its re-establishment in 1993, 17 have progressed into production.  This creditable ratio of 1:6 compares favourably to other European film funding agencies, which I understand achieve an average ratio of 1:10, and to the Hollywood hit rate of 1:15.</P>
    <P>Feature film production loans are usually in the range of 10-15 per cent of the overall budget of a film and the board is required to operate under an upper limit of 15 per cent of a film's budget. By the end of this year the board will have given 44 production loans.  The board also offers production loans each year for a small number of ambitious documentaries, with an emphasis on feature length documentaries with potential for theatrical, festival and television screening.</P>
    <P>In evaluating applications for production loans for projects, the board takes into account the potential for the employment of Irish workers in all technical and creative grades among the cast and crew and especially as heads of department. The House will appreciate that the director and writer of a film are central to its creative texture, to the authenticity of its realisation and to its eventual profile.  For this reason the involvement of indigenous directors and writers is one of the crucial criteria for board support.  Before the board's re-establishment in 1993 Irish producers were at a serious disadvantage as they had little or no Irish finance to bring to the table and they <Col N="708" /> found it very difficult to negotiate for the employment of an Irish cast and crew or on where the shoot should take place.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations, obtaining funding for a feature film without support from one's home country is extremely difficult.  The position since 1993 is that an Irish Film Board-supported film can go to foreign markets with up to 30 per cent of its budget in place from the domestic market.  This takes account of the net contribution of the section 35 element of the film's budget and any other indigenous investment. Apart from this augmented return to the economy as a result of being in a better position to secure foreign investment in films, Irish film makers who are now developing a successful track record are better able to influence where a film is shot and the cast and crew employed.  For this reason, the spend in the economy and the contribution made by ancillary services in all stages of production and post-production is a significant factor in the board's consideration of applications.</P>
    <P>The production loan is offered on the basis of either repayable loan or equity participation.  The board has recouped more than 20 per cent of its total capital investment during the first four years.  By international standards this recoupment level is very good and greatly exceeds the returns of other national film funding agencies such as the Australian Film Commission with returns of 9.8 per cent, the British Film Institute with returns of 5.7 per cent and the Council of Europe's film co-production fund, EURIMAGES, with returns of 2.8 per cent.  I am also pleased to report that the board made an overall profit on its investment in more commercial films such as &ldquo;Circle of Friends&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Man of No Importance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe the House will agree that this is a creditable performance and that the staff of the Irish Film Board and the board, under the chairmanship of the distinguished documentarist, Louis Marcus, and of his predecessor, Lelia Doolan, deserve our full praise for their achievements. In saying this, however, I hope the board's performance in the recoupment of loans granted is maintained and, if possible, improved in the years to come.</P>
    <P>One of the other more positive indicators of the performance of the Irish Film Board to date is that Irish films supported by it have won international critical and audience acclaim at film festivals throughout the world.  For example, three of the last four films to win the best film award at the prestigious San Sebastian Film Festival were supported by the board - &ldquo;Ailsa&rdquo;, &ldquo;Trojan Eddie&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Went Down&rdquo;.  It is unprecedented for a country of Ireland's size to achieve such success at this and other premiere international film festivals.  More recently, &ldquo;The Last Bus Home&rdquo; was voted the best film at the British and Irish Film Festival at Cherbourg in France.</P>
    <P>In addition to development and production loans, the Irish Film Board has established funding <Col N="709" /> alliances with RTE, Teilifís na Gaeilge and the Arts Council for certain focused interventions. The board co-funds with RTE the &ldquo;Short Cuts&rdquo; series of five to six short film dramas per year.  The welcome emphasis here is placed on emerging non-established film-makers and the scheme is viewed as a springboard for film-makers who wish to take on feature length projects.  The fact that three of these &ldquo;Short Cuts&rdquo; projects - &ldquo;A Soldier's Song&rdquo;, &ldquo;Before I Sleep&rdquo; and &ldquo;Quando&rdquo; - won awards at the recent 1997 Cork Film Festival is an illustration of the quality of these shorts.  The board and RTE are currently selecting from 150 applications for the fourth series of &ldquo;Short Cuts&rdquo;.  This clearly demonstrates the relevance of this funding alliance between RTE and the board.</P>
    <P>A very welcome scheme in the Irish language, which is similar to &ldquo;Short Cuts&rdquo;, is the new scheme &ldquo;Oscailt&rdquo;.  This scheme will fund between two and four short Irish language film productions each year and is funded by the board in conjunction with Teilifís na Gaeilge.  RTE and the Arts Council are partners with the Irish Film Board in funding &ldquo;Frameworks&rdquo;, an animation scheme designed for creative animation projects under ten minutes duration.  Six creative animations are funded under the scheme per year and the third series will be advertised shortly.</P>
    <P>The final funding alliance is the &ldquo;Real Time&rdquo; scheme which is run in partnership with RTE. This scheme is aimed at cinematic one hour dramas and, unlike the &ldquo;Short Cuts&rdquo; scheme, is open to established film-makers.  It is designed for films suited to the television format.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for broadcasting and film policy, I offer my strong support for these four funding alliances which acknowledge the importance of television production in the overall development of the industry.  Television drama is an essential ingredient in the development of the industry and I hope that further and extended initiatives can be developed between the Irish Film Board and television broadcasters in the future and within existing resources.  In this regard the independent television channel, TV3, which is expected to come on air during the second half of 1998 will offer further opportunities for the film and television production sectors. I am confident that much of the programme schedule of the new service will comprise high quality home-produced programming in all genres, including in particular drama.  There will also be scope for TV3 to participate fully in the funding alliances to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record my appreciation of the assistance the board gives my Department from time to time and, on request, the professional advice it gives relating to film budgets and other matters in the context of my Department's role in certifying section 35 film projects. The board also participates at seminars in Ireland and abroad which have a direct relevance to the promotion of the industry and it provides information and advice to indigenous and international <Col N="710" /> film producers on an ongoing basis.  The board's excellent and concise brochure &ldquo;Incentives for Film-making in Ireland&rdquo; is now in its second print run and has been widely disseminated abroad.  Moreover, with its presence on the World Wide Web, the board is frequently the first call for people seeking information or advice on filming in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The board also advises and supports film producers in obtaining other sources of finance outside Ireland.  It maintains stands at the Cannes, Berlin and Toronto film festivals and provides support for Irish producers seeking foreign investment and information to international producers wishing to film in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The board does not fund cinema exhibitions directly.  However, it ran a showcase of Irish films which toured Ireland during the summer of 1996. This is an initiative that could be repeated and strengthened.  A very welcome initiative was Cinemobile which was also run in 1996 as part of the celebration of the centenary of the cinema. This touring cinema, which was hired from France and carried on an articulated truck, toured villages and towns along the Border.  The board provides matching funding to commercial distributors for the publicity and advertising costs involved in the theatrical launch of boardsupported films in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, the funding of all the activities of the Irish Film Board which I have outlined requires considerable Exchequer support.  This support is provided under subheads N.1 and N.2 of the Vote for my Department and in 1997 the allocation for the board involves £419,000 in administration expenditure and £3.721 million in capital expenditure.  The current expenditure of the board involves the salaries of its full-time staff of four persons, its other administration costs and contributions to international commitments such as EURIMAGES, funded jointly with RTE, EUREKA Audiovisual and the EUREKA Observatory.  The board also partly funds the EU Media Desk in Dublin and the Media Antenna in Galway.</P>
    <P>I warmly appreciate that the capital expenditure of the Irish Film Board is funded up to a maximum of £13 million under the Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-1999. EU funding support, from the European Regional Development Fund, amounts to 75 per cent of this amount, with the balance coming from the Exchequer.  I cannot over-emphasise how important this European funding is in promoting the development of the film industry in Ireland.  It represents a strong acknowledgement by the European Union of the contribution of the European audio-visual industry to economic and social development by way of employment and value added in the EU.</P>
    <P>The industry operational programme also includes a provision of £2.58 million for training for the industry, of which 75 per cent is provided by the European Social Fund and the balance by the Exchequer.  These funds were released for use <Col N="711" /> earlier this year.  They are channelled through the Vote of my Department to the Irish Film Board. The training schemes are administered by the National Training Committee for Film and Television, which operates under the auspices of FÁS and comprises membership from industry interests and the key State interests.  It has been agreed that this £2.58 million training fund will be topped up by a £250,000 contribution per annum from FÁS, subject to demand, with significant additional FÁS expenditure on traineeships for the industry.  For 1997, the first year of effective operation of the national training committee, it is expected that some £1.2 million will be spent on initiatives organised by the committee.</P>
    <P>The analysis outlined in the STATCOM report on &ldquo;Training Needs to 2000&rdquo; pointed to the need for focused training interventions in a range of film and television functions, to build on the considerable skills which are being obtained by students of media studies who are graduating from our third level colleges each year.  The National Training Committee for Film and Television is addressing these skills deficiencies aggressively.  The training initiatives which have already been undertaken or are in train include a television producer-director course; a story editing workshop; a masterclass for directors conducted by a distinguished British director; a marketing and distribution workshop; a course in scriptwriting for situation comedies; traineeships in sound post-production for assistant sound editors; the development of a strategic company development programme, to commence mid-1998; training programmes for industry specialists, including educationalists-trainers; a film scoring course; a production assistants course; and an intensive scriptwriting course for Irish language programming which is just about to commence.</P>
    <P>Over the next two years, eight workshops for directors, screenwriters and producers will take place in the partner countries of Ireland and Scotland under the Moonstone initiative between the national training committee and Scottish Screen, which draws from the Robert Redford Sundance training model in the United States.  Deputies will agree this is an impressive list of training activities now impacting on our film and television practitioners in Ireland.  Because of the overlap in some EU funding to the year 2000, the House can be assured the national training committee will continue to organise focused and high quality training initiatives up to that time and I am confident its activities will greatly improve the skills base of our industry and the capacity of Irish practitioners to obtain upgrades in the film and television hierarchies over time.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed my satisfaction at the operations of the Irish Film Board to date.  Since 1993 the board has chaired a committee of senior officials of Government Departments and the State marketing and promotional agencies, entitled STATCOM.  One of the priorities set by STATCOM since its inception was the establishment <Col N="712" /> of a screen commission for Ireland, which would have the single function of marketing Ireland as a location for film production. Deputies will be aware that earlier this year the Irish Film Board submitted proposals for the establishment of a screen commission to the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The Minister subsequently announced the establishment of a screen commission on 4 June last, based on the Irish Film Board's proposals.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, commits the Government to the establishment of a screen commission and of an industry think tank which would evaluate the effectiveness of existing schemes and incentives, and formulate a strategic plan for the future of the industry.  Before I took up office the Irish Film Board had submitted its draft terms of reference for the screen commission to my Department.  I am now arranging meetings with film industry interests, RTÉ and the Irish Film Board to hear their views on the priorities for a screen commission and I expect to make my decision on the commission very soon afterwards.</P>
    <P>I also propose to address the other commitment for this sector in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, by establishing the industry think tank as soon as possible.  I propose to assign the think tank the task of formulating a strategic plan for the development of the industry over a ten year timeframe.  I expect the think tank to examine the effectiveness of the existing structures and incentives in place to develop our film and television production industries and to consider whether our arrangements need to be refocused or restructured over time.  In this connection, I am mindful of the recommendation in the 1992 report of the Special Working Group on the Film Production Industry to the effect that there should be a review of the operation of the Irish Film Board after five years.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the think tank will have the results of an exercise already carried out by STATCOM to assist it in its deliberations.  Over the past 12 months or so, STATCOM has, independently, been elaborating the components of a plan for the development of the industry and it recently submitted a draft to me for my information.  I emphasise that the text of the plan has not, to date, been endorsed by the respective authorities of the constituent members of STATCOM, but the value of its existence is that it can serve as a very useful base discussion document for use by the industry think tank.  I will, therefore, ask the think tank to draw up a strategic ten year plan for the future of the industry, using the STATCOM document as an opening basis for discussion and deliberation.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the full co-operation of the industry in the deliberations of the think tank and I am confident this is the best way to proceed to ensure the achievements of the recent past can represent a sound foundation for <Col N="713" /> the sustained development of the industry over time.</P>
    <P>Also looking to the future, I am pleased to inform the House that the conclusion of a Film Co-Production Agreement between Ireland and Australia is very near and I am expediting the final procedures on the Irish side to allow for its adoption when the procedures in Australia have also been completed.  The agreement will enable producers in both countries, who enter into film co-production agreements with each other, to source the production incentives available in both jurisdictions for their projects.  I place a particular value on the extension of Ireland's co-production contacts with other states.  In this regard I expect to be in a position to adhere to the Council of Europe's European Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production in the first half of next year.  This convention can apply to bilateral and multilateral co-productions and, since 22 of the 40 member states of the Council of Europe have signed the agreement, I very much hope it will be a means of avoiding the rather lengthy process of formal bilateral treaties with individual states.</P>
    <P>Ireland is currently experiencing a sustained high level of film production throughout the State.  It is a matter of particular satisfaction to me that, despite the natural attractions of Dublin and Ardmore studios as locations for film-making, no fewer than 17 counties have to date experienced film-making of various degrees of size since the Irish Film Board was re-established in 1993.  My own county, Clare, hosted the feature film, &ldquo;The Serpent's Kiss&rdquo;, in Sixmilebridge, which was very enjoyable.  I had the opportunity to visit the set of &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo; in County Wexford in July, at which I obtained first hand experience of the impact which film production can have on local economies.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Taxi Drivers' Union and the Irish Taxi Drivers' Federation were met, in my absence, by my programme manager on one occasion.  The purpose of the meeting was to permit the taxi drivers to explain their <Col N="714" /> position and set out the problems they are experiencing with the authorities.</P>
      <P>As a result of the meeting I was briefed on the situation.  I intend meeting the taxi drivers tomorrow, with a view to finding a way forward and putting a structure in place to permit dialogue and avoid a recurrence of the chaos we experienced on Thursday, 30 October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain why Fianna Fáil members of the City Council and other Dublin local authorities played the role of defender of the monopoly of the taxi drivers and thwarted all progress?  Does he accept the importance of the role of the taxi as an adjunct to other public transport in the city of Dublin and that it must be regulated, expanded and upgraded for the good of Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why any particular councillors did anything.  Unfortunately, they do not consult on these matters nor do I ask them.  I accept the importance of the taxi service. The present situation is chaotic and four councils have made different decisions which are totally contradictory and contributing to the chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach met the organisation and, if not, does he intend to do so?  He will be well aware that in the past number of months, prior to the General Election, members of his party had regular meetings with the Irish Taxi Drivers' Federation and the National Taxi Drivers' Union to whom many promises were made. Does the Taoiseach intend to fulfil those promises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My programme manager had a meeting with both organisations some time ago and I intend meeting them tomorrow.  I have had consultation with them.  The difficulty is that there has been a number of reports on this issue. There has been grave difficulty in the councils over the past year, all of whom have taken different decisions.  Unilateral decisions were introduced which have resulted in grave difficulties and the taximen have responded in an equally unilateral fashion.  Neither has been helpful.  I am meeting them with a view to finding a basis for a useful dialogue rather than the problems being collectively created.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Will the Taoiseach agree that a balance is needed in the approach to the whole issue of taxi drivers in Dublin?  Will he accept that the action by some politicians, particularly around Christmas, in denouncing the taxi drivers because of long queues is not helpful in the sense that one cannot judge the number of taxis needed throughout the year by the exceptional period at Christmas?  Is the Taoiseach aware of an element of speculation in the taxi industry where individuals are buying up a large number of plates and trying to create a monopoly? We also have cosies, drivers who have no <Col N="715" /> rights or security whatsoever, whose rights must not be exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct.  There are many categories involved here, as well as a number of councils.  The issues include taxi owners who do not drive, taxi drivers who drive and have other licences, those who rent licences, cosies, hackneys and others.  There have been numerous reports and examinations of the problems but there has not been an adequate solution. Given the various categories, the difficulty is that every time a solution is put forward not everybody agrees.  If people would agree to work together and abide by whatever recommendation is put forward, without cherrypicking, it would help.  I have long experience of this problem.  The situation has not changed since I first dealt with this issue 24 years ago and when I chaired a council group 20 years ago.  I am not saying the position will change after tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware the local authorities are not making different decisions but, in fact, made a compromise joint decision, after much debate, to issue 200 licences before Christmas?  Two years ago this power was given to local authorities.  Prior to that time the power rested with the Department of the Environment and because of inaction in that Department a monopoly was allowed to develop.  The solution is not to set up a new body but rather that somebody has the political courage to make a decision once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While that may be the case, it was not a good idea to make a decision to grant 200 licences when a survey is being carried out to determine if additional licences are required. That merely set people against each other.  It would have been more appropriate to wait until the survey was completed.  The collective view of the House and the county councils is that 200 licences are required, but it is difficult to get people to say that.  There are other decisions to be made regarding the £100 and the £450 and the question of a 5p increase since 1985 also arises. The rights of the hackney drivers and taximen must also be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Last week's actions will not help the public's view of matters. I would prefer if the issue were dealt with in a comprehensive manner.  It is regrettable it surfaces every year in the run up to Christmas and then drifts until the following Christmas.  This issue is almost as predictable as an all-Ireland final in that it nearly always arises in the first half of November.  There must be another way to do business.  While it may not be directly my responsibility, I know many of the groups <Col N="716" /> involved and I will try to find a mechanism with which everyone agrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's indication that he will try to find a suitable mechanism for dealing with the question of taxi licences. What avenues have been considered?  Does he agree that an appropriate Department could work in conjunction with the four new local authorities to deal with the issue in the Dublin area? I have already taken up this matter with the Minister with responsibility for public affairs.  Will the Government examine the feasibility of providing appropriate late night licensed public service vehicles through Bus Átha Cliath and Iarnrod Éireann's DART system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those matters can be considered. We must carry out a comprehensive examination.  It is part of the modern day transport problem and everybody has a role to play. We must put in place a fair mechanism with which everybody agrees.  In regard to the Deputy's suggestion about a single Department, responsibility for this matter was removed from a Department only 18 months ago because, in their collective wisdom, the councils believed they could deal with the matter in a more appropriate manner.  I would hate to think my honourable friends in the councils are throwing in the towel after only 18 months and that the matter is back with the Taoiseach or the relevant Minister.  From time to time the Taoiseach and councillors have to make unpopular decisions.  We must sit down together to find a way forward on this issue.  It is not helpful to say one thing at a council meeting and the opposite outside.  It would be better if we were all truthful and tried to reach an agreeable mechanism.  I will try to put in place such a mechanism, but it will be up to the councils to implement it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Time use surveys are an important source of information in developing a system for the evaluation of unwaged work.  The CSO carried out a small scale pilot survey of some 300 households, involving nearly 1,000 respondents, in June this year.  This involved the collection of general demographic information and the completion by household members of a time use diary in respect of two days.  The information collected in the survey is being analysed and the CSO hopes to issue a report early in 1998 on the results of the pilot survey and on the feasibility and cost of conducting a large scale national time use survey.</P>
      <P>In the national accounts area, the CSO's priority is to extend the range of data available at present to comply with the full detail of the core EU national accounting system.  This is a legal requirement under EU law and is also necessary in the context of EMU.</P>
      <P>The measurement of unwaged work is not part of the core national accounts.  This is dealt with in satellite accounts which are used to extend the core system to provide information on topics where the estimation methods are not developed enough to allow their inclusion in the main system. In conducting the pilot time use survey, the CSO has taken an important step in this area and will continue to monitor the research and development work being undertaken internationally to evaluate unwaged work.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the information.  Is it reasonable to expect the Government to make the information derived from the time use survey available to us?

When we examine the 1997 results more closely and the CSO publish its views, I am sure the system can be developed further.  Unwaged work in our economy needs to be measured.</P>

Will he also agree there is exploitation not only in the home but in the workforce where women's work is on a grossly unequally remunerated scale to that of men employed in industry and there is great exploitation of part-time women workers? Why does the Government not give a lead by rooting out that type of exploitation and inequality as a start to addressing this problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a policy question and I will not be drawn too deeply into it other than to comment that in recent years under successive Governments changes were made to the taxation and social welfare systems and a new Department of Equality and Law Reform was established. Those changes have narrowed a gap that needed to be narrowed.  Those policies will continue to close the gap fully between the incomes and remunerations of men and women.

      <P>I am very satisfied with the progress to date of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan.  Significant developments are taking place in the main areas addressed by it.  The key focus in the plan is on creating the right organisation to deliver value for money military services which meet the needs of the Government and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following acceptance by the Government of the Efficiency Audit Group's report in July 1995 an implementation group prepared a fully costed implementation plan for phase 1 of the proposals. The first phase covers a period of three years <Col N="720" /> 1996-8.  This plan is essentially strategic in nature and sets out the parameters and objectives within which the reform of the Defence Forces will take place.  The initial phase concentrates particularly on the reform of the Permanent Defence Force's structure and organisation.</P>
    <P>Reforms are being implemented in a planned and sensitive manner with the full backing of the military authorities and ongoing consultation with the representative associations in accordance with the agreed system of representation.  Since assuming office I listened to a range of views within the Defence Forces and I will be anxious to ensure the process of consultation and communication is as developed and inclusive as possible. The reform programme tackles in a positive way the many problems confronting our Defence Forces, for example, the high age profile, inadequate collective training, the extensive numbers working in civilian type jobs and the imbalance between pay and non-pay spending.</P>
    <P>Work is at present under way to amend the Defence Act, 1954, to reorganise Defence Forces headquarters.  The amendment will involve the abolition of the positions of adjutant-general and quartermaster-general and their replacement by two new appointments of deputy chief of staff.  I hope to be in a position to bring the draft heads of the Bill to Government shortly.  Simultaneously, work is also under way to amend Defence Forces Regulations where necessary to give effect to the new organisation.</P>
    <P>With regard to personnel issues, moves have been made to address the age profile problem.  A voluntary early retirement scheme commenced in 1996 when a total of 500 personnel availed of it. A further 735 members were granted voluntary early retirement this year.  In tandem with the voluntary early retirement scheme a recruiting drive has taken place.  A total of 46 cadets and 600 recruits were enlisted in 1997 and the recruitment of 17 apprentices is taking place.</P>
    <P>The question of equipment and infrastructure are important elements of the development of the Defence Forces.  The Government's commitment to continue a programme of major investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces has been proven.  In the three years 1995-7 no less than £29 million was provided in infrastructural investment in military barracks generally. When the voluntary early retirement scheme is completed at the end of 1998 a substantial amount of savings from the reduced Defence payroll will be allocated for equipment and infrastructural purposes.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the Defence Forces is developmental in nature.  The Government is fully committed to ensuring the Defence Forces become a more effective and efficient organisation geared to deliver the required military and other Defence services in a value for money way. I am confident the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan is the process to make this happen.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Deputy on his appointment as Minister for Defence and wish him success.  This is a time of great change for the Defence Forces and they will need a strong Minister to defend their case, with vigour, which I am sure the Minister will do at Cabinet.

      <P>Does that mean the target dates set out in the implementation plan outlined by the chief of staff for a variety of changes necessary in the Army, for example, the establishment of new units, the disestablishment of others, dealing with surplus personnel in some areas and shortages elsewhere, will need to be put back? I assume those changes cannot go ahead if the necessary legislation and regulations are not in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A series of changes are taking place.  There has been significant new recruitment, the establishment of a voluntary early retirement scheme and ongoing work in a consultative way on the establishment of the new units.  It is in many ways a slow process.  I expect that over the next 12 months further significant improvements will be made to speed up that process, but we must take account of the views of the representative bodies.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that when we achieve the complete review and reform, the men and women in the forces own that process, believe in it and have been fully consulted in making it happen.  I am not worried if we lose a month or two in waiting for legislation or regulations.  I am more concerned that the end result gives us a fitter, leaner, better, younger, more developed and enterprising defence force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that at the moment, from the ground up, there are concerns about some of the proposed changes?  I pay tribute to the firm acceptance of the Government of the continuing recruitment process.  It is extremely important for the Army that the Minister states what future recruitment will be.  There is nothing like new recruits to improve morale in the Army, as there is a shortage of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the statement made by the president of PDFORRA when he said exhausted Army drivers were falling asleep at the wheel and soldiers were carrying arms having done long hours of duty.  I also wish to draw the Minister's attention to the statement by the Chief of Staff when he said the current plan would need to be modified and that the same type of voluntary retirement scheme as in the past could not be used next year.  He also said that personnel would <Col N="722" /> have to move and it would be difficult to maintain the current barracks with the numbers envisaged in the plan.  Will the Minister respond to these comments by different Army personnel, both expressing concerns about some aspects of the implementation plan and worries about the lack of personnel to carry out the tasks we demand of our armed forces?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject of fatigue is covered in another question.  Some of the matters raised by the Deputy are probably more appropriate to a Second Stage debate but I will do my best to reply as fully as I can.</P>
      <P>It was never envisaged that the changes proposed following the Price Waterhouse review, conducted under the aegis of the efficiency audit group, would happen without some strain on the resources of the Defence Forces.  A reduction in manpower to 11,500 was agreed by the Government in 1995.  The Deputy is right as regards the voluntary early retirement scheme - it is not possible to go ahead with a similar scheme in 1998.  Whereas voluntary early retirement will still be the principal element, it is important we move forward to see where the gaps appear.  To consolidate the important work done up to now, a new look should be given to how the voluntary early retirement scheme will evolve to take account of the pressures which I accept are there, but which are inevitable in change.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding whatever difficulties exist, there are few people I have met in the military establishment, from third star privates to the very top, who do not accept the necessity for change. However, as that change evolves, it presents problems which have to be addressed.  One way to do this is to make sure there is continuous recruitment, to which we are committed.  I will make an announcement, following the Estimates, of significant recruitment in 1998.  I have already made a public commitment to ensure recruitment programmes are constantly in place to take account of retirements, so past problems due to the stop-go approach to recruitment will be resolved.  These will also address the age profile, which there is no point in addressing now if we do not continue to do so, as it continues to increase.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputy Fitzgerald that in reviewing the voluntary early retirement scheme for 1998, I will do everything I can, though of a voluntary nature, to take account of the pressures which have evolved so far.  I am also committed to continuous recruitment and I will make a major announcement in the near future as regards recruitment programmes for 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that he will substantially address the recruitment issue for next year.  As regards the changes to legislation and regulations he will bring before the House, does he intend to devolve more power to the military authorities and lessen some of the regulations?  There is an impression of overburdening by regulations and <Col N="723" /> the decision making process the Defence Force is subjected to, in relation to even the smallest item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the Deputy raises that question as one of the first functions I had to perform as Minister was to sign a particular document which perhaps would have been more appropriately signed by someone else closer to the resolution of the problem.  We heard the Taoiseach speak to the Deputy's colleagues about problems in the management of taxi and hackney services in Dublin.  One of the problems he addressed was that of the devolution of authority which worsened the situation considerably.</P>
      <P>I am a great believer in empowering people to take decisions about their future and I agree with that philosophy across every Department. However, from personal experience, raw as it has been in past Administrations I have served, the ability to take tough decisions is scarce when authority is devolved.  The ability to take popular decisions is in abundance.  Sometimes, in all Departments, but particularly in the Department of Defence, because of its regimental nature, obligations and the system which exists there, it is necessary to have the right structures in place.</P>
      <P>I am committed, to every possible extent, to ensuring the empowerment of the Defence Forces to take decisions on the changing procedures and changing times which require us not to concentrate decision-making in centres of power, but to devolve it as much as possible.  It has to be consistent with the obligations and national policy strategies which have to be adopted from time to time.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Michael Smith on his elevation to the office of Minister for Defence.  In office he was always approachable, constructive and independently <Col N="724" /> minded.  I wish him well in what Deputy Frances Fitzgerald has already described as an interesting and exciting brief.  I have no doubt he will have a successful tenure.  I am glad this memorandum is going to Government so quickly.  Will the options hinge on reducing the State's exposure to the processing of people's claims?  Is there an estimate of the number of claimants who may emerge with valid claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to answer that question.  There are approximately 9,900 claims currently on file alleging hearing damage or handicap from exposure to gunfire.  Approximately 872 of those have been settled.  The average compensation in those cases is almost £22,000.  However, £4,400 for plaintiff costs must be added to that figure.  Some 220,000 men and women have served in the Defence Forces, the FCA, Slua Muirí, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  We do not know how many claims may be submitted.</P>
      <P>The memorandum I will present to Government is not aimed at reducing the State's exposure to legitimate claims.  I want to ensure that people who have served or are serving in the Defence Forces and who develop a significant handicap from exposure to gunfire will always have the right to make a legitimate claim. However, I am concerned at some of the court awards which appear to be considerably higher than those obtaining in other jurisdictions for the type of hearing handicap which most people accept is not of an injurious nature.  I am working with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to establish an expert group which will develop hearing assessment criteria on which future cases can be judged.</P>
      <P>I accept that in the past handicaps were associated with exposure to gunfire.  The State is open to liability in such cases and we will respond to legitimate claims as far as possible.  It is also important to determine such claims on a fair basis rather than on the criteria which apply in other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on making rapid progress on this agenda in the short time he has been in office.  We all support the legitimate claims for compensation by those who have suffered hearing impairments.  It appears that 100 claims are still being received each week, while the average level of settlements and costs has decreased.  Is that correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 2,394 claims prior to 1996, but last year this rose to 5,164, which is approximately 100 claims per week.  That represents an avalanche compared to 1993 or 1994. Some of the awards granted by the courts in recent cases have been lower than those in earlier cases.  However, the Deputy must bear in mind that 25 or 26 cases were defended and the claims withdrawn.  These experiences may have helped <Col N="725" /> to determine awards similar to those at international level.</P>

      <Quest>whether Price Waterhouse management consultants have been requested to carry out further work on the reviews of the Air Corps and Naval Service; if so, the revised terms of reference given to the consultants; the expected date of completion of the work by the consultants; whether he will publish the completed reports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-1998, provided for special studies to be carried out on the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  In July 1996 the efficiency audit group engaged Price Waterhouse Management Consultants to conduct special studies into the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  The consultants subsequently furnished a preliminary draft report to the efficiency audit group.  This draft report highlighted issues which required to be studied in greater detail and identified a number of new issues which required examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence, rather than publishing a report that merely identified problems, it was decided that the consultants further examine these problems to produce a report that was as comprehensive and well grounded as possible.  It <Col N="726" /> is believed that the resulting report will produce a definitive blueprint for the development of these important services in the years ahead.  The consultants are due to report to the efficiency audit group in mid December.  It is my intention to publish this report at the earliest possible juncture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the report be published? Have the consultants considered the retention gratuity which the Minister is offering to Air Corps pilots?  One of the key issues is how to retain the pilots we are training given the incentives to move to commercial airlines.  Who is advising Price Waterhouse Management Consultants on matters relating to the Air Corps?  Are outside specialists working with them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>The answer to the last question is yes.  The report will be published as soon as possible after I receive it.  The report is expected to be with the efficiency audit group by mid-December. I do not anticipate a long delay in having it published once I receive it.</P>
      <P>There has been a considerable amount of misapprehension and justifiable anxiety about the amount of time taken to produce this report.  The Deputy will appreciate that the range of services carried out by the Naval Service and the Air Corps in drug interdiction, sea and air rescue, fishery surveillance and serving the community required a detailed and structured examination. It was necessary to ensure the report was sufficiently comprehensive to enable us to develop the right policies.  However, having said that, it has taken longer than I would have anticipated to produce it and I am anxious to publish it and move on to the integration of that process into the general review of the Defence Forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That incentive scheme is a central issue, but is the Minister aware there is concern that the differentials it will create in the Air Corps will be very bad for morale among senior officers?  Perhaps he ought to consider other incentives.  It is not an easy issue with which to deal.  However, is following that route not likely to create more dissatisfaction rather than achieving its very worthy aim, which is to retain trained pilots in the Air Corps?</P>

      <P>It is not too long since I was in Opposition, one of the attractions of which is the luxury of pointing out faults in Government schemes and recommending different schemes without having to say what they should be.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme is designed, as the Deputy said, to retain pilots in the Air Corps.  It was negotiated for particular pilots and is a far better arrangement that the compulsory retention scheme which existed prior to the introduction of this scheme by my predecessor on 1 August. Bearing in mind the manner in which Air Corps pilots are attracted to the aviation industry, which has improved dramatically, and the desire of my illustrious shadow spokesperson, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to manage the public finances with a degree of discretion, it is the best we can do.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to solve all problems and to make the same offer indiscriminately to everybody. It would be a grand world if we could always apply special incentive schemes across the board.  However, it would result in the disappearance of the incentive aspect for the group at which it was targeted.  We must concentrate the scheme on those for whom it was intended.  The consultative process has concluded and the letters of sanction have been sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question in relation to retaining pilots for the new Air Corps service which is to be developed for the east coast.  I also raised the question of the leasing or buying of the helicopter.  In terms of the long-term development of the Air Corps and in the interest of retaining pilots and developing their expertise, the Government could build confidence in the Air Corps and demonstrate its support by buying rather than leasing a helicopter.  Such a commitment from the Department of Defence to buying a helicopter and training our pilots to provide this service would improve morale and strengthen the wish of pilots to remain in the Air Corps.  It would mean the Department of the Marine was not calling the shots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, this matter is covered by a later question.  However, the proposals which have been made in this regard and have been put out to tender by the Department of the Marine will necessitate the very direct involvement of the Air Corps.  It is envisaged that a number of pilots will be immediately seconded to provide that service and the training process must get under way to enable the scheme to begin in June or July 1998.  It is further envisaged that the number of pilots will increase to nine or ten in a short time in order to provide the required range of services for the east and south east.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Air Corps pilots will be an integral part of the provision of that service, which demonstrates the Government's commitment to providing the best possible sea and air rescue service for an area which was neglected.  As the Deputy said, <Col N="728" /> the proposal has been made by the Department of the Marine but the Air Corps pilots will be an integral part of the provision of that service and the necessary training.  It will be my task to ensure the new recruits and cadets are trained to provide those new services.</P>

      <P>There are no specific educational requirements for enlistment for general service in the Permanent Defence Force. However, applicants for enlistment must satisfy interview boards that they possess a standard of education sufficient for service in the forces.  Generally speaking, applicants for enlistment in recent times have had a good standard of education.</P>
      <P>The medical standard for enlistment is as laid down from time to time by the relevant military authorities.  Applicants for enlistment are required to undergo a thorough medical examination and a physical fitness test in order to determine their suitability for military service.  The medical examination covers such matters as physical and mental health; disability, handicap or physiological alteration; the ability to undergo physical and mental strain and exertion; keenness of vision, including colour vision; hearing standard and height.</P>
      <P>These standards have general application and an applicant who fails any aspect of the medical or physical test is regarded as unsuitable for military service.  It is essential that only fully fit, young people are enlisted in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I am sorry for smiling as a I read out some of those exacting standards.  There was probably only a very short period in my life when I would have measured up to such standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  In 1994 the height limit for entry as a recruit was a minimum of 5' 2&rdquo;.  This was raised to 5' 5&rdquo; in respect of the recent batch of recruitment. The Fianna Fáil general election manifesto stated that maximum encouragement would be given to females to apply for recruitment.  In addition, the programme for Government contains a paragraph which refers to encouraging increased participation by women in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider reducing the height limit requirement from a minimum of 5' 5&rdquo; to 5' 2&rdquo;?  What was the basis for increasing it to 5' 5&rdquo;? Given that there is a difference between the average height of males and females, will he agree this requirement discriminates against females?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every confidence in the military authorities and the standards set for <Col N="729" /> enlistment.  The Deputy needs to take into account that standards are intended to take cognisance of the requirements and responsibilities under the safety, health and welfare at work legislation.  A decision was taken by the military authorities to raise the height requirement limit from a minimum of 5' 2&rdquo; to 5' 5&rdquo;.  While I am unable to argue against any disability this may present to female applicants, a huge proportion of the female applications would exceed the minimum height limit of 5' 5&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the need for strict regulations and changes to meet the new circumstances, commitments and legislative codes necessary in many different areas, I will reconsider this matter if I find that these regulations have a detrimental effect on applications by females for various posts.  However, a cursory glance at the new recruitment drive shows that there has been a substantial number of female applicants at all levels. Bearing in mind that this is the age of equality, it may be that the case made by the Deputy, including the suggestion that female genes do not have the same growth capacity as male genes, will get him into more trouble than my answer will get me.</P>

      <P>There were approximately 3,100 applicants from which 800 appointments were made.  There were no difficulties in getting the numbers to meet the medical, physical, educational and other criteria.  Up to 20 per cent of the applicants who were tested failed the hearing test.  Young people are listening to music at hazardous noise levels.  We need to take action regarding the noise levels at functions attended by young people, which are undesirable and injurious.  Between 15 and 20 per cent failed the physical test and approximately 10 per cent failed the medical test.  I will consider the possibility of short-circuiting some of the recruitment problems to ensure that applicants can be informed of their position at an earlier stage of the process.</P>

      <P>I do not know the answer to the Deputy's second question.  I will look into the matter and revert to him.  Approximately 86 per cent of all students virtually complete their second level education.  Taking this as a base it <Col N="730" /> may be assumed that a huge proportion of applicants to any of the forces have completed the greater part of their second level education.  The standard of education is generally good.  It is exceptionally good by international standards, even though there are aspects which we need to improve.  Having met young recruits I am confident that the standard is more than sufficient to meet the requirements of the Defence Forces.  I will always encourage the opportunity to participate in further study and training.</P>

      <P>Deputy Timmins made an important point regarding the change made to the height specification for applicants.  There has been no continuity in recruitment.  As a consequence, when it has taken place, there have been large numbers of applicants.  I would like to think that the change in the height requirement from five feet two inches to five feet five inches was not made to keep the number of applications down.  I ask the Minister to ascertain why it was necessary to make it.</P>

      <P>There will be constant recruitment.  I intend to announce before Christmas the details of a substantial recruitment programme in 1998 to fill vacancies left by members of the Defence Forces who have retired etc.  From time to time the military authorities review standards and criteria to comply with the provisions of new health and safety legislation, to take account of experience gained while serving with the United Nations and in settling claims.  These standards cover such matters as the height of recruits and physical fitness levels.  I have to rely on the advice of military authorities in this regard.  If there are aspects at which I can look in the context of a review I will be happy to do so without giving any commitments to introduce changes.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister every success. He is committed to achieving a gender balance in the Defence Forces.  I remind him that under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, one is not allowed to introduce restrictions to discriminate against women.  In altering the height requirement one may not be in compliance with that Act. In view of the fact that for many years the Defence Forces were exempt from the provisions of the Act, will women be specifically targeted in future recruitment programmes?</P>

      <P>I am committed to the principle of equality and the participation of women at all levels of the Defence Forces.  Recently two female cadets received their commission.  The Deputy is correct that the numbers are still too low and that there is a need to keep all avenues open.  In recent days I was asked the highest rank reached by a woman in the Defence Forces. When Minister for the Environment I was asked when the first female county manager would take up office.  Female participation is encouraged at all levels of the Defence Forces.  I will ensure no obstacles are placed in their way.</P>

      <P>I understood that difficulties were encountered in the recent recruitment programme in retaining recruits but the Minister seemed to imply that that was not the case.  I understood also that the numbers of applicants were down considerably.  This is understandable in a booming economy.  There is considerable scope for making more information available to the public about the career options available in the Defence Forces and about the work that they do.  The recruits to whom I spoke recently were excited about the opportunities for career development in the Defence Forces.  We will continue to encounter difficulties unless the work the Defence Forces do is explained more fully to the public.</P>

This is a serious matter and I ask the Minister to raise it at Cabinet.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  I raise this matter because I wish to heighten the level of public consciousness.  The Deputies opposite and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle as a medical practitioner are as concerned as I am that such a large number of young people have hearing problems. At some functions it is not even possible to have a conversation without having to shout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 1,376 applicants for 46 cadet positions, 370 applicants for 17 apprenticeships and 3,100 applicants for 800 enlistment positions. While the overall numbers were down for the best of reasons, thankfully huge numbers still want to join the Army.  Deputy Fitzgerald and her colleagues, including Deputy O'Shea, can make a contribution in providing information on the activities of the Defence Forces.  Some work has already been done in that regard.  While their work with the United Nations and in other areas is a source of great pride, there is a lack of understanding among the public of their functions and obligations.  It is only on ceremonial occasions or when a security problem has to be dealt with that the public become aware of their existence.  I will <Col N="732" /> find ways to heighten considerably the public's understanding of their activities.</P>

      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 provides for the implementation of a European directive on certain aspects of the organisation of working time.  Section 3 provides for its non-application to, among others, the Defences Forces and Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Defence Act, military personnel are liable at all times to render military service.  Therefore, the application to the Defence Forces of legislation relating to the organisation of working time would be contrary to the principle of military service and would have fundamental organisational and operational implications <Col N="733" /> for the efficiency and effectiveness of the Defence Forces.  As there is no sector of the Permanent Defence Force that is regarded as non-essential its application to &ldquo;non-essential areas&rdquo; does not arise.  This position is unequivocally supported by the military authorities.</P>
    <P>The hours worked by personnel on security duties vary according to location and the security position at any given time.  In general, personnel detailed for barrack or post security are employed on that duty for 24 hours.  The hours worked on other type of security duties, such as providing aid to the civil power, cannot be accurately predicted as it is dependent on the security position and resources available at any given time.  A security duty allowance is payable when Permanent Defence Force personnel are required to carry out such duties outside of their normal working schedule.</P>
    <P>Members of the Defence Forces are given adequate rest periods following or during occasions when long hours of duty may be necessary. In this respect, rest and sleep periods are often availed of during periods of extended hours of duty.  In addition the Defence Forces have a very flexible and general system of leave-granting, time-off and &ldquo;days resting off&rdquo; which reflects and caters for the uniqueness of military life.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied existing arrangements and conditions relating to time off and monetary compensation take full cognisance of the nature and requirements of military service and that application of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 to the Defence Forces would not be appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">

      <P>Has the Minister met representatives of PDFORRA to discuss the concerns expressed by its president at its conference in Tralee when he said that, with the reduction in the personnel numbers in the Defence Forces, 72-hour weeks had become the norm rather than the exception and gave an example of soldiers, within fewer than 24 hours of having completed a 72-hour shift in Portlaoise, having to participate in a 24-hour training exercise?  Has he investigated the specific complaints the PDFORRA president voiced at its conference?  Is the Minister concerned about such instances, which however few, demand a great deal of our soldiers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 85 of the Defence Act, 1954 in relation to service of members of the Permanent Defence Force states that every member of the Permanent Defence Force shall be liable at all times to render military service within the State and if he or she is employed on a State ship or service aircraft be liable at all times while so employed to render military service outside the territorial seas of the State.  Because of the very nature of security and the activities of the Defence Forces there will be occasions when members have to serve long hours.  For that reason it would be impossible to apply the provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act, <Col N="734" /> 1997.  As far as I can ascertain, that is largely the position of police and military forces worldwide.</P>
      <P>However, to answer the specific question Deputy Fitzgerald raised, I will meet members of PDFORRA very soon.  I had a brief opportunity to meet them on the occasion of their conference in Tralee.  This was not one of the matters I addressed then since that meeting took place just one day after my appointment.</P>
      <P>The type of example cited may well be the case from time to time but should arise in the most exceptional circumstances only.  However, the changes taking place, reduction in personnel numbers and possible delay in the recruitment process may well have imposed certain strains which I hope will be overcome very quickly as that recruitment drive percolates throughout the system and supports the existing cadre.  With such continuous recruitment I hope such pressures can be avoided.  Nonetheless, because of the exceptional nature of the service within the security area - all Members will have had such experiences both within the Garda and Defence Forces &mdash; such exceptionally long working hours may well occur but should be the exception because members are entitled to their rest periods, time off and adequate facilities.  Within the limits of our capabilities we must strive strenuously to ensure that it will be on the rare occasion only that such will be the case.</P>

      <P>The reply the Minister gave today in relation to the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 corresponds word for word with that he gave on 2 October last; yet on 8 October, almost a week later the president of PDFORRA made a very strong public statement to the effect that members of the Defence Forces were falling asleep at the wheels of trucks because of the hours they were expected to be on duty.  Surely that is not acceptable?  Does the Minister accept that its president would not have made such a big issue of it in public unless it was true and was giving rise to serious concern?</P>
      <P>Furthermore, would he agree that the spirit of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 could be applied voluntarily since its provisions sought to regulate in a humane way the hours any person, whether a member of the Defence Forces or otherwise, would be required to be on duty and alert?</P>
      <P>Does he agree there is a distinction to be drawn between members of the Defence Forces on active service on peacekeeping exercises or in supporting the civil power, say, in the case of road blocks and so on?  Does he agree that a distinction should be drawn between the day to day, routine activities of members of the Defence Forces and other special activities in which they may have to engage from time to time in support of the civil power?</P>

      <P>When I answered Deputy Fitzgerald earlier I approached the matter from a different angle, that is on the basis of an immediate <Col N="735" /> inquiry as to how the Health and Safety at Work Act was being operated within the Defence Forces.  Very considerable resources have been allocated to the successful implementation of its provisions; something like 63 different standards of a technical, military and other nature having been supplied to different members and an advisory military committee established.  The best possible effort is being made on the crucial aspect of the general health and safety of members of the Defence Forces.  The opportunity does not arise for any implementation of the provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 in the case of the Defence Forces.  Nonetheless, I will undertake to ensure that any such allegations &mdash; where they can be substantiated - are examined and steps taken to ensure they do not recur at all or in exceptional circumstances only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody knows better than members of the Defence Forces that exceptional demands can and have been made on them from time to time.  Therefore, I welcome the Minister's assertion that in modern times these long periods on duty must be exceptional.  Members of the Defence Forces are as entitled to health and safety at work as anybody else.  In fairness to the military authorities and the Department of Defence, that would be their approach to this issue.  To return to a point I put to the Minister earlier in relation to the current stage of the implementation plan, there are serious shortages of personnel in a number of areas.  It is much more likely, therefore, that people will be required to work excessively long hours, particularly on the Border where onerous duties are carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised when I saw the statistics on the average number of hours worked on Border duty which did not seem to present problems.  That sometimes belies sets of circumstances which, when averages are applied, can change the whole picture.  I said earlier in answer to questions from Deputy Fitzgerald that the amalgamation of the different units and the various stages of the implementation plan would cause certain difficulties.  That is one of the reasons I want to begin the 1998 recruitment programme as quickly as possible because gaps can emerge and they can only be closed fully with constant recruitment programmes.</P>

There are solid reasons it is important that men and women in the Defence Forces are not fatigued when performing their duties.  On the basis of a preliminary examination of these hours, they do not appear on average to present the type of problems outlined.  I have undertaken to revisit this matter to see to what extent I can help.  I do not want to bore the House by repeating myself, but one of the ways I can help is through substantial and constant recruitment and ensuring these gaps do not emerge in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that commencing in 1999 there will be net savings of the order of £15 million a year arising from the reduction in the strength of the Permanent Defence Force.  It has been agreed that from 1999 onwards 50 per cent of the pay savings will be made available to provide additional funding for equipment and infrastructural programmes for the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assessment of the early retirement scheme over the past year?  I understand engineers were targeted.  Is it true that a few million pounds will be returned to the central Exchequer because the Army currently does not have sufficient numbers of engineers to do the necessary planning to make the various infrastructural and general changes.  If that is true it is an indictment of the voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The early retirement scheme was voluntary.  Approximately 500 people availed of the scheme in 1996 and 735 this year.  It is inevitable that schemes of this nature, while reducing the overall numbers, do not address all the problems because they have accumulated over a long time.  This scheme is a somewhat crude though <Col N="737" /> necessary way of reducing numbers.  I would not be surprised if certain aspects of the scheme created problems although in the main it has worked successfully.  In my approach to the next phase of the VER I will have to take account of any problems that arose in the previous phase to ensure that we have the right people available to do the right work at the right time.  The Deputy is correct in saying there was a small refund to the Department of Finance in terms of capital moneys available.  In any of the Departments in which I served I never gave back a farthing to the Department of Finance.  I always made sure I had a sufficient number of plans in motion to use the funds available.  It is a matter of regret to me that I inherited that particular problem.  My Estimate for 1998, in terms of capital works, will be fully spent and I intend to put in place the preparatory work to ensure that will happen.  I have no doubt that I have the resources to do that.</P>

      <P>I welcome the expenditure on the upgrading of barracks, which is excellent, and great credit must be given to all concerned with that.  Other areas require further investment and I hope the Minister's budget will reach out to those.  Has the Minister decided to go ahead with the further development of the voluntary early retirement scheme, and does he intend to have consultations with the representative organisations as well as the military authorities in that regard?  If it is to go ahead it will obviously have to be much more targeted than previously.  Is that the Minister's intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is broadly the intention.  I am anxious to enhance the consultative process and be as engaging as I can in terms of determining the ultimate approach that will be made.  It is fair to say that my anticipation at this stage is that the VER scheme for 1998 will contain a number of new elements.  I do not like to use the word &ldquo;focused&rdquo; or &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; because we have to negotiate with the military authorities and the representative associations, but the end product will be one to which all of us would subscribe and will, in the main, attract people into voluntary retirement.  My responsibilities are to ensure that the scheme operates effectively not only for those who retire but, more particularly, for the people who remain in the service.  They obviously must be fully considered in that context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 26 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the progress to date of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan. Significant developments are taking place in the main areas addressed by the plan.  The key focus in the plan is on creating the right organisation to deliver value for money military services which meet the needs of the Government and the public.</P>
      <P>Following acceptance by the Government of the efficiency audit group's report in July 1995, an implementation group prepared a fully costed implementation plan for phase one of the proposals. The first phase covers a period of three years, 1996-98.  This plan is essentially strategic in nature and sets out the parameters and objectives within which the reform of the Defence Forces will take place.  The initial phase concentrates particularly on the reform of the Permanent Defence Forces structure and organisation.</P>
      <P>Reforms are being implemented in a planned and sensitive manner with the full backing of the military authorities and ongoing consultation with the representative associations in accordance with the agreed system of representation.  Since assuming office I have listened to a range of views within the Defence Forces and I will be anxious to ensure the process of consultation and communication is as developed and as inclusive as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of what the Minister said in reply to Priority Questions.  He said he is committed to consultation and involvement, inasmuch as involvement is possible within the Defence Forces, in relation to the changes going on.  There is a great need for further consultation. Has the Minister considered methods of consultation within the Defence Forces and, when the Price Waterhouse report on the Air Corps and the Navy comes out, the best way of imparting that information?  That is a very important aspect of the change if we want it to be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the first matters I addressed on assuming office.  The Price Waterhouse report on the Navy and Air Corps will present me with an opportunity because at that stage the process of integration into the Defence <Col N="739" /> Forces of that set of proposals will begin.  I was surprised at the level of consultation that had taken place - conferences had been held and special military advisers had visited each region. Since last May there have been about 22 meetings between officials in my Department and various representatives, RACO and PDFORRA, in the context of the arbitration and conciliation processes. Notwithstanding all that, we are talking about significant change.  In that process of change communication is critical so that the men and women involved believe in and take ownership of the process as we move forward.  I have undertaken to enhance that process and will give consideration to how I will do that on foot of the presentation of the Price Waterhouse report on the Navy and Air Corps.</P>

      <Quest>the estimated service life of each of the seven patrol vessels in the Navy fleet after refitting and refurbishment.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The service life of a Naval Service ship is determined by the level of operational activity.  The 15-16 year stage in a ship's life cycle is the optimum point at which a &ldquo;life extension/refit programme&rdquo; should be undertaken so as to extend the useful life of the ship to 30 or more years.</P>
      <P>At present the Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying patrol vessel, four offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
      <P>The European Union's current five year programme 1996-2000 provides for financial aid towards the cost of measures to enforce the Common Fisheries Policy.  Approximately £1.35 million was committed by the Department on EU-funded projects in 1996.  The Department spent £5.88 million in 1995 and £8.69 million in 1994 on EU-funded projects.  The position on the programme for 1997 is that Ireland's submission provides for a down payment on an additional naval patrol vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three of these vessels - <i>LE Emer, LE Deirdre</i> and <i>LE Aoife</i> - were refurbished at the Naval dockyard in recent years and another, <i>LE Aisling</i>, is currently undergoing a major overhaul at the same location to replace and refurbish obsolete or deteriorated equipment and extend its operational <Col N="740" /> life.  This work is due for completion by end January next.  The three remaining vessels &mdash;<i>LE Eithne, LE Ciara</i> and <i>LE Orla</i> - will undergo similar refurbishment during the next three years.</P>

      <P>It would be very unwise, in the final negotiations on the tender process for the next ship, to disclose what I think it should cost. To put it in rough terms, it could cost anywhere from £13 to £20 million and beyond.</P>
      <P>The existing ships are 15 or 16 years old.  Following a refurbishment programme their life could be easily extended to 25 or 30 years.</P>

      <P>The current state of production is that the series, &ldquo;Ballykissangel&rdquo;, and Pat O'Connor's &ldquo;Dancing At Lughnasa&rdquo; have just completed shooting at Ardmore.  This year the quantity of production in budget terms will exceed the 1996 level.  There has been a discernible improvement in the creative strength of Irish projects in recent years.</P>
      <P>Since the Irish Film Board has been re-established, and by the end of this year, approximately 44 feature films and series, 20 documentaries, over 20 shorts and 13 animations will have been made with the assistance of the board.  Of the feature films and series, 34 have had Irish directors and 25 had first time directors.  Irish people have been on the receiving end of images of Ireland and Irishness from time immemorial.  The significance of the Irish Film Board's achievements is that Irish film makers are now able to speak directly to an audience at home and our best work can be exported abroad in an epoch of increasing globalisation.</P>
      <P>The capacity of the people to tell their stories through the most powerful medium in the world is being greatly accommodated by the activities of the Irish Film Board.  The Bill will enable me as Minister to continue to fund the board in the years to come, subject to the annual Estimates process.  For this reason I confidently commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Iarraim ar an Aire leanúint le polasaí cuimsitheach an Tuar-Cheatha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the limit of the total amount of funds which can be expended in investments, loans and grants from £15 million to £30 million.  It is an enabling measure which my party will support because it is an indication of the outstanding success which the pioneering policies of the former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, pursued during his tenure in the then Department of Arts, Culture <Col N="742" /> and the Gaeltacht.  The four year review is most valuable and I hope it indicates a commitment by the new Minister and Government to give full support to Bord Scannán na hÉireann as practised by the former Government.</P>
    <P>There is a strong emerging film industry in Ireland which is receiving worldwide attention. The quality of employment has improved and expertise is growing, driven by the wise training programmes the board has pursued in partnership with employers, trade unions and training professionals.  The board and its chief executive have been very successful.  Mr. Louis Marcus and the chief executive, Mr. Rod Stoneman, dedicate long arduous hours to the proposals placed before them.  The working group system has been outstanding in its choice of recommended scripts. The films are offered for investment and the take up of television and satellite companies assures a limit to risk taking.  It is then up to cinema sales. This certification process is time consuming and for their dedication alone, the House owes the board members who worked since 1993 sincere thanks and gratitude.</P>
    <P>The annual report is in a progressive format. There is a full review of the previous year's activities and proposals to be implemented in the coming years, including a commentary on the objectives and policies of Bord Scannán which are outlined in concise terms.  They are all worthy of support, particularly by the Minister, Deputy de Valera, and her Department.  The objectives are to promote the creative and commercial elements of Irish film making and film culture for home and international audiences.  The board supports a number of film projects through the provision of development funding.  It also provides production finance by way of debt/equity investment for a selected number of films.</P>
    <P>While I understand the experience of other countries has made remote the objective of realising a rotating fund role for the board, the Minister should indicate whether she intends asking the chairman and members to follow the policies of other State development companies, such as Forbairt which is now using preference shares and equity more frequently when investing.  The decision not to allow the promoters to offset loans already issued was laudable.  However, the Minister should state her view on the rotating fund role.</P>
    <P>The board also encourages the development and training of technical, artistic and production skills.  The STATCOM initiative was outstanding since its membership comprised senior representatives from RTE, Forbairt, the IDA, FÁS, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Bord Fáilte, the Arts Council and the Department.  This group has helped the labour force work towards self-sufficiency and consolidated the use of the advanced computer and digital-based technologies available today.  This has encouraged rapid growth in small companies, some in rural areas and there are outstanding examples in the Gaeltacht area. There is now a great climate of achievement and <Col N="743" /> I hope the Minister will build on the current air of confidence.</P>
    <P>During my period as the Minister of State in the Department I visited many small companies, particularly in the west, which built on the confidence the former Minister, Deputy Higgins, engendered in this area.  I was disappointed today that the Minister dwelt solely on Fianna Fáil's role in creating confidence in this area because the evidence shows that all parties are anxious that it grow.  The greatest tribute must go to the former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who in bad times and good pursued goals and objectives which led to the current position.</P>
    <P>There has been an unusual delay in the appointment of a chief executive and staff in the Screen Commission.  This idea has been floated since 1995 and the previous Minister agreed to establish such a commission.  I do not understand the prevarication in the Department.  The Minister said it was a draft proposal but I understood it was a solid recommendation worthy of support. I hope the Minister will ask her officials in the Department to deliver their considered opinion on it quickly because she needs to take action on this matter.  There is a constant clash between the interests of Departments and the Department of Finance and the rules and regulations it intends to set.  While the Bill contains a housekeeping measure in section 2, any delay in moving on such progressive proposals gives the wrong impression and deters qualified people who might be interested in the post.  The chief executive post in the Screen Commission is a very responsible one, as this work needs to be completed urgently.  We accept that co-productions are a fact and the means to empower home and foreign filmmakers to work here are needed.  When in Opposition, the Minister constantly exhorted us to look for partnership developments, but she has been in office for several months and has done nothing in this area.</P>
    <P>The former chairperson, Ms Leila Doolan, claimed that although it is an imperative of technology that major and commercially driven multinational production and distribution will grow, nevertheless the creativity, surprise and universality of our unique critical vision and individual imagination are equal to their deepest challenge. That is what someone on the Minister's side had to say about further investment in the Screen Commission.  I urge the Minister to have her officials sanction this reasonable request urgently.</P>
    <P>During Ireland's recent successful EU Presidency, the Government agreed the format for the European Guarantee Fund for cinema and television production.  Why did the Minister did not refer to this in her speech?  There was strong debate on Europe's role in cinema and film production during the Irish Presidency, and the point was made that something was needed to counter the influence of America.  Could the Minister give a summary of any work done by her or her Department in this area?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> Ireland must pursue this role, because even though the Irish Film Board is promoting indigenous film activity, we must plan for the future of the cinematic space.  RTE is obliged, as the Minister knows, to establish closer links with the independent production sector and they have successfully helped to commission independent programmes.  However, there is still a huge amount of US-made film, especially in the children's area.  This is coming to Europe more and more, and there is a danger that cheap cartoons from America will replace the very good animation sector developed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that Teilifís na Gaeilge in particular has developed this valuable cultural and educational role, and it has pursued it professionally in the children's TV area.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not refer to the growth of industry attached to Teilifís na Gaeilge, especially the multilingual aspect of some of those companies.  There is a company in the Ring Gaeltacht where translations are done into four or five languages.  I saw &ldquo;All-Ireland Gold&rdquo; being produced there with the commentary being translated from English to Irish and other languages. In the Baile Bhúirne Gaeltacht I saw the work of Seán Ó Riada's son, who has different schemes to set up and who deserves support.  These are young companies with vibrant Irish people who have returned from abroad.  They should have some programme to work to.</P>
    <P>Recent studies have claimed a link between crime and violent images, which is worrying.  This issue will not go away, and I commend the board for its work in this area.  There are parents who believe that violent on-screen images should be controlled.  Researchers have discovered that offenders already prone to violence are able to remember more details of cruel actions and identify more closely with characters who performed violent acts on screen than with victims or nonviolent characters.  There is a clear notion abroad that films inspire copycat offences.  Will the problem of screen violence become a political issue? Do we have cases that parallel the death of Jamie Bulger?  Have the Minister or her Department any views on this matter?  The content of films was not discussed in the Minister's speech and she should have given her opinion on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is also disappointing that the Minister did not mention an agreed development programme with the IDA.  The then Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht negotiated with the IDA for an investment programme.  The former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, strongly urged Mr. McGowan, the IDA chief executive, to complete this programme.  We know that investment in films can be very profitable.  The work contributed by the board and the reliefs in the Finance Act give scope to make substantial gains, though there was unease in the industry when Fianna Fáil published various proposals before the election.  I hope the Minister sustains the current high confidence in the industry by pursuing the effective policies of the previous Government.  Both investors <Col N="745" /> and workforce are anxious to create a thriving sector.  The Minister should help them achieve their aim.</P>
    <P>Other sections of the Bill are housekeeping provisions.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report stated his satisfaction with the work of the board officials.  We will tease out the controls proposed in the Bill, and this might best be done by way of amendments on Committee Stage.  There is already a history of industrial relations difficulty in the Minister's Department. The Minister might refer to whether or not this Bill will lead to the same impasse as at the Collins Museum.  Is this not leading the Minister into the same problem?  I hope she will answer these questions when we table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with this Bill.  She is working in an exciting area.  I am glad she is negotiating an agreement with Australia, which I am sure she would like to visit, as she likes to visit the sun from time to time.  St. Patrick's Day would be a nice time to go and sign that agreement.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht an phíosa reachtaireacht t-uasteorainn seo.  Fáiltím roimh an dá mhalairt atá ann: an le caiteachas Bord Scannán na hÉireann a mhéadú, agus roinnt eagrú i gcúrsaí foirne.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for this Bill and I wish her well.  This is the Minister's first legislation in this area.  I welcome the Bill's reorganisation of staff and the raising of the upper level in relation to the certified expenditure by Bord Scannán na hÉireann.  I cannot oppose much of the Minister's speech in so far as it describes much of my own practice.  Another interesting parallel is that I introduced my first Bill, the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, within a similar period of time.  The Minister referred to what was done between January and May 1993, my first five months in office, including the funding of the Irish Film Board, the establishment of STATCOM, the establishment of an independent commissioning unit in RTE when I lifted the cap, changes in section 35 and the commitment to Teilifís na Gaeilge.  We must consider about seven measures together to understand the impact which occurred in early summer 1993.  In an area where there is such cross-party support, it is not useful to say who was responsible for particular measures.  I was the Minister with responsibility for film in two Governments with different complexions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the memory of Tiernan MacBride who was outside the House to welcome me on the day I was appointed.  I remember he had a placard suggesting a film board.  I met him previously in 1987 when funding was removed from the Irish Film Board.  The board was not disestablished as the Minister suggested but rather funding was removed from it.  I do not claim to have re-established the Irish Film Board but to have <Col N="746" /> funded it.  When we funded it, we decided to give it a particular emphasis.</P>
    <P>There is cross-party support for the Bill's proposals and I support much of what the Minister said.  Instead of confining herself to proposals in this short Bill, she was correct to take the opportunity to give us an idea of the direction which she wishes activity in the industry to take.  I assure the Minister she has my support for much of this and I will spend some time suggesting areas of scope for cross-party support.</P>
    <P>The seven measures adopted in those first six months, to which I referred earlier, had critical effect and would not have been possible without the working group's report handed to me by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  This provided a basis from which to depart.  Other work, including that by Film Makers Ireland, was crucial.  The film community had kept faith in the possibilities of film during the period 1987 to 1993 which was as dead as a door nail.  We need not argue about it given that total expenditure on production in those six years was under £12 million. I am glad expenditure is being maintained and has been increased this year as opposed to last year even though the number of projects has fallen.  It is also important that the indigenous component is being maintained.  The film making community, those who assisted it and the working group made so much possible.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty in the relationship between the Minister with responsibility for film and the Minister for Finance in any Government because of the structure of the thinking.  I inherited a situation where the received wisdom was hostile to film in that it was considered neither an industry nor a service.  It reflected a certain rigidity and paucity in thinking.  Historically, the first Irish Film Board was badly treated in the way people commented on it and it should have been given a chance.  The failure of nerve was a political one. There was also a suggestion that one could look at the commercial side of finished film which would suffice instead of at the arty farty types producing films.</P>
    <P>The best reforming legislation that will be introduced after this short Bill will be, I hope, a departure point for film makers.  I will put my points positively to the Minister and suggest where I might assist her.  I have had the benefit of negotiating with Governments of different complexions on a new Department.  For example, when dealing with ceilings on staff numbers, the position of a new Department and the bodies for which it is responsible is entirely different from that of an established Department responsible for bodies which have existing baselines.  It is nonsense to suggest a Minister could, for example, move the National Museum to its new facilities with new expertise on the existing baseline.  I sympathised with the Minister, wished her well and told her she will have my co-operation in trying to resolve the industrial relations difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is, however, an impossible task in that one cannot do new things on imaginary baselines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> One can justify expenditure to start things up because one is doing new things.  In the case of the National Museum, there is a list of reports the length of my arm which have not only expressed disappointment but have condemned outright the neglect of the museum.  The Minister spoke about what she inherited but that is what I inherited.</P>
    <P>The film section in the Department, which employs some of the founding members of the Irish film industry, is totally understaffed.  If one wants to talk about possibilities in a new area, one should accept that point.  I would support an approach by the Minister to the Department of Finance in that regard.  I was glad the small number of staff employed by An Bord Scannán was referred to.  Perhaps no smaller group of people has given such a huge administrative outturn.  If one looks at the total amount spent on salaries versus the amount handled and processed, the ratio is extraordinary.  We, as citizens, are getting incredible value for money.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued for an equivalence between the section 35 initiative and the refunding of the Screen Commission.  I referred earlier to a number of other factors, including independent commissioning in RTÉ, the arrival of Teilifís na Gaeilge and the establishment of the training initiative and STATCOM, which must be taken together.  Section 35, which is important in many cases, is at its best when integrated into what is made possible by the Irish Film Board.  In fact, the Minister adverted to this by listing films which were the work of Irish directors.  The most satisfactory outcome of my time in office was the number of Irish directors.  The tax incentives were becoming locked into the indigenous film making sector.  The Irish cinematic space was, therefore, being strengthened.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the glitzy Hollywood image which was a bit of a conversion because she recommended that to me when I was Minister and suggested that high expenditure foreign films were necessary to create training opportunity.  I always believed in the indigenous sector and had many reasons for so doing.  The industry will remain after comparative advantages have disappeared in the long term.  It is the way of the future.  It was also a fine basis on which to argue in a European context for a specific European cinematic space.</P>
    <P>When the atmosphere is right for film making things happen.  Kevin Rockett's publication on Irish cinematography is of immense significance in this regard.  There is no point blaming a particular administration for not putting the archive together.  Between 1987 and the early 1990s people who attended international conferences had apologies ready as to why nothing was being produced.  There were one or two good years and then suddenly there was a huge volume of production. I commend the Minister on referring to the films which have received the approval of international critical panels, including &ldquo;I Went <Col N="748" /> Down&rdquo; which has won many awards, including one at the San Sebastian Festival.</P>
    <P>This is the real test.  Younger and older directors are now confident to go abroad with their work.  Certain measures must be taken to advance this progress.  The Irish Film Board should be treated as a special case, ring-fenced and given additional staff.  There is also a case for expanding the board on the basis of suggestions put forward by the staff.  I enjoy much greater freedom now that I am no longer Minister.  When I was Minister I was criticised for conceding on some aspects of the original INDECON report on the film industry, &ldquo;A Strategy for Success Based on Economic Realities - The Next Stage of Development for the Film Industry in Ireland&rdquo;.  Rather than wait for the end of the review period we should seek to have provision made in the Finance Bill for the proposals in the later INDECON submission which succeeded the report.  I make this point in a positive way.  The report referred to a review period but the later submission presented to me by Mr. Gray, the economist who guided INDECON, put forward proposals which the Department put to the Department of Finance. These proposals should be put to the Minister for Finance in time for inclusion in the next year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>We should proceed with the establishment of the commission.  To ensure a balance the commission should be strongly influenced by film makers and take account of budgets and film making of different sizes.  Members of the film investment community may be more articulate but they already have a voice through IBEC and it would be wrong to put them in the same category as those who make films.  While they all should be involved, I agree with the Minister on the importance of the funding alliances established between RTE and the Irish Film Board, between the Irish Film Board and Teilifís na Gaeilge and between the Arts Council, the Irish Film Board and Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Such alliances are to be recommended.  My points are made by way of positive suggestion on what should be achieved in the short term.</P>
    <P>I have a difficulty with the reference in the Minister's speech to the industry think-tank.  It is good to hear that the industry is thinking but I am not sure if the proposals put forward by STATCOM, which represents the various agencies, the Irish Film Board, RTE and FÁS and has built up experience over several years will become the baseline for the think-tank.  What will the think-tank do with these proposals and why was it not capable of putting forward proposals before this through the semi-State agencies on which it is represented?  In some cases it has a majority of representatives on the board of these agencies.  Why does the work of one body have to be ended and handed on to another?  I am not clear on the logic behind this.</P>
    <P>I am glad the co-production agreement I initialled with the Australian Ambassador will shortly be debated in the Australian Parliament, <Col N="749" /> after which it will be signed.  If 22 of the 40 members of the Council of Europe have signed the European Convention on Cinematic Co-production does it mean they have ratified it and that this will lead to a shorter time span for finalising co-production contracts?  The Attorney General's office and the legal affairs office undertook much tortuous work in the production of the Australian agreement and if it was used as a model the other co-production agreements could be finalised more quickly.  I am looking at the matter from the outside but I imagine the time span would be shorter if one used that model rather than waiting for ratification of the Council of Europe initiative.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that by the end of the year 44 feature films and series, 20 documentaries, 20 shorts and 13 animations will have been made with the assistance of the board.  This is an incredible record.  Thirty four of the 44 feature films and series have had Irish directors and 25 have had first time directors.  That is the basis for future progress.  There is nothing as fickle as those who invest money to avail of a tax break.  All these people are interested in is whether the Revenue Commissioners will issue the tax certificate and whether they will get the tax break.  They do not mind if the film is made in the bush in Australia or in Ballyhaunis.</P>
    <P>Having said that, films could not be made without such investors and their interests have to be taken into account.  However, it must be put in context.  After section 35 was amended and when further amendments were being negotiated some irresponsible people in this community circulated publicity leaflets in North America, thereby almost bringing everything that had been done to its knees.  I very rarely travelled abroad when I was Minister but on the one occasion I visited the United States I spent much of my time trying to undo the lies which had been printed by British tabloids about the Irish system.  That was assisted by the fact that people who were fund-raising for investors wrote letters to client bases in the United States and Canada stating that they must invest because section 35 was nearing an end. Section 35 was simply amended.  It is to the credit of the officials who worked with me, particularly Mr. O'Grady who travelled to the United States with me, that we replied to those articles, explaining the changes that took place.  In referring to section 35 I am not scoring a point.  All Ministers want the most favourable regime for film.  I am simply saying that in terms of finance, in light of what we now know, a finely tuned system would have my support.  There are ways of devising such a system which would minimise the tax leak and maximise returns in terms of job creation and expenditure in the economy.</P>
    <P>Tax concessions such as section 35 concessions are of most benefit to those on higher incomes.  It is yet another tax break for those who can afford to pay tax.  One cannot be indiscriminate in dealing with this matter.  It behoves us to have a finely <Col N="750" /> tuned system.  If, as has been the history of the Irish film industry, it creates jobs, new skills and partnerships with various institutions, such concessions are justified.</P>
    <P>I agree to some extent with the point made by the Minister when in Opposition that changes made on foot of the INDECON report, addressed at Irish investors, miscalculated the nature of United States investment in the film industry.  We are talking about an internationally competitive market and that investment could be won back by making changes.</P>
    <P>We are discussing the Irish Film Board, and Deputy Carey is right in referring to the imaginative nature of the reports produced by it, of which there are three.  In the last report dealing with the period 1995-6 a number of specific proposals were put forward.  Lelia Doolan made a number of points which deserve consideration.  I join with others in paying tribute to her, her successor, Louis Marcus, and all the members of the board. A number of interesting proposals which deserve consideration were put forward on the future of the film industry.  There is reference, for example, to education.  It is important that the Department of Education co-operates with other Departments. If new films are to achieve mass audiences and rise against the tide, as is required in Ireland and Europe, media appreciation and reading of film should be included in the school curriculum. It is a powerful tool of citizenship to contextualise films, documentaries and so on.</P>
    <P>There is also reference to training.  As Irish film production increased in recent years we regularly exported pieces of work to Britain.  There should be a link between pre-production and post-production facilities to achieve as many skill formations and create as many jobs as possible.  I agree the purpose of the film commission is to ensure representation at home and abroad, to be representative of what is happening in the cinema at home and at the same time attract such industrial products as will result in the best training modules. The commission, which should not be ridden with bureaucracy, should be established as soon as possible.  There should be flexibility to ensure the best people work in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to films that won international awards.  People who qualify from film courses have cards printed stating &ldquo;Film Producer&rdquo;, but standards and excellence are important.  There is great value in external validation of films, as in the case of &ldquo;I Went Down&rdquo;, because they are validated by juries who know the system.  On all the films mentioned by the Minister, the reviews were positive.  The jury's view is important but it is also important that films be commercially successful.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister agrees with me about the attraction of the cinemobile which visited the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's area.  I visited it as it moved to various villages along the Border and to say it received an enthusiastic reception is an understatement.  The cost involved in such a project is very high, about £200,000, but the effect <Col N="751" /> would be enormous.  It is what was one time vulgarly called a budget sweetener, and was recommended as such.  All of us from rural Ireland remember what it was like to go to the pictures. It is sad to think of what happened all those buildings where films were shown, although there is now a recovery of seat sales through omniplexes and so on.  The cinema was a crucial part of our lives, as it is in many countries, particularly northern Europe.  It is important legislation in this area receives support.  The Minister should indicate to her colleague, the Minister for Finance, that there is cross-party support for exceptional measures in this area to secure employment and create new opportunities.</P>
    <P>We could all get excited about what could be done to ensure Ireland is populated by people who are not simply consumers of images made by others but who make films on their own terms.  It is important that resources are made available to that end.  The number of people working in this area would fit in three modern telephone kiosks, it is certainly far fewer than the number of people of high grades working on aspects of the single currency.  People have to be realistic in doing new things.  It was very difficult to do something new when one's Department was treated the same as any other Department in respect of staffing, expenditure and whatever.  What can be done in this area is important not only for employment and industrial reasons but for cultural reasons. There is a meaning to cultural diversity and the right to make one's own films and show them as expressions of oneself is an aspect of that cultural diversity and a powerful tool of democracy.  I hope there will soon be a response to the list of items which occur to me as the next consolidating and developing steps in Irish cinematic activity and the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech and presentation of the Bill.  I agree it is time the subvention to the Irish Film Board was increased. I support the Bill and the increase in revenue from £15 million to £30 million which can be expended by the Irish Film Board.  It is important to look at the work of the Irish Film Board and the enormous contribution it has made to our culture and in no small way to employment.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the former Minister, Deputy Michael Higgins, who is widely and deservedly respected for his dedication to the arts, culture and film industry.  During his term of office he set a shining example.  I know the Minister will give equal commitment and make a similar impact during her term of office.  In presenting the Bill and in her wide-ranging proposals for the Irish Film Industry she has given an indication of her intent.  She will have all-party support for this and future initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a deep interest in the arts and culture. Cork Corporation - where I am a member of the arts committee - recognises the importance of arts and culture to our city.  I commend Cork <Col N="752" /> Corporation for its policy and commitment to the artistic and cultural life of the city which includes the very successful Cork International Film Festival now in its 42nd year.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the board members and staff of the Irish Film Board for their vision and foresight in developing the industry to the advanced stage it has reached today.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Board was reconstituted in April 1993, by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht under the Irish Film Board Act, 1980.  It provides support by way of development and production loans which are repayable.  Since 1 January 1997, the board received 191 applications for developing loans and 42 applications for production loans.</P>
    <P>The figures for direct Irish employment are as follows: 1993: 480; 1994: 1,291 and 1995: 1,266. The 1993 figures exclude independent television production.  The slight drop from 1994 to 1995 reflects the closure of a major animation studio and conceals an underlying upward trend. Development and production loans provided by the film board are a crucial element of the support measures for the indigenous film industry.</P>
    <P>The film board is only one component of film development.  There is a danger that future funding to the board is seen as all that is required.  The board was underfunded.  Clearly more finance is necessary and that is the reason I welcome the Bill but other issues need to be addressed, such as professional training at all grades.  The Coopers &amp; Lybrand report identified the need for producer training.  The INDECON report has more specific training recommendations.  FÁS and the film board have also looked at this.</P>
    <P>Cork has no real training programmes.  CAVERN, a local film makers group, St. John's Central College and Triskel Arts Centre have all run video courses.  These are not professional training courses for film-making.</P>
    <P>Galway Film Resource Centre, Film Base and NCAD offer real training and their students &mdash; such as Paddy Breathnach with his recent production &ldquo;I Went Down&rdquo; - are now in a position to make film-board funded films.  Cork is not creating film-makers to use this money.</P>
    <P>Film Base and Galway Film Resource Centre give young film-makers a chance to develop. Cork does not have a subsidised BetacamSP suite or any 16mm or 35mm.  A resource centre such as that in Galway, is vital in Cork.  Much of the good work that has been done in Cork has been in community video through Outreach programmes run by Triskel and local community groups.  This sector is badly in need of equipment and I ask the Minister to look at it in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the level of interest in film in Cork - and a vibrant film culture - with a 25 per cent increase in box office receipts at the recent Cork Film Festival, KINO and Triskel are screening serious cinema.  Clearly there is a growing film culture.  The producers and technicians are not there to benefit from this growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> The Coopers &amp; Lybrand report identifies the lack of producers as the major weakness in the industry.  While steps have been taken - such as the media programme - there is still an absence of producers.  The film board and section 35 tax concessions offer the space for producers to work but it is ultimately up to the producers to make things happen.  Business-driven training in film production is necessary.  The media programme has a number of initiatives but there is no reason management departments at third level cannot develop post-graduate training.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any film infrastructure in Cork there is no easy access to information on training, funding, crewing etc., thus the film board's money is further away from the local &ldquo;would be&rdquo; director.  It is essential that this gap is filled.  A resource centre would provide a focus for the information but short of this something else must happen.</P>
    <P>In looking at the level of film activity in Ireland we can say at last that we have a vibrant indigenous film industry.  We are no longer dependent on the US and the UK for visual entertainment on the television or in the cinemas throughout Ireland.  Last summer the Cineplex in Cork City had four Irish films showing at one time in the six-screen multiplex.  A few years ago this would not have been possible.</P>
    <P>What is even more satisfying is that films such as &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; broke all previous attendance levels in cinemas throughout Ireland.  This proves there is a market in Ireland for indigenous films.  More recently with the release of films such as &ldquo;I Went Down&rdquo; - director, Paddy Breathnach - and the &ldquo;Sun, Moon and Stars&rdquo; - director, Geraldine Crew - we see the emergence of a new generation of young film-makers.  This year 14 films have been made in Ireland.  This can be attributed largely to the hard work and support of the Irish Film Board under the direction of Rod Stoneman, chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>A successful marketing strategy begins at the script stage and peaks on the screen.  More investment is needed to allow film projects go into development.  Given that we have proved there is a capacity to produce Irish films we need to consolidate our strengths and address our weaknesses. This is an area which must be looked at seriously especially in smaller European countries. It is difficult for indigenous films to make a profit in the face of the massive Hollywood.  Its marketing machine spends billions of dollars promoting its films.  Government support is essential to protect a developing industry against the power of the dominant players.  Once indigenous film makers develop a foothold in the market, they can secure future success and greater returns to the economy directly through the development of sustainable employment and location and indirectly through employment in support services and invisible exports, such as tourism.  It also ensures the social need to reflect Irish society and to understand ourselves better.  There is a cultural imperative to allow Irish artists create great films <Col N="754" /> that will enable us compete equally on the international stage.</P>
    <P>The STATCOM report identified a number of critical training needs which must be addressed urgently.  This process was initiated under the aegis of the National Training Committee and Mary Lyons.  One of the courses, film marketing and distribution, was held during the Galway Film Fleadh.  A STATCOM workshop was held in Galway and a number of others were held in Dublin.  Dublin and Galway have leaped ahead of the rest of the country in this area, partly due to the institutional support those cities have received.  The Film Institute of Ireland is located in Dublin and the Irish Film Board is located in Galway.  There must be more investment in film making centres other than in Dublin and Galway. I hope Cork will be considered as the next natural hub for institutional investment.  We in Cork want more investment and training in the Cork region. The three centres could then work together to ensure the rest of the country has an opportunity to participate in film making activities.  Last year the Irish Film Board commissioned a report on film marketing and distribution from Helen Guerin, a lecturer in marketing in University College Cork.  I hope this tool will assist film makers to successfully reach their target markets.</P>
    <P>The digital revolution presents new opportunities for Irish film makers and multi-media producers.  As a result, the cost of broadcasting will be greatly reduced and the demand for educational materials greatly enhanced.  Ireland is well placed to exploit these emerging opportunities due to our high standards of education, flexible size and fluency in English.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, Cork can boast the only arthouse cinema in the country.</P>
    <P>This cinema, run by Mick Hannigan, from Blackpool, and Una Feely, gives the general public the opportunity to see films from around the world, including Ireland.  It gives people a choice of films other than the standard Hollywood fare of violence and special effects common in the &ldquo;Terminator&rdquo; type of films.  There should be greater support for this alternative and other cities should consider the possibility of setting up arthouse cinemas.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned CAVERN, the Cork Audio Visual Education and Realisation Network. It is the Cork equivalent of the Film Base in Dublin and the Film Centre in Galway.  While still in the early stages of development, CAVERN promises to provide training and access to resources for the Munster region.  To do this, additional funding needs to be invested in purchasing capital equipment.</P>
    <P>Cork also wants more money to be invested in training in the technical aspects of film making to allow more people avail of the employment potential.</P>
    <P>It is a cause for serious concern that we need to hire in technical crews to work on films made in Ireland.  We need greater investment in this young industry if we are to reap the economic <Col N="755" /> rewards.  We need this investment to help preserve our Irish culture in the face of growing globalisation.</P>
    <P>I am happy to support the Minister's Bill which will provide continued funding for the Irish Film Board.  It will provide the means for the continued success of the film industry.  We must acknowledge that the industry has been successful. Since the re-establishment of the Irish Film Board there has been an unprecedented level of film making activity.  We have also achieved success where it ultimately matters, at the box office. It is appropriate that we are enacting this legislation at a time when an excellent new Irish production &ldquo;I Went Down&rdquo; is number one at the Irish box office.  I congratulate Paddy Breathnach and his team for scooping three awards at the <i>Sunday Independent</i> Ford Ireland Awards last night.  The new Irish films were the first to sell out and the reactions of the audience were very positive.</P>
    <P>While this is very encouraging, we must put in place structures that will enable the industry to effectively compete in a very competitive international marketplace.  The Irish Film Board has been extremely successful in ensuring Irish films are made and Irish film makers are able to express their skills and talents.  It is vital that we have a clearer focus on the marketing and promotion of Irish films at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>It follows that we must allocate the necessary resources for effective promotion.  We must acknowledge the domination of the international cinema industry by the major Hollywood studios which share 85 per cent of the box office in Europe.  This is not a complaint, it is a fact.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we can learn from how the Hollywood model ensures its industry is successful.  Marketing is vital if the Irish film industry is to achieve the level of success we want.  No fledgling service or manufacturing business would receive public moneys without the appropriate State agency scrutinising its marketing strategy.  The film industry should be treated on a similar and equally positive basis.</P>
    <P>It is clear there is enormous international interest in Irish culture, in music, theatre and literature.  We must plan to ensure similar success in the area of film making.  I am aware that various film festivals across the world are currently planning Irish seasons.  The Brussels international film festival in January 1998 is devoting a special programme to 20 years of Irish cinema.  Such programmes are largely cultural events, but they have real advantages for the Irish industry in reaching new audiences and attracting press coverage.</P>
    <P>They attract the attention of film distributors which is useful ground work for later box office success.  We should facilitate such events in a coherent and planned fashion to promote Irish cinema.  We should have effective stands at selected festivals and markets, similar to stands from other industrial sectors and from the film promotion <Col N="756" /> agencies of many European countries.  We should treat our film industry with the same seriousness.  A successful film industry is not simply about production.  It is about the effective exploitation of those productions, about reaching cinema-going audiences at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>We must also invest in training.  We must have a talent base that can continue to produce original films which Irish and international audiences wish to see.  While film productions rely on the imagination, talent and skills of many people, the key to a good film is the script.  Audiences want to hear a good story.  The Irish Film Board should be asked to put in place a programme to nurture screen writing talent.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to a number of those points.  A maxim of the film industry is that while one can make a bad film of a good script, one cannot make a good film of a bad script.  Such a programme would enable our writers to develop good scripts in which producers will want to invest to make films audiences will want to see.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a literary heritage second to none. We continue to produce playwrights and novelists who achieve international acclaim.  However, we do not have the medium to develop the specific skills necessary for successful screen writing.  If this were to happen during the Minister's tenure it would be a valuable contribution to the future of the film industry.</P>
    <P>The international audio-visual industry is sophisticated and complex.  Ireland is a very small player in this global industry.  With imagination from our film makers and the Minister, Ireland could make a significant impact on the cinema screens of the world.  I have every confidence such imaginative responses will be forthcoming from the Minister and for that reason I am pleased to support the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking this is a noncontroversial Bill.  It will be welcomed by the film industry and on behalf of Democratic Left I also welcome it.  As a proposal from a Fianna Fáil Minister, it contrasts sharply with the treatment by a former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, of the film board as recently as 1987.  When citing dubious commercial criteria he, in effect, closed down the film board at the time.  The success and expansion of the film industry since 1993 has been in sharp contrast to the neglect of the indigenous industry during the period from 1987-92.  The Ministry of Deputy Michael Higgins was and is recognised as a watershed for film making in Ireland.  That the Minister should now claim credit for Fianna Fáil for the development of the film industry smacks of some opportunism. Charles Haughey's record is part of the story too, but she neglected to mention it.  Fianna Fáil is yet again trying to airbrush Charles Haughey out of history as if he never existed.  Film may belong to the world of illusion, but the Minister should not try to delude herself or us about the story of film making in Ireland in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> In Opposition the Minister rightly spent much of her time arguing for consultation and openness. She was preoccupied with listening to the interest groups and the people who were involved in the industry and to her credit she was assiduous in preparing the ground for office.  I recall in one interview she criticised the previous Minister for having run a personality driven Department and maintained that her interest, if she were given the job, was in a policy driven Department. Although she is now more than four months in office, we are still waiting for policies that will drive her Department.</P>
    <P>Her biggest test so far has been to oversee the opening of Collins Barracks as part of the National Museum.  I appreciate it was not her fault but she must account for what happened. The Government managed to turn a triumph into a fiasco, essentially because of the intransigence of the Minister for Finance.  He was asked to deal with a modest claim by the museum staff, which was reckoned to amount to an increase of £20,000 per annum.  The opening of Collins Barracks cost approximately £70,000.  It is regrettable that has proved to be such an unnecessary thorn in the side.  The intransigence of the Minister for Finance in regard to what should have been a wonderful event in Irish cultural life must be condemned.</P>
    <P>In this Bill an enabling provision gives the film board a continuing important role in assisting film making, and staffing arrangements are being rationalised under it.  The Minister referred to the Screen Commission.  I was surprised to hear she had not yet met the various interest groups to hear their views on it and its draft terms of reference nor has she established the think-tank promised in the Government programme.  She said she will make a decision on the Screen Commission &ldquo;very soon after meeting the groups&rdquo; and she will establish the think-tank &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;. We are entitled to question the failure of the Minister to set deadlines and her failure to establish a policy on two important areas in the film business.  If she has any difficulty making decisions at this stage in her tenure it does not augur well for the future.  The future of the Government is to an extent tenuous because of numbers.  There is a certain reticence in making decisions.  The ground work for the Screen Commission was laid before the Minister's time in office.  The think-tank is a commitment given in the programme for Government.  It would have been helpful to flesh out that proposal and to hear the Minister's views on the decisions she will make on it.</P>
    <P>The need for a screen commission is well known and well grounded in our experience.  We are competing with other countries which have developed their own commissions and marketing organisations.  The previous Minister, Deputy Higgins, established the Screen Commission before he left office.  The film board submitted its draft terms of reference before the Minister took office and as yet there is no indication as to when <Col N="758" /> the Screen Commission will move fully into action nor how the funding of its work will be ensured.  I understand there has been only one informal meeting of the Screen Commission and I would like to know if that is the case.  I get the impression that everyone is waiting for the Minister to outline and declare the policy and the terms of reference she has promised.</P>
    <P>Currently Ireland does not have an effective marketing arm in this most competitive of industries. Film making is highly competitive globally. Other countries have Government supports, as we do, and they also have marketing capability. Because our marketing is so limited we seem to be operating with one arm behind our back and experience tells us that can be a serious handicap.</P>
    <P>When limited section 35 changes were introduced by the previous Government commissions and bodies elsewhere exploited the opportunity to bad mouth Ireland's attractiveness as a destination for film making.  It was damaging to the good reputation we had built up and it was instant in its effects.  Rebutting the negative messages took time and showed up - if anyone was in any doubt - the importance of having a screen commission in place.  I would be grateful if the Minister would refer to this in her reply to the debate.  There is a desire in the film community to address the disadvantage Ireland has experienced and there is concern about any further delays on this.</P>
    <P>We need a timeframe for the think-tank she is establishing.  A strategic plan is highly desirable, but when a strategy is being drawn up there is always a danger of prevarication and delay.  I expect the Minister in drawing up a strategy has some idea of a timeframe for the work of a think-tank. There are many worthwhile reports the preparation of which involved much effort, gathering dust in various Government Departments because sufficient time was not given to the implementation of a report.</P>
    <P>I note the last speaker referred to County Cork and inevitably the Minister will be brought on a tour of the country.  As a public representative for County Wicklow, I believe that county can lay particular claim to being the film making capital. The village of Avoca, among many others, in County Wicklow has been transformed as a result of film making activity.  Historically Avoca was a mining village and when the mines closed the community was devastated.  The community suffered the negative impact of economic decline, rural depopulation, high unemployment and desperation. With the filming of &ldquo;Ballykissangel&rdquo; and national and local efforts in regard to village renewal, the village of Avoca has been transformed. If anyone wants to see the impact of film making and how beneficial it can be at local level, they only have to visit Avoca.  The biggest problem there is adequate car parking facilities to accommodate visitors.</P>
    <P>The town in which I live, Bray, also has a tradition of film making, particularly tied into Ardmore Studios.  Ardmore Studios have made a <Col N="759" /> major contribution at national level, and particularly in terms of economic life, to the town of Bray.  That facility is being used by national and international film makers.  Post-production facilities have improved and the stages in place are used effectively.  In fact there is a danger of having to turn down business because of the lack of stages and office space.</P>
    <P>We are all aware film-making is not like other industries.  Many of the jobs are temporary and the benefits are widely spread beyond those directly involved.  A range of people benefit &mdash; taxi drivers, dry cleaners, extras and those directly involved.  There is a tradition of film-making in Bray which is part of the reason we can now acclaim young film-makers from Bray like Pádraig Breathnach and Robert Walpole who were involved in &ldquo;I Went Down&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, because of the nature of the diffuse benefits of a film being made in any locality, it is not always easy to obtain the usual industrial development grants available for other forms of industry.  While post-production facilities in Ardmore have been improved, there is a need for further expansion of stages and office space but it may not be possible for Ardmore studios to avail of the normal industrial development grants.</P>
    <P>The provision of a laboratory in Ireland as a form of capital benefit is another suggestion made to me.  I ask the Minister to consider discussing with the Minister for Finance the possibility of granting tax designation status to Ardmore studios.  I have no doubt this form of assistance would have benefits outweighing any negatives as regards a loss to the Exchequer and would enable studios to expand and develop as necessary.</P>
    <P>I welcome the work of the film board in the area of training.  There has been slowness in establishing training courses although I appreciate that the many skills deficiencies are being tackled.  There is need to provide skilled people in a range of areas across the sector, from entrepreneurs to producers to sound engineers to backup staff.  I hope we can continue to expand training opportunities.  It is remarkable that we have a skills and workforce shortage in various industrial activities.  We need to put money into enabling people to take up the jobs and opportunities in film-making.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also comment on the role of RTE?  The abdication by RTE until recently of its role in the making of drama productions was disappointing in addressing the cultural needs of the people.  The screening of the series, &ldquo;Making the Cut&rdquo;, and the critical acclaim it rightly received, clearly showed that need.  We need to see, in dramatic terms, our evolution as a society and an expression of where we are now.  RTE, and any other television station which is established, has an important role to play in this.  I know RTE is placing considerable emphasis on technological advancement, but we have to look <Col N="760" /> at its cultural and educational role as well as its technological requirements.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see that the Irish Film Board recently joined the English language cinema plan which includes film commissions from New Zealand, Australia, Britain, Canada and South Africa.  The aim is to co-ordinate national policies to counter-balance the dominance of English language film by American cinema.  The Minister has outlined trans-national arrangements she is making, but I ask her to address the question of how to ensure there is space for English-speaking film-makers producing Englishspeaking films, comparable to the productions of American film-makers.  This is not a chauvinist criticism of American film-makers.  We are greatly influenced by American film-making but there has to be diversity.  The challenge is a continuing one in relation to how we can prevent ourselves being dominated and overwhelmed by cultural messages and forms of expression from that source.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute, as others have done, to the contribution of Leila Doolan and her successor as chairman of the film board, Louis Marcus.  They and many like them in the Irish film-making industry have kept the faith through many hard years.  The business is healthier than it has ever been but we should not ignore the fact that it has not always been so.  It is in a healthy state and I wish the Minister well in devising a future for film-making in Ireland that will produce greater expansion, development and opportunities &mdash; both for those on the creative side of film-making but also those whose livelihoods depend on it &mdash; to ensure that future is good for all of them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Minister's invitation to cover a number of areas relevant to the activities of the Irish Film Board.  I am impressed by the work of the board and the input various Ministers and chairpersons have made over the years.  I do not want to get involved in a back-slapping exercise so I will focus on the investment side and the deficiencies in the current regime which ought to be remedied.</P>
      <P>The film industry welcomes the invaluable support the Government is giving to the film board &mdash; particularly in seed funding projects and also integrating our film industry with other European initiatives.  I am impressed by the range of integration measures outlined by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The film industry is still in its infancy, when compared to the development of other industries. The future of this fledgling industry is in jeopardy and it could be placed in serious danger in the next two years or so unless certain actions are taken.  The Fianna Fáil Administration which <Col N="761" /> established the film board should be congratulated for its initiative, particularly in introducing section 35 tax concessions.  The importance of this incentive cannot be underestimated if Ireland is to have a sustainable and viable film industry. However, the watering down of section 35 by the last Administration has been detrimental to native film-making, which will be the bedrock of a sustainable industry in the future.  Ireland is ideally placed as a centre of film production.  We have always had the essential ingredient - the ability to tell a story.  As is said in Hollywood, the three most important ingredients in a film are the script, the script and the script.  We have that talent in abundance.</P>
    <P>Another important ingredient is the English language which is the language of the world cinema. In Germany films are made in English and dubbed in their native tongue.  Producing films in English is easy for us.  We have always had our good share of actors who have made their mark not only in Ireland but across the globe.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have begun to hone the other necessary skills in sound, camera, lighting, editing and so on.  We have produced directors who are among the best in the world.  However, the negative changes to section 35 of the Finance Act, introduced by the previous Minister for Finance, could spell the death knell for that vital catalyst in our film industry, the indigenous film producer, particularly in light of the incentives now being offered by the Labour Government in the United Kingdom.  If there is to be a flourishing Irish film industry, we need Irish producers who not alone develop scripts, appoint casts, cameras and directors but who can also put the financial package together.  This is the core of any industry and the film industry is no exception. There is no point having financial incentives for the film industry if the main beneficiaries are movie moguls from Hollywood.  We must support Irish producers in a European context if we want an Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>There are those who say the incentives are too generous as they represent a direct loss to the Exchequer.  However, what did it take to industrialise Ireland from Seán Lemass's first economic plan to the Celtic tiger of today?  A myriad of initiatives, including financial incentives, tax breaks, grants, subsidised exports and technical advice, were needed to kick-start and sustain industrialisation.  It did not happen overnight, so why should we expect it for the film industry?</P>
    <P>We must support this industry because its potential is huge and the rewards are significant. It brings us quality skilled and well paid jobs, on the one hand, and a subtle propaganda tool to present ourselves through the most popular mass medium in the world.  What needs to be done and why must we do it?  We must foster Irish produced films, not only films produced in Ireland by foreign producers.  We must ensure that Irish producers can go to the international marketplace, <Col N="762" /> particularly Europe, to raise the finance to produce Irish and European films.</P>
    <P>Irish films need investment from outside Ireland if they are to be made.  There is a limit to the amount of investment available.  We are able to attract sizeable investments for two reasons. Under the original section 35 of the Finance Act, Irish producers were able to bring 20 per cent of the budget to any project as well as a substantial cash flow.  Once the vital initial investment was made, it was almost certain that a project of calibre would attract the remainder of the budget. The change to section 35 means that initial investment has now dropped to 12 per cent at best and sometimes to as low as 9 per cent with a consequent knock-on effect on cash flow.  This has made it more difficult for Irish producers to operate in the competitive marketplace.</P>
    <P>This difficulty is compounded by what is happening in the United Kingdom.  For years the film industry in Britain looked with envy at the success of our film industry which was largely due to the original section 35 initiative introduced by a Fianna Fáil led Government.  The British film industry has persuaded the new Labour Government to introduce tax incentives which are more attractive than anything Ireland introduced.  In addition, it has allocated substantial sums of money from the UK lottery to the film industry. That is a real threat to our film industry.  At present, investing in a UK English speaking film is more attractive than investing in an Irish one. If we are to succeed in the future we must face this threat and redress the balance.</P>
    <P>What must we do to grow the indigenous film industry?  Budgets for Irish produced films are modest by world standards.  Some £5 million would be a large budget for an Irish film, whereas £50 million would not be extraordinarily high for something produced in Hollywood.  We need a sliding scale of tax incentives which will maximise the industry but will benefit the Irish produced film.  For films up to £5 million, the tax based investment should be increased to 70 per cent, the tax write-off should be increased from the present 80 per cent to 100 per cent as it was in the original section 35 and the pay back period should be increased from one year to three years.  This means Irish producers would have between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the budget in addition to a good cash flow which would give them a strong hand in trying to attract the remaining budget in the marketplace.  For films with a budget in excess of £5 million and less than £12 million, up to 60 per cent of the budget should qualify for 100 per cent tax relief over three years. For budgets in excess of £12 million, the present arrangements will suffice - 60 per cent of the budget qualifying for 80 per cent tax relief which must be paid back in one year.</P>
    <P>If this approach was adopted, we would have a vibrant film industry producing quality jobs.  It would be a net contributor to the economy and to the Exchequer and it would be able to proudly fly the flag for Ireland world-wide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Pat Carey for sharing his time with me.  We are all in agreement that the Irish film industry is a success story.  It has developed in recent years and we should be proud of it.</P>
      <P>There are a few people who can take credit for the development of the film industry.  The former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, is one such person.  He helped to move it forward during his term in office.  I was delighted he discussed the working group's report during his contribution. I remember when the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, set up the Film Institute of Ireland, of which I was a member, and when that report was presented.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins said he took on board many of the points made by different people in the industry when he was Minister. I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy de Valera, will also encourage its future development.  I hope it will be a huge success.</P>
      <P>Many people kept faith with the film industry through difficult times, such as Mr. Tiernan MacBride who was a member of the Film Institute of Ireland.  They knew that if the right mechanism was put in place, the industry would develop.  The industry is at an important stage in its development.  Many other countries encouraged the development of their film industries.  Australia's film industry, for example, was successful but it seemed to hit a wall.  We should examine why it did not develop as it should.</P>
      <P>The Film Institute of Ireland is the designated national body charged with responsibility for the promotion of the culture of the moving image in Ireland.  Since its inception, it has defined its role as tripartite.  The film archive of the Film Institute of Ireland has been engaged in the laborious, time consuming but crucial work of identifying, collecting, preserving and conserving Irish films and related material.  The transfer of moving images from old film stock to more durable modern media is not only a necessary act of conservation of the national film heritage, but also a rendering of that heritage into more immediately usable forms.  The film archives have become a major and continually expanding resource for research into, and understanding of, the cultural history of modern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Irish Film Institute, operating through the Irish Film Centre and its screening facilities, seeks to broaden, deepen and enrich the experience of film culture through the deployment of a suite of programming strategies.  These include specialist screenings of archive material and the best of Irish and international cinema, themed film festivals, conferences and seminars with Irish and international film makers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since opening in 1992, the Irish Film Centre has been sustained by a loyal membership base and by the development of ancillary entertainment and catering enterprises.  In its relatively short existence, the film centre has become precisely that - a centre for debate and dialogue, with access to and direct engagement in the practicalities <Col N="764" /> of film culture.  The Irish Film Centre successfully blends entertainment and education.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Institute's education department is in many ways the most important and valuable dimension of the institute's work, which I will put in context.  In Ireland we have one of the world's most avid cinema audiences.  Irish film goers make more visits to the cinema than is the case almost anywhere else in the world.  It is true the number of cinemas has decreased nationally, but the number of screens has increased.  The trend towards shrinkage in the film audience which occurred for almost three decades has been reversed in recent years with an annual increase in audience numbers.</P>
    <P>This is a curious phenomenon of which there are many possible interpretations, one of which is the part played by predictable and repetitious television programming.  The beady eye of the box in the corner of the living room does not hypnotise in the way it formerly did.  Alterations to the demographic profile of the population, the increased spending power of those in a position to milk the Celtic tigress and enhanced mobility conspire to generate growing numbers of consumers for the products of the cinema industry.</P>
    <P>We should be aware, however, that cinema screens are increasingly monopolised by the product of the cinema industry based in Hollywood. Whether one finds this admirable, regrettable or deplorable, it is self evident that Hollywood represents the most efficient global concentration of film expertise and capital and the most intense development of marketing and distribution muscle.  We may say the typical Hollywood product is bland, homogenised and custom made for an undiscriminating global market, and that it constitutes an insidious form of cultural imperialism at worst, or an invisible form of cultural penetration at best.  Nevertheless, we must also concede that the Hollywood industry has always been capable of producing the exceptional product, the film that fundamentally impacts upon our perception of the world and our place in it.</P>
    <P>It is an inescapable fact that Hollywood now addresses its product to a global audience.  The product may be homogenised but the audience is not.  Herein lies a series of opportunities.  The audience for film remains local, national, culturally diverse and ethnically and ethically differentiated. Hence the existence of many national film boards charged with the responsibility of producing films reflective of the culture and value systems of indigenous and diverse film audiences. I greatly supported the former Minister in his support of the French defence of its film industry during the GATT negotiations.  I felt that the Hollywood industry was trying to completely take over, which would have had a catastrophic effect on the very important French film industry which produces many fine films.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong, however, to see the various national film boards as forlorn, last ditch stands against the might of Hollywood.  That would grant <Col N="765" /> a homogeneity to Hollywood which it does not possess.  &ldquo;Hollywood&rdquo; is merely a shorthand term for the intensifying process of media and capital conglomeration into fewer and fewer trans-national communication corporations.  The production division of a media corporation makes a film, and then the promotion, publicity and advertising divisions market the product globally. There is no way that a national film board, no matter how well organised it is or richly endowed with funds, can hope to compete with the trans-national market makers.  What can, and is, being done is that national film boards can seek to complement and supplement rather than compete.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Institute's education department already has in place the expertise and appropriate educational structures, processes and technologies to underpin its participation in, and its contribution to, the study of film and film culture in Ireland.  The institute, equipped with its high quality screening facilities and the rich resources of the film archive, is uniquely placed to become a leading player in the coherent development of media studies generally, and particularly film studies.</P>
    <P>The institute has provided in-service training for teachers at all levels of the education system. It has organised special screenings, lectures and seminars at the IFC for thousands of students and, as far as its limited finances has permitted, has tried to bring those services to a national audience.  Inevitably, the financial constraints imposed by the inadequate allocation of £11,000 from the Department of Education means the institute is continually frustrated in its efforts to provide access to the educational programme for all those who not only wish, but need, to avail of its service.</P>
    <P>As a former member of the institute, I know how much work it has done in this regard over recent years out of limited resources.  The Minister should examine whether extra resources can be provided for this area because, as has been proven in the development of our economy, education provides jobs in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Institute is poised to cater for all levels of the education system.  It is situated at a crucial nodal point from which it can draw on the best national and international expertise and practical experience.  It is in constant dialogue with parallel institutions around the world.  It has immediate access to all the required visual and documentary material necessary for the coherent development of film studies in Ireland.  It is a national resource which is ready to be recruited to serve the national interest.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister will do a very fine job in developing the film industry.  This has been an excellent debate and it is good to see Members on both sides agreeing, more or less, on the huge success story of the Irish film industry.  I wish the Minister and the film industry well.</P>

She put forward some very positive proposals during that time which I am sure she will implement now.  I also recognise the work of the former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  He added new energy to the film industry, which has not gone unnoticed at home and abroad.  His enthusiasm influenced many people, which is why we have such a thriving industry.</P>
      <P>We have had a tradition of film making here, although not all the films were indigenous.  A number of major films were shot in my county. The shooting of &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo; put Dingle on the tourism map.  People still visit the area to see the location of the film.  I have met cyclists from Australia and walkers who have climbed to the top of Mount Brandon because of this film. &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo;, an epic film based on the short story by Maurice Welsh, a north Kerry writer, was, unfortunately for County Kerry, shot in Counties Mayo and Galway, which got the tourism spin-off.</P>

      <P>Agreed.  We get too many All Irelands.  &ldquo;The Field&rdquo; was also shot in County Galway, in Leenane.  These two major films were based on the works of north Kerry writers. Deputy Michael D. Higgins will be delighted to know that John B. Keane's novel <i>Durango</i> will be filmed.  The rights were bought last week for a considerable sum of money.  We will be calling on the Minister to try to ensure that the film will be shot in Kerry.  The people there must put together a good package to the promoters in Los Angeles to encourage them in the shooting of this epic story, which deals with a cattle drive through north Kerry during the last world war.</P>
      <P>The Irish Film Board was re-established in 1993 to promote the creative and commercial elements of Irish film making and film culture for the home and international audiences.  The board supports a number of film projects through the provision of development funding and provides production finance by way of equity investment for a selected number of films.  It has been successful, despite failures.  Had it not been re-established and reconstituted in 1993, I doubt if we would have had such success today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the incentives available in Ireland are attractive they are modest compared to those offered by some of our European counterparts. The UK Government is now offering incentives which surpass ours.  This will create major competitive problems for our industry.  For example, <Col N="767" /> a film such as &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; could have been shot in Scotland were it not for the incentives available here.  We should not become complacent about our new found success in the film industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Money speaks all languages.  All film board funded feature films have had a substantial component of market money from a broadcaster or distributor as an essential element of production finance.  Over the years, film makers have proven to be tenacious and inventive in pursuit of commercial investment.  This is reflected in the funds they have been able to obtain and source to match the funding available here.  Prior to the establishment of the film board, few films were made in Ireland each year.  This compares to the situation today where over 20 feature films and television series are made annually.</P>
      <P>Before the establishment of the film board, Irish film producers were at a serious disadvantage as they had little or no Irish finance to bring to the table.  Therefore, they found it difficult to negotiate on such matters as an Irish cast and crew and shooting location.  Apart from these considerations, obtaining funding for a feature film without support from the home country is extremely difficult.  At present, a film board supported film can go to foreign markets with up to 30 per cent of its budget in place from the domestic market, funded by the board, section 35 and RTE.</P>
      <P>The incentives available under section 35 are similar to the corporation tax levels of 10 per cent in terms of attracting foreign investors to the industry.  That is why it is important that they are retained and, if possible, made more attractive. Some argue that the section represents a loss to the Exchequer.  However, when the spin-off in terms of employment, including investment in accommodation and equipment and the sourcing of crews in Ireland following the development of indigenous expertise are considered, it represents an immeasurable benefit to the local economy. Doubtless the figures in terms of employment numbers and financial return are difficult to quantify, but one only has to consider the publicity such films give to the country to realise the extent of the benefit.  They contribute to the advertisement of the tourism industry and of the way of life in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish films supported by the film board have won critical and audience acclaim in festivals throughout the world.  For example, three of the last four films to win the prestigious San Sebastian <Col N="768" /> Film Festival Best Film award - &ldquo;Ailsa&rdquo;, &ldquo;Trojan Eddie&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Went Down&rdquo; - were supported by the film board.  It is unprecedented for a country of Ireland's size to achieve such success in this and other premier international film festivals.  More recently, &ldquo;The Last Bus Home&rdquo; was voted the best film at the Cherbourg British and Irish Film Festival.  The impact of other recent films, such as &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; and &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo;, together with pending films, such as &ldquo;Dancing at Lughnasa&rdquo;, &ldquo;I Once Had a Life&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Butcher Boy&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Nephew&rdquo; makes it difficult to comprehend the success of what has happened.</P>
    <P>The accelerating production activity on this island provides a striking manifestation of the effectiveness of the integrated film and television policies put in place in 1993.  The energy displayed by the then Minister influenced many people and gave them confidence to invest in the industry.</P>
    <P>As the industry expands and develops, producers and directors are discovering new and innovative sources of finance, and, with the help of the film board, are obtaining commercial success, reputation and respectability in the market place.  The support of the film board has a snowball effect on the industry with producers, directors, cast and crew obtaining more experience with each film made.  The rising tide of increased activity also lifts technical expertise, facilities and infrastructure.</P>
    <P>As the industry develops, the need to employ foreign talent and crews diminishes and the pool of talent in Ireland expands.  The Minister mentioned funding for training, which includes a provision under the industrial operation programme for £2.58 million, £1.2 million of which has been spent already.  That is very welcome.  I understand that recently 15 people successfully completed the first sound editors course to be organised at Ardmore Studios.  Previous to this sound editors had to be brought from the United States.  RTE and FÁS asked four professionals from the United States to provide the necessary training. This will broaden the range of technical expertise available here.  The Minister should recommend the course to her think tank as a model that could be used in other areas.</P>
    <P>We need to stress the need for quality in film, documentary and video production.  This has been done in the case of the computer, electronics and food industries.  Inferior productions are no longer acceptable.  We have the necessary infrastructure and key personnel at all levels of the industry to satisfy the requirements of any producer who decides to film on location.  I have heard it said that our film and technical crews create a good impression, they are friendly, cooperative and hardworking.  In other countries, because of union restrictions, it is difficult to find crews which are as flexible and available day and night.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Shortcuts&rdquo; is a joint initiative between the Irish Film Board and RTÉ.  It provides young <Col N="769" /> producers, of which there are many throughout the country, camera operators and technicians with an opportunity to gain valuable experience.</P>
    <P>I commend the independent production unit in RTÉ, especially Clare Duignan and Clare Mitchell, on its efforts.  I was involved in the production of five videos on north Kerry writers which were critically acclaimed.  They would not have been completed without the help and co-operation of the independent production unit.  It should receive greater support.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister well and pay tribute to her predecessor who adopted a handson approach.  He was enthusiastic and showed great foresight.</P>
      <P>The film industry has gone from strength to strength.  In considering production loan applications the Irish Film Board takes into account the extent of the Irish input in terms of personnel. This is an important factor and provides people with an opportunity to become involved in the industry.  It is heartening that people respond in such large numbers to appeals for extras who participate on a voluntary basis.  The Minister for Defence has often made Army personnel available. Their enthusiasm, interest and co-operation have in no small way facilitated the development of the industry.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and the further investment in a growing industry.  The Bill presents us with an opportunity to express our opinion on its future development.  Irish people have consistently been successful in the entertainment and service industries.  We should seek to create further opportunities to build on our success in these industries which provide employment without damaging the environment.  The film industry is a green industry, the type of industry we should actively promote.  It encourages us to make the most of our natural and cultural heritage.  We have a great deal to offer in so far as we have a highly educated and skilled workforce and have gained considerable experience in an industry which fits the personality of the Irish.  It will provide many opportunities for those young people attracted to its technical side.</P>
      <P>I commend the efforts of the former Minister who showed great vision.  I have no doubt that the Minister will build on his success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a debate such as this one tends to be taken on a tour of the country.  We all wish to draw attention to specific projects in our constituencies or counties.  Ireland is but a small dot on the map and I like to think that people from abroad look beyond the capital to what we have to offer.  I will not apologise therefore for mentioning the achievements in my constituency.  In examining <Col N="770" /> the areas we represent we can focus on the policies that will succeed in building a national success story based on a strong national policy.  I exhort the Minister to acknowledge the revolution taking place within local communities, who have focused on an industry they see growing and within which they perceive a role for themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the involvement of Young Irish Film Makers in Kilkenny in the production of a film entitled &ldquo;Under the Hawthorn Tree&rdquo;, a good example of what I am talking about.  To observe young people between the ages of seven and 19, without any adult involvement, participating in the production of that film and presenting it in a truly professionally manner is a clear indication that there is indeed a future in film making here.  Having observed the manner in which that group and film evolved, regardless of the funds being committed for the implementation of this Bill, additional steps must be taken to ensure that such groups are properly funded.</P>
    <P>I have seen similar groups in other counties forced to go to the United Kingdom and America to raise funds for film production.  That is no harm because it makes them focus on their endeavours, value the money they collect and provides them with an opportunity of interacting with other similar groups at home and abroad.  It also affords them an opportunity to import their new-found education, talents and skills for the benefit of their local communities, creating new jobs and hope where none existed.</P>
    <P>That is a very positive way of building on the success of the film industry.  Unfortunately, in instances like that of the Young Irish Film Makers, insufficient funds are allocated to adequately recognise their time and input, sometimes given voluntarily.  When one considers parents' commitment to such organisations, they too have committed talent, skills and time.</P>
    <P>We should not merely throw money at them but make it possible for them to have access to sufficient funds to enable them bring a worthwhile project to fruition.  In the instance I quoted, Channel 4 saw the expertise and potential of that local community and was willing to assist in the development of that film.  It is the kind of pilot project or success story that could well be further examined and developed by the Minister's Department with the involvement of indigenous communities in the advancement of this industry.</P>
    <P>That type of activity invigorates a local community and gives them an opportunity to participate on the world stage within the film industry while allowing them develop their talents and creativity. It is good for personal and individual expression in addition to the local economy, as we discovered in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>When one observes the value local communities derive from that type of activity, one can readily acknowledge that it is worthy of the support of any Department.  Its value is also acknowledged in the various initiatives being taken to market various counties in the course of film <Col N="771" /> making.  In the case of Kilkenny, various local interest groups, the Chamber of Commerce, the Young Irish Film Makers, the local authority and enterprise board all came together to devise a marketing strategy for the film industry.  They actively sought local community involvement in marketing themselves on the world stage, attracting the types of films compatible with their locality.</P>
    <P>It is wonderful to see a medieval city like Kilkenny and the county become involved in modern film making.  There is much involvement by the Office of Public Works in the restoration of historical sites.  Such activity adds value to the expenditure of public funds since it benefits not only tourism but augments the enjoyment of the indigenous community without damaging the environment.  Once such films have been produced locally and screened inevitably their content exposes Ireland to a whole new market, in addition to being a great source of satisfaction to political figures and various officials involved in the maintenance of such historical sites which feature in them, thus adding to their overall tourism attraction potential.</P>
    <P>A national film marketing strategy must be devised in co-operation with the many Government Departments involved, incorporating the great work being undertaken at constituency and county level, thereby ensuring that that local marketing strategy is matched with its national counterpart, not so much by way of grants but through some form of access to funds to ensure all of this can take place in a cohesive manner for the benefit of the country generally.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to information technology. There are many picturesque and historical sites nationwide which could be of enormous value even in the case of a modern film.  These places could be highlighted through information technology, super-imposing their locations in the course of editing films in which they might appear.  A library of that kind should be established and made available to those who produce or edit films, thus exposing such sites to the overall marketplace.  That is another aspect of the industry which has been supported by many enterprise boards, involving young people directing and making films through their digital equipment.  However, the cost of such digital equipment can be a deterrent to many young people wishing to become involved in film making activities, such as the Young Irish Film Makers and other such groups at the cutting edge of the industry who wish to forge ahead in the marketplace. They should be facilitated in the purchase of such equipment and extend their services, through information technology, to locations outside this State.</P>
    <P>At a time when Ennis has been awarded the Telecom Éireann &ldquo;Information Age Town&rdquo; award, when Telecom is investing some £10 million in information technology in schools, surely we have reached a stage in our development at <Col N="772" /> which we should seriously consider comparable investment ensuring that all funds are pooled. Sufficient funding should be made available to make possible the development of information technology, film making, location, editing and so on at county level.</P>
    <P>In my county people have become involved in film editing of their own choice.  Some have moved from the capital city to places like Kilkenny, where they have established enterprises and become quite successful.  They interact daily, through the Internet and information technology, with American companies and others worldwide.  Surely that presents us with huge potential for employment.</P>
    <P>This type of activity constitutes part of overall education within the film industry.  Involving young people of seven years of age in film making is indeed a form of education, from which point they move on and become involved in various national institutions, educating themselves further.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred this morning to the glitzy image of the film industry.  There is a whole new perception of the industry at local level and those involved in it, while being aware of its glitzy Hollywood image, are quite capable of meeting its many challenges.  That is the way forward for job creation in the future.  This country's film industry has long-term prospects if we can pool all our resources at national and local level.</P>
    <P>In regard to the tourism element of the industry, a number of low cost films have been made in Kilkenny including &ldquo;Lock Up Your Daughters&rdquo;, which met with a degree of success, &ldquo;Circle of Friends&rdquo; and &ldquo;Widow's Peak&rdquo;.  The people who work in Ireland making these films return here for holidays.  They leave this country singing its praises and that is what it is all about; one industry lending itself to another.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and I urge the Minister to look to this industry in the future as one that can be developed in a way that provides a substantial number of jobs for the young qualified people coming into the market place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and wish her well on her appointment.  I welcome the fact that she has moved swiftly to implement two of the commitments to the Irish film industry contained in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium.  I welcome also the emphasis the Minister has placed on television as well as film production.  Television production may be regarded by some as being a second class citizen to the film industry but in reality it is at the cutting edge of the film and television chain and plays a crucial role in giving skills to workers.  An example of that is &ldquo;The Hanging Gale&rdquo;, a four hour television series on the Famine which was filmed in County Donegal.  That project was a co-production between RTE and BBC and the experience it offered to Irish crews was as important as that offered by a feature film production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> It is appropriate for the Minister to ensure the most effective mechanism possible to promote Ireland as a quality location for film-making.  As previous speakers said, there is no doubt that people who work in this country on film productions take with them when they leave a deep love of the country and return here to support our tourism industry, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has adopted the model suggested by the Irish Film Board and consulted those in the industry with a view to obtaining their views on this issue.  The idea of a ten year strategy for the industry, to be drawn up by the new industry think tank, is an excellent one.  It indicates that the Government is not interested in the short-term needs of the industry but proposes to drive its agenda forward over a longer time span reflecting the enormous competition in the audio-visual production and the challenges being posed in this ever increasing high tech industry.  The industry should see the think tank as being central to its own interests.</P>
    <P>In signalling an interest in the ten year strategy for the industry, the Government is essentially institutionalising the film and television sector in the broader industrial sector of the economy.  It is sending out a strong message that the sector is not just a cultural curiosity at the margins of the economic and social priorities but can contribute significantly to the central employment strategy of the Government.  The film industry is growing and more young people in primary and second level schools have an interest in the production of films.  It is essential that we try to include those young people in film-making or some other part of the film industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a television drama series on Deirdre Purcell's book, <i>Falling for a Dancer</i>, has just been completed in Castletownbere, County Cork.  This project has brought significant benefits to the local economy and is proof positive that the Minister's plan for the continued development of the industry will be greatly beneficial in terms of job creation and value added to the local and national economies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with real pleasure that all of us have participated in this debate.  I am delighted that so many people contributed to it, and with such enthusiasm.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy de Valera, on taking up the baton in the creative arts and the culture and heritage of this country, so ably handed on to her by the former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  Both the Minister and the former Minister made excellent contributions to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome also the cross-party recognition that this industry is centrally, culturally and creatively Irish.  It is about our own identity, painfully emerging from a time when we had little support to explore it.  The importance of that must be underlined outside the financial and staffing difficulties which will be examined in this Bill and by the Department of Finance.  As Deputy Higgins <Col N="774" /> pointed out, some things cannot be priced, although we are talking here about a very successful project.</P>
    <P>I want to underline the sense of development in the industry and coming to terms with our own identity, not the &ldquo;begorra&rdquo; image that was imposed on us from abroad at a time when we had no control over the production, financing or scripting of what were passed off as Irish films.</P>
    <P>I am very aware of the experience of the Australian film industry which suffered great disadvantage and shared our lack of confidence in film-making until it received state funding and recognition by society that investment must be made to create images of Australia and its people which are then sent forward, as Deputy Higgins rightly said, for other juries to adjudicate upon.</P>
    <P>I remember the sense of excitement and interest I experienced when I first viewed some of the great Australian films which portrayed that country's extraordinary history.  Deputy Eoin Ryan referred to the fact that the Australian film industry may have run into a wall but I would like to think that if we run into such a wall it will be seen as creative, as theirs continues to be.</P>
    <P>One of the first striking Australian films was &ldquo;Gallipoli&rdquo; in which Mel Gibson and many other young actors made their presence felt.  Mel Gibson went on to produce and direct in Ireland, in partnership with our film board and the former Minister, Deputy Higgins.  I have in mind</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Strictly Ballroom&rdquo;, &ldquo;Muriel's Wedding&rdquo; and &ldquo;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&rdquo; which was irreverent and witty but, above all, about Australia and its people.  Made on a small budget and with an extraordinarily creative design, &ldquo;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&rdquo;, won the Oscar for costume and design in the year in which it was nominated.  This goes to show that creativity, dedication and, above all, when one is sure of oneself and one's own identity, wonderful and marvellous things can be done without a Hollywood budget.  That is something we also recognise. One of the most extraordinary films that broke all barriers not just in human but in animal terms was the Oscar winning &ldquo;Babe&rdquo;; I am glad that &ldquo;Babe II&rdquo; is now being made.  Looking at such films, one realises they came from the culture and experience of Australians, and we can now be proud of the long line of films with an Irish stamp.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Michael D. Higgins and with the Minister on the need to concentrate not just on the indigenous skills of our people but on the extraordinary creativity of our writers and poets.  Script writing, which is an amazing skill, and training in media appreciation should be included in our school curricula.  In doing that we will show that not alone do we love cinema but that we take great pride in producing our own films.  I remember the sheer joy, excitement and exhilaration of going to the local cinema in the <Col N="775" /> small town where I grew up when it was the event of the week.  It was literally the magic lantern that opened up windows to a world that we did not have the opportunity to explore ourselves.  In producing our own films we will allow other people to have windows into our world; as we looked out, people can now look in and we can be proud of what they are looking at.  That will require the underpinning of finance and a political will that understands that it requires not just a financial budget and tax recognition but a realisation that we are dealing with our culture, our heritage, in economic circumstances which we never experienced before and at a time when not only can we reach out with pride and confidence but can also bring in the diaspora.  One film that has not been mentioned yet but which will, I hope, go into production with all the supports that are necessary is &ldquo;Angela's Ashes&rdquo; based on the book by the Pulitzer prize-winning Irish author, Frank McCourt. One thing we can feel confident of is that we have the makings of good scripts to an extraordinarily rich degree.  Every Deputy who spoke was able to refer to some training, education or film development in his constituency.  Some Deputies referred to the making of films in their area which showed the beauty of the country and highlighted the wonderful co-operation and generosity of the people who housed the film crews and worked as extras etc.  The reputation they gained will stand to us in the future.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister and Deputy Michael D. Higgins that progress so far is due to the enthusiasm, commitment and sacrifices of all the people involved who have more than proved themselves on every level.  They do not have to make a strong case for themselves.  We should be able to make that case in complete confidence. There is a need to recognise the lack of staffing, the need for protection in terms of the incomes of people involved in this industry, the importance of film archives, of having a film institute and ensuring that the film that already exists and is under threat is not just preserved but funded to enable restoration etc.  I pay tribute to the archives for what they have done already in terms of restoration work.  When one considers what is achieved here in film making with much love and attention and very little money compared to the huge budgets allocated in other countries, we must realise that it is about time we made an investment.  Possibly this could not have been justified before, but now we cannot justify not doing it.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on setting up the Irish women's history project.  The extraordinary experiences of people even in our living memory can be used not just as archive but as a springboard for continuing to have an indigenous film industry that will not be dependent on outside scripts.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Dukes on Tuesday, 4 November 1997:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to commit adequate resources to tackling the factors contributing to the rapid deterioration in Dublin's traffic conditions.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, recognising that measures to ease traffic congestion in Dublin should be implemented within the framework of the integrated transportation strategy for the Greater Dublin Area as set out in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, welcomes the commitment of the Government to implementation of the DTI Strategy and, in particular:</P>
    <P>notes that the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 provides for investment of in excess of £600 in transport infrastructure in Dublin;</P>
    <P>supports the Government's commitment to provide a light rail system for Dublin, within the framework of the Operational Programme, consisting initially of a Tallaght/City Centre/Dundrum line;</P>
    <P>welcomes the planning work in progress on extension of light rail to Ballymun and Sandyford;</P>
    <P>notes that implementation of the DART extensions to Greystones and Malahide, acquisition of additional DART rolling stock, construction of new DART and suburban rail stations and implementation of quality bus corridors is proceeding as quickly as possible consistent with the need for adequate public consultation and compliance with relevant tendering and contract procedures;</P>
    <P>supports the Government's commitment to provide key additional road infrastructure for Dublin, in particular, the Southern Cross and South-Eastern Motorways, to complete the Dublin C-ring, and an access route to Dublin Port;</P>
    <P>endorses the policy of promoting better use of road space in Dublin through implementation of a range of traffic management measures and intensified enforcement of traffic regulations; and</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have 30 minutes, and I propose to share my time.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of discussing the traffic of Dublin.  I welcome the fact that this motion was tabled by the Opposition in Private Members' time because we are approaching the busiest part of the year where gridlock will once more prevail in spite of our best efforts.  I should like to make a few suggestions about our traffic problems.</P>
      <P>More use should be made of the SCAT traffic signal system.  When traffic approaches a SCAT system, the lights will change if there is nothing coming in the other direction.  It gives all motorists a fair chance.  There is nothing more irritating for motorists than to sit at a red traffic light waiting for it to change although there is no traffic approaching from the other direction.  This is most aggravating given the amount of traffic on roads and I advocate greater use of SCAT, particularly in the county part of Dublin.</P>
      <P>There has been much discussion recently about the speed of traffic on roads.  There should be better enforcement of traffic laws.  I did not hear the details but I understand there was a severe crash on the Chapelizod bypass this evening.  I cannot comment on it because I am not aware of the circumstances.  However, I understand a number of children were taken to hospital and I am sure the House shares my hope that none of them was seriously injured.</P>
      <P>I travel that road from Celbridge every morning and I am aware of the volume of traffic on it. Articulated trucks speed along the bypass but it is rare to see a Garda car with a radar.  Video cameras should be installed along that route. Many other measures need to be taken urgently about these problems.  I have contacted the Garda Síochána on a number of occasions about speeding traffic on the Chapelizod bypass and the Lucan road.  I am told many prosecutions are taken against speeding motorists but I travel that route daily and I rarely see Garda squad cars or motorbikes pulling aside drivers.  The problem of speeding articulated trucks needs to be addressed urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a huge amount of selfish parking in the city in the run up to Christmas.  The level of fines should be doubled in November and December to prevent people parking on double yellow lines or at dangerous junctions.  The manner in which some people park is outrageous.  If one tries to drive through Suffolk Street and Trinity <Col N="778" /> Street to Dame Street, one will see cars parked on double yellow lines.  Traffic cannot get through as a result of the selfishness of other motorists.  There should be many more tow away vehicles to deal with the problem of improperly parked cars.  It is time something was done about this matter.</P>
    <P>Larger fines may be the answer.  If a person was fined £200 for parking on a double yellow line in November or December in the city centre, he or she would think twice about parking there again. It is selfishness because many people do not worry about the fines imposed for parking in such places.  They usually hand them over to their firms which take care of them.  This is very wrong.</P>
    <P>The bus services in Dublin are dreadful.  I conducted a survey on the standard of the bus services in my constituency of Dublin South Central last year.  Approximately 25,000 questionnaires were distributed and I received over 500 replies which was substantial.  Some 94 per cent of the respondents said they usually used the bus.  They were asked how frequently per week they used the service; 55 per cent used it daily, 34 per cent used it three to four times a week and 11 per cent used it once a week.  The respondents were asked to rate the local bus service; 7.3 per cent said it was very good, 16.3 per cent said it was good, 26.7 per cent said it was fair, 21 per cent said it was poor and 28.7 per cent said it was very poor. Approximately 6 per cent of those who replied said they did not usually use the bus.  Of those 41.9 per cent cycled, 35.5 per cent drove cars and 22.6 per cent walked.</P>
    <P>The people who rated the service cited the 22 and 22A as particularly poor.  One person said the average waiting time was 40 minutes.  They wanted more buses on the 22A route or at least the buses already on the route to arrive at the advertised time.  Another person said the average waiting time was 40 to 60 minutes.  They wanted the bus replaced with another system which would guarantee frequent arrival, for example every ten to 15 minutes.  Another person said the waiting time for the 22 or 22A bus was up to one hour and ten minutes.</P>
    <P>I sent this information to the manager of Dublin Bus and I received an acknowledgement. However, nothing has been done about it.  I intend to give the Minister a copy of the survey. If we want people to use buses we must provide a proper service.  It is also time to provide decent vehicles.  The people surveyed did not like the small buses, the Imps.  They complained of over-crowding and long waiting times.  They said they are frequently left waiting at bus stops because Imps are already full when they reach them.  The respondents also said people should not be allowed to stand on these vehicles which are viewed as uncomfortable for older people who find it difficult to board them.</P>
    <P>Larger vehicles have been requested and they should be provided.  Bus fares should also be lower.  If the volume of people using buses was increased, it would more than offset the initial <Col N="779" /> cost of lower fares.  This area must be addressed. One respondent to the survey on the standard of the bus services in Dublin South Central sent me a picture which shows a skeleton waiting at a stop for a 22A bus.  This sums up the feelings of the people in my constituency about the bus service. I have a copy pinned up in my office as a constant reminder that people are most concerned about this problem.  Perhaps I should place a copy in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>I favour cycle lanes but it should be an offence if cyclists do not use lanes where they are provided. Some cyclists career along streets and weave in and out of traffic although a cycle lane has been provided at considerable public expense.  The use of cycle lanes should be compulsory.</P>
    <P>Everybody is aware of how couriers behave on the roads.  I am not aware of the death rate among couriers but I worry about the survival chances of some of those young people on bicycles who weave in and out of traffic, go through red lights and go the wrong way up one way streets.  The law does not appear to apply to them and the Garda are unable to stop them.  Years ago cyclists stopped if a garda stuck out his hand.  Now they cycle around the garda and usually give him or her a rude gesture when they are out of sight.</P>
    <P>I often travel through Lower Kevin Street in the morning.  There is a shop there and during rush hour, when cars are bumper to bumper, there are always vehicles parked outside on double yellow lines.  They appear to have the freedom of the street and are never ticketed.  Nobody appears to care.  I understand the need to drop off merchandise to shops but that can be done outside rush hour.  Lower Kevin Street is frequently reduced to one lane of traffic travelling towards St. Stephen's Green.  This matter should be examined.</P>
    <P>I regret the lack of good manners among many motorists.  It is common decency to give way when one cannot move.  People park on yellow boxes when they know they should not.  One morning I left Celbridge, which is more countrified, and tried to get to the main Dublin road at Lucan.  A magnificent new green Volvo, driven by a beautiful blonde woman, was parked in the middle of the yellow box.  I showed my disapproval and she gave me an Italian gesture in return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody agrees there is a serious traffic problem in Dublin city and county. That did not arise today or yesterday, and successive Governments can share the criticism for this problem.  I represent satellite towns such as Blanchardstown, Clondalkin-Lucan and Tallaght. We have had bypasses, motorways and other major infrastructural investments.  It appears that the greater the investment, the greater the gridlock and ensuing confusion.</P>
      <P>It is frustrating to see what has happened mainly under the authority of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  The Minister should, as a result of this debate, look at those projects which could tackle this problem and which require urgent attention.  The Minister spoke last night of the understandable need for wide public consultation.  That is very desirable, but there are other considerations.</P>
      <P>There is agreement on the need for a tunnel into Dublin port.  Elected representatives made representations on behalf of worried constituents. The project is gridlocked and nothing can be done until everything is resolved.  The management of Dublin Corporation came up with a scheme which was rejected by its elected members.  The matter went back to public display and three months of consultation.  Then location of the proposed entrance was moved.  Recently representatives got a colour brochure which is the third issue of the Tunnel Information Project.  It sets out the requirements necessary before the project proceeds, which is very desirable.</P>
      <P>The progress of many of these projects is predictable. It takes years to get to the point when construction starts and proceeds to completion. One can see oil tankers and lorries with 40-foot containers endeavouring to get up the Dublin quays throughout the day.  A national rail distribution park is proposed for my constituency.  A rail line is to be extended from the port to carry container traffic; the roll-on, roll-off facilities are to be installed and then goods can be picked up on the motorway and distributed nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These projects have been discussed for years, but we are still talking about the chaotic Dublin traffic.  A tollbridge was built in my constituency and I understand that the traffic there now is at the level predicted for 2002.  That is the so-called forecasting competence of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which has been responsible for seeing these projects through with the local authorities.  That is the case with virtually every roundabout, motorway or bypass in my constituency.  There is a rectification <Col N="781" /> crew out to cut back footpaths or remove bollards virtually before the paint is dry on the road markings. The need for those changes should have been predicted.</P>
    <P>At the end of the Western Parkway in Deputy Hayes's constituency there were traffic tailbacks; after three years a slip road was built, which is excellent.  However, that could have been done three years earlier.  It is frustrating to know that finance is available, usually supported by the EU, yet matters get bogged down by red tape.  It is easy to criticise bureaucracy.  The Southern Cross motorway has been delayed for years in the courts, though it will hopefully begin construction soon.  A ring road is necessary to relieve traffic in the western towns, but there is no cohesive, overall plan.  That is not the fault of the Department of the Environment; it is ours.</P>
    <P>Another team of consultants reviewing Luas is ridiculous.  This should have been looked at as a first option.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Finance is available for all these projects and everyone agrees they are necessary. What will happen with this gridlock?  Perhaps the Garda will switch from other duties and try to move the traffic, but that is like arranging the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic.</i>  It is only fiddling with the problem.</P>
      <P>Projects such as the Dublin port tunnel, the national rail distribution park, finishing the Southern Cross motorway and provision of underground or overground public transport by rail should not get bogged down.  The Opposition has tabled this motion and Dublin Deputies can catalogue the difficulties arising out of the problem. Unfortunately, they do not see an end to it. If nothing else, the Minister should get agreement between his Department and the local authorities on fast-tracking the projects I have mentioned. Let the public express their views.</P>
      <P>The Palmerstown by-pass goes through my constituency and 11 houses had to be knocked down for it.  Representations were made by people who did not want houses knocked down because the prices being paid were not high enough.  When arrangements were made with the occupants, their next question was when they would receive their cheques.  All such projects have their problems.  Organisations such as the Dublin Transport Initiative, Dublin Corporation and other bodies have an interest in this, but the Minister will have to take control of the problems of Dublin and the east coast.  It is a national issue. Traffic to the port is causing gridlock which is a key factor in Dublin's problems.  I urgently recommend the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the House take action to get these major capital projects under way so that the problem may be tackled.</P>

      <P>This is a timely debate coming up to the Christmas period when traffic usually gets <Col N="782" /> worse, although in recent years traffic is terrible most of the time.  I represent the constituency of Dublin South East which bears the brunt of traffic coming into the city in the morning and leaving it in the evening.  At each residents' association meeting I attend the main issue is usually traffic, the problems associated with it, the lack of pedestrian facilities, traffic management and traffic calming measures.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there are two ways to tackle this problem.  The DTI strategy outlines some long-term and short-term measures, including improvement in public transport services, selected new road construction, traffic management measures and effective compliance with and enforcement of traffic and parking laws.  I am delighted there is a new traffic supremo for the city of Dublin, Mr. Eoin Keegan, an official of Dublin Corporation.  He was an excellent manager of planning and I have no doubt he will do an excellent job in trying to resolve the traffic problems in Dublin city centre.</P>
      <P>Investment of £1,280 million is needed to meet the DTI strategy, an enormous amount of money. We will not see some of the fruits of that money for approximately five years and, in a number of cases, even longer.  The port tunnel and the southern cross route are major infrastructural programmes which are needed as soon as possible but it will take time before they are completed. Possibly even before the port tunnel is completed, we should consider building a tunnel under the strand at Sandymount, which is needed. The Sandymount, Merrion and Ringsend residents' associations have come to the conclusion that it is needed.  If it is constructed, traffic management and the environment in those areas will be improved greatly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot blame me for that because I always said it was needed and that we were sticking our heads in the sand by pretending the problem would go away.</P>
      <P>The economy is one of the culprits for this problem.  There was a slogan - put a tiger in your tank.  We have certainly put the Celtic Tiger in our tanks because car ownership in Dublin has gone from 275 per thousand in 1991 to 357 per thousand in 1996, a huge increase.  This year again there has been a huge increase in car sales and it will continue as our economy grows.  Certain Members from Dun Laoghaire were delighted when particular operations were transferred to Dublin port.  We were not delighted about it because we felt the infrastructure was not there. Tonnage in Dublin port has gone from 7.7 million tonnes in 1991 to 14.5 million tonnes last year and it continues to grow.  Traffic is travelling on roads which cannot properly facilitate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passenger numbers through Dublin airport have increased from 5.5 million in 1991 to 9.1 million in 1996.  Perhaps I am wrong, but we do not hear the authorities in Dublin Airport asking <Col N="783" /> for a spur of the DART to the airport.  The reason is they are making a fortune from car parking from where one must get a bus to the terminal. The last time I was at Dublin airport a person missed a plane because it took so long to get from the car park to the terminal.  That is ludicrous.  If the Dublin Airport authorities were not allowed such considerable car parking space, they would have looked for a spur of the DART to the airport a long time ago so that people from the southside could travel by DART to the airport. This happens in many other international airports.</P>
    <P>There are short-term solutions.  When in Opposition, as my party was, it is difficult to get things done.  However, this time last year the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and I held a press conference in Buswell's Hotel on this issue.  Unlike the Opposition we came up with positive proposals for the Government.  The Opposition has condemned the Government, which is ludicrous.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a long-term solution.  We came up with positive proposals and three weeks later the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, in fairness to him, implemented Operation Freeflow, which included many of our proposals and which we welcomed.  That was positive Opposition, of which there is little in this motion.  The Opposition, which is less than six months out of office, cannot blame the present Government. That will get it nowhere.  There are a number of short-term solutions, including Operation Freeflow. I am delighted the Minister will arrange a meeting between the relevant Ministers and agencies to try to get people to think before they travel. Such a scheme should be implemented.</P>
      <P>This House can only do so much.  We have said we will provide the money, implement the DTI strategy and Operation Freeflow.  Those who really need traffic to move properly are the businesses in the city centre and we must get them to help themselves.  During the month of December and the early part of January during the sales, they should get those who work in their businesses to pool their cars or to take public transport so that their customers can come to the city to shop.  That is a proposal we made last year.  If they do not do so, people will travel to shopping centres outside the city.  Invariably, we will face the problem we had in the mid to late 1980s when Dublin city centre was dying which we do not want to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Businesses must help themselves because otherwise we are wasting our time.  Dublin City Centre Business Association and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce should be asked to get everybody, including shop workers, solicitors or accountants who depend on each other in the <Col N="784" /> long-term, to leave their cars at home when they can.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the effectiveness of car pooling and the number of cars we could take off the streets is considerable.  There are approximately 20,000 free car parking spaces in Dublin city centre.  At a recent conference Colm McCarthy asked why these spaces were free and said they should not be.  We will not tackle the problem if people must pay for public transport but not for car parking.  People should be forced to pay so they will think twice about bringing their cars into the city centre and consider taking the bus or the DART.  If there is not a change in attitude, we will get nowhere.  Although we may implement the successful Operation Freeflow, businesses must help themselves by getting their employees to reduce the number of cars coming into the city centre.</P>

      <P>Traffic chaos and the associated problem of road safety are among the issues of highest priority for people living in Dublin.  They are certainly one of the priorities for my constituents. The views put forward to Deputy Ryan at meetings of residents' associations are the same as those put forward to me by the public.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the emphasis placed by Deputy Ryan on short-term solutions.  There is scope for better traffic management and better enforcement of the road traffic laws.  There is also a need to proceed urgently with the plans already in the pipeline, for example, the port tunnel, the completion of C ring etc.  We must recognise that the sooner we put in place longer term solutions the quicker we will solve the traffic problems.</P>
      <P>There is no short-term solution to the problems. The traffic problems in Dublin are caused by the increased number of vehicles on the road. There has been an increase in the number of heavy goods vehicles on the roads as a result of the increased level of economic activity.  Deputies Ryan and Lawlor referred to the increased level of activity at Dublin Port, which is a reflection of the increased level of economic activity.  The increase in the number of private cars on the roads reflects the increased prosperity experienced by some people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it will require a change in personal behaviour and in the urgency shown to it by the Government and its agencies, we must acknowledge that the only viable solution to Dublin's traffic problems is a radical and fundamental shift to public transport.  The Government has a responsibility to ensure that this takes place as quickly as possible.  The previous Government exercised that responsibility by advancing the Luas project, but this Government, to its shame, has torpedoed the project and put it back.  By <Col N="785" /> doing so it is condemning the people of this city to many more years of traffic misery and chaos.</P>
    <P>The decision to adjourn until next April the inquiry, required under legislation, into the Luas project is the latest blow commuters in Dublin have had to face.  The chairman had no alternative but to adjourn the inquiry given the decision by the Government to appoint yet another set of consultants to examine the possibility of putting the city centre portion of Luas under ground. However, the decision of the Government to surrender to pressure from vested interests during the election campaign by agreeing to open up again the prospect of going under ground in the city centre was a major error of judgment, especially as this option had been examined and rejected on a number of previous occasions.</P>
    <P>At a time when Dublin is grinding to a halt as a result of traffic congestion and crying out for a modern and efficient public transport system the prospect of Luas starting up fades further into the distance.  The reality is that there is little prospect of seeing trams on the streets of Dublin during this century.  Of even greater concern is the real danger that if the delays continue - and there is a perceived lack of enthusiasm and interest at Government level - crucial EU funding could be withdrawn.  The best thing the Minister for Public Enterprise could do is to abandon the plan even at this late stage, to ask the consultants to examine the discredited underground proposal, to allow the O'Leary inquiry to proceed without further delay and to put some effort and energy into getting Luas back on the rails.</P>
    <P>We have some of the worst traffic problems of any European city of comparable size and they are getting worse by the week.  Traffic problems were once the norm for an hour at peak time in the morning and evening but are now being experienced throughout the day.  Even relatively short journeys at rush hour now take on epic proportions. The only solution to the traffic crisis is to encourage more people to leave their cars at home and to use public transport.  However, this will not happen until we have an acceptable public transport service.  We are a long way from achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>By shunting Luas even further into the distant future the only public transport available to the majority of the citizens of Dublin is Dublin Bus. However, bus services in many areas are also creaking to a halt.  The combination of poor service, relatively high fares and chronic traffic problems are forcing more and more people away from public transport and into their cars.  This, in turn, worsens the traffic problem, further slows the buses and inconveniences people who have no alternative to public transport.  The vicious circle has to be broken.</P>
    <P>There is a commonly held view that the level of Government subvention to Dublin Bus is very high.  However, the reality is that it is very small and one of the lowest for any similar sized city in Europe.  The subvention to Dublin Bus this year amounts to £7 million.  Given that Dublin Bus <Col N="786" /> makes approximately 185 million passenger journeys each year, this represents a subvention of just 3.8p per passenger journey.  At the same time the Government provided what was in effect a subvention of almost £40 million to private motorists under the car scrappage scheme.</P>
    <P>Given that the financial picture is in its healthiest state for more than 50 years it is time we recognised the social and economic advantages of having an efficient public transport service.  This requires an efficient service and economical fares. It cannot be provided on the level of subvention currently given to Dublin Bus by the Government. It would be money well spent if the Government was to consider increasing the level of subvention to Dublin Bus.  The subvention of bus fares would bring down fares and increase the level of service provided by Dublin Bus in this city.</P>
    <P>There are two other issues I wish to raise, the first of which relates to the report released today by the Dublin Transport Organisation on the contribution ferrying children to school by way of private car makes to the traffic problem.  I confess that I am one of the parents who contributes to that problem every morning.  However, for most of us there is no alternative.  One cannot let a four year old child cross three busy roads and a roundabout with no pedestrian crossing and walk a mile and a half to school through busy traffic.  I am sorry the Minister of State who has responsibility for school transport is not present.  We need an efficient school transport system which will enable children to be taken to school and home in safety and which will considerably ease the traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>The other issue which needs to be addressed is co-ordination.  There are too many Departments dealing with transport and what we need is a single Department dealing with this issue.  It is absurd to have the Department of the Environment dealing with roads, the Department of Public Enterprise dealing with airports and rail, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda dealing with road traffic and enforcement of the law and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources dealing with ports.  If this problem is to be tackled with urgency, cohesion and the focus it deserves, a single Ministry of transport is needed, and perhaps Ministries of State with particular responsibility for specific areas such as road safety and traffic congestion in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion tabled by my party, which is similar to a motion put down last March by the Government side when in Opposition. The ongoing problem of traffic congestion and gridlock in this city and the three new county areas surrounding it is a major headache for the people of Dublin, and we as politicians have a duty to do something about it.  Political action is required at the highest level of Government to ensure all State agencies involved seriously deal with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> We have been talking about this problem for far too long.  The DTI presented its report in 1994.  While the consultation process started in 1991, it was initiated in the early 1980s.  Reports are available in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and we know what is required, but political determination is needed to address many of the issues referred to by Deputies Lawlor, Gilmore and others.  One point the Government should consider is the lack of cohesion in terms of transport policy.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government hands out money to local authorities for roads while the Department of Public Enterprise deals with another policy area.  It is important that those two Departments work together, otherwise we should set up a new Department of transport to deal with this issue.  I regret the Minister for Public Enterprise, who is directly responsible for this issue, has not addressed the concerns raised in this debate and I hope she does so before the end of the proceedings at 8.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>The traffic problem in Dublin is at crisis point and has been so for a number of years during which various Governments were in power.  We are all responsible for the lack of action in this regard.  One of the consequences of the upturn in the economy in the past four or five years is that a greater number of citizens are purchasing cars. As Deputy Lawlor said, the projected figures for the year 2002 have been already reached.  This problem must be addressed and the motion asks the Government to do that.  The average number of cars in Ireland at present is about 320 per 1,000 citizens whereas in a European context it is almost 450.  The problem of traffic congestion is increasing all the time and will not be solved unless a modern, effective and clean public transport system is put in place.</P>
    <P>I represent Dublin South-West, a relatively new suburb which, for the past 25 years, has not received its fair share of the national cake in terms of infrastructure.  The position has improved somewhat in the past four years or so, but we are only beginning to catch up.  There is complete dismay in that community at the decision of the Minister for Public Enterprise to once again put the issue of Luas on the backburner. Since the reports are available and we know the pros and cons, it is time a decision was made to move forward with this project.  The decision of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, flies in the face of good public policy.  The issue of Luas must be addressed.  Such a system would provide a means of transport for many people, particularly those who do not have cars - some parts of my constituency have a lower number of cars per population than any other part of the country.  As the DTI report points out, it is areas such as those that need attention.  If we decide against the underground option, areas such as west Tallaght, where there <Col N="788" /> are fewer cars, will never have an effective public transport system.</P>
    <P>Not alone has the public inquiry been put back to well into next year but it is likely no work will begin on Luas until 1999 at the earliest.  Even if a decision is made to include the underground option, land acquisition and environmental impact statements will have to be undertaken. The CIE application will be omitted from the public inquiry.  If, as a result of the latest inquiries, the underground option is not considered, the Minister should do the honourable thing and resign.  The Government is culpable.  That is what the motion is about and I commend it to the House.  I hope, as a result of my party putting the matter on the agenda, the gridlock issue, which is central to many of the problems in our city, will be dealt with once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who shared their time with me.  I welcome this debate.  The traffic congestion problem in the greater Dublin area requires action of a radical nature which will have an immediate and lasting effect on the streets of the capital and bring real benefit to those who today spend much of their time commuting, quality time which should be spent with their family and friends or in the pursuit of recreational, leisure or educational activities.  The volume of commuters has increased because of the healthy state of the economy.  More people are at work and travelling from outer suburbia into central Dublin in ever increasing numbers. The number who travel from Drogheda-Dundalk on a daily basis is remarkable.  The phenomena is not confined to this route but also occurs from other access corridors from the south and west of the city.  Its impact on the road network, which was not designed to accommodate high volumes of motorised traffic, is appalling.</P>
      <P>The loss of time, the impact on the environment and the health cost which this frustration generates must stop.  The effect of school holidays on traffic movement is remarkable.  The elimination of this element from the normal daily toll reduces the travelling time substantially for the remaining road users.  This same observation is also true in respect of the summer months when annual holidays also reduce the volume of commuters. I am not suggesting that four year olds, as referred to by Deputy Gilmore, should use cycle lanes but mature students who can use them should be catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From these observations it is apparent that any reduction in people movement at peak times would have a beneficial effect on the remaining traffic.  If cycle lanes were provided, parents would be prepared to allow their children cycle to school in safety rather than drive them.  This would be a real benefit to commuters.  We must also look at the road network and note the benefits of the M50 in redistributing traffic around the city.  We must seek the completion of that route to maximise the benefit of that section already built.  We must redirect traffic from central Dublin. <Col N="789" /> While awaiting that completion we must place restrictions on heavy vehicle movements at peak times.  We must ensure all road works are undertaken speedily and in such manner that they do not impact on carriageway capacity at peak times.</P>
    <P>We have to create an environment where single occupancy of a motorised unit is no longer acceptable.  The idea of hundreds of cars lined up with nowhere to go all containing one person in their safe cocoon has got to stop.  It always reminds me of a sardine rolling around in a kipper can.</P>
    <P>Tax or other incentives must be provided to encourage off street parking and the removal of parked cars on the public highway at any time of the day.  This need must be appreciated by all the agencies involved.  Another idea which would help the flow of traffic is, for example, that where there is a four lane road, two lanes in either direction, we should look at the possibility of using three lanes in the morning entering the city centre while reverting to two during the day and changing in the evening to three lanes exiting the city.</P>
    <P>Greater enforcement of traffic and parking controls is required.  It seems wasteful to engage the services of the Garda to monitor traffic on clearways, to enforce bus lane regulations or to write parking tickets.  Traffic wardens, when provided, do the job adequately in respect of parking controls.  Their role should be expanded to allow them take ownership of the enforcement of the rules.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate in the light of what is happening in the city and in the greater Dublin area.  I do so with the intention of trying to be constructive but at the same time critical of the Government because of its failure to grasp the nettle and deal with the Luas problem.  If the Government decides to do that, unpopular as it may be because there is no popular solution to the traffic problems in Dublin City and in the greater Dublin area, it will upset some people but the light rail system is the way forward.  In the time available I hope to set out some of the reasons that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the four local authorities there is no apparent co-ordination in terms of traffic management. I live approximately eight to nine miles from here and if I leave home at 8 a.m. it takes approximately one hour and ten minutes to arrive at the gates of Leinster House.  My problem and that of other commuters - even though we have a DART system - is that to get to Ballsbridge, two to three miles from the city, could take up to an hour of valuable time sitting in traffic.  Deputy Cosgrave touched on the reason for this.  If one is entering the city via the Stillorgan road, two or three traffic lanes exiting the city are practically vacant while there is a snarl up of traffic entering the city.  Surely it is not beyond the bounds of intelligence to have a traffic management structure which would utilise traffic lanes to the maximum advantage at peak times.  That involves <Col N="790" /> somebody with authority taking a decision - a traffic corps, the Garda Síochána or traffic wardens - to allow the traffic to flow.</P>
    <P>Given the absence of a regular public transport connection system to the DART those from the hinterland will not risk using it.  Large numbers of cars travel to a particular DART station where they remain parked all day, thus adding to the snarl up and volume of traffic entering the city. Even where there is a DART line difficulties have to be tackled.  If we have a light rail transport system, whether the DART or the Luas project, we must have a proper public transport network to encourage people to use it and leave their cars in the driveways.  That will cost money but the loss of money through time to business, deliveries etc., is enormous.</P>
    <P>I have just returned from a pre-budget seminar presented by the SIMI.  In case we think we have reached the point where the number of vehicles on our roads is comparable with the UK I was shocked to learn that per 100 of population here there are between 20 and 30 cars.  That compares with the UK, France, West Germany, Luxembourg and Italy where there is an average of 50 cars per 100 of population.  Given that the economy is developing and people are becoming more affluent there will be a tendency to increase the number of vehicles on the roads.  If we think this problem is overly manifesting itself we are fooling ourselves.  We are dealing with the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    <P>We have another problem, that of rising house prices in and around the greater Dublin area. More people are forced to live in Counties Wicklow, Kildare or other adjoining counties and commute to the city centre on a daily basis.  Unless we have a public transport system, a combined traffic management system and the local authorities working closely together, or an authority responsible for traffic management, those who are forced out of the greater Dublin area will have to buy a car to commute to and from the city.  Otherwise, how would they get to their place of work?  This is probably one of the most important issues facing us.  For all our prosperity we do not have the political will to deal with the problems surrounding our light rail system or traffic management in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion purports to condemn the Government for its failure to commit adequate resources to tackle the factors contributing to Dublin's traffic conditions. Deputies opposite know the financial allocations for transport related services this year, and the two previous years, were determined by them when in Government.  If they condemn the level of finance allocated to Dublin transport and traffic infrastructure, or the speed of implementation, they are condemning their own decisions. That is not the real issue.  Last night, three front bench spokespersons for Fine Gael announced <Col N="791" /> that the solution to traffic congestion in Dublin is to resurrect the Dublin transport authority which was dissolved in 1987 and to abandon the institutional arrangements put in place to co-ordinate and drive the DTI Strategy.</P>
      <P>The final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative was launched in August 1995 when Fine Gael sat around the Cabinet table.  The report set out an agreed integrated transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  The strategy introduced a whole new approach to transportation and traffic management in Dublin and outlined the general policy framework for the future development of the transport system.  There was, and still is, broad agreement that implementing DTI is the way forward and the best chance of eliminating traffic congestion.</P>
      <P>The final report of the DTI recognised that institutional arrangements to co-ordinate and oversee the recommended strategy would be crucial to its success.  The arrangements recommended and put in place were selected for a variety of reasons.  They ensured effective participation of local authority elected members and representatives of transport users and providers in the ongoing decision making process. They drew on the resources of existing agencies and avoided the creation of a new bureaucracy and were sensitive to the existing statutory responsibilities of various public bodies, including local authorities which would remain largely unchanged.</P>
      <P>The final report of the DTI recommended, following an extensive consultation process and assessment of a range of options, that arrangements were needed to perform three principal tasks.  In regard to strategic planning, they should provide an ongoing land use transportation planning process for the greater Dublin area.  In terms of implementation, they should co-ordinate and monitor the work of the individual relevant agencies to ensure the effective implementation of the DTI Strategy and the medium term investment-implementation programme derived from it, as well as monitoring the impact of implementation. In terms of participation, they should facilitate, at strategic planning and individual project planning levels, adequate and effective consultation, participation in the decision making process and the provision of full and adequate information and feedback.  It was within this framework that the Dublin Transportation Office was established in November 1995 when Fine Gael was in Government.</P>
      <P>The business of the Dublin Transportation Office is conducted by a steering committee.  All of the members hold senior positions with the various land use and transportation agencies in the greater Dublin area.  This ensures that the various implementing agencies are involved at the highest level in the delivery of the DTI Strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the critical need for participation, particularly the involvement of local <Col N="792" /> elected representatives and transport users and providers.  This is achieved by the work of the local authority committee and the consultative panel which represents business, transport and environmental interests.  These provide advice and guidance to the steering committee on the performance of its functions, a forum for consultation on strategic planning and project implementation issues and a forum for public consultation.</P>
    <P>These structures built on the credibility achieved by DTI during its earlier phases.  They provide an effective framework within which all interests can participate in the measures needed to give effect to the DTI Strategy.  It is a sad reflection on Fine Gael that, less than five months after leaving office, it wants to abandon the DTI Strategy and its institutional arrangements which were decided and put in place while it was in Government.  Fine Gael wants to resurrect an earlier and unsuccessful structure in its struggle to find new policy initiatives.</P>

      <P>We face an enormous challenge to guide Dublin transport onto a more sustainable course.  Strong economic growth is forecast to continue for the medium term.  Household formation and employment will also increase in Dublin, leading to very significant increases in car ownership, assuming the continuation of present policies. Without clear preventive policies, these economic and demographic forces will lead to even more severe traffic congestion than Dublin is experiencing today.  Good solutions can be attained.  The experience of a number of economically well developed European cities, which have successfully implemented sustainable transport programmes, is proof of this.</P>
      <P>Improved infrastructure, in relation to roads and public transport, will have a major role to play, but this will not provide a full solution.  We need to manage and control the use of this infrastructure. We need also to encourage and support lifestyle changes so that dependence on the private car is greatly reduced.  Deputy Clune rightly referred last night to the environmental implications of unrestrained growth in traffic in our cities and towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely accepted that transport is a key sector to be addressed from the point of view of sustainability. It has extensive impacts on the environment. For example, the use of land for transport infrastructure encroaches on landscape, natural habitats, biodiversity and agricultural use. Motor vehicle traffic emits pollutants which affect air quality and human health.  Carbon dioxide is linked to adverse climate change, sulphur and nitrogen oxides are associated with acidification and carbon monoxide, lead, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter damage human health.  Transport is often associated with excessive noise and, as we all know too well, road accidents <Col N="793" /> result in significant injury and loss of life. Those factors must cause us all to redouble our efforts to reduce our dependence on the car and switch to more sustainable forms of transport.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister referred to the widespread international recognition that urban transport problems and traffic congestion are among the most difficult for politicians and administrators to resolve.  He also summarised the progress being made with implementation of the DTI Strategy to tackle the problems.  However, he also recognised that more needs to be done.  We understand that reality and the Government's amendment clearly outlines the facts and the way forward.  It firmly commits the Government to full implementation of the DTI Strategy.  The amendment moved by the Minister deserves the full support of the House and I call on Deputies opposite to withdraw their motion.</P>

      <P>In concluding the debate I want to highlight the seriousness of the crisis facing us.  It is estimated that the traffic congestion in Dublin costs approximately £500 million each year.  That money is going down the drain.  On two occasions this year toxic emissions in Dublin exceeded the WHO acceptable level, not the maximum recommended level.  I am sure the Minister is aware that if that level is reached on several consecutive days he will be obliged to take action similar to what happened in Paris recently and to what happens in Athens on a regular basis.  Meanwhile the population is slowly, insidiously and silently being poisoned.  That is the reality.  None of the facts and figures can show the effect traffic congestion is having on the quality of life in Dublin.  Dublin is not just an economic unit, it is a place where people live, work, play and bring up their families and they are doing all that in a rapidly deteriorating environment. Everybody knows that getting to work and doing business around the city is a nightmare. Our residential areas and suburbs are overrun with cars and heavy vehicles as motorists try to avoid congestion on the arteries into the city.  The result is that life has become unbearable in the Dublin suburbs.  Our footpaths for all but the most nimble of foot have become dangerous and frightening places.</P>
      <P>Young children growing up in Dublin today do not have the privilege of learning to ride a bicycle because it is simply too dangerous.  Parents rightly feel that it would be safer to give them razor blades to play with than to let them out in the Dublin traffic.  If the traffic does not cause them harm, the toxic fumes will.  The simplest tasks, living in Dublin, have become impossible.  Bringing the children to school, doing the shopping or visiting the family are all time consuming jobs.  Life is now dictated by the level of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I failed to attend the seminar given by the car industry, but I understand that more than 55,000 new cars were sold in Dublin this year, which accounts for more than half of all those sold in <Col N="794" /> the country.  We have not reached the European average, but we will and that will mean more car on our streets.  That is the inexorable trend and it is at the heart of the crisis we now face.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about Operation Freeflow and it worked well last year.  If sufficient resources are put into it, it can work again this year, but not as well as last year.  Operation Freeflow is wonderful at managing traffic within the existing road capacity.  It is expedient to manage traffic, but it is not a system of traffic restraint.  It can only be and was never intended to be anything other than a short-term solution to the problem.  Zero tolerance of traffic violations must continue.  The most frightening figure is the most recent figure from traffic modelling studies emerging from the DTO.  It shows that even with the implementation of the entire strategy, including the construction of the ring road, the port tunnel, the Luas, the quality bus corridors and other traffic management and restraint measures, such as cycle paths, such is the growth in the level of car ownership that we cannot stand still in terms of traffic congestion.  On current trends by the year 2006 there will be 13.5 per cent more car trips than there are today and that cannot be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment, which suggests the DTI strategy will solve the problem, is wrong according to DTI's figures.  It does not mean the DTI strategy should not be implemented.  Using the DTI's figures, and by its admission it is too little too late, we are facing a crisis and I stress that a brave, decisive and interdepartmental political initiative of a dimension that would act as a catalyst to secure the necessary modal switch from private to public transport is required.  That is the single most important and critical issue that must be addressed.  To do that, commuters must be convinced that public transport can meet their needs, that it can be reliable, frequent, efficient and flexible, but at present it is none of those things.  That is not the fault of Dublin Bus.  It is partly a chicken and egg situation.  Too much traffic causes buses to be slow and buses that are slow cause more traffic problems.  Dublin Bus does not have the ability to meet demand because it does not have the necessary fleet capacity.  It cannot meet existing demand and the demand that must now be made on it.  It is futile to ask commuters to switch to public transport when an adequate service is not available.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced last night he will ask people to think before they travel.  That is a good idea, but it will ring very hollow to commuters who stand in the rain and watch one full bus after another pass them by.  If quality bus corridors are to succeed in persuading people to leave their cars at home there must be excess capacity at peak hours.  The same applies to the bus lanes. Extra buses could then be used for other trips for those who do not want to commute into the city but wish to make orbital trips during the day. Those people are also entitled to a public transport service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> Uniquely, Dublin Bus recovers 90 per cent of its current and capital costs from bus fares while in most other European capitals the transport system is required to recover approximately 20 to 30 per cent of such costs.  Instead of rewarding Dublin Bus for its phenomenal achievement it is penalised because more and more of the CIE budget is allocated to other divisions of the group which are not required to fund their capital investment.  There is a compelling argument in this regard and I ask the Minister of State to transmit it to the Minister with responsibility for transport who has not bothered to turn up for any of the debate.  There is a compelling argument to take Dublin Bus out of the CIE group and leave it as a stand alone company.  Its function as a main service provider is too important for it to be left the poor relation of the CIE group.  I hope the public service contracts, which are shortly to be negotiated, will recognise the importance of Dublin Bus and will include a subsidy which will be performance-related and a genuine incentive to encourage an increase in the number of passengers carried.</P>
    <P>There are other carrots that can be used to tempt private car owners to switch to public transport.  One is to allow employers in the public and private sectors to offer free family public transport tickets.  Currently some employees are rewarded with cars or mileage allowances and, particularly in the public sector, to qualify for a mileage allowance one must have a car and is usually provided with a free car parking space. Those are disincentives to people leaving their cars at home.  In other words, people are penalised for leaving their cars at home.  Free public transport passes would overcome that disincentive and at least public transport would participate on a level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>Much has been spoken about the role and proliferation of parking facilities and car parks in Dublin.  The worst offenders have been public bodies whose facilities are a disincentive, even to people who participate in car pooling, many of whom would lose their mileage allowances.  It is within the Government's ambit to deal with that, but that would require greater co-ordination.</P>
    <P>I am sure every speaker mentioned the Luas project, and what I regard and can only describe as the wilful and calculated decision to ensure that the money will be lost for that project simply because the Government cannot face the disruption that it might cause.  I do not propose to rehash the argument, but I was astonished when I heard the Minister say on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last week that she held in utter disdain those who questioned her decision to commission a further study.  Some might say that was a rather arrogant attitude for a Minister to take, but I will leave that for others to judge.  I hope her disdain for those who criticise her does not extend to disdain for those who have placed so much hope in the Luas project.  I hope her judgment will be unclouded on this issue so that she will realise <Col N="796" /> what is at stake and it will not prevent her taking action now before it is too late to recall the public inquiry and at least allow it to proceed in regard to that part of the route which is not part of the revised study.  In that way when the issue is reviewed by the EU in the spring perhaps we will be able to show some progress and maybe the money will not be lost.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that even if the money is lost Luas will be built.  It will be built some day because the arguments for it are compelling but it will be too late for this generation of Dubliners and it will also be too late for those in the city centre.  Many of them have been vocal in their objections to Luas, but long before it is built many of their customers will have disappeared to the out of town shopping centres.  They will have voted with their feet and Dublin city will be the ultimate loser.  Last week our brave public service providers, the taxi drivers, gave us a glimpse of the type of permanent gridlock we will face and are moving towards inexorably unless action is taken to reduce reliance on private transport.</P>
    <P>The DTI is based on a city where public transport, including taxis, cyclists and pedestrians, has precedence.  In that city there is a huge role for taxis beyond their wildest dreams, but they have shot themselves in the foot by reducing demand for their own service.  I have discussed taxis at great length and I do not wish to seem to condemn taxi drivers.  They have effectively curtailed a potential market.  There is a huge suppressed demand for taxis which cannot be expressed because they are in a monopoly position.  Since the latest demonstration there has been an enormous amount of media comment on what needs to be done about taxis.  However, it is plain to the dogs in the street that we need more of them.  The industry also needs to be regulated, expanded and upgraded.</P>
    <P>For two years I was on the local authority taxi committee and I argued with the Fianna Fáil defenders of the taxi monopoly.  They said taxis had a role to play and it was in their interest to increase numbers.  As a compromise, it was agreed to issue 200 taxi plates this year.  We got the answer to that compromise last Thursday on the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot say he is committed to the implementation of the DTI and then balk when a hard decision has to be made.  Whether it is on Luas, taxis or road pricing, the public interest has to hold sway occasionally rather than vested interests all the time.  The Minister cannot say he is committed to the construction of the ring road and then fail to provide funding for the ancillary roads such as the Dundrum bypass and the green route, which have to be in place before the Southern Cross can be opened.  The Minister cannot say he is committed to a co-ordinated approach when the Minister for Public Enterprise, replying to a parliamentary question I put down last week suggesting that some of the vehicle registration tax might go towards funding the Dublin Bus fleet, delivers a succinct one liner stating the Minister <Col N="797" /> has no role in this matter.  Is it credible that the Minister with responsibility for the prime public transport system in the capital has no role in securing funding for it?  It is hardly a co-ordinated approach when the Minister for Public Enterprise cannot speak to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will not listen to the recommendations of the DTO.</P>
    <P>There is a plethora of bodies responsible for traffic in Dublin - the four Dublin local authorities, Dublin Bus, CIE, the National Roads Authority, the Department of the Environment <Col N="798" /> and Local Government, the Garda, the carriage office, the new director of Dublin traffic and the DTO.  They all have wonderful and worthy plans but this is all they will be unless someone takes the political initiative to implement and co-ordinate them.  This is the job of the Government. There must be decisive action now if we are to save Dublin and have a city fit to live in and a capital we can be proud of.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Rathowen (Westmeath) Drainage Works.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I will share my time with Deputy McGrath.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of concern to the people of Rathowen and the surrounding areas, including my home area.  Glen Lake is a lake of approximately 50 hectares situated on the WestmeathLongford border.  It is a designated special protection area and one of the most important over-wintering sites in the country for geese, ducks and swans.  It has been subject to years of study and recording of various interested private and State bodies.</P>
      <P>The lake is, therefore, of national and international importance as an over-wintering habitat for migrating water fowl.  Its importance has been recognised under Irish and European law, having been designated a national heritage area and a special protection area which effectively means it is afforded special protection under EU Directive 79-409.</P>
      <P>In the middle of September and since then, the Office of Public Works undertook work which resulted in cutting and deepening the old drainage channels into the drainage systems of the lake.  The Office of Public Works maintains an obligation to maintain the drainage scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
      <P>It is years since such maintenance works were undertaken on this lake.  There is a fear among committed local people, who constitute the Rathowen Community Development Company Limited, that the water level will fall and destroy essential wildlife habitats with further loss of endangered wildlife fowl.  Since its foundation, the community group has recognised the importance of this great natural asset and has in its plans for the reinvigoration of this rural area a development plan which cost approximately £10,000 to prepare.</P>
      <P>Since it was drained many years ago, the lake is flooded in periods of high rainfall, providing a perfect habitat for over-wintering fowl.  Approximately 50 per cent of the Icelandic population of whooper swans come to Ireland every winter and 40 per cent of those arrive at Glen Lake because the habitat has everything they need.  The view of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which is attached to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, is that this lake is an important bird habitat worthy of conservation and should be conserved.</P>
      <P>The work undertaken on Glen Lake raises concerns from the point of view of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It should not have taken place in the absence of consultation between the Office of Public Works, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the local Rathowen Community Development Association.  I also understand that the National Parks and Wildlife Service is drafting a management scheme for this area and, accordingly, the possibility of conflict is evident in the works of the Office of Public Works and the management proposals of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the absence of consultation and agreement.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Office of Public Works considers it has a statutory responsibility to fulfil and maintain all drainage channels resulting from arterial drainage schemes.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has a statutory responsibility to protect the conservation values which led to the designation of Glen Lough as a special protection area under the EU Birds Directive.</P>
      <P>It is essential to ensure that any work undertaken is compatible with the wildlife interests on the lake.  The Office of Public Works says it is doing maintenance work only, namely, clearing weeds and silt from the river.  However, it appears that the channel leading out from the lake has been widened by at least one foot or more and the river bed has been similarly deepened.  This results in a major increase in the cross sectional area of the water channel, which in turn increases the water flow by an amount which makes it nearly impossible for the water level to rise as the water flows out of the lake as quickly as it flows in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the water level rises it falls back at an increased rate and so cannot keep a body of water in the lake for any reasonable time.  The result will be a drying out of the lake bed with a negative impact on the existing wetland habitat. If anybody proposes to undertake work on a special protection area or a national heritage area which has an area of 15 hectares or more an <Col N="801" /> environmental assessment must be undertaken.  I understand that the Office of Public Works is undertaking a hydrological survey which will identify the implications, if any, of the present drainage maintenance programme for the status of the Glen Lough as a special protection area for birds.  The local people are concerned that the pivotal importance of this natural asset be preserved and safeguarded and that Glen Lough will continue to have an importance in the Rathowen area as a viable rural entity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Rathowen is a small village in County Westmeath on the border with County Longford.  In 1994 a vibrant Rathowen Development Association was formed to enhance and promote the area.  The association has an active and enthusiastic committee of approximately 18 members and is worthy of our support.  One of the aims of the association is to protect Glen Lough.</P>
      <P>Glen Lough is a small area near Athlone.  It is a lake in the winter months and reverts to a wetland in the summer months.  It is a marshy habitat of great ecological interest and a wintering site for geese, ducks and swans.  It was designated in accordance with the council directive on the conservation of wild birds as a special protection area.  It is one of only 35 lakes in Ireland that have received this designation.  It is also protected under the EU natural habitats directives.</P>
      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service has a statutory responsibility to protect this area. Unfortunately, the Office of Public Works also has a statutory obligation to maintain drainage in the area.  Recent drainage works by the Office of Public Works, which widened and deepened the water canals, will increase by as much as 50 per cent the outflow of water from the lough.  The consequences of that were outlined by my colleague, Deputy Penrose.</P>
      <P>Local people contend that this was not routine work, but rather more extensive drainage work that will have catastrophic consequences for this special protection area.  They question whether an environmental impact assessment was needed before any work was done since the area affected is more than 15 hectares in size.  There was no consultation with them, nor with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</P>
      <P>The solution to the interest of conflicting statutory bodies lies in the position of a sluice to control water levels in Glen Lough.  It is achievable and the two State agencies - the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Office of Public Works - can combine and co-operate to provide this solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled a number of parliamentary questions on this matter.  However, because I was unhappy with the answers I received my colleague and I submitted this matter for this Adjournment Debate.  I hope the reply by the Minister of State will not contain a rehash of the replies to the parliamentary questions, but rather that he will make positive proposals on how a reasonable solution <Col N="802" /> can be reached to restore Glen Lough as a natural wildlife habitat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  It appears to be generating much debate in the Lough Glen area.</P>
      <P>The question of the effects of drainage on the Lough Glen area has been the subject of a number of parliamentary questions which I recently answered.  I will try to acquaint those Members unfamiliar with the matter of the position.</P>
      <P>Lough Glen, or Glen Lough as it is shown on the official ordnance survey map, is situated within the Inny Catchment Drainage Scheme in County Westmeath.  Under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, the Commissioners of Public Works undertook drainage works to the River Inny which were completed in 1968.  Under section 37 of the Act, the commissioners are statutorily obliged to maintain the drainage works &ldquo;in proper repair and effective condition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since the completion of the drainage scheme maintenance works were undertaken in the Lough Glen area on three occasions prior to 1995 &mdash; in 1976, 1980 and 1991-92 - these works had no detrimental effect as they did not prevent the designation of the area as a special protection area for birds in 1995 by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>Following further maintenance of the drainage works in the area this year, concern was expressed by a local group who felt that they would have a detrimental effect on the special protection area and would destroy the work carried out by the wildlife service.  The maintenance works undertaken in 1997 were routine and did not vary significantly from previous works.  Initial survey information has confirmed that there is no change in the outfall control level to the Lough Glen area.</P>
      <P>However, to ensure that there is no worsening of conditions and that my statutory obligations as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works and those of my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands are met, the House can be assured that there will be continued co-operation between the two organisations.  To this end, we are already working together to draw up an agreed management scheme for the future of the area.  I hope this will meet the requirement and concerns raised by the Deputies and the people in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The designation of an enterprise area at Sligo North-West Airport is viewed as an opportunity to enhance not only the development of Sligo airport but also provide a much needed stimulus to job creation which can benefit the whole of County Sligo and the north-west region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sligo is the regional capital of the north-west subregion and its airport services an areas within <Col N="803" /> a radius of approximately 40 miles, including counties Sligo and Leitrim, significant parts of south County Donegal, north County Roscommon, north County Mayo, County Cavan and south County Fermanagh.</P>
    <P>The north-west subregion is one of the most disadvantaged areas in the country.  It is at the extreme periphery of the EU and there is a significant disparity between it and other subregions in Ireland in terms of unemployment, high population losses, low level of average income, low urban base and very low population densities.</P>
    <P>The development of the airport is seen as a key factor in seeking to redress the social and economic imbalance from which the area suffers.  It is already playing an important role in support of tourism development and many of the major industries which have located in the north-west in recent years have indicated that the availability of a regional airport in close proximity to their plant was a key factor in their choice of industrial location.  This is borne out by the conclusions of the EU network project report on the development and promotion of regional airports which states that the existence and success of a regional airport is increasingly critical to the development and economic success of a region as a whole.</P>
    <P>The designation of an area immediately adjacent to Sligo regional airport as an enterprise area with special tax status could make a real difference to the capacity of the airport company to raise additional income on an ongoing basis and be of significant benefit in job creation and attracting investment to the region.  The provision of an enterprise area with special tax status to specifically attract manufacturing industry and internationallytraded services which in recent years have been established predominantly on the east coast and in our larger cities would be a valuable response by Government to the population loss and employment creation problems in the region.</P>
    <P>The social and economic position of County Sligo and the catchment area served by Sligo regional airport has to be viewed in the wider context of the situation of the west.  The task force established in recent years to conduct a major study of the problems of the west specifically recommended that its designation status for industrial grant purposes should be maintained and that current measures aimed at the attraction of investment should be vigorously promoted.</P>
    <P>The survival of Sligo regional airport depends on three important elements: designation status, capital funding and passenger movements.  Has the European Commission raised any queries about the granting of tax designation status?  On capital funding, the airport company which in ordinary circumstances cannot meet its operational costs from aviation related income will find it difficult to raise the required matching funds to make the necessary adjustments.  It will require grant aid substantially in excess of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> In relation to the essential air service programme tenders have been invited for a three year contract commencing in January.  Aer Lingus operates on all three routes concerned, Kerry, Galway and Sligo.  There are three round trips to Kerry, two to Galway but only one to Sligo.  This acts as a disincentive.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of State that his party gave a commitment in its election manifesto to introduce the first ever regional airports development Bill which is badly needed.  It stated that legislation would be enacted to make it mandatory for the transport Minister to give seats on the boards of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta to nominees of the regional airports.  That would be an important move.  It further stated that the legislation would shift the burden of air traffic control costs away from the regional airports which would be exempt from rates.  Sligo regional airport's rate Bill is approximately £12,000.</P>
    <P>There are 50 acres available at Sligo regional airport which has the full support of Sligo County Council, Forbairt, the enterprise board and the local community.  The provision of a development park on this site would be of enormous benefit to the region as a whole.  This is an important issue and I appeal to the Minister of State to introduce some of the legislation promised by him when in Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1997, makes provision for the designation by order of areas immediately adjacent to seven regional airports, including Sligo regional airport, as enterprise areas.  It is important to note however that the designation order will be made by the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise, following receipt of a proposal from or on behalf of a company intending to carry on qualifying trading operations.</P>
      <P>Qualifying trading operations are manufacturing companies which qualify under the Finance Acts for 10 per cent corporation tax and internationally-traded service activities, that is, data processing, software development, technical and consulting, commercial laboratory, health care, research and development, media recording, training, publishing, financial and administrative headquarters.  Companies must also have been approved for financial assistance by the industrial development agencies, Forbairt or IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>Approval of qualifying companies will be given through a certification process involving, <i>inter alia,</i> Forfas and the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance.</P>
      <P>The tax reliefs for the enterprise areas are those set out in section 35 of the Finance Act, 1995, and include capital allowances of up to 100 per cent on expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of premises used by qualifying companies as well as a double rent allowance for ten years for the lessees of such premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> Shortly after the announcement of these provisions in the Finance Act the European Commission raised queries about the State aid aspects of these enterprise areas.  The Minister for Finance subsequently issued a press release on 23 July stating that the Commission was raising such queries.  There was a meeting in July in Brussels between officials from my Department and the Commission to discuss the matter.  The Commission subsequently sent a representative here on a fact-finding mission which included a visit to a number of proposed enterprise areas and an existing one.  Since then we have supplied the Commission with any supplementary information it requested.</P>
    <P>While nothing can proceed on the enterprise area front until the European Commission has reached a decision on the matter, I hope it will be satisfactorily resolved in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister of State for coming in to reply.</P>
      <P>The question of Naas hospital has been occupying the minds of public representatives in County Kildare for many years.  In 1987 the former Minister, Mr. Barry Desmond, announced that the first phase of the development programme was to proceed.  Further stages of the programme would cover the refurbishment of the theatre, outpatients' department and radiography department. In 1996, in line with public requests, the previous Minister decided to sanction stage 2 at a cost of £21.5 million.  Final approval was given in May this year.</P>
      <P>In reply to Parliamentary Question No. 90 on 1 October the Minister stated that the plan was being considered by the Eastern Health Board and the Department.  The time for consideration, review and revision is long past.  The position is so serious that following admission patients have to wait on trolleys in waiting areas and virtually have to share beds.  The staff are finding it difficult to deliver the services expected in a major hospital.</P>
      <P>This issue has not been politicised and I hope it never will be.  The need is self-evident.</P>
      <P>Any attempts to delay or in any way retard progress on the second stage of this development programme will be met by a very strong groundswell of reaction by the public in the Naas area, the fastest developing area in the country whose needs are obvious and have been well enunciated.</P>
      <P>One school of thought is that the provision of additional wards would solve the problem.  That suggestion is part of another agenda within certain sectors of the medical hierarchy who contend that the provision of additional wards would meet immediate needs and that the hospital could be downgraded and used for other purposes at a later stage.  Such a proposal would be totally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> I hope the Minister will inform us of his intention to allow the programme proceed as quickly as possible.  While accepting that the drawing and approval stages must first be gone through, it is imperative that the plan proceed, as announced, in 1998.  Any deviation from that timescale would be a serious blow to staff morale and to those who have been expecting that programme to be proceeded with for quite a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to explain the present position in relation to Naas General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The original plan for the development of this hospital set out proposals to update its facilities in four phases, the first of which was completed in 1991 and incorporated the psychiatric unit and ancillary facilities.</P>
      <P>In 1993 a review group was established by my Department and the Eastern Health Board to examine the remaining stages of the development, taking account of the overall acute hospital requirements of the area, including the proposed new Tallaght Hospital.  Following the review group's work, the Eastern Health Board produced a revised set of proposals for the phased development of Naas General Hospital.</P>
      <P>A revised development brief for the hospital, incorporating the recommendations of the review group, was formally approved in June last.  This approval allowed the Eastern Health Board to proceed with the preparation of a revised development control plan for the whole hospital development and the drafting of a more detailed phase II development option within the approved cost limits.</P>
      <P>The phase II proposal includes new accommodation and the upgrading of existing facilities. The plan envisages the provision of the following services in new accommodation: an accident and emergency department; out-patient department; medical records department; entrance concourse; day services; an operating department; an intensive care unit; a coronary care unit; medical, surgical and geriatric wards and a geriatric day hospital.</P>
      <P>I have been assured that the planning process for the hospital development is being progressed as quickly as possible by the Eastern Health Board which has appointed a design team for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the current difficulties being experienced at the hospital.  I can assure the House that the project continues to merit high priority in my Department's capital programme. I am anxious to ensure that the development will meet the real needs of the people of the area served by this hospital.  Further discussions are being held between my Department and the Eastern Health Board to ensure that the planning of the hospital continues to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Deputy Durkan mentioned his anxiety about any delays or dragging of feet, with the Minister for Finance residing in County Kildare I <Col N="807" /> can assure him that there will be no danger of anybody in my Department being allowed to drag their feet.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the dental treatment services scheme medical card holders are entitled to resort to a dentist of their choice for treatment provided the dentist in question is contracted to the relevant health board. This very effective scheme was introduced in 1994, the intention being then to implement it on a phased basis, but confined initially to those aged over 65 who receive treatments for fillings and partial dentures, crowns and bridges being excluded.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the scheme were extended in June 1996 to patients in the 16 to 34 year old category. However, the 35 to 64 year old category, comprising some 30 per cent of the population, remains excluded.  There is no medical or dental reason for their exclusion which is unfair, inequitable and discriminatory.</P>
      <P>Reports I have received indicate that since patients in that 35 to 64 year old age group qualify for free dentures but not partial dentures, they now resort to complete extraction of their teeth. No doubt dentists would prefer a restoration approach rather than the complete extraction or destruction of patients' teeth.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister inform the House when it is intended to extend the scheme to this age group? While I am aware that there is a cost factor involved, this group should not be discriminated against.</P>
      <P>Major difficulties are being experienced within the Southern Health Board region with regard to orthodontic treatment, with a waiting list, for assessment alone, of some 5,000, a large number of whom reside in the Kerry area.  Even when assessed, they must await treatment.  I should be glad if the Minister would address this matter with his departmental officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The dental treatment services scheme was introduced by my Department on 1 November 1994.  Under this scheme private dental practitioners under contract arrangements with health boards provide services for adults with medical card entitlement.  Health board dentists also participate in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three main elements to the scheme: emergency treatment for the relief of pain; routine dental treatment e.g. fillings, extractions, dentures, etc.; priority full dental treatment for edentulous persons, persons with no natural teeth.  This was a major new scheme and in its <Col N="808" /> entirety could not be extended to all eligible adults from the outset.</P>
    <P>In the initial phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 November 1994, emergency dental treatment was made available to all adults.  Routine dental treatment and priority full denture treatment was made available to persons of 65 years of age or older.</P>
    <P>Under the second phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 June 1996, routine dental treatment was extended to persons in the 16 to 34 year age group and full denture treatment was extended to all edentulous persons.</P>
    <P>All health boards also operate a priority waiting list for dental treatment for medically compromised persons who are given priority, irrespective of age, on production of a letter from their general medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>The management of the scheme is the responsibility of the health boards.  Its operation is monitored at a local level and at a national level by groups representative of management and the service providers.  I am satisfied that the scheme is working well in most areas, as I am in the case of the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>However, as I indicated, persons in the 35 to 64 age group are not yet covered for the provision of routine treatment under the scheme.  Understandably, this group would like to benefit from the routine element of the scheme as soon as possible and receive, as necessary, the full range of routine treatments provided, e.g. scaling and polishing, fillings, extractions, root treatment, dentures, etc.  I will extend routine treatment to persons in the 35 to 64 year age group according as the necessary additional resources are available.</P>
    <P>Returns received by my Department from the Southern Health Board show that in the six months ended in September last the board received a total of 5,705 applications for treatment under the scheme.  The total number of approvals issued in this period, also taking account of earlier applications for treatment, was 6,723.  The overall waiting list for the board at the end of September was 1,406.  The average waiting period between application and approval for treatment for the area was six to seven weeks.</P>
    <P>The most recent figures available to my Department for the Kerry area are for the month of October 1997.  In that month 200 approvals were issued by the board for the Kerry area. There is currently no waiting list for patients in the Kerry area.</P>

      <P>A review group established to examine the adequacy of the marine search and rescue coverage of the east coast presented its report to the then Minister for the Marine in June 1996.  The group recommended that a medium load carrying marine emergency helicopter be provided to service the east coast.  At present, search and rescue coverage on the east coast is provided by the Air Corps from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  The group also recommended that the service currently provided by the Air Corps be relocated to a location on the south-south-east coast once the medium load carrying helicopter service is in operation.  The decision to proceed with this project demonstrates the Government's commitment to the provision of modern facilities in this most important area of safety.</P>
      <P>The new helicopter will be civilian registered and will be accountable under contract to the Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  It is proposed that a number of Air Corps crew members will be assigned to the service following a period of relevant training which will be provided by the contractor.  The new service will operate on a temporary basis from Dublin Airport, but will be located at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel once certain legal difficulties concerning the question of the basing of a civil operation at a military airbase have been resolved.</P>
      <P>The present position is that a tender competition for the delivery of the service has been held by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  Tenders are currently being evaluated and that Department expects to place a contract for the service shortly.  It is intended that the service will commence in July 1998.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to assign two Air Corps first pilots and three co-pilots to commence training in early 1998.  The contract will also provide for the training of additional Air Corps pilots as necessary.</P>

      <P>Ireland was responsible for the control and management of the European Community Monitor Mission to the former Yugoslavia during the six month period of the Irish Presidency of the EU, i.e., July to December 1996.  The post of head of mission was held by a diplomat from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  There was a total of 88 Irish personnel serving with the ECMM throughout that time, of whom 78 were members of the Permanent Defence Force.  A member of the Defence Forces held the post of deputy head of mission (Operations).  In addition, an officer was seconded as adviser to the Presidency in relation to the EU administration of Mostar and a further officer was seconded to the Department of Foreign Affairs as adviser on the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately prior to the commencement of the Italian Presidency, i.e., January to June 1996, there was, in accordance with normal practice, a gradual build-up in the number of Irish military personnel serving with the mission.  At the beginning of 1996 there was a total of 15 members of the Defence Forces serving.  There had been six Defence Forces members serving with the mission since 1991.  By April 1996 this number had risen to 32.  A further eight Irish military personnel were deployed during April 1996 and the balance <Col N="812" /> was deployed during June 1996, bringing the total to 78 personnel.</P>
    <P>During the post Presidency period of the troika arrangement a total of 23 Irish personnel, of whom 19 were members of the Defence Forces, continued to serve in the mission.  These numbers were gradually scaled down during the Dutch Presidency, i.e., January to June 1997 and there is currently a total of nine members of the Defence Forces serving with the mission.</P>
    <P>The ECMM is an unarmed mission, which is civilian in character, comprising some 300 diplomatic and military personnel seconded by the EU member states, as well as Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

      <P>On 21 June 1997 six Defence Forces personnel were injured, one seriously, when a mine exploded in the UNIFIL area of operations in South Lebanon. As is the standard practice following serious incidents of this nature, the UN established inquiries into the incident.  These inquiries have now been completed and the relevant reports have recently been received and are being examined by the military authorities.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that my primary concern and that of the Government, is for the safety and well-being of all Irish Defence Forces personnel serving overseas.  Because the safety of Irish personnel is of paramount concern to the Government, Ireland was happy to co-sponsor the resolution to establish a Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.  The Government has already signalled its intention of signing and ratifying this Convention at an early date and they intend to bring forward the necessary enabling legislation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of safety of Irish troops generally in their execution of the UNIFIL mandate, it is obviously not possible to give absolute guarantees as to their safety.  I can, however, assure the House that none of the troops engaged on overseas service will be exposed to any unnecessary risks and all possible precautions are taken to ensure their safety.  Standard operating procedures are reviewed as necessary. Following the incident referred to, the military authorities have, in accordance with normal procedures, commenced a review of engineer search and explosive ordnance disposal procedures. This review will be completed next month.</P>

      <P>The position is that expenditure on the Defence and Army Pension Votes for 1997 is being closely monitored but it is too early at this stage to make a definitive assessment as to the final outturn on the various subheads referred to in the Deputy's question. However, it is likely that a supplementary estimate will be required on the Defence Vote, Vote 36, to meet the cost of loss of hearing claims from members and former members of the Defence Forces.  The relevant subhead is AA.</P>

      <P>The question of the appointment of an Ombudsman for the Defence Forces has been raised by PDFORRA under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Forces.  The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the association, provide that discussions under it are confidential to the parties involved.  Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue.  I might add that revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996. These procedures included the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister.  The agreement provides for a two year trial period after which a review will take place, i.e., in May 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to purchase an additional fishery protection patrol vessel for the Naval Service as part of the 1996 to 2000 EU Fishery Protection Programme which will attract EU support.  Tenders for the construction of the new vessel were received on 1 September and are currently being assessed.  It is expected that a contract will be placed for the new vessel by the end of this year and that construction time for the vessel will be of the order of 20 to 24 months.  The vessel will be equipped with the most up to date equipment relevant to its fishery protection role.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to indicate the likely cost of the additional patrol vessel.  Discussions are ongoing with the Commission on the level of support to be provided over the period of the programme but it is expected that funding in the range of 50 per cent to 65 per cent will be provided.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service fleet currently consists of seven patrol vessels.  These undergo regular and planned maintenance and repair to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements.  In this context, successive EU Fishery Protection Programmes have facilitated certain planned maintenance and re-equipping to extend the service life of the vessels.  Three vessels &mdash;<i>LE Deirdre, LE Emer</i> and <i>LE Aoife</i>&mdash; have been refurbished to date.  Refurbishment of the <i>LE Aisling</i> is currently under way.  The remaining vessels are due to undergo refitting in the period 1998-2000.</P>

      <P>Forty-four public bank acounts are operated by officers of my Department and officers of the Permanent Defence Force who are duly authorised to do so by or on behalf of the Department's accounting officer.  Two bank accounts are also operated by Coiste an <i>Asgard</i>, a body under the aegis of my Department; 39 of the 46 accounts are single signatory accounts.</P>
      <P>One hundred and twenty-nine bank accounts are maintained by units and sub-units of the Reserve Defence Force to facilitate the administration of unit funds which are composed principally of an annual grant from public funds to meet ongoing expenditure in accordance with Defence Forces Regulations.  Each account is operated jointly by two commissioned officers of the Defence Forces who act as cheque signatories. The operation of such accounts are regulated by Defence Force regulation and a quartermaster general's instruction.  Under Defence Forces regulation, unit funds are subject to supervision and audit by officers of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>All official bank accounts are subject to audit by my Department's internal audit unit and by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Ten accounts have been audited since 1990.  Furthermore, the operation of the accounts is kept under scrutiny by departmental officials on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>All public bank account holders have been issued with written instructions on the correct procedures to be followed in operating these accounts, including the requirement to furnish appropriate vouchers in support of expenditure. These instructions were most recently revised in 1993.</P>
      <P>My Department is not aware that in the operation of any of the above-mentioned accounts blank cheques are signed in advance of completion and countersignature.  However, all personnel involved are being reminded of their responsibilities to ensure that this does not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Deputy's contention.  Indeed the restructuring of the Defence Forces was undertaken under the previous Government.  The cost <Col N="823" /> of the voluntary early retirement scheme for members of the Defence Forces in 1996, 1997 and 1998, means that the first phase of the reorganisation process involves additional expenditure through the &ldquo;front loading&rdquo; of the cost of the scheme.  This expenditure is firm evidence of the Government's commitment to the success of the reform process.</P>
      <P>In its review of the Defence Forces, Price Waterhouse Management Consultants identified the ratio of pay and non-pay Defence expenditure as one of the problems to be addressed as part of the reform and reorganisation of the Defence Forces and suggested that an appropriate ratio of pay to non-pay expenditure for the Defence Forces should be 70:30, rather than 80:20.  Accordingly, one of the objectives of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan is to achieve an improved ratio of the pay and non-pay expenditure.</P>
      <P>During the first phase of the plan, the total overall strength of the Permanent Defence Force will fall by approximately 1,300 personnel.  This will reduce the total Defence Forces payroll and it has been agreed with the Minister for Finance that a substantial amount of these savings will be available for investment in the Defence Forces infrastructure and equipment from 1999 onwards.</P>

      <i>Enforcement of JLC Legislation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Labour Court, under the terms of the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946-90, is empowered to establish Joint Labour Committees to regulate wages and other conditions of employment in certain sectors.  Minimum wages and terms and conditions of employment in the sectors covered by the JLC's vary according to age and length of service. Currently, there are 15 JLC's covering some 162,000 workers in such occupations as agriculture, retail grocery and contract cleaning.</P>
    <P>The function of a JLC is to draw up proposals for fixing minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for the workers involved.  When proposals submitted by a Joint Labour Committee are confirmed by the Labour Court, through the making of an Employment Regulations Order, they become statutory minimum pay and conditions of employment for the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>JLC legislation (and other employment rights legislation) is enforced by the labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The inspectorate comprises ten inspectors.  Routine inspections are undertaken to ensure that employers are complying with the terms of the legislation.  In addition, inspectors pursue reported breaches of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The inspectors actively pursue a policy of negotiating payment of arrears and compliance with the ERO's.  The effectiveness of this policy is reflected in the low level of prosecutions.</P>

(now in receivership) which had been vested in my predecessor in title in 1988.

I do not propose to comment on allegations in a newspaper article.

    <P>I can also inform the Deputy that the matter raised by this press article has not been discussed at EU level.  The position of the European Union on terrorism is clear and well-known.

    <P>As regards the ongoing campaign of the Kurdish terrorists against the Turkish authorities, this conflict has lasted more than 12 years and resulted in the deaths of over 22,000 people, including Kurdish guerrillas, members of the Turkish security forces and innocent civilians. With our partners in the EU we have urged that efforts should be made to seek a political solution rather than a military solution to the Kurdish question.</P>

      <P>In July 1995, the Government accepted the broad conclusions of the efficiency audit group that a phased programme of reorganisation of the Defence Forces should begin immediately.  As part of that reorganisation, the Government set an overall objective of reducing Defence Forces strength to 11,500 by the end of 1998.  The implementation plan for phase 1 of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, adopted by the Government in March 1996, was drawn up on the basis that no barrack closures would take place during that phase.</P>
      <P>The question of changing the strength of the Permanent Defence Force is a matter for the Government and there are no proposals to revise this strength, at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Scheme of Installation Aid for Young Farmers was one of the sub-measures operated under the Operation Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99.  The programme had an indicative budget of £17 million for the scheme and was launched in December 1994.  It was expected that about 3,000 young farmers would participate. Due to the high level of demand the scheme was suspended with effect from 7 August 1997 in respect of new applications.</P>
      <P>By 1 October 1997 a total of some 3,320 young farmers had been paid about £18.5 million under the scheme.  In addition there are about 600 other applications being processed currently with a potential grant commitment of about £3.5 million.</P>
      <P>As part of the Operational Programme the independent analysis and evaluation unit carried out a detailed evaluation of the scheme.  They indicated that the scheme should be terminated as it was not meeting the main objective of encouraging the earlier transfer of farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department as part of its submission to the mid-term review sought additional funds to enable the continuation of the scheme.  This was additional to the funds sought in other areas where the level of applications had already exceeded the level of funds available (CFP and dairy hygiene).  The mid-term review took on board the views of the independent evaluation <Col N="830" /> report and a report prepared by consultants on the operation of the first half of the Operational Programme, both of which recommended the suspension of the scheme, and accordingly did not make any additional funds available for the continuation of the SIA scheme.  The scheme was consequently suspended, as already indicated, on 7 August 1997.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that there are currently in excess of 6,600 farmers participating in the scheme of early retirement from farming.  While this money is not going directly to young farmers the benefits of the earlier transfers along with other national aids - tax reliefs - have greatly assisted in the improvement of their position.</P>
    <P>In addition the Government in An Action Programme for the Millennium, recognise the need to support young farmers by ensuring adequate provision for access to quota or production rights by qualified young farmers, and stamp duty exemption for young farmers taking over family holdings.</P>
    <P>I am considering the matter and will be closely monitoring progress of other large-scale projects in the CSF as a whole in early 1998 to see if savings are likely to be identified in any area.</P>

      <P>The International Monetary Fund has arranged to have an evaluation carried out by independent consultants of several aspects of programmes supported by the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).  This external evaluation is complementary to an internal evaluation of ESAF already conducted by the IMF earlier this year.  The external evaluation is considering three main topics: developments in countries' external position during ESAF-supported programmes; social policies and the composition of government spending during ESAF-supported programmes; and the determinants and influence of differing degrees of national ownership of ESAF-supported programmes.</P>
      <P>I expect that the consultant's report will be completed by the end of 1997.  Any decision to proceed with an Irish contribution to ESAF will be taken in the light of the findings of this report and the IMF's response particularly in regard to social sector conditionality.</P>

      <P>I have requested the board of the Adelaide and Meath hospitals, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital to consider a phased opening of the new hospital at Tallaght.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of additional construction projects were approved earlier this year so as to enhance the new hospital.  These include an expanded outpatients department, additional car parking, and private facilities.  The design and construction of these projects to a degree which would be compatible with the functioning of a major acute hospital is the main delaying factor.  In addition the opening of the hospital is contingent on such issues as the completion of necessary equipping, staff training, management decisions and patient needs.</P>
      <P>In seeking the hospital's consideration of a phased opening, I have requested that the majority of the services be transferred by May of next year.</P>
      <P>The Department reached agreement with the hospital on the additional private facilities last March.  It is the responsibility of the board of the hospital to finance and develop these facilities. Discussions with consultants in this regard are a matter entirely for the hospital management.  It is hoped that a decision by the board to proceed with a phased opening of the hospital will facilitate a resolution of any possible negative impact (on the determination of opening) which might arise from such discussions.</P>
      <P>The full range of medical and surgical services currently being provided at the Adelaide, the Meath and the National Children's Hospital will transfer to the new hospital at Tallaght.  The new hospital will also have a modern acute psychiatric unit which is being transferred from St. Loman's hospital.  Any proposals for the further development of additional services will be considered in my Department in the light of available resources.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring that this fine hospital facility should open as soon as possible as the hospital's catchment population must have its services at the earliest opportunity.  I have recently met with the full board and had a comprehensive discussion on all of the issues relating to the opening of the hospital.  The board is in no doubt as to my views and requirements in this regard.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least 10 years before pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of a retirement pension, registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.  The yearly average condition will be reduced to 10 contributions for the new <i>pro-rata</i> old age contributory pension from 21 November next.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable - national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions.  These gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
      <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of this pension.  However, as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of the satisfying of the yearly average test.</P>
      <P>However, social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age contributory pension in satisfying the first two conditions, set out in the first paragraph above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>

      <P>I am continually monitoring the position with regard to waiting times at law centres, in consultation with the Legal Aid Board and I am aware that waiting lists in some law centres have increased as a result of the introduction in recent years of additional family law legislation including the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board continuously monitors demand in all law centres and, where appropriate, prioritises certain cases which would fall into the family law category.  An emergency service (i. e. cases in which applicants are not placed on waiting lists) is provided in cases where there is a real danger to children being taken out of the jurisdiction without the consent of the applicant, and in proceedings under the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, proceedings under the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991 and for the defence of child care proceedings under the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>

      <P>To provide a means-tested maintenance grant scheme for post-leaving certificate students along the lines of the higher education grant schemes would cost in the order of £13 million per annum. The programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a commitment to provide &ldquo;equitable support of students attending PLC courses&rdquo;.  The commitment in the Programme for Government reflects the importance which the Government attaches to students in the PLC sector. The implementation of this commitment, including the timing of the introduction of an appropriate scheme, is under examination.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the school transport scheme, transport may be provided only to schools which have received permanent recognition from my Department.  The school in question has temporary recognition only at present.  I regret it is not open to my Department to recognise this school for transport purposes at this <Col N="843" /> time.  However, I would be pleased to re-examine the transport situation for these pupils should the school receive permanent recognition in future.</P>
