      <P>I wish to advise Members that the version of the Children Bill, 1997, circulated today erroneously indicates that it has been passed by Dáil Éireann.  The heading on the Bill should indicate that it has been amended in Committee.  The correct version of the Bill will be circulated as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Dáil passed a motion in support of the Louth residents' group.  On the Order of Business last Thursday, in reply to a question from the Leader of the Opposition on whether funding for the legal side of the case is included, the Taoiseach said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  Is the Taoiseach aware the Minister of State yesterday sent a lengthy letter to the Louth residents' group&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;refusing a meeting with them, inserting new unworkable preconditions in terms of funding research and refusing to meet legal costs?  What is the Taoiseach's response to the charge that this flies in the face of acceptance of the motion and the commitment given on the Order of Business last Thursday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position has not changed from the reply I gave Deputy Bruton last week. The group concerned should sit down in the normal way, as do all other groups, without stenographers and deal with a person who, as a former Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is approachable.  The Government had agreed to pay for research and when it came to light that there was a requirement for further research we stated after last week's motion that we would pay for that research.  Accumulated bills, mostly legal bills, are at issue in this case, but these matters can be addressed.  The matter should be researched to see if there is a case to be taken and then let us <Col N="231" /> get on with it.  There will be no difficulty on the part of the Government, but if the group insists on having rows with the Minister and will not talk to him or his officials without stenographers being present, it will be difficult to proceed on the matter.  The group should not be so unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach take the necessary action to ensure the BTSB unit in Cork is not obliged to close, as it will have to do in a matter of weeks if action is not taken by the Department of Health and Children to ensure the necessary funding is provided?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach the best way to proceed is by means of a meeting but the Louth residents' group are concerned about misrepresentation of facts subsequent to the meeting. Is the Taoiseach saying there will be no meeting if a record is not taken of that meeting?  If there is a question of transparency it is not unreasonable, given the detailed documentation involved, that there should be a verbatim account of such a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At most meetings of party spokespersons, Ministers' and officeholders' notes are taken and there is no difficulty with that.  During my 20 years in politics I never had a group who said they would meet me only if they had stenographers.  I have never heard of that and it is entirely unreasonable.</P>

      <P>Can an opportunity be found to introduce a token Estimate to allow the House an opportunity to examine the effectiveness of Operation Freeflow?  I do not want to sound critical &mdash; and maybe it would be unfair to be critical &mdash; because efforts have been made but it would be timely to examine if the outline plan is fully operational and successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It was raised this morning and obviously it is in some sort of order.  May I ask the question I could not ask yesterday morning? Will the Government allow the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Jacob, who is doing the best he can with one hand tied behind his back by his senior colleagues, to go ahead with the meeting with the Dundalk residents' group on the same basis as the last meeting which set a precedent by having a notetaker from both sides present?  That would resolve the matter and we would not need to go into any more detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If both sides want to have note-takers the matter can be readily resolved.  The issue is that one side wants a stenographer, which is interpreted differently.  If we can stay with note takers the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, the meeting can proceed.</P>

The Taoiseach will recall that in Opposition the Minister for Education continually insisted that such papers should be made available to allow a full debate on the matter.  Will those papers be made <Col N="233" /> available to the Opposition to allow a full and informed debate on the Education Bill?</P>

    <Title>An Bord Glas Annual Report, 1996: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bord Glas Act, 1990, the board of An Bord Glas is required to produce an annual report and accounts.  Briefly the 1996 report states that in the course of the year the board continued with the work of implementing its Development Plan 1994-99 &ldquo;Achieving Growth in Horticulture&rdquo;. The report outlines the functions of the board and it contains a general review of the horticultural industry.  It also details the activities undertaken by the board in 1996 in the various sectors of the industry such as field vegetables, soft fruit, top fruit, honey, mushrooms, other vegetable crops, ware and seed potatoes and the amenity sector.  The report also deals with a number of other areas of activity such as promotion of horticultural products, the Horticultural Industry Forum, the environment and various miscellaneous matters.</P>
      <P>While the report and accounts relate to the activities of 1996 I want to take this opportunity to look at the entire horticultural industry in the broader context of the Bord Glas Development Plan 1994-99.  Before doing so, I would like to give some background to the setting up of An Bord Glas.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil was in Opposition in the 1980s, we produced a document entitled &ldquo;A Policy for Horticultural Development&rdquo; which provided for the establishment of An Bord Glas.  On taking office as Minister for Horticulture in l987 my colleague Deputy Kirk set up An Bord Glas on an interim non-statutory basis.  One of the first decisions of the interim board was that a very intensive and detailed examination of the horticultural industry was essential.  As a result of that examination the interim board produced a document entitled &ldquo;A Programme for the Development of Horticulture&rdquo;.  Additionally, a separate programme on the seed potato industry was published. The two programmes taken together envisaged a market share recovery and export expansion of £60 million and the creation of 1,800 full-time and 1,500 part-time jobs over five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The horticultural industry performed well over these first development programmes.  The actual increase in output realised was over £45 million or 75 per cent of the target.  The aggregate export target was an increase of £28 million and the actual increase was £32 million.  The employment targets were achieved but actual performance depended more on part-time employment than was envisaged &mdash; increases of 700 full-time and 6,100 part-time jobs.  During the period of the <Col N="240" /> programmes market share for many products directly competing with imports remained very high.  There were improvements in the basic productive and commercial efficiency of horticulture with growing participation in the board's quality schemes and improvements in marketing and production structure.  Retail distributors acknowledged a substantial improvement in the quality and presentation of Irish produce.</P>
    <P>While An Bord Glas was established on a statutory basis under the Bord Glas Act, 1990, the board has effectively been in existence with a full complement of staff only since 1991.  With a very small staff of 11 and modest budgets, ranging from £700,000 in 1991 to £1.634 million in 1996, An Bord Glas nevertheless has an impressive list of initiatives and achievements to its credit by any standards.  For example, it put a new emphasis on quality and hygiene and effected improvements in these areas.  Quality improvement schemes for a number of products and for garden centres were introduced.  Systematic market assessments and examinations of Irish fruit and vegetable sales were undertaken and consumer information provided. Assistance was also provided for feasibility studies and a wide range of marketing and development projects.  An innovative and successful scheme for growing potatoes from mini tubers was introduced.  The board also initiated partnerships with producers in the form of the IFA potato marketing co-ordinator and the national horticultural organiser.  These partnerships have been particularly beneficial to the horticultural industry and it is important they will continue as envisaged in the development plan.  The board also increased the emphasis and focus on marketing and this resulted in a more market led approach by the industry.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of 1994 the board published its development plan 1994-99 &ldquo;Achieving Growth in Horticulture&rdquo;.  This plan built on the success already achieved and intensified development activities in other areas.  It introduced a number of initiatives in the areas of better market intelligence, co-ordination, linkage with the industry and support for improved marketing efforts and structure.  The plan outlines the potential for the different products.  It examines each sector in some considerable detail, it pinpoints the strengths and weaknesses and, most importantly, it clearly sets out targets and the actions required to achieve these targets over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>The plan envisaged that amenity horticulture was an area where the market would grow rapidly and where substantial increased output was possible on both the home and export markets.  Mushrooms and soft fruit were identified as other areas which would provide increased output.  The plan recognised that potatoes already had a very high domestic market share and <i>per capita</i> consumption is the highest in the EU.  The plan also saw that seed potatoes had growth potential.  It recognised, given the past record in the fresh vegetable sector, that it would be difficult to make progress. <Col N="241" /> Nevertheless the board's main emphasis was on increasing domestic market share which stands at very high levels for principal vegetable lines. Finally, in the protected crops sector, notwithstanding the problems of energy cost and strong competition from imports, the aim of the plan was to increase domestic market share.</P>
    <P>The plan also recognised that quality and hygiene were key features of modern industry and they were likely to become even more important.  Accordingly, the plan envisaged the extension of the board's quality symbol and approval schemes to a comprehensive range of products to ensure the industry could continue to be competitive in these two essential areas.  In addition the plan envisaged the board would continue and enhance its promotion of horticultural products with emphasis on the health and environmental aspects.  Action was also envisaged on value added market opportunities, improving links with all sectors of the industry and on improved market and marketing structures.</P>
    <P>The plan recognised the development and marketing of horticultural produce is consistent with and supports efforts to improve the environment. There is little direct conflict in horticulture between production and the environment.  Amenity product production and consumption, for example, directly enhance the visual environment. The production of most primary horticultural food products is done in an environmentally friendly way.  The board ensures, therefore, that its marketing and development efforts continue to support the environment.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the significant health benefits which arise from increased vegetable and fruit consumption are being increasingly recognised. In addition to positive environmental impact, increased horticultural consumption will be associated with the enhancement of the general health level.  The gains to society from improved marketing and consumption of horticultural produce, therefore, extends beyond the direct economic benefits.  An Bord Glas has promoted a wide range of horticultural products to the consumer in recent years, including, for example, potatoes, tomatoes, apples and soft fruit.  In 1996, the board implemented a multi-sectoral promotions plan which provided for a comprehensive series of actions to ensure co-ordinated and balanced promotional activities in all the key market sectors.  I will return to this subject later.</P>
    <P>The development plan envisaged an increase in output of more than £56 million, an increase of 33 per cent on the 1992 figures.  On the assumption the target is achieved, the board envisaged that employment would increase in amenity horticulture, vegetables and mushrooms.  Horticulture is labour intensive, as Deputies are aware, and this is significant in the context of employment. Horticulture represents only 5 per cent of gross agricultural output, yet it accounts for 14 per cent of the agricultural labour force.</P>
    <P>I want now to let Deputies have some further <Col N="242" /> indications of areas in the development plan where progress has been made.  The board has placed great emphasis on hygiene and quality. Quality programmes have been developed specifically for the needs of the horticultural industry.  In addition, a comprehensive range of quality manuals have established appropriate codes based on EU and national legislation as well as best practice for the management of horticultural products from the growing environment to the end user.</P>
    <P>The quality programmes currently target primary producers and wholesalers and pre-packers to present the highest quality product for sale to the retailer or processor of horticultural products.  Participants are required to develop and operate quality control and traceability systems as an integral part of the quality programmes.  All quality audits of participating enterprises are undertaken by an independent quality auditor and participants who achieve An Bord Glas standards are awarded quality and hygiene awards or certificates as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Market intelligence is another area of crucial importance and the board engages in the collection and dissemination of data on wholesale market prices, horticultural production, retail consumer expenditure, sectoral market research and information on EU trade and trends.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the question of promotion. These activities are undertaken by An Bord Glas by promoting the concepts of healthy eating and living, quality produce and the enhancement of the environment.  Promotions target the benefits of greater fruit, vegetable and potato consumption for a healthier lifestyle and the contribution plants and flowers make to our .environment and lifestyle.  Medical research worldwide has confirmed evidence that vitamin E, which occurs in many vegetable and fruit oils, dramatically reduces the risk of heart disease.  In addition, increased consumption of fruit and vegetables in the daily diet can help in the prevention of certain forms of cancer.</P>
    <P>Promotion is conducted on a generic basis utilising a wide variety of promotional media.  As Deputies will have seen from the 1996 annual report of An Bord Glas, it published and implemented a promotions plan which had a multi-sectoral approach to consumer communications spanning six key market areas for fruit and vegetables while the amenity products covered three areas.  Specifically the areas covered in the fruit and vegetable sector were consumers, retailers, catering, medical, schools and colleges and community groups, while the amenity products covered consumers, retailers and specifiers.  A wide range of organisations were consulted and collaborated in the implementation of various promotional projects under this programme.  In addition, a wide range of media advertising projects was undertaken.  An Bord Glas also participated in and supported a number of shows and exhibitions as well as producing <Col N="243" /> and distributing a wide variety of promotional literature.  Demand for literature increased substantially as promotional work progressed during the year.  Promotional activities are continuing in 1997 and will be further continued in 1998.  The promotional activities provide a co-ordinated and integrated approach to the promotion of horticultural produce on the domestic market.  In general, the intention in 1998 is to base the promotion on an overall unifying theme which will take account of the needs of various sub-sectors.  The promotion plans will be devised and implemented in close consultation with retailers, producers and relevant An Bord Glas personnel.</P>
    <P>Under the 1990 Act An Bord Glas also has a strong development function which it implements by co-ordinating the total development effort in conjunction with other relevant State agencies.  It directs resources into the areas where they are required to realise the potential in the various product sectors.  It liaises with interested groups to ensure a fully integrated approach to promoting growth within the industry and encourages development on an individual business level through assistance for feasibility studies, the operation of business development programmes and other related measures.</P>
    <P>I will now speak specifically about some of the product sector areas.  In the case of mushrooms, the aim under the development plan was to increase output from £51 million to £71 million and to actively encourage the continued orderly development of the industry in line with State policy and developments in the marketplace.  The value of the mushroom industry at the end of 1996 was almost £73 million, so the target of An Bord Glas for the sector has been achieved.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas has carried out a wide range of activities in this sector, including market research in the UK and continental markets, promotional activity, the organisation of the national auditing and hygiene awards, organising demonstration farm sites and business management training programmes, an in-depth review of the industry in conjunction with other State agencies and the promoting of spent mushroom compost projects.</P>
    <P>Since the start of the development plan the mushroom sector has performed very well overall. Initially there were difficulties with sterling, increasing costs and reducing margins coupled with a more competitive market.  However, 1996 was a satisfactory year.  Demand from the UK market was strong and developments in exchange rates favoured trade.  The wholesale market maintained a reasonably good demand and supply balance during the year and average returns were up.</P>
    <P>Challenges facing the sector include market developments, environment pressures and recruitment.  The industry will have to ensure that the adoption of new technology, which will lead to an increase in total production, is balanced <Col N="244" /> with the potential of the markets to absorb extra production.</P>
    <P>There are at least six key issues facing this important industry: the continued orderly development of production and marketing in order to prevent fragmentation of the sector; potential future growth of market sectors, for example, multiple markets, and other market sectors, including exports; technological developments at home and abroad, for example, phase 3 compost, indoor composting, alternative growing systems, picking aids etc., which will impact on production levels and viability; environmental issues, including waste disposal; training and recruitment; and the impact of the single currency.</P>
    <P>In the case of other vegetable crops, for example, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers etc., an increase of £2.6 million in output value was aimed at under the development plan.  It is expected that in this sector domestic <i>per capita</i> consumption of the main products will reach the level of the European average.  The picture in this sector, however, is not as positive as that in the mushroom sector.  Returns to the glasshouse sector are unpredictable and variable and influenced by many factors.  Tomato output will have the biggest influence on the Bord Glas target for this sector because it is by far the most important crop in value terms.  Unfortunately, since the launch of the development plan the total acreage of protected crops has fallen.  While a small acreage of new glass has been erected, this has not been enough to replace the loss which resulted from high energy costs and EU expansion.</P>
    <P>Nineteen ninety-five was a disastrous year for tomatoes due to gluts in the EU market which resulted in very low prices to producers and a consequential dramatic drop in the output value of tomatoes by £2.8 million.  In 1996 there was a much improved situation which led to a significant increase in the output figure compared with 1995, making an important contribution to the target of An Bord Glas.  Cucumber and pepper production is small and it is not likely that we will see any significant increase in the production of these crops.  Total lettuce production has decreased in recent years, and the flat lettuce market has been affected by the demand for iceberg lettuce.</P>
    <P>The cost of energy and low prices driven by developments within the EU continue to cause problems.  The key issues facing the sector are: new developments within the marketplace and a move toward direct purchasing and centralised distribution; opportunities for grower groups to have closer liaison with fresh produce buyers, negotiate better returns and improve co-ordination; developments in other producing countries; high costs of reinvesting in and developing production units; high cost of energy; the need for specialist labour skills.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas has been taking and will continue to take a range of actions to achieve the targets set for this sector.  Group marketing has <Col N="245" /> been actively encouraged and assisted.  An important aid to this sector is the operation of the An Bord Glas Tomato Quality Mark which was introduced in 1992 and continued in 1996 and 1997.  This scheme is used to assist producers raise quality standards, inform them of relevant legislation, promote quality produce in the marketplace and help them in obtaining better returns. Promotion of tomatoes was carried out and will continue to be carried out to highlight quality and increase consumption.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas played a major role in having the business expansion scheme extended to the glasshouse sector and prepared a guide to widely promote the scheme as a vehicle with which to raise funds for investment in the industry.</P>
    <P>I now turn to field vegetables.  The objective in the development plan was to increase domestic output from £26 million to £32 million by 1999 &mdash; an increase of £6 million.  This target has been exceeded with output reaching £35 million by the end of 1996.  The main emphasis within the sector will be on maintaining and increasing domestic market share which stands at 70 per cent to 75 per cent for principal vegetable lines.  Vegetable trade with the United Kingdom is expected to reach £4.5 million by 1999.  While the overall value of the sector has increased, rising input costs combined with lower producer margins and the availability of cheap imports are putting severe pressure on producers and leading to some growers leaving the sector.</P>
    <P>With almost 60 per cent of the retail market controlled by multiples which are introducing central distribution and supplier rationalisation strategies, there is an immediate requirement for smaller producers to work in a more co-operative and focused manner.  In terms of market demand, there is a growing requirement for exotic prepacked and prepared vegetables.  There is significant market potential in the domestic, retail, multiples and food services sector.</P>
    <P>An important element of the work of An Bord Glas in this sector is the market co-ordination programme which was introduced in 1995 and continued to operate in 1996 and 1997.  The benefits of this programme have been acknowledged by producers, wholesalers and retailers.  The Horticulture Industry Forum which was established towards the end of 1995 by my predecessor, Deputy Deenihan, also plays a crucial role in this sector as it does for the horticulture industry as a whole.  The forum was established to encourage greater co-ordination, co-operation and communication within the horticulture industry with particular emphasis on closer links between those in the industry comprising the supply chain.  It is also designed to create closer and more dynamic links between the statutory bodies, such as An Bord Glas and Teagasc, my Department and the various sectors of the industry, such as growers, wholesalers, retailers and their representatives.</P>
    <P>The key issues facing this sector are: to encourage and facilitate increased co-ordination among field vegetable producers; to support producers in <Col N="246" /> adapting to the trend towards centralised distribution among multiple retailers; to continue to improve quality standards at producer and prepacker level; to improve the flow of market information to producers; to address the issue of labour availability; to keep abreast of technological developments, i.e. new production methods; to monitor and encourage the uptake of the new EU producer group scheme.</P>
    <P>The output of soft fruit has exceeded the target increase of £2.5 million set down in the development plan.  Valued at £6 million in 1992, the soft fruit sector had increased its value to £9.07 million by 1996.  Strawberries continue to be the dominant product, accounting for an estimated two thirds of production.</P>
    <P>The market for minor fruit, such as tayberries, blueberries and loganberries, is expected to increase while there is also scope for increasing fruit production for processing.  Export markets, particularly for strawberries, are being developed and further potential exists.  The erratic and severe weather conditions during 1997 caused serious problems for soft fruit production in terms of reduced yield output and low quality standards.</P>
    <P>The processing sector accounts for 28 per cent of the soft fruit industry.  Ireland is the only country in the European Union producing Cambridge Favourite type strawberries.  This gives us a strong competitive advantage in terms of selling to processors in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Despite the market potential, the level of acreage is declining.  To combat this decline, An Bord Glas, in consultation with Teagasc, producer representatives and the processing industry, has introduced a scheme to improve quality in the sector and encourage increased production of strawberries for processing.  This scheme is part of a long-term strategy designed to guarantee the survival of the strawberry processing industry by achieving better quality, higher yields and output, and encouraging the maintenance of a critical mass and economies of scale among growers.  The scheme will also act as a strong marketing tool in promoting Irish strawberries to processors operating in the Irish market.  An Bord Glas has had ongoing liaison with groups operating in this sector and encouraged and assisted group marketing projects.</P>
    <P>The key issues in this area are: to maintain and increase, where appropriate, the acreage and number of growers to ensure the viability of the soft fruit industry, both fresh and processing; to increase quality and hygiene standards at production level; to promote and assist the establishment of producer groups and further develop existing groups; to provide producers with up to date market information.  Other key issues include exchange rates, exports, developments in the European Union, technology and labour productivity.</P>
    <P>In the top fruit sector growth has exceeded the modest target set in the development plan.  Output value increased from £2.17 million in 1992 to <Col N="247" /> £3.63 million in January 1997.  Irish apple producers hold an estimated 14 per cent share of the domestic market.  During 1997 domestic output and the quality of domestic produce was severely hampered by frost during the spring growth season. With the changing retail structure to centralised distribution and supply rationalisation, it is vital that apple producers are more co-ordinated in targeting the retail market.  An Bord Glas has assisted producers with promotion in this area to maintain and increase market share.</P>
    <P>Among the key issues are: to encourage increased co-operation among producers to increase economies of scale; to provide strategic direction to producers in terms of identifying and targeting retail customers; to provide marketing and promotional support to producers; and to assess market potential for new apple varieties. Other key issues include recruitment and developments in the EU market.</P>
    <P>The ware potato sector has been under severe market pressures in recent years with a combination of poor pricing and increasing customer standards.  Significant investments have taken place in the potato sector since the mid-1980's under the FEOGA and OPARDF grants schemes.  However, some businesses which have invested heavily are under financial pressure due to poor markets.</P>
    <P>Potato production increased by approximately 10 per cent during the period 1992-6 leading to an oversupplied market in 1996.  Preliminary estimates project 1997 production to be reduced by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.  These changes are expected to lead to more balanced supply and demand.  There are also structural changes which concentrate an increasing percentage of production in the hands of larger producers while smaller producers are moving out of production.</P>
    <P>The An Bord Glas development plan target was to increase output by £3 million.  The 1992 output was valued at £51.1 million.  The assessment of the achievement of this target is complicated by annual price and yield variations.  The 1996 output was estimated at £57 million.  While there has been modest growth in production since 1992, sustainability of this growth will be difficult to maintain unless there is ongoing growth in export markets and-or the development of new value added and processed products in the domestic market.  I understand there may be developments in the chip potato sector.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas introduced new quality awards for potato pre-packers in 1996.  The awards were an important step forward for the potato sector as they highlighted a strong commitment to promoting quality and hygiene within the sector.  The An Bord Glas awards are assessed on the basis of the quality manual for potatoes which outlines a code of practice for handling, storage and marketing. This manual forms the checklist against which participating companies in the An Bord Glas quality and hygiene programme are audited <Col N="248" /> by an independent quality consultant.  The companies receive feedback on areas where improvements are needed in their systems, operations and facilities and this has been an effective mechanism for putting new standards in place.  The key issues in this sector are to promote value added initiatives for potatoes and monitor fresh market consumer trends; to support and promote enterprises supplying the catering trade; to support new processing initiatives; to monitor and encourage export opportunities for fresh potatoes; to expand the quality programme which An Bord Glas operates for potatoes; to promote the quality programme to major retailers and to improve the timeliness of production and market intelligence in conjunction with my Department and Teagasc.</P>
    <P>The seed potato industry has undergone many significant developments in recent years. However, its competitiveness remains a continuing cause for concern.  Against this background An Bord Glas undertook a strategic review of the industry in 1997 with a view to developing new policy initiatives.  This review is being finalised and will set the agenda for State agencies and the seed potato industry for the coming years.  The development plan target for seed potatoes is to increase output by £2 million.  The 1992 output was valued at £4.7 million.</P>
    <P>I am aware that my time is exhausted. However, I have much more to say on this issue and I would be grateful if I might use some of my colleagues' time.</P>

Among the key issues subject to review are measures to co-ordinate and monitor the promotion and implementation of the seed potato review recommendations with State agencies and the industry; measures to promote and assist the development of increased group co-ordination of seed potato producers and merchants; ongoing monitoring of the An Bord Glas minituber scheme and the development of a seed potato export strategy in association with key exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The output of the nursery stock sector was valued at £12 million in 1992 and this has increased to almost £20 million at the end of 1996. The target in the development plan was an increase of £14 million, and over 50 per cent of the target has been achieved.  This sector of the business has continued to experience significant growth in recent times.  There has been a 64 per cent increase in turnover since 1992.  The main domestic markets, namely, home retail, wholesale, local authorities and services, are performing well.  Domestic consumer market penetration continues to rise and is now at 67 per cent, although it will be important to categorise the remaining 33 per cent in order to take a strategic standpoint on domestic market expansion. Coupled with this is the fact that we have one of <Col N="249" /> the lowest spends <i>per capita</i> in Europe, indicating further potential, although it is imperative that this obvious market potential is balanced with appropriate development of our production base. As production capacity increases, the industry will be forced to take a more proactive, co-ordinated approach to developing export markets. Exports are worth about £3 million at present.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas supported initiatives to address the imbalance with regard to VAT in the hardy nursery stock sector.  The results were the reduction of VAT in the last budget from 21 per cent to 12.5 per cent and the introduction of registration for VAT liability on sales of produce in excess of £40,000 annually.  These measures provide a balanced package for this sector of the industry by removing or reducing significantly certain tax based distortions of competition in the garden centre market.  Also in this sector An Bord Glas has highlighted the importance of a co-ordinated and planned approach for landscaping on a national level and took steps to encourage the advanced incorporation of detailed landscape design and specifications in the planning of road projects by bringing together local authorities to assist the hardy nursery industry to respond to market requirements.</P>
    <P>The key issues facing this sector are to ensure that production capacity keeps in step with increasing consumer demand; the obvious deficiency in business and management skills in some areas, which imbalance needs to be addressed; the generation of more pertinent market information which will allow An Bord Glas to address issues such as import substitution, market trends, perceived value, etc.; formal and pragmatic market entry strategies for export markets need to be adopted; at a retail level, the importance of quality and relevant promotion will increase in significance as the sector competes more directly with the leisure and gift market.</P>
    <P>Ireland has the lowest spend <i>per capita</i> in the EU on live plants and floricultural products.  The board recognised that this issue needed to be addressed by way of generic promotion and this has been and is being done.  In this regard the recent provision of EU funding for promotion should be of considerable benefit not only to the hardy nursery stock sector but to the amenity sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>The protected flowers, pot plants and cut foliage sector of the amenity market has seen continued consumer growth over the last 12 months, with total value of sales increasing by some 9 per cent.  This figure can be explained by an increase in the number of households buying rather than an increase in spend per household which remained virtually flat and which, in European terms, is very low.  One of the fundamental characteristics of this sector is the small production base.  As a result, much attention is focused on identifying market niches where Ireland can compete in terms of delivery, unique products or as a supplement to imported products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> Two notable exceptions are the bedding plant industry which is now worth in excess of £4 million a year and the cut foliage industry which is developing significant export markets.  The key issues facing this sector are the erosion of the Irish production base in more open trading conditions and the effects of this on the dynamics of the supply chain and Irish producers' ability to meet customers' demands; market entry or expansion of existing enterprises which requires significant capital investment; the fragmented nature of the sector emphasises the need to identify and invest in profitable market niches such as cut foliage.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the Christmas tree industry.  At production level the Irish Christmas tree industry has experienced rapid growth.  It has been estimated that about 1,500 hectares of Christmas trees have been established in Ireland, representing a total investment of over £50 million. About 75 per cent of this production is owned by five major groups and the remainder by an estimated 150 growers.  Best estimates of current output indicate a home market of 350,000 units and an export market of 100,000 units.  This represents a gross market value of £6.75 million and export earnings of £1.5 million.  The key issues facing this sector are the following: while some companies have investigated the European markets extensively there is a need for more research; more transparent co-operation is required; and generic promotion on the domestic market is required as a proactive defensive mechanism against artificial trees.</P>
    <P>The annual report indicates that the horticultural industry performed well overall in 1996 with output, excluding potatoes, increasing to over £166 million compared to £141 million in 1995. The mushroom, soft fruit and amenity sectors had good performances.  The tomato sector had a satisfactory season following a poor one in 1995, while areas such as field vegetables and potatoes had a difficult year.  It will also be seen from the report that the board undertook a wide variety of projects and initiatives aimed directly at promoting, developing and assisting the horticultural industry and with a view to achieving the growth targets in its development plan.  If one looks at some of the specific products in the plan it will be seen that already the mushroom, field vegetables, ware potatoes, fruit, protected flowers, pot plants, outdoor flowers and bulbs have all exceeded the targets in the plan and the nursery stock and Christmas tree sectors are set to reach their targets. The overall target increase of £56 million was within £6 million of being achieved by the end of 1996, less than half way through the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>While the overall value of the field vegetables sector has increased there are factors putting severe pressure on producers.  Similarly, there are difficult and intractable problems to overcome in the seed potato sector while the protected crops area continues to face major difficulties and challenges. However, both my Department and An <Col N="251" /> Bord Glas will continue to take whatever steps we can within the constraints of the funding available and EU rules to ensure these important sectors will be promoted and developed to the maximum extent.</P>
    <P>I thank the chairman of An Bord Glas and members of the board for their dedication to their work.  I compliment my predecessor, Deputy Deenihan, on the work he did in this area when he was Minister of State.  Finally, I thank the House for giving me extra time to complete my statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive statement and I wish him success with his appointment, particularly in this area which is an important sector for those involved.</P>
      <P>The annual report is an excellent production. It not only looks well but, for somebody such as I who must familiarise myself with the subject reasonably quickly, it is also highly readable.  The report contains essential information with little padding so it was a pleasure to read.</P>
      <P>The development plan, which is central to the work of An Bord Glas and those whom it seeks to encourage, is a seminal document in the horticulture sector.  It appeared ambitious when it was first produced but the targets it set for the 1996-1999 period have already been substantially met although we are only half way through the programme. The overall target was to increase output by £56 million and the figure of £50 million has already been achieved.  That is a source of great satisfaction to everybody involved.  Having achieved so much in such a short time, it behoves An Bord Glas to increase its targets rather than being tempted into complacency.  Clearly there is more potential in some sectors.  I congratulate the growers, the board and its staff on the success of the plan so far.  They have worked hard to achieve their targets and I hope their progress continues.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss the role of An Bord Glas. What does it do and how well does it do it?  What does the board cost and is it value for money for the taxpayer?  Does it justify its continued existence? There is a view in some quarters that all promotion work associated with our food production ought to be the responsibility of An Bord Bia.  That is an attractive option when one takes a cursory broad look at the food production industry.  However, horticulture is an unusual business in that it is comprised of many relatively small elements which require a focused approach rather than being included within a huge organisation such as An Bord Bia which deals with vast quantities of produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Glas defines its role as improving all aspects of horticulture by developing, promoting, co-ordinating and assisting the production, marketing and consumption of horticultural produce. It is difficult to see how a huge organisation dealing with vast quantities of products could give that type of focus to an industry that is scattered and produces many different products in relatively <Col N="252" /> small quantities.  The board's objectives are correct and the report on the development plan's progress to date appears to suggest it is achieving its objectives.  In addition, the board is not substituting or duplicating the work of other State agencies, a possibility of which we must beware.</P>
    <P>An attractive feature of the board is the fact that it focuses on the industry from the point of view of the marketplace.  That is a trend which our agriculture industry must face in the future. Many of the proposals put forward by Commissioner Santer and others are designed to reorientate agriculture to face the full blast of market forces.  However, that is a debate for another day because undoubtedly we will oppose many proposals which we believe will not be good for Irish agriculture.  Nonetheless, the international trend in all business is to orientate production to the marketplace rather than to the producer.  It is heartening, therefore, to learn from the report that this is one of the objectives of the board's activities.</P>
    <P>The horticulture sector does not enjoy many of the supports which other industries and other sectors of agriculture enjoy.  There is no area aid from the EU.  No premiums are paid by the EU and there is no compensation for green pound devaluations.  There are no disadvantaged area payments.  In short, none of the supports we have negotiated for other sectors of agriculture is generally available to the horticulture sector.  It is, therefore, exposed to market pressures and intense competition.  An Bord Glas is a small operation and I am heartened to see it concentrate so heavily on the marketplace.  That emphasis can only be good although it can often be painful.</P>
    <P>The annual accounts of An Bord Glas show that the board, more than many other semi-State companies, is run on a virtual shoestring and appears to provide good value for money.  In 1996 its total grant-in-aid was just over £1.5 million.  I am slow ever to suggest we should spend more taxpayers' money but given the importance of the marketing, promotional, quality auditing and other activities undertaken by the board to make our horticulture industry more efficient and userfriendly, a modest increase in the 1998 Estimates would be justified and warranted.  The increase is not being sought to expand the staff numbers in An Bord Glas but to help at the coal face of promotion and quality incentives.  Given that the industry is currently worth in excess of £220 million, about 1 per cent of that &mdash; some £2.2 million to £2.5 million &mdash; would be modest expenditure by the State on this important work.  I hope the Minister and Minister of State will make a case to the Minister for Finance for small additional expenditure on An Bord Glas's promotional and quality assurance activities.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the employment content is high; horticulture is labour intensive relative to agriculture generally.  It is environmentally friendly and the full-time and part-time employment figures demonstrate the industry's ability to <Col N="253" /> create jobs.  As to the cost, the industry undoubtedly provides value for money, so a slight increase in money for the purposes mentioned should be forthcoming in 1998.</P>
    <P>The agriculture section of the Government programme and the Fianna Fáil manifesto make no mention of either horticulture or An Bord Glas.  I accept it was a Fianna Fáil Government which brought the board into existence and I know the Minister of State is interested in the area but it is disappointing that no reference was made to it in either the manifestos or the programme for Government.  That may have no significance but I make the point in any case.</P>
    <P>There is great potential in highlighting the health benefits of vegetables.  People are now more concerned about their diet and health.  I have seven children and the most difficult thing to convince them to do is to eat vegetables &mdash; that may be unique to our family but we also live in the country.  It would be worthwhile if An Bord Glas undertook promotional activities in the schools, pointing out the healthy qualities of vegetables. In this world of junk food there is much consumption of foods which are not especially healthy and a relatively small consumption by young people and children of vegetables and fruit, which are regarded as secondary to chocolate and sweets.  It would be good for the health of the nation and this industry, and for a host of other reasons, if the Department of Health and Children and An Bord Glas put across to young people the value of eating vegetables for their future health.  However, An Bord Glas only has a limited budget in this respect.</P>
    <P>The horticulture industry may be relatively small but its total output in 1996 was in excess of £220 million, its employment content is high and its expansion has been well in excess of planned growth.  It is a considerable industry.</P>
    <P>I forgot to say that I wish to share five minutes of my time with Deputy Yates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a number of individual sectors.  It is clear from the report that 1996 was a topsy-turvy year for field vegetables.  The two halves of the year were totally different.  In the first half supply was severely limited in an open marketplace, which gave rise to satisfactory price increases, but the difficulties experienced by growers meant they were not able to benefit from this &mdash; they did not have enough produce.  The second half saw overproduction, good quality produce and bad prices.  The last six months were difficult and it is hard to see what An Bord Glas or anyone else can do in such a case, although valiant efforts were made to match supply to demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of the field vegetable sector nonetheless increased in 1996 from £30 million to £35 million.  However, the import figures are worrying, because they were almost as high as domestic <Col N="254" /> output.  I do not propose the simplistic solution that we should not import vegetables.  That is clearly nonsense because we cannot produce all our own vegetables, for reasons of seasonality apart from anything else, so we will always have to import vegetables at some times of the year. Nonetheless, the trade balance is not satisfactory &mdash; we export virtually no field vegetables and import half our requirements.  We must work hard to strike a better balance because we import large amounts of carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, lettuces, onions, etc.  Some of this is due to seasonality but we must produce more of our own field vegetables and import less.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas makes a significant contribution to the promotion of quality and hygiene.  It is a feature of all aspects of the sector that the board is continually prodding and encouraging growers and the message must be continually driven home that growers must recognise the importance of the consumer, the demand for higher quality and that great buzz word &ldquo;traceability&rdquo; which is becoming such a feature of consumer requirements. The board has assisted companies in this area and has advised them on obtaining accreditation from ISO 9000, etc.  Those quality marks are part of the drive for market share and I congratulate everyone associated with that effort, which I hope will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Another interesting development, which was made clear from talking to people in An Bord Glas and reading the report, is that it is possible to try to balance supply with demand.  By keeping informed about weekly occurrences at the producer end, it will be possible to anticipate market requirements and growers' ability to fulfil them. For example buyers should be told who will have a large quantity of carrots next week rather than allow them be tempted to take the easy option of importation.</P>
    <P>I have questioned whether all of this might better be undertaken by a larger organisation but a large organisation concentrating on a multitude of issues cannot be expected to get down to that level of detail.  One of the features of An Bord Glas I like most is that the board deals with that kind of detail which will become more rather than less important in the future.  We now have a huge multinational supermarket chain, Tesco which along with Marks and Spencer, whose standards are very high, have their sources of supply in the United Kingdom.  It entails a great deal of effort on our part to convince them they can obtain an equally acceptable or better source of supply here.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas has its representatives actively in the marketplace meeting the representatives of Tesco and other multi-national companies convincing them of the importance for us that they purchase and source their materials here, but they are very demanding customers whose general trend is to cut out wholesalers and go direct to producers.  In the United Kingdom, where they have been engaging in that practice for some years, there are very large producers which means <Col N="255" /> these large chains can get exactly what they want, in the volumes they want when they want them. That is a tremendous challenge to us.  These big supermarket chains like Tesco like to be able to obtain what they want, when they want it at a price they deem appropriate.  We must orientate ourselves to the direct challenge presented by their going direct to our producers.  Our producers may need to get together in groups to meet that challenge.  I congratulate An Bord Glas on efforts made to date, which are so important to the future of our food industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the soft fruits business, more than half of which comprises strawberries. The business appears to have had a reasonably satisfactory year.  One of the great success stories of our horticultural industry is mushroom production.  We are the largest suppliers to the United Kingdom market having produced some 54,000 tonnes in 1996 of which we consume only a tiny proportion.  In relative terms this is a huge exports success story I would like to highlight. Its success was not built on chance but on planning with excellent producers.  While its future is not assured, an excellent foundation has been laid for its development.  It is a large market right on our doorstep which we are satisfying better than any other suppliers.  We must bear in mind that there are others, such as the Dutch anxious to get into that marketplace so it behoves us to do everything in our power to retain and expand on that already high quality market we have penetrated successfully to date.  I have noted what An Bord Glas is doing to maintain a focus on that important endeavour.</P>
    <P>The tomato industry having experienced a very difficult year in 1995 had a much better return last year.  Nonetheless it is a difficult business for reasons of scale, of huge competition, of relative dumping from the Canary Islands and elsewhere in the back-end of the season.  There is something we could do here though it raises difficult precedents for other users of energy.  We could endeavour to obtain some advantage in energy prices from An Bord Gáis.  While noting a rather bland statement that discussions were held with producers and An Bord Gáis in relation to energy costs, as far as I am aware nothing happened in that respect during the tenure of the previous Government or of this one to date.  If the Minister was able to make a special case for that it would be of significant benefit to tomato growers.  While we are not in an era of making special appeals to industry for something which is a natural resource, because of the small quantities involved and its effects, a case could well be made for it.</P>
    <P>Potato production is another difficult business. The year 1995 was disastrous and it had a smaller knock-on effect in 1996.  In relation to legislation on below-cost selling, potatoes are treated in the same way as perishable fruits and so on which are excluded from below-cost selling.  The issue of bringing potatoes within the below-cost selling legislation arose in the course of the year.  Since <Col N="256" /> potatoes are not perishable in the same sense as strawberries or soft fruits, it would be reasonable and fair and a worthwhile exercise on the part of the Government.  Perhaps the Minister would make that case also.</P>
    <P>We have a very negative trade balance in seed potatoes.  We import more than we export.  We should try to rectify that.  I think An Bord Glas is active in that area but I would urge it to be more so.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Annual Report of An Bord Glas indicates satisfactory progress in achieving what were ambitious targets in the development plan.  The board has a tough job, as horticulture is very exposed to competitive forces which will be its strength in the long run.  In the meantime, however, many challenges must be faced.  I urge the Minister to continue to face them and he will have our full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Coveney for allowing me two minutes.  As former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry it is certainly not my intention to trespass on current activities or on our party spokesperson dealing with national issues.  Nonetheless I express my appreciation for the support An Bord Glas has given to the Enniscorthy Strawberry Fair in County Wexford.  An Bord Glas is its main sponsor having tied itself into a three year deal.  I express my appreciation to the present Chairman and board and Mr. Brendan O'Donnell, its chief executive, all of whom have been very involved in sponsoring grower awards.  This fair is the shop window and platform for the county festival, in the largest soft fruit growing area in the country, which is not only a huge boost to tourism but has done much to promote sales of high quality Wexford-grown strawberries.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me, as former Minister and a Deputy for this area not to express my deep appreciation.  Indeed I was requested by all involved in County Wexford to do so today.  I hope the Minister of State will convey my thanks. I hope this level of sponsorship of this group which, in overall terms is modest, will continue under this Government.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a bheith agam labhairt sa díospóireacht tábhachtacht seo.  Treaslaím le cathaoirleach An Bord Glas, an bord agus le daoine atá ag obair don bhórd as ucht an tuairisc bliantúil seo a chur ós ár gcomhair.  Tá sé leagaithe amach go maith.  Tá sé so-léite agus tá sé furasta teacht ar nós eolas ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have more than a passing interest in this subject because when the Development Plan 1994-99 was launched, I was Minister of State with responsibility for food and horticulture in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and I was very involved with the plan at that time.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, well in this regard.  My contact with the board at that time was valuable because it was doing a good job in <Col N="257" /> terms of putting our industry in a modern context.</P>
    <P>Ironically, when I left the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry shortly after the development plan was published, I became Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for health promotion.  Part of health promotion is healthy eating and my contacts with An Bord Glas continued after I left the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  During my first year in the Department of Health the theme for Healthy Eating Week was &ldquo;Eat More Bread, Cereals and Potatoes&rdquo;.  The theme this year was &ldquo;Eat More Fruit and Vegetables&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Coveney when he talked about the problem of getting children to eat vegetables.  The Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health published a leaflet containing 12 tips on fibre in the diet, one of which states: &ldquo;Offer raw vegetables to children, especially when preparing vegetables for dinner&rdquo;.  That tip may be useful in persuading children to eat raw vegetables.</P>
    <P>Fibre is an important part of diet.  It swells inside the body when water is added to it.  It is important, therefore, to drink plenty of water when eating a high fibre diet.  Fibre helps us to dispose of food wastes in our bodies.  It is fundamental to a healthy diet to eat at least four helpings of fruit and vegetables per day.  Unfortunately, we have not reached that level in Ireland. We should be clear when we talk about portions. A portion can be a glass of orange juice, a portion of vegetables, an apple or a banana.  As a nation we are not eating enough fruit and vegetables to maintain a healthy diet.</P>
    <P>Health promotion is about the individual taking responsibility for his or her own well-being thereby reducing the need in the long-term for hospital care.  It is about promoting health and preventing disease.  An Bord Glas has played a major part in getting across the message about the need to eat more fruit and vegetables, as has the Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health.  We must continue to work at getting that message across because the national average intake of fibre must be increased to at least four helpings per day.</P>
    <P>Reading the report I was somewhat disappointed with the figures for seed potatoes and the decrease in our imports between 1995 and 1996. When I became Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry I was surprised and disappointed at the level of imports of basic varieties of seed potatoes such as British Queens, Kerr Pinks, Golden Wonders and so on. During my time in office I tried to make some progress in this area.  I realise structural difficulties exist in the industry but with our climatic advantages and the fact that there are markets to be serviced, this is an area on which the Minister of State and the board must focus because the £2 million growth figure, and more, is achievable.</P>
    <P>Before I left the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry I introduced Statutory Instruments <Col N="258" /> in relation to the rotation of the potato crop.  They were necessary to prevent the spread of eelworm which can be devastating when it gets into soil.  As part of that general environmental agenda, to which all parties in this House subscribe, keeping our soil in optimum condition is vitally important to the success of our horticultural industry, the growth of output here and the subsequent increase in jobs.</P>
    <P>Another area to which the horticultural industry lends itself is the employment of people with disabilities, intellectual or physical.  I am not talking about people with disabilities being hired as a form of charity; that is not the answer.  People should be employed as of right, disabled or otherwise, and people with disabilities would be productive in whatever operation they are employed. They would earn their pay but in doing so they would be making a worthwhile contribution to the enterprise in which they work.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to ensure consideration is given to this proposal.  I know from previous incarnations that he has a strong personal commitment in this area and in making this appeal to him I am aware I am pushing an open door.</P>
    <P>The mushroom industry continues to prosper but we should examine how that industry developed and the reason it has been so successful. The first important prerequisite was the fact that the correct growing technology was used at the outset.  We got it right on the production side also.  With the involvement of the IDA a marketing structure was put in place to ensure quick and ready access to the market.  During the 1990s the industry experienced difficulties in terms of currency fluctuations, etc., but it continues to prosper.</P>
    <P>During my time in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I was looking around to see if there was some other comparable product that could be developed along the same strategic lines as the mushroom industry.  There was a degree of unanimity that the most likely successor to the mushroom as a big player in terms of providing employment and increasing output was hardy nursery stock, particularly given our climatic advantages.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see the level of development that has occurred in that sector.  This industry would benefit greatly from production and distribution along the lines of the mushroom model. The satellite growers concept could be involved, whereby seedlings would be passed on to producers who would return them to a central area for marketing.</P>
    <P>Because of the particular structure of the British market, where substantial progress can be made, there are a number of peak or focus times when one's product must be ready to a high quality. I look forward to seeing further progress in this regard.  I congratulate all those involved in the development so far.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney touched on the concept of seasonality in terms of our production of fruit and <Col N="259" /> vegetables.  Seasonality is obviously a limiting factor because some fruit and vegetables can only be produced at certain periods.  Interestingly, domestically produced vegetables collectively enjoy a market share of 70 to 75 per cent.  There is still room to improve those figures, but the extent varies from year to year.  Climate in a particular year can affect yields and currency difficulties can also affect prices.</P>
    <P>The dilemma always is to match supply to market demand.  Unfortunately this is an inexact science because there are all sorts of variable factors which cannot be controlled and, therefore, our industry is at the behest of those vagaries.  It is encouraging, however, that the market share of indigenous potatoes, cabbages and mushrooms is some 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>Sometimes an overly negative picture is presented in relation to our industry generally. Food and horticulture formed part of my brief in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. The message in terms of developing the food and horticulture industries was the same &mdash; both industries will continue to be consumer led so we must always emphasise quality.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the health aspect of vegetables and how they are an important part of our diet.  This education process must continue and I have no doubt that it will.  I see many changes among younger people's choice of diet.  One must produce what consumers want at the price and quality they require.  Through various marketing measures we can introduce new produce and change tastes.  All that will continue to be possible.</P>
    <P>Employment levels within the industry, including the producers and others involved, is what it is all about.  We produce a product that is necessary to a family's diet, but we also have to work towards creating employment.  Some areas are more employment orientated than others.  Both the Department and An Bord Glas were involved in producer groups because economies of scale can occur at a number of levels.  For instance, a carrot producers' group was formed in the Ardmore area of my own constituency.  Because of favourable climatic conditions in the Lismore area, their carrots were available some weeks before those of other producers.  They discovered that savings could be achieved by using one van to transport the group's produce to the market in Cork, where most of the carrots were sold, instead of seven people travelling there separately. There are also ways of staggering production so that the total fully grown crop will not arrive at the same time for every producer.</P>
    <P>The question of structures in the industry is vitally important as scale becomes a bigger factor throughout the food industry.  In the context of rural areas, the more producers who can be kept in business the better.  Even though horticultural activity may be part-time and supplementary to other sources of income, we should strive to keep as many sources of income as possible in place <Col N="260" /> for rural communities.  The circulation of such income is what keeps local economies running and developing.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss apples in the context of the Minister of State's area of South Tipperary as well as Kilkenny and Waterford.  As the Minister of State said in his speech, domestically grown apples account for about 14 per cent of the market. I believe this figure can be improved but I am not underestimating the difficulties in attempting to do so.  As a Minster of State, the advice I received from Teagasc was that the area for growing dessert apples was basically south of a line from Dublin to Limerick, in valley areas.</P>
    <P>While working in the Department, I was impressed by some of the work I saw at Kildalton at Piltown, County Kilkenny.  The varieties of apples grown there had very good market potential. The storage of apples can cause problems.  If growers want to get the best return they must store their apples and sell them at Hallowe'en when the demand is at its highest.  There is room in the market for more commercial growers but the entry costs are very high.  There is no return on investment until year three and the Department and other groups should give consideration to the provision of financial assistance to new entrants to the market.  I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to this area of the industry and to encourage people to enter the market, thereby substantially increasing the 14 per cent share of the market accounted for by Irish products.</P>
    <P>Growers in south Tipperary, Waterford and Kilkenny were badly affected by frost in early April.  Up until then the crop was three weeks ahead of schedule due to the mild weather.  The yields for this year are down substantially and some producers are in serious trouble.  Some growers will go out of business if they are not given financial assistance.  The Minister represents County Tipperary and I know he will do everything possible to keep these growers in business. I look forward to his reply to this point.</P>
    <P>The report shows that the horticultural sector is doing well.  However, the field vegetable sector did not do well in 1996.  Many of the greenhouses used for growing tomatoes were constructed in the 1970s.  If growers are to maximise production then they must install higher roofs in their greenhouses. Obviously the cost of doing this is very high.  Deputy Coveney referred to tomato imports from the Canary Islands and Morocco where the product does not have to be grown in a protected, heated environment.  The improvements in the variety of tomatoes in those countries affected the general market there.  Tomato producers have to contend with many problems and I am very pleased to note in the report that they had a satisfactory year last year.  I wish this sector of the industry well.</P>
    <P>I look at the industry in terms of its employment potential.  Hopefully other sectors of the industry will be as successful as the mushroom sector.  The hardy nurseries stock sector is probably <Col N="261" /> the most productive.  It seems that the healthy eating agenda will continue to expand. We must not lose sight of the employment opportunities for disabled people in the industry.  Disabled people are employed not for charitable reasons but because they are good workers and will ensure a return for their employers.</P>
    <P>I congratulate An Bord Glas on its work since the interim board was put in place in 1987.  I congratulate Deputy Kirk on the very fine work he did in this area when he was in office.  I also congratulate Deputy Deenihan who introduced the forum.  I will not refer to the forum in detail as I am sure Deputy Deenihan will refer to it in his contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the environmentally friendly aspect of the industry.  The public and privately owned green areas in cities and towns have been greatly improved in recent years. Unlike other countries, producers here do not overuse insecticides, pesticides etc.  However, we need to be vigilant and to jealously guard the quality of the soil and its productive capacity.  In this context I referred earlier to statutory instruments on the rotation of potato growing and the consequent control of eel worm.</P>
    <P>Market information is a two way street in some senses but at the end of the day it is about ascertaining what people want and providing products at a reasonable price.  An Bord Glas has a very important role to play in this area.  The quality programmes in which it has been involved since its inception have succeeded in bringing about changes for the better.  We need look no further than the excellent displays in supermarkets and compare that with the position ten or 15 years ago to see that, with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture and Food, Teagasc and An Bord Glas, considerable progress has been made.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, well in what I consider an exciting portfolio and one with much potential.  I have little doubt he will put his stamp on the industry and bring about improvements in it.  I congratulate An Bord Glas for this excellent, concise report in which information can be easily found.  It outlines the present position in the industry and projections for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Davern, to his new role in this very important sector and wish him every success.  Coming from the constituency of Dublin North where some of the biggest producers in the glasshouse, potato and soft fruit sectors reside, I hope to be an active supporter of the Minister's efforts to increase funding and the initiatives he brings forward in the interests of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined the history of the board. In the 1980s Mr. Haughey, in Opposition, decided there should be recognition of the industry and published a policy document on horticulture development, which has stood the test of time. The Minister rightly gave credit to the first Minister with responsibility for horticulture, Deputy <Col N="262" /> Kirk, for the work he did in regard to the interim board and in establishing the present board of An Bord Glas, which has been a success.  With its present funding, the industry and the taxpayer is well served.</P>
    <P>The board was set up to improve and develop markets and the marketing skills of those involved in the industry.  It has co-ordinated the development of the industry.  Quality assurance schemes and the vegetable monitoring co-ordination programme operated by the IFA and An Bord Glas are important steps in improving growers' confidence.  In his speech the Minister recognised that 60 per cent of the retail vegetable market is controlled by multiples.  With the introduction of Tesco to the industry, that percentage will increase substantially.  The Minister also recognised the role played by the board in the vegetable marketing co-ordination programme. I concur with him on the importance of that scheme.  Since the resignation of Margaret Carr, who did marvellous work in this area over the years, the scheme has been run by Mr. P.J. Jones, Rush, and Mr. John O'Donovan, Cork. Even though its importance is recognised by the board and by the Minister, the scheme is run on a shoestring.  I urge the Minister to ensure whatever funding, technical back-up or manpower is needed is made available.  I ask him to address that matter in his concluding remarks.</P>
    <P>Unless funding is made available for research, the industry will be unable to compete.  In my constituency there is much concern about the lack of specialist advice and research by Teagasc.  If research is not funded and replacements made in certain sectors, the industry will go down the slippery slope.  In a recent interview with Aidan Arnold, the chairman of the board, Mr. Michael Murphy, made scathing remarks about the failure to replace Mr. Ted Ryan.  The Minister recently visited Kinsealy research centre and saw the excellent work, expertise and specialist information available to many sectors.  Without adequate funding for research and sufficient manpower in the workplace, the industry will be unable to compete with other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney said this sector receives no support.  In the Minister's term of office I hope he will ensure the horticulture industry is included in schemes, funded nationally or by the EU.  For many years I have made representations to Ministers about the farm retirement scheme, which has been extremely successful but from which horticultural producers are excluded.  I hope the Minister will take up that matter at European level.  It is indicative of the neglect of this sector that we must at all times remind people of its importance.  I hope the Minister will confer similar benefits on this industry as on the agriculture industry.  In recent years announcements were made of subsidised loans for new enterprises, which have been a great success, but horticulture has been excluded from those schemes.  In the event of the Government introducing further loan schemes to assist young people setting up <Col N="263" /> enterprise, the horticulture sector should be included.</P>
    <P>The board recognises the importance of the tomato sector, which was referred to by other speakers.  Our product is of the best quality and, given the right conditions, which include reasonable energy costs, our growers are able to compete with the best.  In terms of energy costs, in the early 1980s growers in Rush were encouraged to transfer from oil to gas and commitments were given that a special case would be made in regard to the price structure of gas.  I ask the Minister to keep that promise in mind in the context of any future price increase.  I recognise An Bord Gáis has to deal with its industry in a commercial manner but in a labour intensive industry such as the glasshouse sector it is imperative that energy costs are given a high priority.</P>
    <P>The year 1995 was a disaster for tomato growers. The board and the Minister are aware &mdash; and the former Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, will be aware from representations in recent years &mdash; of an IFA growers' proposal seeking help for that industry.  I will not dwell on the details of the proposal but in the context of the industry about £500,000 would be sufficient.  Many of the best growers in Rush have not recovered from that disaster and are under tremendous pressure from the banks to sell off assets or to get out of the industry.  Given that the previous Administration recognised the need for assistance I ask the Minister to look again at the files.  The need for assistance was recognised at EU level.  Because of the devaluation which took place that summer and the effect which the dumping of those products into the Irish market had on our growers, the Commission allowed individual countries to pay compensation.  I understand Belgium, France and Germany have already paid such compensation to their growers.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to the well documented case in respect of the 1995 tomato season.</P>
    <P>In regard to the board I strongly believe in the concept of small being the right way to proceed. I would like the board to remain in its present format in relation to this specialised industry. Given its funding of £1.5 million it is doing an excellent job.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to provide increased funding in the coming year to the industry.  I have no doubt, given the right conditions, our producers are capable of competing with the best.</P>
    <P>There is much concern with regard to the introduction of the Tesco chain into the retail sector. It is vitally important this indigenous industry is given the backup it deserves in terms of research and technical advice.  Irrespective of what marketing programmes the board may introduce, if the producer on the ground is not given the necessary technical advice they are waste.  If the individual producer is not able to compete in the modern world and does not have all the technical advice he needs we are making a big mistake.  I urge the <Col N="264" /> Minister to accede to the request made to him for research and so on.</P>
    <P>I commend the board on its report.  It is a precise report which provides many details.  I hope the Minister is in a position to remedy some of the problems in the industry.  I hope to be in a position to encourage the Government to provide extra funding to ensure some of those schemes can be put in place.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, well in his new portfolio and compliment the outgoing Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who did an excellent job and took a keen interest in this area.  I was pleased this morning that Deputy Yates and Deputy O'Shea contributed to the debate.  I note Deputy Kirk is present.  By the time this debate concludes four former Ministers as well as the Minister will have contributed.  This is an indication of the level of interest.</P>
      <P>I congratulate An Bord Glas on an excellent report.  I have been given the honour of being spokesperson on this portfolio and I intend to be successful.  It is early days yet and I have much to learn.  While there are not many growers in the west there are many people involved in the industry whom I will be meeting in the next few weeks. I intend to put much pressure on the Minister to ensure he assists the people involved in the horticulture industry.  This is an industry which most Governments, since the foundation of the State, have neglected.</P>
      <P>If today the Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Harney, was announcing 25, 30 or 40 jobs from a Dutch, American or Third World company there would be a great fanfare.  The IDA would be present and everybody would be delighted and say it was great that multinationals are coming to Ireland. Yet we have a natural industry and people with land who have not been assisted by the State and for many years have not received the support they should.</P>
      <P>Recently I visited a young man, Mr. Horkan, who wrote to me and congratulated me on my brief.  He started a plant business in the west. When I came into the Dáil the first question I asked was the total value of imports for the previous three years.  From January to May 1997 the total value of imports was £9.2 million; 1996, £18.4 million; and 1995, £17 million.  This is for an industry that depends much on the weather. When I see the advertisement on the television showing the extremes to which an individual goes to take the box of chocolates to his girlfriend, wife, partner or whatever, I think it is time An Bord Glas promoted and encouraged Irish people to buy pot plants.  When we buy a bouquet of fresh flowers we are inclined to hide them as we do not want anyone to see us bringing them.  It is time we encouraged people to buy pot plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that.  Local people such as the Horkans and Charlie and Mat Shaw are involved in the industry.  The Horkans employ 25 people in the west, an area which has been ravaged by emigration and has not received much support from the IDA in terms of jobs in the past number of years.  I hope the Government will give these people the support they need.  I compliment Horkan's garden centre which won the national award in 1993-94.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will take a special interest in the fruit and vegetable industry in which part of his constituency &mdash; Kilkenny, Waterford and south Tipperary &mdash; is involved. There are only about 30 apple producers here, with approximately ten major producers in the north Dublin-Meath area.  Some of them lost at least 50 per cent of their crops this year because of bad weather.  When other sectors experience difficulties they quickly seek assistance from the Department, but this sector has not done that.  I hope the Minister will respond to the difficulties they experienced this year.  The Government should reward producers on a once-off basis for the major investments they have made.  We produce approximately £3 million worth of apples each year, but we import £24 million worth.  That does not make sense.  Deputy Wright knows the difficulties experienced by apple producers in recent years.</P>
      <P>I recently met a carrot producer who spent approximately £200,000 upgrading his washing and grading facilities.  Producers must update their equipment because consumers will not buy second rate goods and want to know the origin of the produce they purchase.  I hope the Minister can assist vegetable producers who also experienced difficulties this year because of bad weather.  Other sectors of agriculture are quick to seek help from the Minister and Members when they experience difficulties.  Fruit and vegetable producers should not be ignored in difficult times merely because fewer numbers are involved.  That natural industry should be assisted in every possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased strawberry producers in north Dublin and Meath are supplying Tesco.  The Minister referred to large multiples.  During my time in business I dealt mostly with small businesses. Large multiples have swallowed up small businesses and taken over 60 per cent or 70 per cent of the market.  Like the horticulture industry, successive Governments have failed to protect small shopkeepers or small industries.  Small industries no longer count in this State, but we are paying the price for that.  Large multiples dictate prices and terms and conditions.  People in <Col N="266" /> offices in London or Dublin can decide to import produce from South Africa or elsewhere if it is cheaper than buying from home producers.  It is regrettable that large multiples are taking over the market, they do not care about the small producer. They are concerned only with profit margins and the number of customers they can attract to their shops.  They have no loyalty to Irish producers.</P>
    <P>Under the capital grants for the horticulture industry an investment of £180,000 was grant aid, but unfortunately that figure has been reduced to £90,000.  It should be increased to £200,000 or £300,000 because of the increased costs associated with restoring or replacing glasshouses.  This industry must compete with the UK and European markets and if our products are not up to standard they will not be sold.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas produced an excellent report, but its budget of £1.6 million should be increased to approximately £3 million.  It costs approximately £800,000 per annum to run the company, leaving very little to promote the industry.  We should promote organic produce.  While An Bord Glas is doing a good job in promoting the industry, it can do very little on a budget of £1.6 million. The Minister should make sure he receives a reasonable amount of funding for An Bord Glas from the Minister for Finance this year. I wish to share time with Deputy Deenihan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has the second lowest sales of plants in Europe.  We can create more employment in the plant industry.  We should set aside more days on which people are encouraged to buy plants.  We should encourage people to purchase home grown plants on occasions such as Mother's Day and Father's Day.  We should not have to import plants for such occasions, the home industry should be supported.  If the hardy nursery stock sector received assistance from Government it would create more employment.</P>
      <P>In the past the seed potato sector was a major industry in the west, particularly in north Mayo and Donegal.  R.G. Barrett exported seed potatoes from Westport and Ballina Quays to countries all over the world, but that is no longer the case.  I am pleased, however, that the Moy Valley Seed Potato Company, with the assistance of one or two farmers, has set up a co-operative and hopes to grow and export seed potatoes.  That company should also receive Government support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to meeting the parties involved in the horticulture industry.  I intend to get to know this brief and to work hard on behalf of producers.  They have been let down by many Governments for many years probably because they are natives.  If they came from China, America or elsewhere and invested in industry they would be eligible for millions of pounds of grants and there would be <Col N="267" /> bands to welcome and congratulate them. However, because they are Irish and producing land based products there is no support for them nor has there been any for many years.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State, like the former Minister Deputy Deenihan, will continue to do good work and will look after those who work, invest in and are committed to this industry to ensure they get the support they require from the State and should have got for many years.  Some of them experience difficult times and they should get assistance at those times.  They make their returns to the State when times are good and they should get support from the Department. I am depending on the Minister to provide for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for sharing his time with me.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment. I am confident he will bring a good deal of pragmatism to his position, that he will use his energy to promote this sector and during his stewardship I am sure the horticultural industry will benefit.  I mean that sincerely having regard to my dealings with him over the years.  I also take this opportunity to thank his Department officials who are present.  A small number of people work in the horticultural unit in the Department.  I had a good deal of contact with that unit in the two and a half years I was Minister of State and it was a great experience to work with the staff there. We worked in a spirit of co-operation and for the common good.  At times politicians find officials easy targets, but the level of co-operation I got from the officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was positive, encouraging and heartening.</P>
      <P>I welcome the chief executive and chairman of An Bord Glas in the visitors gallery.  I worked closely with them and with the previous chairman of the board.  At all times we worked in a spirit of partnership and co-operation and, ultimately, the industry benefited from our collective wisdom on many sensitive issues at various times.</P>
      <P>I wish Deputy Ring well in his area of responsibility. He will keep horticulture on the agenda and I am sure he will raise many questions of concern to interest groups.  I am pleased the IFA is represented here.  I am sure Deputy Ring will work closely with its members to ensure all matters that affect this industry are raised in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget for An Bord Glas was a point of contention with me when I became Minister of State in the previous Government.  The budget for 1997 is £1.634 million.  That is a small budget, the smallest for any State agency, particularly for one with the responsibility of An Bord Glas. When I was Minister of State I also had responsibility for the greyhound industry.  I tried to secure as much money as possible for that industry and, even though it needs more funds, it is better funded than An Bord Glas.  I appeal to the Minister <Col N="268" /> of State to secure more funding for the horticultural industry.  Before I left office I requested that the budget for the industry be increased.  I appreciate there is a spending level, but I am sure it is possible to get money for An Bord Glas from other areas of the Department.  It was estimated that a budget of £2.5 million is necessary to ensure it is effective.</P>
    <P>There are only 11 staff members in An Bord Glas who must deal with a multiplicity of products including all the ranges of food and vegetables, ware and seed potatoes, amenity horticulture, nursery stock flowers, bulbs and so on. That is a vast area for that small number of staff to deal with and I compliment them on their work.  They are young, energetic and committed to their work, and that is worth recognising.  They deal with a multiplicity of groups and agencies involved in the industry including producers, wholesalers, retailers, consumers and State agencies. The staffing complement for An Bord Glas should be given serious consideration.  Taxpayers are getting a great return from An Bord Glas.  It should be better resourced and the staffing complement should be increased.</P>
    <P>The industry is worth about £223 million, which is considerable, and represents approximately 15 per cent of employment in the agricultural industry. There has been a proliferation of garden centres and nurseries and latest figures show that approximately 12,700 people are employed in the horticultural industry on a full-time basis and 19,000 or 20,000 on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>The Horticultural Industry Forum is very important and I will raise it with the Minister of State at another time.  It was very important this summer particularly in regard to tomato production. The chief executive and the chairman were able to make arrangements with the multiples to ensure that Irish tomatoes were selected.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister of State I set up an effective interagency group on amenity horticulture.  It included representatives of An Bord Tráchtála, Forbairt, Teagasc, An Bord Glas and the Department. It discussed the foliage industry, made considerable progress and its re-establishment is worth considering.</P>
    <P>The organic farming consultative group was effective because it included members from the various representative groups who felt isolated and alienated and much progress was made in that area.</P>
    <P>I set up a group to devise a national landscape policy, a matter that probably should be handled by the Department of the Environment.  That idea is worth pursuing.  We need a national landscape policy and no doubt it would benefit the horticultural industry.</P>
    <P>I do not have sufficient time to expand on these points, but I take this opportunity to thank officials for their work and to wish the Minister of State well in his new office.  A former Minister of State, Deputy Kirk is present, and Deputy O'Shea and the former Minister, Deputy Yates, were present.  There is goodwill in this House <Col N="269" /> towards the industry.  We all want to help and will be as helpful and constructive as possible to the Minister of State in his term of office.</P>

      <P>Tír ghlas, An Bord Glas, Bia glas Aer glan, Tír fhalláin agus Bia úr.  Ireland has a clean healthy environment which produces clean healthy food.  The functions of An Bord Glas are to develop, promote, facilitate, encourage, co-ordinate and assist the production, marketing and consumption of horticultural produce.  The board's report and its Development Plan 1994-99 recognises the challenge of achieving higher levels of output with efficient production, marketing and management skills.  It also recognises that all efforts must be consistent and support work to enhance the environment.  We are very fortunate that the production of most primary horticultural food products is done in an environmentally friendly way.  It does not create environmental damage which can arise in other sectors.  I am aware An Bord Glas is endeavouring to ensure that its marketing and development efforts continue to support the environment.  Surely it is not too much to expect that a green country with a green board can produce green food.</P>
      <P>I speak as a consumer, one who views, reviews, selects and consumes, a consumer who is faced with a range of fruit and vegetables of many hues and shapes, many of which were unheard of ten years ago, a consumer who sees expanded ranges in shops, greengrocers, farm gates and supermarkets; but, primarily, a consumer whose interest lies in food safety and quality.</P>
      <P>Consumer power has led to the development of a horticultural industry in this country which is estimated to be valued at £166 billion in 1996. When demand is that high and that valuable, there is a danger that producers and suppliers will tend to cut corners, let standards slip and avail of every opportunity to speed up production to ensure attractive long-lasting produce, irrespective of how that is gained, and an element of experimentation can set in.</P>
      <P>The industry is only valuable to Ireland in so far as it remains of high quality, clean and green. The organic food market in Ireland is worth approximately £1.5 million and vegetables account for 60 per cent of this.  The sum of £1.5 million is very small in the overall context and the reason is that the demand for organic produce is still reported to be exceeding supply.  This is significant in so far as organic produce tends to be more expensive than other produce, proving the fact that the shopper has one main concern, and that is food safety.</P>
      <P>We do not want our food sprayed with pesticides and insecticides, nor do we want soya super beans, apples that will not decay and tomatoes that will not rot.  Is the bright red fruit natural, waxed or genetically engineered?  Like many consumers, I am worried about the ethical and long-term environmental impact of genetic engineering breeding methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> Biotechnology seems to be taking the place of conventional methods, which have been used for centuries to modify varieties of plants and animals. Such conventional methods have involved selection, crossbreeding and hybridisation.  Today the aim seems to be to improve further certain characteristics of plants, animals and microorganisms by introducing a modified, or unmodified, copy of a gene either from the same or from another species.  Personally, I worry about mixing the genes of the human, animal and plant kingdoms.</P>
    <P>Experiments are also aimed at improving food production so that plants are more resistant to disease, hard weather conditions or other effects of the environment and they aim to extend the choice and shelf life of foods.  We have already been introduced to Dolly, the cloned sheep.  Dolly may be joined by animals with no fat or chickens with no feathers.  But in the context of the horticultural industry which we are discussing today, the following inventions may be coming our way: iceberg lettuce in individual serving size, potatoes which will absorb less fat when made into chips, tomatoes which will have their rotting enzymes removed; or corn with scorpion genes.  I, as a consumer, do not want to be guinea pig in the global experiment involving genetically engineered foods.  Ireland should not allow itself to become drawn into this experiment for beet, horticulture or animals.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of objective research in relation to genetic engineering and, indeed, there is little evidence to date that safety is an overriding concern for producers.  In Canada, two strains of genetically engineered rape seed had to be withdrawn from the market because of the unexpected appearance of a stray gene.  A food supplement produced in the US from genetically engineered ingredients was found to include an unknown toxin that killed 37 people and permanently disabled 1,500 more.</P>
    <P>I regret that Ireland allowed a multinational company, Monsanto, to begin testing and growing genetically modified organism sugar beet, known as GMO sugar beet, in Carlow.  There is no demand from any quarter for GMO food.  Every survey and opinion poll shows that consumers do not want GMO food.  Public safety has been ignored, public concern is being ignored and the long-term effect on our valuable horticultural industry seems to have been substituted by immediate short-term interests.  I am not against development, science or biotechnology but I am against rushing into developments when safety and long-term effects have not been properly investigated.</P>
    <P>Consumers have many reasons for being concerned about genetic engineering, and the primary one is safety.  What if a food has the genes of a monkey nut in it and the consumer has an allergic reaction to nuts?  A vegetarian may not want to eat a product which has been made with the genes derived from an animal.  An Orthodox Jew may not wish to consume a food which was <Col N="271" /> made with the genes derived from a pig.  Will crossbreeding of plants with genetic modification lead to disturbances of ecological titles?  Already such foods may be on our shelves, but there is nothing to indicate to the consumer that they have been genetically engineered.  Foods derived from genetic engineering should be clearly identified and labelled as such.  Information about the process should be given in a prescribed format. Labelling should be positive, not negative.  For example, labelling which states &ldquo;this food does not contain any genetically engineered ingredient&rdquo; is not acceptable.  It is more important for the consumer to know what it does contain.  One should not assume that all food is safe and there is no need to warn consumers about the use of new technology.</P>
    <P>The BSE crisis has shown how much consumers need information.  In particular, we need to know about the origin of food.  In recent years we have made tremendous progress in the labelling of food regarding E additives and preservatives. The next step should be to ensure that all foods containing genetically modified ingredients and those produced from genetically modified science should be labelled as such.  Consumers are entitled to know this and to express a preference for the type of foods they want to buy.</P>
    <P>The best way, however, of protecting the consumer and of protecting the horticultural industry is to insist on a ban on genetic engineering in Ireland, and I ask the Minister and the Government to institute such a ban.</P>
    <P>I also support the call this week of the chief executive of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to establish a system for rapidly detecting sources of food poisoning.  It is unacceptable that salmonella strains of bacteria must be sent to Britain for identification of their specific type.  Ensuring food is safe involves a chain of responsibility.  A reference laboratory would support the work already being done by vets, farmers, shops and consumers.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fail is committed to ensuring the highest possible standards of food production and aims to introduce a quality assurance scheme which will be applicable across the entire food industry.  This scheme will result in products of excellence and a high level of market suitability being identified with a quality label similar to the <i>Labelle Rouge</i> system which is in operation in France.  I urge the immediate introduction of this in order to protect the consumer.</P>
    <P>I compliment An Bord Glas in its work to date in developing, improving and promoting the horticultural industry.  For them, too, quality is of paramount importance.  The continued success of the industry depends on education and training at all levels of the quality chain.  It creates a requirement for personnel who have a knowledge of horticultural produce as a biological material together with a knowledge of the business environment of the post-harvest sector of the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> Education is one of those topics referred to in the annual report and I compliment the Dublin Institute of Technology, Cathal Brugha Street, for the development of courses to respond to the needs of the industry.  Having spent six years as chairperson of the board of the Dublin College of Catering, as it was then, I am particularly conscious of the willingness and ability of this college to respond to the demands of industry.</P>
    <P>A certificate course in food quality assurance, such as horticulture, addresses the fundamentals of quality assurance in the horticultural industry and the management of fresh produce.  The diploma course is a natural development of the certificate from the academic, industrial and personal development perspective.  These courses form part of the food related courses offered by the School of Food Science and Technology, within the Faculty of Tourism and Food.  There is also a growing level of activity in research and development in food.  Examples include work in detection of genetically modified foods, minimal processing of horticultural produce and implementation of legislation.  Only through education and research can we improve our standards and protect consumers and the environment.</P>
    <P>As the Christmas season approaches, it is useful to consider the work of An Bord Glas in respect of the Christmas tree industry.  Specialised Christmas tree production is a recent development in Ireland but it has a long history in Europe and the USA.  The Irish market for Christmas trees is estimated at approximately 300,000 whereas in England the market size in 1995 was 5.5 million and in Germany it was 27 million.  The first challenge for An Bord Glas is to meet the needs of the Irish market.  The noble fir trees planted in the 1980s will now largely meet those needs.  Our second challenge should be to market in Europe.  I note that the aim in the Bord Glas development plan is that the Christmas tree sector should increase in value and volume to approximately £7.5 million in 1999. I look forward to purchasing a quality natural Christmas tree at that time which, hopefully, will not cost the current outlandish price of £30.</P>
    <P>The horticultural industry is well served by An Bord Glas.  Its development plan is innovative and forward-looking but the horticultural industry could also be well served by legislation, control of irradiation, banning genetic engineering and ensuring accurate labelling.  This will ensure that the consumer is protected, the industry developed and Ireland maintains its natural green status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the An Bord Glas report for 1996, which was a good year for fruit and vegetables &mdash; I suggest that An Bord Glas be renamed the &ldquo;fruit and veg&rdquo; board.  It has been a different story in 1997.  I have no doubt that the personnel of An Bord Glas are doing a good job in difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major problems faced by those working in horticulture in Ireland involves climatic <Col N="273" /> conditions such as lack of sunshine.  We have an inability to grow many of the products we consume which leads to a necessity to import them.  This is a difficult problem which will not be easy for individuals, groups or boards to overcome. However, a number of measures could be put in place to help produce products which are difficult to produce under normal climatic conditions.</P>
    <P>I would like to see increased use of plastic sheeting and glass greenhouses.  In countries with sunny climates such as Italy, Spain and France, glass and plastic are used to promote the growth of marginal fruits and vegetables.  We do not seem to endeavour to succeed where nature defeats us.  However, I realise the climatic factors in Ireland such as gales, etc., might cause damage to plastic sheeting.</P>
    <P>The people who operate most successfully in the field of horticulture receive no assistance and do all the work themselves.  A previous speaker referred to the production of carrots in Ardmore, County Waterford.  The group involved in this enterprise is very industrious and the key to its recent success &mdash; which has also been used in the production of potatoes in Ballinacourty, County Waterford and areas of south Wexford &mdash; was not alluded to in the report of An Bord Glas or the Minister of State's contribution.  The system used involves the placing of plastic sheeting over entire fields of carrots, parsnips and early potatoes.</P>
    <P>Tremendous advances have been achieved through the use of such aids.  For example, the methods used in carrot production at Ardmore, which is primarily directed toward the market in Cork city, means that produce can be placed on the market four to six weeks earlier than if the carrots were grown in open fields.  The group involved has done itself proud and its methods are also being used by potato growers in other areas.  As already stated, this development, which is the most successful advance in recent years, is not referred to in the report.</P>
    <P>I imagine that the repetition in this debate is boring for some people.  However, as Deputies Kirk and O'Shea, both former Ministers of State, indicated, the major area of growth and expansion in horticulture is in the mushroom industry. This industry initially developed in Border counties such as Cavan and Monaghan but it has since spread to many other areas.</P>
    <P>Production of many other horticultural products has receded rather than progressed.  It is difficult to see how that trend can be reversed, particularly if account is taken of climatic conditions and the avalanche of year-round imports.  In the past, the only horticultural produce imported to Ireland were early potatoes from Cyprus, Italy and Spain and tomatoes from the greenhouses in the Netherlands.  Now, however, such produce is being imported from South and Central America, southern Europe and North Africa.  It is difficult to compete with countries with perfect climates.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to growing vegetables and fruit leaves much to be desired.  This has much to do <Col N="274" /> with the welfare state mentality, namely, that people do not have to work for the money they receive.  I deplore that ethos because our ancestors kept their households going by producing vegetables and fruit.  That is no longer the case because people merely purchase what they need from supermarkets.  Their front gardens are well kept but their back gardens are overrun with weeds or the grass has been replaced by tarmacadam or concrete.  It appears that the day of tilling one's own cabbage patch or plot of land is gone.  Politicians get an insight in this regard when they go canvassing.  Canvassing gives one a great excuse to knock on a front door, and if there is nobody home one can look around the back where the story is not a very flattering one.</P>
    <P>People who can afford it have concrete or tarmac or a beautiful lawn, but the days of having a vegetable garden are virtually gone.  One would be doing well to find one in 30 or one in 40 growing vegetables, and that person is usually middleaged or older, has pride in his work and likes to grow his own produce.  It is a striking indictment because we are not that wealthy a country.</P>
    <P>In Germany, Holland and France a high proportion of people, who are much better off financially than we are, till their own plots.  They grow salad vegetable &mdash; chives, lettuces, scallions, etc. They grow tomatoes and grapes for making wine. We have lost that ethos here.  We depend on others to give us what we need.  Even the English do much more than we do.  In England and in some countries on the Continent they still have allotments.  People who are old enough to remember the last war will remember that people rented allotments from the local councils on which to grow their own vegetables.  They had to; if they did not they went hungry.  That tradition is still carried on in Great Britain and in parts of the Continent where one can still see people tilling their own plots all year round, a tradition that has lived on.  We, as an agricultural country, do not give two hoots about that.  It is beyond us to do menial work of that nature.  I make the point because it says a certain amount about our society.  It is a marked indication that we have moved away from the basics and are not doing simple things that we should be doing, growing our own &mdash; it might be a slogan for An Bord Glas.</P>
    <P>The most successful people in horticulture are those who do what they do with no assistance.  I am not aware that any of my constituents who grow early potatoes, carrots, parsnips, cabbage, cauliflower, etc., get any assistance from An Bord Glas.  They do all the work and marketing themselves. Sometimes, as in Ardmore, they form co-operative groups and sell on a joint basis.  There may be more of an emphasis by An Bord Glas closer to Dublin, but I do not see it down the country.  However, I am open to correction if I am being unduly critical.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake to say that our import and export position is not bad.  The wrong message may be read from the fact that the cost of produce is going up all the time.  One family in south <Col N="275" /> Kilkenny grows thousands of acres of potatoes. The same happens in counties Meath and Dublin. That means thousands of people who produced potatoes years ago do not do so any more.  One district outside Dungarvan, an area of small farmers, was famous for producing potatoes, among other vegetables.  I doubt if there is a potato grown in the whole locality now.  These are the days of mass production.  Potatoes are produced by the trailer load by one individual.  That is the trend, but it means that fewer people are involved and that we are importing more of everything every year.  There are many vegetables we could produce, despite climatic conditions.  These include potatoes, the brassicas &mdash; cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts; turnips are produced mainly for fodder now and not so much for human consumption.</P>
    <P>One area where there has been tremendous advancement, but which is peripheral where An Bord Glas is concerned but very important to the economy, is the area of garden centres and the production of shrubs and flowers.  Years ago we would not have considered that area to be part of the horticultural industry.  Nowadays it is included.  It involves recreational gardening rather than producing for consumption.  People have pride in how their houses and gardens look, and with the growth of affluence that area is improving and expanding all the time.  However, there are many basic products we could produce but are not producing, and there is no easy solution to this because of people's mentality.</P>
    <P>There are exceptional areas, for example, Wexford, where there has been a tremendous upsurge over the past 25 years and where so many strawberries are produced.  This year the strawberry producers took a beating because of the incessant rain during June when the fruit was swamped and did not develop.  I commend the Minister for making money available to cereal farmers and other producers of horticultural products who suffered because of the bad weather.</P>
    <P>I spoke in the House recently about the apple producers in Waterford, south Kilkenny and south Tipperary.  There are only between nine and 12 commercial apple producers in that whole locality where years ago hundreds of people produced apples on a commercial basis.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s the variety of apple called &ldquo;Golden Delicious&rdquo;, which was developed in France, was introduced to this country.  Farmers who had never produced apples before put in orchards of &ldquo;Golden Delicious&rdquo; all over the place.  There were soon hundreds of commercial apple producers in my own county.  Now there are six or seven.  This is a sobering statistic.</P>
    <P>The valley from Dungarvan to Fermoy and Mallow was the home of apple growing in Ireland.  There was an apple institute located within it.  When we joined the European Union in 1973 there were guaranteed prices for milk and beef.  This resulted in orchards being replaced by cows.  With the exception of major investment in <Col N="276" /> the glasshouse sector, there are virtually no grants available from the European Union for early potato growers in Ballinacourty, carrot growers in Ardmore and others involved in horticulture. We are overrun by imports, including those from countries outside the European Union.  It is an uphill fight and there is nothing the Minister of State and An Bord Glas can do about it.  I will not be political and say that he should.  Those involved in the sector will have to paddle their own canoe and fight their own case.</P>
    <P>One no longer has to travel to Amsterdam to see beautiful fields of tulips.  In recent years the growing of tulips has been identified in my own area as a source of income.  Apparently they grow far better here than in most other places.  I understand they are produced mainly for export.</P>

      <P>When Minister, a person came to see me and told me this could be done &mdash; when I put it to my officials they laughed &mdash; but I read as recently as one month ago that lavender is being grown here successfully on a commercial basis for use in the production of scented soaps and perfumes. There are many areas about which we do not speak and in which results are being achieved. More and more restaurants and housewives are growing herbs instead of vegetables.</P>
      <P>It is stated in the report that we should be trying to sell products containing vitamin E which is good for us and counteracts heart problems. Young people in particular should be encouraged to eat apples, pears and plums which can be grown here instead of junk food.  The Minister of State should consult the Department of Health and find out by how much the Health Estimate could be reduced if people ate an apple a day and a pear every couple of days.  As a medical doctor, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle might have an opinion to offer on that.  The effect of such a campaign could be tremendous.  Potatoes are rapidly being substituted by rice which cannot be grown here, although it may have been possible to do so in County Waterford in August.  These points may be offbeat but they are relevant.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> This debate as well as presenting us with an ideal opportunity to reminisce and romanticise the past gives us an opportunity to highlight the major issues which cause problems for those involved in horticulture such as tight profit margins offered by supermarkets and weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the chief executive of An Bord Glas, Mr. Brendan O'Donnell, and his staff for the tremendous work they are doing in developing this sector.  What I find baffling is that most members of the board are usually fired by the incoming Government on completion of their three-year term, even though they have tremendous ability and knowledge of the sector.  Only three members of the previous board were retained.  This needs to be looked at to ensure <Col N="277" /> continuity in the implementation of the development plan.  A three-year term is not adequate.  All of the current members are experts in their field but I wonder whether the appointments are too political.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas has a small staff of 11 and a small budget.  I hope the Minister of State, who is very astute, will seek extra funding in the forthcoming Estimates.  An Bord Glas provides a worthwhile service throughout the country.  When the County Wexford Strawberry Fair, at 30 years the longest running fair in the country, was under threat a number of years ago Mr. O'Donnell and his staff made an invaluable contribution by allocating a substantial amount of money to ensure its continuance.  It has an international flavour and has gone from strength to strength.  It is of major importance to the local economy.  The committee, patrons and growers appreciate the tremendous help given by An Bord Glas in recent years.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for visiting County Wexford at short notice at the height of the crisis during the strawberry growing season to meet growers and processors.  I hope, under the package he has produced, substantial compensation will be paid to growers.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State consider establishing regional offices of An Bord Glas?  It is time this was done.  It would not give rise to major overheads. It is important that personnel from An Bord Glas are made available to the horticulture industry in each region.  The Minister should examine how that might be achieved.  New offices or buildings would not be needed because Teagasc or Department of Agriculture and Food offices could be used and a worthwhile regional service could be made available.</P>
    <P>When one considers the industry is worth £223 million currently and represents about 15 per cent of agricultural employment, the staff of 11 with a small budget needs to be increased substantially if the plan for 1994-99 is to be developed properly.  I hope the Cabinet will examine the importance of the horticulture sector, consider its development in conjunction with An Bord Glas and give a substantial increase in funding.  Given that the Departments are awash with money some of it should be made available to the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>County Wexford has a broadly based horticulture industry including early and late potatoes, carrots, peas, strawberries, raspberries, blackcurrants, gooseberries, apples, rhubarb, which is not too widespread, and cabbage.  It is to the forefront in horticulture development but the growers suffer from weather problems, cheap imports and difficulties in dealing with the supermarkets.</P>
    <P>I am aware An Bord Glas encourages partnership arrangements between farm organisations, producers, consumers and the retail multiples.  It is important the products are of top quality and are produced in a green environment.  However, it is also important the producer is adequately paid for the products.  The supermarkets tend to <Col N="278" /> squeeze out the producer by demanding top quality products at very low prices.  As a result many producers are going out of business.</P>
    <P>I am concerned major supermarket companies such as Tesco which is now in the Irish market, seem to be moving away from high quality products being produced here and towards imports and buying from large producer groups.  Small scale producers are being forced out of business. I am pleased that An Bord Glas is involved with Tesco in establishing a trading consultative group involving An Bord Bia, Forbairt and other State agencies.  However, I am not sure the supermarkets are committed to it and perhaps the Minister of State will indicate the nature of the discussions and negotiations in which he is involved with them.</P>
    <P>The mushroom industry is an example to Tesco, Marks and Spencer and other English companies that we are capable of producing top quality products.  We are part of the UK mushroom market thanks to the growers in counties Monaghan and Cavan and also thanks to companies such as PA Walsh and others in the south-east who have marketed their top class products in the UK.  Our other products are also produced in a virtually organic fashion and we should be in a position to put pressure on the supermarket multiples to buy more of these top quality products. It is the consumers' wishes that count and consumers want such products.  It is up to the supermarkets, in conjunction with An Bord Glas and the producers, to make such quality products available.  We must ensure that as many as possible of the products being sold in Ireland are Irish products.</P>
    <P>The supermarkets have made advances in presentation and quality in retailing products.  In the past products may have been dirty and ill presented.  However, top quality products are now available to shoppers in supermarkets and we must continue to move in that direction.  It is important that the Minister of Sate would lead the charge with An Bord Glas to ensure growers are not left behind when the supermarkets are buying horticultural products.</P>
    <P>In my childhood in County Wexford every back garden had strawberries growing in it.  The income from strawberries was used to put children through college or to buy communion or confirmation outfits.  Society is more affluent nowadays.  However, strawberry production should not be allowed to decrease much further. An Bord Glas has introduced a quality bonus scheme for the strawberry processing industry but there has been a substantial decline in the number of strawberry growers in County Wexford, which is the main growing area, and in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that An Bord Glas will give incentives over the next three years to bring about an increase of 100 acres per year in the strawberry growing area.  I encourage the Minister of State and An Bord Glas to continue this development because it would be a shame if the <Col N="279" /> strawberry industry is allowed to decline to a point where it is no longer viable.  A number of processors, such as Chivers, have been purchasing strawberries in the south-east for many years but they are not getting enough product there and there is a need to give the industry a boost.</P>
    <P>I welcome An Bord Glas involvement in initiatives to develop the strawberry industry for the future.  It is involved with the Wexford growers' association and Teagasc in developing new ideas and products.  Teagasc in Clonroche, County Wexford has been involved in developing new varieties.  This development approach should be continued.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to Wexford and for recognising that strawberry growers had a major problem this year.  They depend on good weather to produce a top quality strawberry crop but the weather this year was not good and as a result they suffered a substantial decrease in their income.  There was also a smaller quantity of strawberries produced for processors.  I am glad the Minister became actively involved with this issue.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the number of garden centres.  In Wexford, for example, the number of garden centres has escalated.  This is a good development because it creates jobs.  Up to three people work in each garden centre producing shrubs and greenery, for which there is huge demand.  As Deputy Deasy pointed out, the centres received no grant aid.  I have tried to encourage county enterprise boards to give small grants to people setting up such centres because they create jobs. In other sectors we pay huge amounts of money to companies locating in Ireland to generate employment, yet in south Wexford about 50 jobs were created in the past two years in garden centres which received no grant aid or financial support.  The Minister should examine how start up grant aid can be given to such enterprises, perhaps through the Leader programme or the county enterprise boards or An Bord Glas.  In that way more jobs could be created in the sector. The demand for those jobs is so great that Teagasc and FÁS are involved in training people for them and in encouraging young school leavers to join relevant training schemes so they can secure employment in garden centres.  That is a good development and should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>There is a need to examine the potato industry. It is a seasonal industry heavily dependent on the weather.  The report of An Bord Glas confirms that the board is greatly involved in developing the industry.  It is necessary to look at the quality of potatoes and how to achieve a better seasonal return for producers.  The price varies from year to year.  In some years potato growers in Wexford are in danger of being wiped out because of poor prices but in other years the prices are so high that everybody starts to grow them which results <Col N="280" /> in a fall in prices the following year.  There does not appear to be consistency in the industry.</P>
    <P>Potato growing should be left to the experts, although Deputy Deasy would probably be of the opinion that everybody should grow their own potatoes.  However, there is a significant number of expert potato producers in my county and throughout the country and responsibility for production should be left to them instead of farmers and others deciding to grow potatoes during various seasons when it suits them or when they think prices will be good.  We will never have continuity of supply or a proper potato industry unless there is a level playing pitch which will enable producers with expertise to make a living from it.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his help to date in areas of County Wexford where difficulties have arisen in the horticultural sector.  I also thank An Bord Glas for its contribution to the county.  We hear a great deal about cheap imports but if we cannot produce the product all year round there will be significant imports.  The producer, supplier, An Bord Glas and the Department of Agriculture and Food, through the Minister, must make a major effort to develop the horticultural industry.  They must tell the Irish people, the supermarkets and the Europeans that we have a top class quality product which is produced organically in a green environment and that we are the leaders in this sector.  If that is done we can significantly increase the number of jobs in the industry and promote our horticultural industry across the EU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive statement and I wish him every success in his new office.  I hope he blossoms and blooms in the years ahead.  He is lucky to have a portfolio through which he can develop an industry that needs leadership although in saying that I mean no disrespect to An Bord Glas and its pioneering work in recent years under the development plan.</P>
      <P>If one were to look at any industry in Ireland, particularly this one, 150 years ago and look at what has happened to it in the interim, in all cases one would see huge expansion and development. Horticulture was always classified as the Cinderella of the agriculture industry and was treated by successive Ministers as such.  There was little regard for the sector because it was composed either of producers who were supplementing an income or of very small scale producers.  They were insignificant in the overall plan for the development of the agriculture industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at horticulture 150 years ago one thinks of the Famine, and the humble potato and the failure of the crop immediately comes to mind.  Since 1847 there has been a steady decline, despite occasional exceptional years, in potato production.  A 10 per cent decline was recorded last year.  That is a serious matter.  It is time to sound the alarm and see what can be done to arrest the decline as this is not just a question of <Col N="281" /> decline in the production of one product.  The effect of the decline in potato production over the years has been a change in lifestyle and a change in population in rural Ireland.  As a direct result of the Famine we experienced large scale emigration and lost most of our population of eight million people.  We have barely recovered.</P>
    <P>In 1997 we talk about rural renewal as a new concept.  What does that mean?  Does it mean we must rethink what we produce, as Deputy Deasy mentioned?  There are traces of old famine ridges throughout the countryside.  They have never been touched.  The decline has been ongoing and nobody has called a halt to the population movement. What part can horticulture play?  It can have a vital role in stabilising population in rural areas if an effective plan is put in place.  It might apply to small producers in the west or along our seaboards but it could be anywhere in rural Ireland if an effective plan is put in place, For instance, to return to the subject I just mentioned, the main reason for a decline in the production of potatoes is the uncertainty about whether the producer will have a viable income.  All too often a producer is unable to be sure of that from one year to another, no matter how optimistic or effective he is.  This price fluctuation must be given a positive boost by the Minister and An Bord Glas by stabilising the price and setting up a price structure with a guaranteed minimum for all products in this area.  It may be difficult to set but why should we not have it?  There is a minimum guaranteed price for beef and that leads to an oversupply with restrictions on production.  In this area, however, we are importing costly commodities which we could produce efficiently and effectively if confidence was there.  The major problem in horticulture is lack of confidence and I hope the Minister, during his time in the portfolio, will cultivate this.  Successive Governments have paid lip service to the area and it is now necessary to restore confidence and guarantee an income to those still in the industry, whose numbers will continue to decrease unless action is taken.</P>
    <P>Many Members spoke of the importance of vegetables to our diet.  However, greater reassurance is needed from the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Health and Children on this matter.  Are those wonderfully presented vegetables as safe a food item as we would like the consumer to believe?  Intensive production has meant the use of preservative and pest control sprays which may enhance the appearance and presentation of products on food stalls but are harmful to their quality.  Some substances have been banned in recent times but others still being used are harmful, although people may use them unknowingly.  The use of growth promoters in the beef sector has thankfully been resolved by the Department.  The same applies to this sector &mdash; we cannot stand over these products and say they are not harmful to the consumer.  I ask the Minister to establish, as a matter of urgency, an inspectorate in the <Col N="282" /> Department, perhaps under the auspices of An Bord Glas, so that we can be guaranteed that proper inspection takes place and no substances which could be classed as harmful are being used on or retained within products available for sale. Some substances produced by chemical companies will be retained within products until they are consumed, which is frightening.  When we see a beautiful shiny apple on a shop counter, we must question why it is so shiny and colourful.  It is usually imports which are treated in this way, I am glad to say.  I am not certain we are eating high quality, healthy products without any downside.</P>
    <P>The Minister should introduce a support system similar to that available in all other sectors of agriculture.  If that means providing grants, then Irish producers must receive them on a par with other producers who receive such aids and facilities.  Grants are provided for storage of commodities, cleansing and other value added processes on vegetables.  We must go beyond that and give realistic support to producers to ensure they will remain in the sector for the future.</P>
    <P>One area which should be examined is below cost selling, particularly of potatoes.  Many supermarkets have temporary hoardings saying that potatoes are selling at £1.99 or £2.99 a bag, although no producer in Ireland can sell them at that price.  I do not blame Tesco or the other multinationals but our own retailers who use commodities like potatoes in this way.  This happens not only in Dublin but throughout the country. I am sick looking at these signs and am often tempted to tear them down or challenge the owner of the shop about why he is doing this, which hurts his customers who produce potatoes. As a first step it is essential that potatoes are taken out of the category they share with soft fruits and that under cost sales are banned.  That will be helpful and supportive and will improve confidence.</P>
    <P>The report deals extensively with the mushroom industry.  I have reservations about this area also, but not about An Bord Glas's efforts to promote and market the product.  Mushroom growing was greeted in rural areas with euphoria. People were encouraged to erect low cost tunnels and they saw in mushrooms a niche with which to supplement their incomes.  Now, a few years on, the reality has hit them &mdash; can they compete on a level playing pitch with the other producers?</P>
    <P>Three major companies have a stranglehold on the mushroom industry.  Not only are these the major mushroom producers, they also provide the compost and small producers have no alternative but to buy compost from these companies.  Monaghan Mushrooms, in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency is one of these major companies and it is a fantastic mushroom producer. There are two others, one in Carbury, County Kildare and another in Wexford.  All three have taken onto themselves overall production of and access to compost and small producers' produce must be marketed through them.  That is unfair <Col N="283" /> practice about which I hope the Minister of State can do something, perhaps through An Bord Glas, thereby giving small producers greater confidence in the marketing of their produce and a greater return on their investment.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a man last evening who had invested in three tunnels located on part of his farmland where two members of his family are engaged in mushroom production.  That activity yielded a gross margin of £2,500 last year.  He is an efficient producer whose greatest costs are energy-related. If we are serious about maintaining smaller producers, we must subsidise their energy costs and, since there is considerable subsidisation in other areas of activity, it would not create any precedent.</P>
    <P>If the work of An Bord Glas was promoted, advertised and subsidised to a greater extent, now that many people are searching for new enterprises, we could ensure much greater valueadded to our produce and have it processed here. One can observe on the shelves of any supermarket today frozen vegetables, potatoes, chips, cauliflowers, carrots, the vast majority of which are imported.  If our producers cannot obtain a grant for import substitution, as is applicable in other areas of industrial activity &mdash; bearing in mind the cost of industrial job creation, whether in the high-tech, manufacturing or other sector &mdash; they will not be able to compete.  We should support the production and processing of our agricultural produce, such as mushrooms, by way of grant, and make it known that we will support applicants.  In this respect a whole new endeavour in advertising and promotion is required, particularly since agencies such as the IDA and Forbairt have done very little in the promotion and processing of agricultural produce and accompanying job creation.</P>
    <P>In addition, our educational system has turned its back on agriculture and horticulture.  Other than courses provided in universities I have not seen any course listed, other than part-time ones, in which people can participate in the horticultural sector.  I suppose the only exceptions would be those held at the National Botanic Gardens or in one of the agricultural colleges providing such courses on an extremely limited budget.  It is essential that this area be opened up in the future so that our rural population can be maintained and the Government of the day seen to positively support agriculture, in particular horticulture, as a means of allowing rural communities to develop.</P>
    <P>I congratulate An Bord Glas, its chairman, chief executive officer and members on the work they undertake within very obvious restrictions.  I hope the Minister of State will open up a new beginning to them and others involved in this overall sector, demonstrating that it is considered to be a very viable one with enormous potential for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of contributing to these statements and of wishing well the Minister of State, with special responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>Members' comments reflect numerous opinions on the horticultural industry expressed outside the House over a considerable period. Many observations have their origins in the fact that we appear to have huge volumes of imports. Given our certain perceived climatic advantages we should be able to produce such crops ourselves.</P>
      <P>Having spent some time involved with the industry and served a short while in the portfolio now held by the Minister of State, I disabused myself of many of those views and notions held sincerely by many outside the industry, certainly those outside the whole realm of direct involvement in the industry, endeavouring to market its produce and make a living from it.</P>
      <P>The decision to establish An Bord Glas on an interim basis and subsequently on a statutory basis was born out of the perhaps justifiable belief that, since there was significant support available to many mainline enterprises in agriculture, the horticultural sector was perceived to be the &ldquo;Cinderella factor&rdquo; within the overall sphere of agriculture. There was very little, if any support, available to potato growers, to field vegetable producers and many others in the industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy reflected on and recounted his experiences, as a former Minister for Agriculture. He said many involved in the horticultural sector for example in apple growing moved into more lucrative milk production.</P>
      <P>Of its very nature the industry is labour-intensive, a fact clearly reflected in the Minister's comments. Unfortunately, a high proportion of its employment-generation is part-time or casual in nature.  Nonetheless it plays a significant economic role in certain rural areas, where there are many smallholdings whose mushroom enterprises provide a supplementary income.  One example is the women who pick them, leaving for home before their children return from school.  The income derived from such casual employment is of considerable overall benefit to many households.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>This dispute's origins can be traced to lost promotional outlets due to voluntary early retirement schemes in the late 1980s which decreased the number of promotion outlets in the National Museum.  The small staffing pool in the National Museum served only to accentuate the lack of promotion opportunities, and a consequent build up of frustration among the professional and technical staff resulted.  The situation came to a head in early 1997 when the recruitment of new staff with skills in disciplines such as conservation, marketing, information technology, etc.  was initiated.  These skills, which are essential in a modern museum, had not been provided previously in our National Museum.  The staff now in dispute were aggrieved at the creation of six new posts, each to be filled by public competition, when promotions were not available to the existing National Museum staff.  The staff then embarked upon the present course of industrial action in an effort to secure promotions.</P>
      <P>On my appointment as Minister I inherited the industrial action among the professional and technical grades in the National Museum. However, there is a compelling need to resolve this industrial dispute.  The National Museum is at a key point in its development, with the recent opening to the public of Phase One of the Collins Barracks project.  It is my earnest wish that a practical resolution to the dispute is reached in order that the National Museum will be in a position to tackle the many challenges that lie ahead at this key time in its development.</P>
      <P>Like every Minister I am required to consider all claims for promotions and additional staff within my Department in the context of the wider public sector pay and staff numbers policy, and this dispute can only be resolved within that framework.</P>

      <P>This dispute has caused great sadness, particularly on the day of the opening of the new museum in Collins Barracks which should have been a day of great celebration, especially for those involved in that museum.  The dispute cast a shadow over those proceedings which was sad for all of us.  I have high regard for both the professional and the technical staff of the National Museum.  I said on that occasion I would do my utmost to ensure this dispute is resolved fairly and as quickly as possible.  Discussions have been held and I spoke with the staff outside Collins Barracks on the day of the official opening.  I have also had discussions with the chairperson of the board, and the board members have been talking to the unions.  I hope this approach will resolve the problem and movement will be made on all sides to bring about a resolution as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister every success and guím rath an Aire Stáit go maith freisin. I hope they both have a very productive period in office.  My Question No. 2 specifically refers to such proposals as the Minister for Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands might have put to the Minister for Finance.  I share the Minister's concern about solving this problem.  I am one of those who was disappointed on the opening day of the new museum because I find it impossible to pass a picket.  My question is specific.  I am concerned at the Minister's comment that the problem would have to be solved within the framework of a limitation on numbers in the public service.  My clear understanding of this dispute is that it is less about money, in so far as many of the people are receiving an acting up allowance, than it is about grading.  I suggest, therefore, that the agreement of the Department of Finance will be required to have an exception to the grading structures and limitations imposed if this matter is to be brought to a satisfactory resolution.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind remarks on my appointment.  I listened carefully to him and found his remarks strange coming from someone who filled my shoes for a number of years.  He knows the various restrictions on Government in these problems.  I inherited this problem.  It did not simply raise its head in the past few months since I took office.  It is a great shame the Deputy opposite did not put into force the suggestions he is now making, or perhaps he did &mdash; without results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there is a danger of the record being wrong, the Minister stated in her original reply that the problem began in the 1980s.  I was a Minister in two Governments but I was not a Minister in the 1980s.  I am not trying to score a point but if she examines the files, and she has access to them, she will find I made proposals to the Minister for Finance very much in line with what I am saying now.  The difference <Col N="287" /> between the Minister and myself, however, is that I was fighting for resources in terms of changes in grading and posts, not money, to resolve the problem.  Is the Minister saying this matter can only be resolved within arrangements for the public service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely underlying the fact that the Deputy must know the procedures and difficulties I face having faced them himself when he came into office four and a half years ago.  This is a difficult and ongoing problem to which we want to see a resolution.  I have given a guarantee, publicly and privately, that I will continue to do all I can and use any methods available to bring about this resolution.  The Deputy can be assured I will use every avenue regardless of whether suggestions come from the opposite benches or from my own to resolve this matter.</P>

      <P>This is a lesson in reality for the Minister because when she inhabited the benches on this side of the House this was a minor problem. Deputy Higgins could have this matter sorted out in the morning &mdash; meet the unions, appoint the staff and get on with it.  In the Minister's reply to the first question she said she felt there was a compelling need to sort out this matter. She is the Minister.  She has a constitutional responsibility to sort it out.  We are talking about a major investment of £33 million in one of the fastest growing areas of tourism interest.  The Collins Barracks museum is an incomplete entity. The curatorial staff are demoralised as a result of this dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question and it is related to all the activities down there.  The Minister has responsibility for this, yet when she was in Opposition she called on the Government to sort it out. It is a simple problem and there should not be any difficulty about it.  The Minister has not answered the question as to whether she has sufficient moneys in the Estimates to deal with lifting this go-slow by IMPACT and the proper presentation of the artefacts in the National Museum at Collins Barracks.  The Minister is aware that glass cases are empty in the museum, while others have unlabelled articles in them.  Five rooms have been prepared for presentations yet there is nothing in them.  It is not good enough.  It is the Minister's responsibility to tell the House, the museum staff and the public when she expects to sort this out.  Does she have money to do so in the Estimates, which were concluded last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the exhibits in Collins Barracks, some people are under the misapprehension that there is not enough to see and that much of the work is incomplete.  Some of the work is certainly incomplete, but I want to fill the <Col N="288" /> Deputy in with regard to the position.  A great deal of hard work was put in by everyone concerned to ensure proper preparation for the opening.  That included the staff of the National Museum, the Office of Public Works and my Department, with the co-operation of the Army for the celebrations on that day.</P>
      <P>The restoration of the magnificent Clarke Square has now been completed and since then over 20,000 visitors have seen the exhibits within Collins Barracks.  Curatorial staff involved in providing those exhibits are not happy because they have not reached the high standards they wish, but a certain number of exhibits can be viewed by the public.  Up to 30 new staff have recently been employed for the new museum, taking into account attendants, sales assistants and tour guides.</P>
      <P>As a former Minister, the Deputy will understand that this is not the place or the time to discuss the question of Estimates.  There will be an opportunity to do so at a later stage and it would not be appropriate to give such information now. I have had an opportunity on a number of occasions to talk to the chairperson of the board. The board is having continual meetings with the union, as is my Department.  I am being kept abreast of what is happening and I am making strong representations to ensure we come to an early resolution of this matter.</P>
      <P>The matter was inherited by me.  Deputy Kenny was a member of the Government who sat around the Cabinet table for four and a half years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Two and a half years should have been quite sufficient to resolve this matter. It is all very well for Deputy Kenny to ask me to resolve this.  We are doing our utmost to do so and I hope it will not take anything like the time it took under the last Administration where this matter simply was not addressed in the proper way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am restraining myself from going down the road of the present Minister. Would the Minister agree it would be useful to tell her colleague, the Minister for Finance, that she would have the support of the Opposition in seeking, as an exceptional measure, a regrading structure for staff in the National Museum and the National Library that would enable this dispute to be resolved?  I say this in a positive spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has yet again stated that nothing was done and that the problem was left there.  She should read the files and she will see my proposals to the Department of Finance.  Would it not be helpful to have a consensus, taking Collins Barracks as a new project I inherited from the 1980s when there were voluntary redundancies? The Minister says she inherited the problem from me, but that is not the way to proceed.  Would the Minister agree that it may be necessary to seek <Col N="289" /> an exceptional status for this problem within the public service agreement being negotiated with the Department of Finance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his intervention.  I will take the opportunity of passing on to my Cabinet colleagues, and in particular the Minister for Finance, that they have the support of the Opposition benches in this regard.  It is interesting to note, however, that when I was Opposition spokesperson, the then Minister for Finance had my support in seeing what could be done to resolve this matter, yet nothing was ever discussed in the House other than when the problem was highlighted by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I have repeated myself on a number of occasions because the questions are continuing to be repetitive.  This matter is not a simple one in that the questions must be viewed in a global context with reference to Government policy.  Within that framework I will continue to do my utmost to ensure that this problem is resolved.</P>
      <P>I was particularly saddened on the day of the opening by the fact that this situation should have arisen at all.  I commend all those who have done tremendous work under difficult circumstances and who have felt frustrated for many years because they have been acting in positions where in any other type of job there would have been opportunities for promotion.  Because of the small pool involved those promotional opportunities were not there.  I want to put it on the record that their work is recognised and that we will continue to do our best to resolve this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's view that this is not the time to discuss the Estimates but she knows the conclusion of the Estimates in respect of her own Department.  I do not take the view that talking to staff outside Collins Barracks on the day of its opening is the way to sort this out. It is the Minister's responsibility and I would like her to outline her agenda for action.  She said she hoped it would not be long before it is finally dealt with.  That must mean that the Minister is involving herself in this.  The museum is in the Taoiseach's constituency and I am sure there will be an element of support from the Taoiseach at the Cabinet table.  If she takes on board Deputy Higgins's proposal in respect of a regrading structure, the Minister will have our support.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that the National Museum does not have a clear management structure and seems to be in an intractable position.  I do not want to see the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands having to continually pass pickets.  It is not good enough.</P>

It certainly needs far more than that to resolve the dispute and that is why I have kept in close contact with what is going on.  In addition, my Department has taken many initiatives to see what can be done in the overall context of the <Col N="290" /> approach by Government.  I have been in contact with the chairperson of the board on a continual basis and the board has been in contact with the unions.  I hope this will be a vehicle whereby both sides can move closer together to find a resolution. That is the approach that is being taken at present.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement to which the Deputy refers, in which I called for moves towards the creation of a global ocean sanctuary for whales, was made in the context of dialogue which took place during the run-up to the 49th meeting of the International Whaling Commission which is currently under way in Monaco. In light of a number of misleading reports in the media that Ireland is in some way abandoning its pro-conservation stance in relation to whaling, I want to state clearly that this is not the case.  All the proposals put forward by Ireland are intended to ensure that fewer whales are killed and that any killing which may be carried out will be strictly regulated.  In light of the confusion which exists about Ireland's position in this matter, I will set out matters clearly.</P>
      <P>Ireland became a member of the International Whaling Commission in 1985 with a clear objective to promote the conservation of whales. Ireland does not engage in whaling and our waters were declared a sanctuary for whales in 1991. Nevertheless, we recognise that it is part of other cultures to take and use whales.  In that context, Ireland's role in the IWC is to ensure that any whaling which takes place does so in a manner which provides that no population of whales is endangered.</P>
      <P>Following a long period of over-exploitation, several populations of whales were endangered and a moratorium on commercial whaling was adopted by the IWC in 1982.  However, it is no secret that there are major difficulties facing the IWC, particularly as it has no power to regulate scientific research whaling or to overrule legal objections by member states such as Norway to the moratorium.  The number of whales taken increased from more than 380 in 1992 to approximately 1,050 this year.  This trend is very worrying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland continues to believe that the populations of whales have not been given sufficient time to recover fully from excessive catches in the past and that it is not appropriate to agree to the <Col N="291" /> resumption of commercial whaling.  We believe, however, that between the extremes of zero whaling and full commercial whaling there may be scope to reach a consensus of all parties to limit whaling in the medium term.</P>
    <P>Ireland put forward its proposals for discussion at the IWC meeting currently under way in Monaco in the context of the impasse at the IWC, the need to complete its revised management scheme, the threat posed by a fragmentation of the IWC and the continued increase in unregulated whaling.  These proposals in no way represent a change in our long-standing policy of being against wholesale commercial whaling.  It is not realistic at present to expect every country to cease whaling totally.  We are trying to minimise the level of whaling and to ensure that any whaling which takes place is strictly regulated.</P>
    <P>Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund and the International Fund for Animal Welfare in a joint statement in Monaco, stated;</P>
    <P>Whaling is growing rapidly and is out of the IWC's control.  Unless firm action is taken to bring the situation under control, unregulated whaling looks set to increase even further.</P>
    <P>The proposals put forward for discussion by Ireland at the meeting are as follows.  The IWC revised management scheme should be completed and adopted.  The scheme must be conservative and provide in particular for inspection and observation procedures that will engender public confidence.  Where quotas are justified under the RMS, these should be restricted to coastal areas only.  This would result in a <i>de facto</i> sanctuary over the oceans of the world.  Quotas should be issued for local consumption only.  This would avoid the pressure on whaling which would arise from international trade.  Lethal scientific whaling should be phased out over a period. Regulations for whale watching should be prepared to minimise the impact of disturbance on whale populations.</P>
    <P>These proposals have been put forward for discussion among all interests in attendance at the IWC meeting in Monaco.  They do not represent a definitive solution to the issues facing the IWC. However, they have been put forward in an attempt to focus deliberations at the IWC meeting on the requirements for whale conservation in the medium term.  I stress that there is no question of negotiating a deal that allows coastal whaling without agreeing to a ban on pelagic whaling and trade and the phasing out of scientific whaling.</P>
    <P>Our proposals are designed to help ensure that fewer whales will be killed and that any killing which may be carried out will be strictly regulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.  Is she aware that the environmental investigation agency said that the Government's representative in Monaco, Mr. Canny, has <Col N="292" /> his finger on the trigger of the harpoon gun but the agency does not want the blood of thousands of whales sloshing around.  Under the law of the sea 40 per cent of the world's waters are covered by the definition of &ldquo;coastal waters&rdquo; in which most of the world's whale population is found.  If the Government's proposals are carried and commercial whaling is resumed in coastal waters up to 200 miles, the level of whale killing will seriously increase.  The blue whale, which number approximately 1,000, is almost extinct.  A modern whaling vessel can butcher and process a whale in less than an hour.  The monitoring by satellite or otherwise of modern fishing vessels which have flagrantly breached the laws laid down in the moratorium is simply not on.</P>
      <P>For many years Japan has used the scientific research clause to take thousands of whales. These whales have ended up in restaurants, not in science laboratories.  This gives an idea of the difficulties we face.  Given that 40 per cent of the world's seas are covered by the definition of &ldquo;coastal waters&rdquo;, if the Irish proposal to resume commercial whaling in coastal waters, where most of the whale population lives, is agreed there will be increased slaughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's emotive language.  These proposals are being put forward for discussion at the conference.  Unfortunately, many countries, particularly Norway and Japan, do not share our view that there should be no commercial whaling.  Because of this different view and the threat of fragmentation of the IWC something must be done.  It would be very easy for us to take an absolutist position and say; &ldquo;This is our position and that is that&rdquo;. However, we must try to minimise the killing of whales.  We are in the business of trying to rescue the situation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy said, some countries have flagrantly breached the regulations and gone against the views expressed.  Commercial whaling in coastal waters will not lead to increased slaughter and further difficulties for the simple reason that most coastal nations have no desire to carry out whaling and have no domestic market for whale meat. By excluding international trade our proposals will tie in to the moratorium nations which already carry out coastal whaling, thereby making the seas safer for whales.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If the moratorium is lifted and whaling is allowed in coastal waters under certain conditions it will reward those countries which have flagrantly breached the existing regulations.  That many countries want nothing to do with whaling increases the opportunity to breach the laws and regulations.  Irrespective of the regulations, in 40 per cent of coastal waters, where the vast majority of the whale population exists, there is indiscriminate slaughter of whales.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that.  If that was the case there would be no point in taking part in a commission to try to find a consensus to save as many whales as possible and prevent indiscriminate slaughter, which unfortunately is the practice in some countries.  As regards the observer status, there will be an international observer on each whaling vessel and vessels will be subject to satellite tracking.  DNA samples will be taken from all animals killed and it will be possible to check whale meat in the market to ensure it has been legally obtained.  Because illegal meat will be confiscated, pirate whaling will be uneconomic.  The application of modern technology will ensure a level of control never available before.  That is why we put forward this constructive proposal.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's view that certain individuals and nations have used scientific whaling as an opportunity to indiscriminately kill whales.  We would like to see lethal scientific whaling phased out over a period, but there must be a consensus that nations voluntarily take whales.  Everybody within the IWC does not think alike.  If that was the case there would be no need for those provisions. I hope at the end of the discussions in May the position whereby many whales are under threat will be improved.  The number of whales taken has increased from more than 380 in 1992 to almost 1,050 in 1997.  We can sit back and do nothing, which might make us feel more comfortable in many instances, but if we are interested in looking after the whale population and ensuring conservation, we have an obligation to put forward these worthwhile proposals, particularly as they relate to quotas for local consumption. When the revised management scheme of the IWC is completed and adopted we can find a medium-term solution to a problem which is increasing in terms of the whale population.</P>

      <P>I will reply to this question in English as the question was put in English although it relates to Inisbiggle which is a Gaeltacht island.  It is my intention, in the case of Inisbiggle as in the case of all populated offshore islands which do not have satisfactory access arrangements at present, to assess all viable options in consultation with the islanders and other interested parties with a view to providing financial assistance to enable them to overcome their access deficiencies in the most acceptable and economical manner possible.</P>
      <P>I intend in the near future to visit Inisbiggle island so that I can get a first hand overview and sense of the current access difficulties.  My Department will then, in consultation with others as necessary, urgently appraise the special access requirements of Inisbiggle, including access by air, and progress proposals that would be deemed safe and economical as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>I am aware the Minister is very active in this Ministry, but I do not know why he has not visited Inisbiggle.  There are 65 people living on that island and the crossing, although very short, is dangerous.  It is about 15 years since a Fianna Fáil Minister made a commitment to provide a cable car as a method of access to Inisbiggle. I am aware the planning appeal was withdrawn and a new application is to be made.  In the document on the provision of facilities on islands and access to islands, there is no reference to access by cable car.  What is the Minister's view on this matter?  Does he favour access by cable car?</P>

      <P>The document states that comprehensive policies on access to islands will be drawn up, but all the methods by which this might be achieved are not specified.  There is already a cable car on one island.  I have visited 17 islands and there are some in my constituency and in County Mayo which I have yet to visit.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of the saying: the first shall be last and the last shall be first.  The fact that Inisbiggle will be one of the last islands to be visited will not mean it will be last in terms of dealing with its problems.  I am making arrangements to visit the island.  I will then be in a better position to assess the options available and make a decision on the way forward.  It would be wrong of me, without visiting the island, to favour one proposed solution over another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will be welcome when he visits the island.  He is an astute reader of files and understands how problems arise and are dealt with and obviously he is aware of the implications of the cable car on Cape Clear.  However, he did not answer my question as to whether he has a personal preference, given his policy document and his experience of dealing with islands, for access by boat and slipway or by cable car?  In the event of Mayo County Council changing its decision to grant permission would the Minister be prepared to fund it, if the cost is reasonable?</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Having visited the 17 islands I have learnt that each island and its location is unique.  The access problems in each island have to be dealt with specifically in relation to the islands themselves.  I assure the Deputy and the people of Inisbiggle we will deal with this issue rapidly.  Various options are available.  I have often been to Achill and Ballycroy but I have never been to Inisbiggle.  Without seeing the island I would be loath to state a preference.  The Deputy will not have to wait long to find out in what direction we are moving.  As Minister of State I have not yet met the islanders in a formal fashion but I intend doing so in the near future.  I do not want to pre-empt that discussion and, indeed, it would be wrong to do so.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister of State is finding it educational to visit islands and I am sure the 62 people on Inisbiggle will find it inspirational when he visits them.  Before he visits them will he agree he is not short of reports given that there are at least two large reports on the cable car and further reports on the hovercraft option?  One does not have to visit the island to read the reports.  The third option we heard today is the air option to Inisbiggle.  Is it the intention of the Minister of State to express a preference for expenditure that might arise from the 1998 Estimates?  Is it his intention to enter into a partnership agreement with expenditure that might arise in the Department of the Environment and Local Government through Mayo County Council, <Col N="296" /> if that option recommend itself?  Perhaps he could put an outer time limit on any resolution.  I have sympathy for the Minister of State because, as I understand it, the 62 people are frequently divided as to which option they prefer.</P>

      <P>The options put to me by the Deputy are not the only options.  I understand from the study, commissioned by Údarás na Gaeltachta, the possibility of a bridge was mentioned, on which I have costings.  My view on the issue is simple.  I believe in consultation.  I recall when Deputy Higgins was Minister priority was given to consultation.  If I expressed a preference today I would be pre-empting open consultation with the islanders.  I want to see the island and speak to the islanders and other interested parties. Following that I will deal not only with this issue but with all island issues.  A programme to resolve the access difficulties to the islands will be implemented without delay in the coming months and years.</P>

      <P>Given the anxiety of the Minister of State to take decisions there are, as Deputy Higgins outlined, substantial files on this matter.  The option the islanders suggested when I visited them was the cable car.  That was the reason the planning application was submitted. The Minister of State does not have to visit Inisbiggle before making a decision.  The people on the island want a cable car and the Minister of State has not answered the question put to him by Deputy Kenny.  Has the Minister of State any objection to a cable car?</P>

      <P>I have no objection to any solution on two conditions: that the money aspect be taken into account &mdash; the Deputy is well aware of that from his time in the Department &mdash; and consultation with the islanders.  As Minister of State I have not had the opportunity to deal directly with the islanders.  In 17 other islands I have sat down with the islanders and I am in the process of proceeding with a number of issues raised by them.  I am surprised Deputies Opposite have not referred to the fact, that although the cable car is an interesting option, sea access could still be an issue.  I want to go there, get the costings on all the options and examine them.  When we come to the next Question Time I will have been to Inisbiggle.  If Deputies wish to table the question again I will be happy to respond to them.  It would be wrong to do that without first discussing it with the islanders.</P>

      <P>Níl mé meascaithe a bheag nó a mhór faoin rud: tuigim go maith gur féidir Orduithe a dhéanamh agus a athrú taobh istigh de reachtaíocht 1956.  Ní hé sin a dúradh.  Má táthar chun conclúid a thógáil as an méid a dúirt an tAire Stáit, tá sé soiléir anois go mbeidh reachtaíocht againn go luath i 1988 ach nach mbeidh an fhadhb seo mar chuid den reachtaíocht sin.  Ní féidir a rá go mbeidh sé againn ar maidin agus nach mbeidh sé againn tráthnóna.</P>
      <P>Beidh gach tacaíocht ag an Aire Stáit uaimse má tá sé i gceist aige rud éigin a dhéanamh chun tacú le daoine atá ag iarraidh a gcuid páistí a thógaint trí mheán na Gaeilge i gcathair na Gaillimhe; bheinn taobhach leis sin.  Ach an rud atá tábhachtach ná nach bhfuil sé soiléir cioca Teachta atá ag insint na fírinne.  Ar maidin bhí sé soiléir go mbeadh ceist na limistéar sa reachtaíocht go luath i 1998.  Roimh leath uair tar éis a trí, dúirt an tAire Stáit nach bhfuil reachtaíocht ag teastáil agus go mb'fhéidir go mbeidh rud éigin againn roimh dheireadh théarma an Rialtais. Cioca scéal atá fíor?</P>

Tá roinnt laincisí ann.  Beidh cúpla píosa reachtaíochta i gceist againn leis an gceist seo a réiteach, mar tá ceist chumhachtaí an Aire i reachtaíocht amháin.  Níl aon fhadhb ná níl aon ghá le reachtaíocht leis na limistéir Ghaeltachta a athrú agus sin an fáth go raibh beagáinín dul amú orm.  Ach shoiléirigh ceist an Teachta an mhí-thuiscint a bhí air.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> An aontódh an tAire Stáit go bhfuil an-dáinséar ann gur ag cúngú na teorainneacha Gaeltachta a bheifear san am atá le teacht má leanann an brú ar an nGaeltacht? An bhfuil lán-eolas ag an Aire ar chomh láidir is atá an brú cultúrtha ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ón domhan lasmuigh i láthair na huaire?  Ní theastaíonn ó thuismitheoirí sa Ghaeltacht go mbeadh a gcuid leanaí nochtaithe roimh chultúr na Gaeltachta nó cultúr na Gaoluinne amháin; ní bheadh ansin ach seóbhineachas amaideach, abair.  Tá sé an-deacair ar thuismitheoirí i láthair na huaire cothramú a fháil ar chultúir a leanaí de bharr an bhrú atá ann ó fhoinsí difriúla agus de bharr an dearcadh atá scaipthe ag na meáin chumarsáide, go mór mór, b'fhéidir, go mbaineann gach rud atá &lsquo;hip&rsquo; ní le cultúr na Gaeltachta ach le príomhchultúr na tíre.  Labhraim mar dhuine a chuireann ar chomhchéim iomlán an dá phríomhchultúr sa tír seo, agus tugaim ómós cuí do gach cultúr eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> An bhfuil aon phlean ag an Aire Stáit nó ag an Roinn breis cabhair agus tacaíocht a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, idir thuismitheoirí agus glúin óg, go mbeidís in ann páirc imeartha níos cothroime a bheith acu agus iad ag tógaint a gclanna?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>An freagra simplí ar an dara cuid den cheist ná go bhfuil plean á réiteach. Tuigimse féin na fadhbanna atá ann, mar is tuismitheoir mé a thóg clann sa nGaeltacht, trí Ghaeilge: tuigimse na brúnna atá ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ó thaobh na teanga de.  Tá gá le gníomhaíochtaí i bhfad níos raidiciúla ná mar a bhí ann cheana agus is gá na gníomhaíochtaí Gaeltachta a athrú chun oiriúint do na fadhbanna atá ann anois seachas na fadhbanna a bhí ann fiche nó tríocha bliain ó shin.</P>
      <P>Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith dearfa de go mbeidh athruithe bunúsacha á dhéanamh ar threo na Roinne agus ar threo na bpolasaithe le déanamh cinnte go bhfreastalaíonn siad ar riachtanais an lae inniu.  É sin ráite, tá cuid mhór d'aos óg na Gaeltachta, go mór mór iad siúd go mbíonn an deis acu dul taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, a thuigeann anois gur féidir leo an dá thaobh a thabhairt leo.  Níor mhaith liomsa go bhfásfadh aos óg na Gaeltacha suas gan Béarla ach ó mo thaithí phearsanta féin ag tógáil clann le Gaeilge níl contúirt ar bith go dtarlóidh sé sin anois.  Tá Béarla ar theilifís chuile áit thart orthu.  An rud a chaithfimid a chinntiú ní hé nach dtabharfaidh siad an Béarla leo mar tabharfaidh agus sin mar is cuí ach freisin go dtabharfaidh siad an Ghaeilge leo agus go mbeidh an tacaíocht institiúideach ann do na daoine atá ag iarraidh é sin a dhéanamh.  Tá gá le hathrú raidiciúil iomlán faoin gcaoi go dtugaimid faoin bhfadhb sin agus feicfear polasuithe nua agus athruithe treo bunúsacha ag teacht ar aghaidh agus tá súil agam nuair a tharlóidh sé go dtuigfidh lucht an Fhreasúra go bhfuil gá lena leithéid seo d'athrú agus go mbeidh tacaíocht le fáil uathu do na hathruithe agus don dearcadh níos réalaíoch atá sé i gceist agam a thógáil i dtaobh na ceiste seo.</P>

      <P>An fhadhb a bhí i gceist ag an Aire Stáit i gcathair na Gaillimhe, chuala mé é a rá nach raibh aon ghanntanas airgid sa Roinn.  An bhfuil sé ag rá linn go mbeidh na limistéir á leathnú le linn a réimeas sa Roinn?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Is dóigh liom gur ceist chasta é ceist chathair na Gaillimhe agus tá roinnt moltaí déanta agam go poiblí faoi na bealaí éagsúla a fhéadfaí tabhairt faoin gceist seo a réiteach.  Go dtí seo, bhíothas ag glacadh leis gur ceist dubh agus bán a bhí ann: bíodh an chathair istigh sa Ghaeltacht nó fágfaimis an status quo.  Tá mé tar éis a rá go minic <Col N="303" /> nach mar sin a fheicim é.  Feicim go bhfuil áit speisialta ag cathair na Gaillimhe mar an t-aon chathair amháin sa tír a bhfuil teorann aici leis an nGaeltacht, cathair go gcloistear an Ghaeilge go minic ar a sráideanna agus i bhfad níos minicí ná in aon chathair eile in Éirinn.  É sin ráite, caithfimid glacadh leis gur Béarlóirí formhór mhuintir chathair na Gaillimhe.  An rud atá mise ag iarraidh a dhéanamh ná teacht ar fhoirmle leis an dá rud sin a réiteach.  Ní dóigh gur trí línte breise a tharraingt ar léarscáil go simplí go ndéanfar an cheist seo a réiteach.  Beidh mé ag déanamh moltaí sonracha i dtaobh na ceiste seo agus is féidir leis an Teachta glacadh leis go ndéanfar na moltaí seo go réasúnta luath.</P>
    <P>Tógfaidh sé reachtaíocht cuid de na moltaí atá i gceist agam a dhéanamh a dhéanamh; i gcásanna eile is féidir iad a dhéanamh le hOrduithe Aire. Beidh cur le chéile den dá rud ag teastáil chun an fhadhb seo a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Is féidir a bheith cinnte de go dtabharfar faoin rud a seachnaíodh le blianta fada, an cheist ollmhór seo, mar níl aon difríocht idir Cnoc na Cathrach, Tír Oileáin agus Baile Bán nó Rathún agus cén fáth i gcás duine ón nGaeltacht atá ag cónaí i Rathún go ngearrtar as chuile rud iad, ach dá mbeidís leathmhíle síos an bóthair, bheidís istigh?</P>
    <P>Is féidir glacadh leis go bhfuil sé faoin Rialtas seo tabhairt faoi réiteach a fháil ar an fhadbh seo, rud ar theip ar an Rialtas deiridh a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 the European Commission is entitled to seek a refund of European Regional Development Fund funding paid in respect of any project which ceases to function within a ten year period from the date of the payment of the final instalment of grant assistance.  If such a situation were to arise, it would fall to the agency which approved the grant assistance to refund the project grant to the Commission.</P>
      <P>As one of the main reasons for grant-assisted projects ceasing to function is lack of funding for operational costs, it has been standard practice since 1989 for all agencies providing grant assistance under the Operational Programme for Tourism to seek to require the promoters of projects which have been successful in securing grant assistance to secure from a local authority or other State agency operating in their area a written guarantee to underwrite any operational costs during the first ten years of operation.  This procedure was adopted by my Department when the cultural development incentive scheme was introduced. I can see no good reason to review the seeking of such guarantees at this point.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware this is posing difficulties for a number of local authorities? They are not willing to give this guarantee with the result a number of projects are being held up.</P>
      <P>How many projects which have been approved under this scheme have received the guarantee demanded from a local authority?  How many projects have been approved but the local authority has not as yet contacted the Department with this guarantee?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's concerns, because we had an opportunity to talk briefly about this matter before today's question.</P>
      <P>The condition for proof of funding under the CDIS is considered to be one of the most important of all the conditions attaching to grant offers as full compliance will be strictly enforced.</P>
      <P>I do not have the additional information which the Deputy sought on the number of projects which have looked for such funding but I will get that information for him.</P>

      <P>As this presents a problem for a number of local authorities will the Minister review this open-ended requirement?  Local authorities which are strapped for cash could find it difficult to meet any losses which would result from the operation of these facilities.  Will the Minister review it in consultation with the European Commission to see if there is a form of wording which would be more acceptable to all local authorities?</P>

      <P>As long as the European Commission is entitled to seek a refund of European Regional Development Fund funding paid in respect of any project which ceases to function within a ten year period, this condition must remain in place.  It has remained in place for all of the projects to date, the reason being that we are talking about operational costs.  If a local authority does not believe that by putting forward funds a project will continue, that in itself raises questions about the project involved.</P>
      <P>I must be strict about this ruling.  It has applied in every case to date.  Because there is this ten year ruling with regard to the European Commission, I cannot see that this is likely to change in the near future.</P>

      <P>Deletion of the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; from the new name of my Department does not represent a downgrading by this Government of the role and importance of culture in the life of the nation.  The statement of strategy for the former Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht &mdash; as published last May and endorsed by my predecessor &mdash; did not identify any specific roles and functions of that Department in relation to &ldquo;culture&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The role and functions of the Department are described in the following terms:</P>
      <P>The Department's main areas of responsibility can be brought together under the combining concepts of culture and heritage, in the broadest sense, as signified by the unifying word oidhreacht, which integrates the Irish language into our definition of culture, in an explicit way, as a major cultural force in our society.</P>
      <P>The word oidhreacht means, of course, &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; and the new title of my Department places the concept of oidhreacht &mdash; which the former Minister accepted in his statement of strategy as embracing &ldquo;culture&rdquo;&mdash; to the fore.</P>
      <P>There are no policy goals set down in the strategy document specifically in relation to &ldquo;culture&rdquo;. This undoubtedly reflects the difficulties in defining what &ldquo;culture&rdquo; means in isolation.  Indeed, there is no uniformity in Europe in the titles of ministries with responsibility for cultural matters. I am quite satisfied the new title for my Department better reflects its role and responsibilities. There has been no change in the location within my Department of the European dimension of its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> The Deputy will be aware that responsibility for offshore islands has been transferred to my Department from the Department of the Taoiseach. As I stated in my reply to Question No. 447 of 30 September 1997, the costs to date incurred by my Department due to changing its name and responsibilities amounted to some £7,700, to be met from existing budgets.</P>
    <P>In connection with the transfer of responsibilities for Islands, it will be necessary to seek a Supplementary Estimate to allow my Department to expend funds currently provided for under subhead F 2.4 of the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been quoted more than once in replies prepared for the Minister and I take the opportunity to explain something.  Perhaps the Minister will not agree with me but I would ask her to reflect on it.</P>
      <P>First the Irish word &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo; has a wider meaning than the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; in English, but at no stage did I say, while heritage is part of tradition, that one could drop the word culture for the obvious reason that one would be dropping the contemporary and the urban.  The Minister will not find a line to justify that in the Department.</P>
      <P>Second, does the Minister think it is interesting that the change in the title of the Department was following what was expected to be the English model but that her colleague in Britain, Chris Smith, MP, calls himself the Secretary of State for Culture?</P>
      <P>Third I asked where the European dimension of the Department's work will be located.  The Council, to which I wish her well when she goes, to which I went was the Council for Audiovisual and Cultural Affairs Ministers.  The word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; in the title of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht acted as a combining term which included the contemporary, the traditional, broadcasting, etc.  I accept that the word &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo; has wider implications than the term &ldquo;heritage&rdquo;. If there had not been a combining term in the Department's title, Teilifís na Gaeilge would not have come into existence because neither the broadcasting authorities nor Roinn na Gaeltachta could have established it on their own.  The empowering word during my tenure in the Department was &ldquo;culture&rdquo;.  I tabled this question because, on the announcement of the change in the Department's title, the Taoiseach stated that the Government would have different priorities, the nature of which I was eager to learn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted the Deputy's remarks because of the direct reference to the roles and functions of the Department set out in the statement of strategy he introduced as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  It is important to note that under the previous Administration the Department had no specific roles and functions in respect of culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> It is clear that broadcasting comes under the auspices of my Department and is one of its major responsibilities.  Therefore, Teilifís na Gaeltachta, Raidió na Gaeltachta and the other elements of broadcasting are to the fore in my Department.  The Deputy is correct to state that this Government places a different emphasis on the Department's priorities.  It will be no surprise to him that the priorities of successive Governments regarding individual Departments differ. We were interested in promoting the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; because, as the Deputy stated on many occasions, it is a wider-ranging and more inclusive term than the term &ldquo;culture&rdquo;.</P>

    <Title>An Bord Glas Annual Report, 1996: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of our discussion on the report of An Bord Glas, one is reminded of the blanket criticism made in this House in respect of State boards in recent years.  Listening to the Minister of State's contribution, I was struck by the modest budget An Bord Glas has utilised since its establishment in 1990.  Given the significance of the role of An Bord Glas in market co-ordination, and its general co-ordinating role, the public expenditure involved is quite small and there is a reasonable value for money return.</P>
      <P>An Bord Glas provides a focal point for development in the horticultural sector.  Many of the growers involved in this sector felt alienated by and isolated from the system because the supports and market interventions put in place for beef, milk and other producers were not available to them.</P>
      <P>The potato sector, mushroom production, nursery stock, the protection of crops, field vegetable production and soft fruit and tough fruit production are the main areas of concern to An Bord</P>
      <P>Glas.  The reality is, however, that no matter how all-embracing or effective the board may be, there are a number of considerations which will have a bearing on the well-being of any of those enterprises, particularly in respect of the returns realised by growers from one year to the next.  In that context, supply and demand is probably more relevant to this area than to any other.  For example, if the European market is oversupplied with produce importers can bring an entire range of goods on to the Irish market, with immediate implications for growers in this country.</P>
      <P>With regard to climatic considerations, a previous speaker stated that there will be a 10 per cent reduction in the anticipated yield of potatoes in the current year.  Perhaps he was referring to a 10 per cent reduction in acreage.  However, if that reduction is in acreage, it is merely a reaction to the serious depression in prices in this sector last year.</P>
      <P>Horticulture and agriculture in general are affected by the capital outlay requirement, which is always underestimated.  Economists &mdash; be they agricultural economists, individuals commenting from the political arena or others &mdash; do not appear to have a real appreciation of what is involved under the general heading of capital outlay. Regardless of the enterprise involved, a major amount of money is required to establish a business from a standing start.  In many instances the return on that money is quite doubtful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other Members stated, the multiples have a significant role in this industry and the degree of control they exert is beyond what it should be. They are in a position to dictate to suppliers and <Col N="311" /> to effectively control the market because of their dominant position, and recent changes have not improved things.</P>
    <P>Economies of scale come much more into play here than in any other member state in the European Community.  We have a small population of approximately five million people, something more than one third of the total population of London.  That puts in context our additional distribution costs.</P>
    <P>The most significant appointment made by An Bord Glas was that of a market co-ordinator in a number of different areas, particularly in the potato industry.  It would be hard to imagine a sector more fragmented than the potato industry but there have been significant structural changes in that area.  However, market co-ordination and the provision of information to individual growers are very important, and the market co-ordinator in that sector did an excellent job.</P>
    <P>The seed potato sector is one area within the horticultural brief that needs to be addressed.  For reasons over which An Bord Glas has no control, the development thrust for new varieties of seed potatoes is painfully slow.  An Foras Talúntas, and nowadays Teagasc, have done great work in this area but there is a need for an initiative in the sector, given the contraction in the volume of seed potatoes exported and the need to develop new varieties that will have a regenerative effect on the potato industry, although I do not for a moment think we will produce the ideal variety overnight.</P>
    <P>Surprisingly, none of the contributors to the debate referred to the potato chip area.  A huge volume of potato chips are imported annually. One reason for that is the difficulty in getting a variety of potato suitable for chipping and that will provide a crop volume allowing the producer to sell at a modest price, given that the profit margins in this area are quite tight.  We need to develop a suitable variety if we are to develop that sector and turn around the volume of imports.  The Maris Piper was hailed as the ideal solution, but some difficulties have arisen with it. It may be possible to rectify the problem or for production techniques to come to terms with it. It is an area that needs attention and, certainly, we could justify spending some money on it.</P>
    <P>In the protected crop sector, effectively crops grown under glass, growers have not, because poor, erratic or inadequate returns, reinvested in upgrading glasshouses and equipment to the extent that they should.  The availability of natural gas was at one time hailed as the solution to high energy costs, but this has not been the case. Perhaps the Minister of State would look at technological developments in utilising energy from farmyard waste and the possibility of on-site integrated development arrangements for glasshouse and farmyard waste in close proximity.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me to conclude without paying tribute to the Chief Executive of An Bord Glas, Mr. Brendan O'Donnell and the modest <Col N="312" /> staff which he had available to him.  They have done a tremendous amount of work.  They are very dedicated people who see it as their goal to implement the various development programmes produced to An Bord Glas.  I take the opportunity also to pay tribute to the horticultural unit in the Department.  The number of people there is small but their dedication and commitment to their task is undoubted.  Because of its nature their work is unseen, but I hope it is appreciated by people outside.</P>
    <P>I had not realised until today that the early retirement from farming scheme is not available to somebody who wants to retire from the horticultural sector.  It might be worthwhile going back to the European Commission to see if it could be extended.  Many people involved in this sector would retire if they could, and it is vitally important to get young people involved in the industry in the hope that this might help to enlarge the scale of operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy, reflecting his own constituency concerns, dwelt at some length on apple production. Undoubtedly there has been a severe contraction in the apple industry.  In the Suir Valley many old orchards have been &ldquo;grubbed out&rdquo;, and dairy cows put in to graze.  That is a great pity because imports of apples are significant.  It is very costly to plant orchards and there is a leadin period before there is any cash flow from it.  A number of years back new orchards were planted in County Dublin, but the Suir Valley in Waterford, south Tipperary, Kilkenny and the Kells area are regarded as the ideal climatic and geographic areas for new orchards.  I do not know what progress, if any, has been made on the planting of new orchards.  There is a prohibition at Community level on providing any support for the planting of new ones, principally because of the surplus of apples within the Community. Even though money is available for rural development programmes under Leader, it is not possible to spend some on encouraging farmers to plant orchards.  Given the undoubted role apples play in our health and well-being it is a great pity we cannot grow what we need.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the interim board of An Bord Glas, of which Eugene Caulfield was chairman &mdash; he was subsequently chairman of the statutory board for many years.  I congratulate and thank all the board members who gave so unstintingly of their time for very little remuneration. We would not be able to operate the system without them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, the chief executive and chairman of An Bord Glas must be heartened and encouraged by what they have heard.  Many Deputies are of the view that there is a need to increase its annual budget.  I am sure the money would be spent wisely and well.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I compliment An Bord Glas on the extraordinary work it has done with limited resources and staff in the promotion of fruit and vegetables.  It has presented a good image.  In close co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Food, An Bord Bia, Teagasc and An Bord Trachtála it might be able to secure increased funding.</P>
      <P>There is a need for growers and retailers to work closely together to ensure their survival and success.  The presence of the major British multiples in the Irish retail market &mdash; I was a supermarket proprietor prior to entering politics &mdash; has instilled fear in small retailers, particularly in the west.  I understand that all of the vegetables on sale in Marks and Spencers in Dublin are imported.  This is a worrying development.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the number of farmers leaving the land.  The time has come to find alternatives.  Young farmers in particular should be encouraged to enter horticulture which has huge potential.  As people become more health conscious presentation and display will assume major importance.</P>
      <P>Retailers have a vested interest in the survival of growers who should be able to exploit our green image abroad.  The Minister of State should consider the possibility of increasing the grants available for growers for the provision of infrastructure. They are competing in an extremely competitive market in which they are required to deliver quickly high quality produce at the best possible price.  Large wholesalers are considering the possibility of putting a central distribution system in place.  This offers a great opportunity to reduce costs and ensure quick delivery of stock. It should not be done at the expense of jobs.</P>
      <P>The consumer expects the highest quality.  Suppliers who arrive between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. in the Dublin market, which I have visited, expect to get the best possible deal.  As we approach the new millennium the consumer will increasingly expect to be able to buy in the supermarket washed lettuce and cut tomatoes in containers.  The days when a retailer sold one pound of tomatoes or carrots are over.  The consumer on his return home at 6 p.m. wants to be able to produce a meal quickly.  In this context the frozen food market is expanding rapidly.  The best way of encouraging growers to provide packaged fruit and vegetables &mdash; added value products &mdash; is to ensure funds are made available for investment in the necessary packing facilities within growers' compounds. Buyers for the major multiples expect the same standards here as in the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union.  Should growers fail to match these standards they will lose business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give a cautious welcome to the arrival of Tesco in the Irish market.  At £13 billion, its turnover is three times that of the entire Irish retail <Col N="314" /> sector and 20 times larger than that of its nearest competitor.  It is of major concern that it is in a position to import stock overnight from the United Kingdom, placing jobs at risk.  It is critical that the Government extends the groceries order to cover horticultural produce to protect growers by banning the below cost selling of potatoes and carrots by the major multiples as an inducement to enter their stores.</P>
    <P>Tesco must be encouraged to retain Quinnsworth's existing Irish supplier base.  This is essential to ensure the continued development of the food industry which accounts for 40 per cent of all manufacturing turnover and 22 per cent of all manufacturing jobs.  The major multiples whose bottom line is profit are devoid of sentiment. We must keep this thought uppermost in our minds when meeting their representatives.</P>
    <P>Our nurseries, which are in need of promotion, have great potential.  Total exports last year were valued at £2 million.  I compliment An Bord Glas on doing an excellent job.  The North Western Health Board successfully promotes fruit and vegetables as being important for health but much more funding is needed to promote the health aspects of fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>Market research is very important.  The report indicates that multiples and single shops accounted for 58 per cent of vegetable sales.  The mushroom growers have had great success in exporting to the UK and must be complimented for it.  However, support must also be given to the other vegetable growers.</P>
    <P>The promotion of quality and hygiene is also important.  I am delighted that the ISO 9000 standard is promoted actively.  The hygiene quality mark is also important because consumers expect the highest possible standards at the best possible prices.</P>
    <P>An Bord Glas has done an effective job in co-ordinating marketing but the Minister of State should increase funding for this area if possible. It is important to encourage those in the west to go into alternative forms of farming to ensure that the erosion of the industry is stopped.</P>
    <P>Business development, in which I am involved, should be encouraged.  There should be a tax break for job creation.  There is very little help for the service industries.  I have always believed that a job is a job, whether in an accountant's office, a supermarket or in farming.  However, jobs in the service industry do not receive State aid at present.  The service sector is the main growth sector in the economy and the biggest job creator.  Another 50,000 jobs could be created in that sector and the Minister of State should seriously consider the matter.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> That is the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's time.</P>
      <P>The report of An Bord Glas states that the development and marketing of horticultural produce is consistent with and supports efforts to enhance the environment and it maintains that, unlike the situation in many other sectors of economic activity, there is little direct conflict in horticulture between production and the environment. Regrettably, that is no longer the case.</P>
      <P>I was surprised and disappointed that the Minister of State and the main spokespersons for the Labour Party and Fine Gael did not debate one of the conflicts with the environment which is emerging in the functional area encompassed by An Bord Glas.  I refer to the mortal danger that the genetic engineering of vegetables, fruit and plants poses to the environment, the future of the industry and the health of the population.  I listened to every contribution and only one Deputy, who was on the Government side, referred to the issue.</P>
      <P>It is outrageous that the Environmental Protection Agency and the previous Government allowed tests by the multinational company Monsanto on sugar beet to take place in this country with no public discussion on the merits and demerits of genetic engineering.</P>
      <P>One process of genetic engineering involves adding genes taken from, for example, microbes to a species of plant or fruit to make it resistant to weed killer or herbicide.  Genetically engineered plants take on their own life and replicate as genetically engineered crops.  Thus, we have an entirely new variety thrust into the ecosystem for the first time with potentially disastrous consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Genetically engineered plants can cross-fertilise with related plants, weeds and wild plants.  A 1994 study found that when ordinary natural potatoes were planted up to 1,100 metres from genetically engineered potatoes 72 per cent of the seeds from the natural crop contained the manipulated gene.  At greater distances 35 per cent of the natural crops' seed had the manipulated <Col N="316" /> gene.  Scientists at the Scottish Crop Research Institute have found that pollen from genetically engineered rapeseed fertilised plants up to two and a half kilometres away.</P>
    <P>The genetically engineered plants, such as those resistant to herbicide which were developed by Monsanto, will infect wild plants or weeds which will then emerge resistant to herbicide. What are the consequences on a macro scale for farming and horticulture?  Stronger herbicides? What about the effect of these herbicides on our ecosystems, ground water, lakes, rivers and seas? Another aspect of this process in the Monsanto trials was to give antibiotic properties to genetically engineered plants and fruit.  There is already a problem of resistance to antibiotics in the community and if this is carried into the food chain there may be horrific consequences of people becoming resistant to antibiotics.</P>
    <P>It has taken millions of years for living organisms, fruits and vegetables and the ecosystem in which they developed to evolve.  To attain a balance the ecosystem allows many species to coexist and to flourish.  Natural evolution takes millions of years.  It allows all organisms to emerge and to develop in balance with each other.  Changes in one are slow and allow other organisms to change.  However, genetic engineering may change in one or two years with unknown consequences which it took nature millennia to develop.</P>
    <P>Multinational companies are taking to themselves the power of a god, with no reference to the people and they are creating a Frankenstein. They must be stopped.  Driven by sheer greed, Monsanto develops herbicide resistant crops so that it can sell the herbicide it produces &mdash; Roundup &mdash; and the more seeds it sells, the more Roundup it sells and the more profits it makes. That is the only reason for its activity.  We have allowed this company, which has a criminal record, into the country.  It manufactured Agent Orange which defoliated millions of acres in Vietnam with horrendous consequences &mdash; 300,000 children suffered the most appalling deformities as a result.</P>
    <P>On 26 April this year two of Fianna Fáil's most senior Ministers, Deputy Joe Walsh and Deputy Dempsey, issued a joint statement about genetic engineering.  I could have written it myself.  I hope the Minister and An Bord Glas will examine that statement.  It said Fianna Fáil would not support what amounts to the largest nutritional experiment in human history with the consumer as a guinea pig.  It called for a moratorium on that experiment.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State a number of questions.  Will the Government soon begin an informed debate, both inside and outside the Dáil, on the genetic engineering of our plants and food?  Will the Government ban further field trials of genetically engineered plants?  Will it ban the sale of genetically engineered foodstuffs or derivatives in shops and supermarkets?  At a minimum, will the Government introduce compulsory <Col N="317" /> labelling of genetically engineered foodstuffs? An Bord Glas is an important organisation which is charged with the safety, security and development by eco-friendly means of our horticultural produce.  I ask the board to appoint research officers immediately who can study this matter, be part of the debate and inform society and the Government of the dangers involved.</P>
    <P>The State and An Bord Glas should put as much emphasis as possible on the development of organic farming and horticulture.  This country could set a headline by standing against the manipulation of science for greed and by developing this crucial industry on the basis of the needs of our people and the safeguarding of their health in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his new office.  I am keen to have continuing discussions with the Minister of State because there are many areas of interest in the report which I would like to discuss further.</P>
      <P>A matter raised on the Order of Business this morning sets the context of this debate.  It referred to the flight from the land and the Government's responsibility in that regard.  Previous Fianna Fáil Governments took this responsibility seriously and sought to maintain as many families as possible on the land.  I hope this Government will reintroduce that policy.  There are startling figures on this subject for every country in western Europe and we are now locked into Europe's future and its monetary system. In 1958, there were 400,000 farmers in the UK.  In 1989, there were 163,000 and that trend has accelerated.  Ireland is facing a similar trend. That should be taken into account in planning the development of horticulture because horticulture is potentially a major employer.</P>
      <P>I concur with the previous speaker's reference to the organic sector which has not, unfortunately, featured in our debate so far.  A salient point is made by the statistics for the application of fertiliser throughout the world.  In 1950, 14 million tonnes of fertiliser were applied to land. In 1989, that figure had increased to 143 million tonnes.  The Minister of State might claim that the trend will level out and then decrease but I believe vested interests are driving policy in the horticulture industry.  Reference was made to Monsanto but there are many other huge multinationals who have an interest in increasing our dependency on a monetary deal, from which they will benefit, to apply more chemicals to the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has overlooked an enormous opportunity to take a lead in organic farming. This is true in relation to genetically modified organisms also.  How many man hours are spent in the Department on the organic sector?  How many man hours per week are spent in Teagasc on this sector?  Horticulture is the poor relation to agriculture but organic farming is a poor relation of the poor relation.  The demand in other countries for organic produce should teach us that we have an opportunity to build on a sector <Col N="318" /> which has made a promising start but is not being encouraged to grow.</P>
    <P>The glasshouse sector in the Dublin North constituency is going through a terrible time.  In recent years a number of traditional farming families have gone to the wall and they were not helped by exchange rates a couple of years ago which benefited Spanish farmers.  Other EU Governments appear to be prepared to support the horticulture sector when necessary and I hope this Government learns from that.  The last Government did not.</P>
    <P>There is great demand from UK retailers for basic commodities such as carrots, onions and turnips from organic producers but they cannot get supplies.  Although An Bord Glas markets horticultural produce it must market organic produce separately, not because of a difference in standards but because the two markets are different and will grow and develop in different ways.  The products should not be lumped together and the consumer left to choose what is available.  If the Minister visited the Dublin Food Co-operative on a Saturday morning he would see how organic produce is in huge demand and sells immediately. People will travel long distances to buy such food. Often the demand is related to children's dietary needs or to the consumer's personal preference. It is a product that must be marketed separately by An Bord Glas in order to develop its potential.</P>
    <P>I welcome the effect of REPS over the past two years and the opportunity it offers farmers who wish to make the transition from conventional chemical-based farming to organic farming.  It is still not recognised how much more difficult it is for people involved in horticulture to make that transition than it is for people involved in, for example, livestock production.  In the horticulture sector there are standards which are more difficult to attain to qualify under REPS.  That must be recognised if we are serious about developing horticulture, particularly organic horticulture.  At this time the inspectors for the organic movement and its constituent organisations are being trained without assistance or funding, in stark contrast to conventional farming inspectors.  Training of those inspectors and of farmers interested in pursuing organic methods should be funded if we are serious about developing this sector, which has such potential for growth.</P>
    <P>The pharmaceutical industry has not always been a happy bedfellow with horticulture but the need for medical ingredients has led it to call for the growth of organic herbs in Ireland.  This is also a poor relation in the horticultural sphere and as a country with a clean image we could do well if we develop this area, which is not capitalintensive but is labour-intensive.  This brings me back to my original point about retaining people on the land.</P>
    <P>I have dealings with Teagasc, as the Kinsealy centre is in my constituency.  It is floundering because it needs a pathologist &mdash; it used to have three but it now has none, and the centre is winging it in terms of testing and meeting the needs <Col N="319" /> of the horticultural sector.  It is completely irresponsible of the Government to tolerate this.</P>
    <P>The move towards genetically-modified organisms was mentioned by the last speaker and I concur with everything he said.  Food irradiation will also be introduced here because of pressure from the United States Department of Agriculture, which has opened the floodgates.  I appeal to the Government to observe its counterparts in Austria, Luxembourg and Italy who are lobbying not to allow genetically modified organisms, conscious not only of the scientific but of the marketing impact.  The consumer is extremely unhappy about tampering with food and if the Government does not take this into account and introduce legislation requiring labelling for irradiated food ingredients and genetically modified organisms, we will face a similar crisis.  It will be reminiscent of the BSE crisis in that we will be helpless because we were linked too closely with what is called the mainstream, even though as an island nation we have the opportunity to have a completely clean and thus profitable and employment friendly horticulture.</P>
    <P>I raised on the Order of Business a matter which came to my attention through an article in <i>The Big Issues</i> magazine entitled &ldquo;New Legislation for Herbal Remedies&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach said this was a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Food; if so, I wish to know more than was printed in the article.  The journalist discovered that vitamins, minerals and herbs are now legal medicines under new legislation which prohibits retailers from providing their customers even with medical tips about herbal remedies. One will now need a licence for items like garlic, according to this article.  This raises questions which the Minister should clarify.  The journalist also states that the Department plans to prescribe alternative health supplements &mdash; in other words basic preventive health care which has been practised and been found to be a way to avoid high medical costs must be prescribed while paracetamol and its like can be sold at the sweet counter at supermarkets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise the issue of British Army lookout towers which has been a major irritant along the Armagh/Louth Border for many years.  In the context of the ongoing peace talks and the ceasefire, many people North and South are anxious that consideration be given to commencing <Col N="320" /> to dismantle those posts.  There are a significant number of posts along the Border and apart from their serious impact on the beautiful landscape of south Armagh a number of more practical considerations must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I visited a number of these posts to see the impact they have had on farm fences.  There has been a serious breakdown in stock-proofing, which is happening cheek by jowl with outbreaks of TB and other diseases among the national herd.  Our Department of Agriculture and Food, in common with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, advise that stock-proof fences are the first requisite for ensuring that some degree of control might be exercised on the spread of TB.</P>
      <P>The very presence of the lookout posts is symbolic of the domination of the local community. Many of them are quite close to the Border, the closest being near Crossmaglen.  The local people are anxious that the posts be removed, as was shown at a public meeting last Sunday.  It is mainly farmers who are affected by the posts.  If the Northern Ireland Office considered indicating that the posts would be dismantled or announced a date for beginning that work, it would do wonders for community relations in the area and would be a significant gesture in the context of the ongoing peace talks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this important issue and I assure him that the Department of Foreign Affairs, through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference has, on a regular basis, raised the impact of these conspicuous military installations in south Armagh and the attitude of the local communities to their presence, that is, the farming community and the gnáth daoine who have an interest in the matter.  Clearly the context in which these discussions have taken place has changed significantly with the restoration of the IRA ceasefire. The overall security situation, given that restoration and the continuing loyalist ceasefire, now offers enormous potential for significant changes in the manner in which the security forces in Northern Ireland operate, and also in the long-term future of the facilities they use in support of their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kirk will recall that, in establishing the International Body in November 1995 to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue, both Governments reaffirmed their willingness to continue to take responsive measures, advised by their respective security authorities, as the security threat reduced.  Such responsive measures can contribute in a most important way to confidence-building and to the creation of an enhanced climate of trust.  The reduction in the profile of the security forces generally, for instance by dismantling installations such as observation towers, would represent a visible, very meaningful expression of the new climate of peace now obtaining in Northern <Col N="321" /> Ireland and could only be conducive to creating an even better climate for the talks process.</P>
    <P>I am very well aware of the depth of feeling within the communities on both sides of the Border with regard to these installations.  It was reflected in the recent rally organised by the South Armagh Farmers' and Residents' Committee. Concerns have been expressed consistently by my Department over the years about the intrusion of these wretched towers, the related fear of the invasion of privacy and the possible health risks arising from surveillance equipment. It is important the feelings of the community are brought home to the two Governments.  This Government is well aware of the problems the Deputy has raised.  I pay the warmest tribute to him for his work in that regard.</P>
    <P>I anticipate this matter might well arise as part of the discussions of the special Subcommittee on Confidence Building Measures established as part of the talks process.  I would certainly welcome such a discussion within that important committee. I reassure the Deputy I and my Department, through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, are actively pursuing, and will continue to pursue, this issue in coming months with a view to ensuring that such installations and the military activities associated with them are de-escalated in line with the new security position.  In addition I ask the Deputy to continue to remind me of this significant matter warranting urgent attention.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Death Penalty.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As all Members will know, quite an amount of public attention was devoted to the application of the death penalty in Missouri, United States to the late Mr. Alan J. Bannister who was executed by lethal injection there yesterday morning.</P>
      <P>If we look at the overall use of the death penalty throughout the civilised world and in places where for one reason or another, we have come to expect its application, its continued use there, to the extent it is, is a reflection on all of us.</P>
      <P>My reason for raising this issue this afternoon is to ensure that our Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs, within the international arena, voices our abhorrence at its continued use, at the same time pointing out that the death penalty, in this case, is a reaction 15 years after the event which led to its application.  While not wishing to comment on that event itself &mdash; obviously the perpetrator of a crime is entitled to pay a price of one kind or another &mdash; spending 15 years on death row is a price in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next issue is when society decides to exact the maximum penalty in much the same way as was done in the days of the French Revolution when somebody decided to devise a humane form of killing, the guillotine, which as we all know was not at all as humane as it appeared at the time. That guillotine proposal in the course of the French Revolution was an attempt to assuage the <Col N="322" /> feelings of the French community of the day, to satisfy them that this constituted the ultimate method of dealing with the problem in a humane way.</P>
    <P>If we are to become the civilised people we think we are, it behoves us all, particularly people in countries like ours that abolished the death penalty many years ago, who have a role to play within the international arena, to bring our abhorrence of this continued practice to the attention of those so-called very civilised countries who continue to resort to that extreme method of punishment.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister to use all the means at his disposal, not only in relation to the United States but to other jurisdictions which continue to use that ultimate weapon to deal with crime, to dissuade them from continuing this practice.  It does nothing to address victims' problems or for society.  It merely indicts society for doing the same thing it accused the criminal of doing in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this important issue this afternoon.  It is also opportune that I express my deep concern about the continued use of the death penalty as an instrument of judicial punishment.  I share his disquiet and no doubt that of many other Members and of the Irish people about the execution by lethal injection of Mr. Alan J. Bannister in Missouri yesterday morning.  This is not the time to enter into a discussion of the complex legal issues surrounding his case.  However, the human factors lying at the heart of the debate on capital punishment were laid before the country on radio in a very real way yesterday morning when RTÉ broadcast a taped conversation between Mr. Pat Kenny and the condemned individual which I understand was a disturbing experience for all who heard it.  I did not have an opportunity of listening but am anxious to obtain a tape of the conversation and reflect on its contents.</P>
      <P>It is opportune to restate the Government's total opposition to the use of the death penalty. As Deputy Durkan is probably aware, the death penalty has not been carried out in this country since 1954 and, ten years later, capital punishment was abolished for all but a very limited number of offences.  Ireland formally abolished the death penalty for all offences, whether civil or military, in 1990 with the passage of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990.  During the relevant debate in the House the then Minister for Justice, in eliminating the measure from our Statue Book stated:</P>
      <P>We will, as a society, signal our concern for the dignity and sanctity of human life and strengthen our standing internationally as a country concerned to promote human rights and civilised values.</P>
      <P>All of us would agree with those sentiments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aware of the international human rights dimension to this question, Ireland became a party to the Second Optional Protocol to the <Col N="323" /> International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1993 and to Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms the following year, both of which instruments provide for the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
    <P>As a country we avail of every opportunity to press for the abolition of the death penalty both within the United Nations and Council of Europe mechanisms.  In such international fora Ireland views this issue from a human rights perspective and lays stress on the need to protect that most fundamental of human rights, the right to life.  It is our firm belief the State has a duty to safeguard that right.  Therefore, all steps which assist in the abolition of capital punishment are to be welcomed as contributing to greater respect for and protection of human rights.</P>
    <P>The abolition of capital punishment in all countries worldwide would represent a major step toward full and universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Therefore, the carrying out of executions is deeply regretted by the Government and, I believe, by the Irish people on two levels; obviously on the personal level for those subjected to this ultimate punishment, but also as a setback for that goal of universal respect for human rights.  Such executions display a deep lack of respect for the dignity of human life.</P>
    <P>Given this perspective, it is not surprising that Ireland gave strong backing at the UN General Assembly in 1994 to an Italian resolution which called for the abolition of the death penalty.  That resolution also called for a moratorium on pending executions &ldquo;with a view to ensuring that the principle that no State should dispose of the life of any human being be affirmed in every part of the world by the year 2000&rdquo;.  We wholeheartedly support the sentiments expressed in that resolution but, despite the best efforts of our own delegation and other supportive delegations, it was defeated following a heated debate in the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly.</P>
    <P>On a more positive note, Ireland worked closely with a number of other Governments in preparing the resolution on the abolition of the death penalty which was adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights at its 53rd session on 3 April 1997.  Again, that resolution was tabled by the Italian delegation.  It calls on states which use the death penalty and which are party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to consider ratifying the Second Optional Protocol which is aimed at abolition of the death penalty.  It further urges such states to respect safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty and reiterates its conviction that the abolition would contribute both to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
    <P>During the debate on this item our delegation made clear Ireland's fundamental opposition to the use of the death penalty in any circumstances <Col N="324" /> and called upon all states to cease immediately applying the death penalty.  In particular, we laid emphasis on our belief that the death penalty is a human rights issue and is thus a matter of legitimate concern to the international community in line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the World Conference on Human Rights in l993.  I understand that the resolution which was adopted enjoyed widespread geographic support and was the first such resolution adopted by the commission for many years. Ireland played a major role in this significant endeavour.</P>
    <P>At its 53rd session, the Commission on Human Rights decided to continue consideration of the issue at its next session which will take place in the spring of l998.  I assure the House and the Deputy that Ireland will continue to take a strong position on the question of abolishing capital punishment at that session.  It is through the process of persuasion, not confrontation, that I hope we will soon be able to convince those states who do not share our views to change their minds on this issue.  Through such dialogue at an international level we look forward to the day when actions such as that in Missouri yesterday morning will become a thing of a darker and less humane past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue and I also thank the Minister of State for coming to reply to it. This matter is literally of vital interest to the people of Naas.</P>
      <P>In 1991, a sewerage pipe ruptured and the raw sewage from that pipe ran directly into a well supplying the town of Naas.  This resulted in over 4,000 men, women and children being poisoned with e-coli bacteria and suffering various levels of disability and illness.  Some people developed chronic gastroenteritis and the only compensation offered to those affected was reduced water charges.</P>
      <P>Since then, major management changes were made, an emergency plan was developed and the water source at Sunday's Well, Naas, was closed down.  The public was assured that this could never happen again.  Last Tuesday, it did happen again.  Sewage has again contaminated the water supply of Naas town and the surrounding areas. The bacterium e-coli was detected during routine sampling by the Eastern Health Board in what should be a sealed water supply for human consumption from a reservoir in Bowdenstown to the homes of the residents of Naas.  In fairness to the health boards and the local authorities they have taken corrective action with all due haste and, I hope, effectiveness.  Pipes have been flushed out, extra chlorine has been added to kill the bacteria and the public has been notified.  Preliminary tests to date have shown an absence of sewage or e-coli.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> The people of Naas were assured in 1991 that sewage contamination of their water supply would not be possible in future.  The authorities, health and local government, have not lived up to that assurance and the potential for widespread infection of large numbers of people with e-coli is again a reality in Naas.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister inform the House on the source of the contamination and where and how it occurred?  Has the contamination ceased and will he give an assurance that there will be no further contamination of the Naas water supply? Given that this is the second occasion major pollution of drinking water has occurred in Naas, will the Minister now hold an inquiry into the reasons for it, devise a regime to prevent a recurrence and examine how those infected and damaged might be rightly compensated?</P>
    <P>I am also mindful, and I am sure the Minister is aware, that water supplies to the town of Castledermot were polluted with cattle slurry last week.  Action is now required by central Government as it is obvious that the local authorities have failed in their duty to their citizens to provide a wholesome and safe supply of drinking water.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I am advised by the Eastern Health Board, which carries out routine testing of the public water supply to Naas for the urban council, that two routine samples showed a very low level of coliform and e-coli. Further testing of the supply to the town confirmed this.  The county council and urban council were advised of the results and standard precautionary procedures were implemented.</P>
      <P>The health board and the county council are concentrating their investigations on the supply to the town from the Ballymore Eustace area to identify and eliminate the cause of the contamination. As a precautionary measure, public notices were issued to boil water before use. Water supplies to Naas are brought into the town through two pipes and the low level of contamination detected was found in one of these. Further testing of samples from the town and the immediate area is continuing and the latest results from samples taken show the system to be clear.</P>
      <P>The health board is in regular contact with the council regarding possible public health risk and will advise on any further appropriate measures necessary to protect public health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to respond to my questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his recommendations in Chapter 16 of the report into the affairs of the BTSB, Mr. Justice Finlay made two specific recommendations to <Col N="326" /> which I want to refer.  He said that those elements of the development plan for the Blood Transfusion Service Board should be undertaken immediately and completed before the target date of 1999.  He then went on specifically to recommend the following: &ldquo;Appropriate renewal of the premises and equipment in the Cork unit, whether by major overhaul and reconstruction or by the provision of new premises, should also be immediately commenced&rdquo;.  Mr. Justice Finlay went on to make various recommendations in relation to the Irish Medicines Board about its capacity and duty to inspect the premises of the BTSB and to carry out regular inspections.  The Minister of State will recall that it was the failure of the predecessor of the Irish Medicines Board to carry out some inspections which was partly responsible for the fact that we did not earlier become aware of some of the difficulties being experienced in the BTSB.</P>
    <P>In his response to the tribunal report on 20 March last, the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, committed the Government to completing the development plan before the target date of 1999. He stated: &ldquo;Likewise the renewal or replacement of the BTSB unit in Cork will be commenced immediately&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am informed that on 7 or 8 October last, the Cork unit of the BTSB was informed by the Irish Medicines Board, following an inspection, that it would not be in a position to renew its licence. I understand the Cork unit supplies most of the hospitals in the Munster area as well as providing a backup service in the event that the Dublin service cannot provide the appropriate services required.  I understand the Cork unit has a substantial donor base.  The unit employs approximately 100 people but it has long been accepted that the accommodation being provided for the service in Cork is less than adequate.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister assure me that this money will be provided to ensure that the unit in Cork does not have to be closed?  My understanding is that no money has been provided in the 1997 Estimates. Will the Minister assure the House either that a Supplementary Estimate will be brought forward immediately or that the money will be provided in the 1998 Estimates, specifically and most urgently for the unit in Cork but also for the completion of the programme as a whole?</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to assure me he is committed to continuing the decentralised service as well as continuing it separately in Cork. Surveys of experience abroad suggest that if one closes an immediately convenient service one cannot hope to replace the same donor base, in this case, for example, in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to restate the commitment given by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, to fund and complete the development plan before the target date of 1999.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, advised the House in response to a parliamentary question on 9 October on matters relating to the Cork centre of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The Irish Medicines Board has issued a manufacturer's licence to the Blood Transfusion Service Board to cover the period from 2 October 1997 to 30 November 1997.</P>
    <P>Certain conditions have been attached to the issue of this licence beyond that period.  In particular, the Blood Transfusion Service Board has been asked to submit plans and specify a timescale for the upgrading of the BTSB Cork centre. The development plan for the Blood Transfusion Service Board provides for major reorganisation and redevelopment of the service to ensure that it is in a position to meet international standards in transfusion medicine.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in implementing key elements of this plan.  Specifically as regards the Cork centre, I am advised that the Blood Transfusion Service Board is fully committed to ensuring that it continues to meet standards of good manufacturing practice as required by the Irish Medicines Board.  Officers of the Department, the BTSB and the Irish Medicines Board are to meet on Wednesday next, 29 October, to agree a refurbishment programme in respect of the Cork centre.</P>
    <P>Over and above this exercise, an option appraisal is required to assess whether the appropriate renewal of the Cork centre should be by way of major overhaul and replacement of existing <Col N="328" /> buildings or by the provision of new premises at a different site.  Such an appraisal will commence in a matter of weeks.  Commencement of the more immediate refurbishment works will begin immediately following agreement with the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that investment in the BTSB, Cork will be made as required.  The precise nature of the work to be undertaken and the timescale involved is being drawn up by the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the Irish Medicines Board.  The agreed programme of work will be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference for the option appraisal will involve consideration of the following: the appropriateness of the current site for necessary developments; the availability and suitability of a new site; whether the Cork centre should ideally be located on the grounds of a teaching hospital; and whether a donor clinic should be attached to the new premises or on a different site.</P>
    <P>Staff at the BTSB Cork centre have been informed regarding its future development.  Full details of the reply of the Minister for Health and Children were communicated to the BTSB and staff at the centre were informed accordingly.</P>
    <P>I wish to reassure the House that the Blood Transfusion Service Board is fully committed to developing the centre to ensure that it fully complies with requirements as laid down by the Irish Medicines Board.  The necessary resources will be made available to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 November 1997.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy means the Caretaker Board of the National Museum of Ireland chaired by Ms Barbara Nugent which was established by my predecessor with the approval of the previous Government in 1995.  The National Museum of Ireland is an institution that currently functions within and as an integral part of my Department.  Within this context the caretaker board does not operate as an entirely separate entity with final executive authority.  The caretaker board is charged to oversee and guide the development of the museum (particularly in relation to the capital projects at Collins Barracks), to operate, as far as <Col N="330" /> possible, the functions assigned to the statutory board of the museum to be established under the recently enacted National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, to prepare the way for the transition of the museum to autonomous status and to examine policy and other operational matters affecting the museum as they arise.</P>
      <P>I have no immediate plans to restructure the caretaker board which I am pleased to say has operated very well since its inception and which has been especially helpful to me during the difficult period experienced in the Museum in recent times.</P>
      <P>The caretaker board is distinct from the Board of Visitors for the National Museum which has been in existence since the 19th century.  The Board of Visitors emanates from a formal agreement made in 1881 between the then Department of Science and Art and the Royal Dublin Society. There is no overlap of functions with the caretaker board as the function of the Board of Visitors is limited to making regular reports on the state of the museum's collections.</P>

      <P>Seals are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and it is an offence to hunt or kill them, except under a licence or permission granted by me under the <Col N="331" /> Act.  No official seal cull has been carried out since the Wildlife Act, 1976, came into force and I have no proposals to carry out a controlled seal cull on the west coast.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the impact which seals can have on the catch and nets of fishermen.  Section 42 of the Wildlife Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that where damage is being caused by a protected wild animal (in this case, seals) to a fishery, the Minister may cause to be taken, by a person authorised by her, such steps, including the killing of protected wild animals, to stop the damage.  Permissions issued under section 42 of the Act provide for the shooting of seals within 100 metres of the nets which are subject to damage.  Permits are issued in response to specific applications and each application is considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>A study is currently under way on the distribution and migration patterns of seals in Irish waters.  This project, which is jointly funded by my Department, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and BIM, will provide data on seal populations. The study, which is due for completion in 1998, will enable us to assess and quantify more accurately seal populations in Irish waters and their possible impact on fish stocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Museum of Modern Art which is located in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, opened to the public in 1991.  Its remit is to provide the Irish public with access to the best Irish and international visual art through exhibition, collection and education programmes.  The aim is to foster within society an awareness, understanding and participation in the visual arts through structures and programmes which are both innovative and inclusive.</P>
      <P>The Irish Museum of Modern Art presents up to 20 temporary exhibitions a year with selections of work from the permanent collection also regularly on show.  Exhibitions from the museum regularly go on tour to other galleries and art centres throughout the country; 100,000 people attended the museum in its first year of operation in 1991 while the number of visitors in 1996 has grown to over 330,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial Government funding (both current and capital) has been provided to the Irish Museum of Modern Art since its opening.  Such funding was provided initially through the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach and subsequently through the Vote of my Department <Col N="332" /> since its establishment in 1993.  Details of the total departmental funding provided to the museum between the years 1991-97 are as follows: in the start-up year of 1991 the grant-in-aid was £1.55 million.  In 1992 the figure was £1.102 million. Since the establishment of my Department the grant-in-aid has increased from £1.161 million in 1993 to £1.515 million in 1997, a 34 per cent increase in funding over the five year period. Since 1993 funding through the Office of Public Works for minor capital and maintenance works at the museum amounting to £250,000 per annum has also been provided.</P>
    <P>In addition significant capital works have been undertaken by the Office of Public Works, both initially to fit out the Royal Hospital for the museum and subsequently to develop artists' studios in the coachhouse.  In addition the museum is also enabled to avail of a tax relief provision which is designed to encourage donations of heritage works of art to our core collecting institutions. Through this measure the Irish Museum of Modern Art has received an important donation of significant art works from the art collector Vincent Ferguson valued at £132,000.</P>
    <P>In a relatively short time the museum has taken its place in the national and international &ldquo;family&rdquo; of art museums and as a direct result has been able to negotiate important loans of artworks from key museums.</P>
    <P>In assessing the work of the museum over its first five years it is reasonable to say that the Board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art has more than met initial projections in terms of creating audience access, engagement and participation in the visual art and has developed a dynamic public space both in the Royal Hospital and throughout the country in its regional work. I am aware that the board is currently reviewing its progress in the light of its achievements in the first five years and that it is formulating strategies for charting the course of the museum for the years ahead.  As such regular reviews are always desirable in the ongoing process of renewal I would like to commend the board for this work. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the work of the board, both the members of the current board and of the first board, and the dedicated effort of the Director and staff who have made this project the success it is.</P>
    <P>Apart from the ongoing development of the Irish Museum of Modern Art as a living and vibrant institution a number of important buildings have been or are being adapted for public use.  There has been the restoration and adaptation of old coach houses as studio and educational workshops spaces which I have already referred to.  Two buildings will shortly be ready to cater for artists with disabilities.  A building known as the Deputy Master's House is being developed at a total cost of £1.5 million, of which £600,000 is being sourced from EU funds under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99. This will open in early 1999 as a series of climate <Col N="333" /> controlled galleries enabling important but fragile artworks to be put on long-term display.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that all of these developments augur well for the future of this important cultural institution.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 53 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, I have had meetings with both the IFA and the ICMSA in relation to special areas of conservation (SACs) and other natural heritage issues.  I intend, in the near future, to meet other conservation bodies to further progress the level of partnership on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the fundamental objectives of the EU Habitats Directive and our most important natural areas should be protected.  In that context I am committed to implementing the Directive's provisions.  I also believe, of course, that those <Col N="334" /> who suffer loss because of conservation restrictions are entitled to fair compensation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that to date a large number of meetings have been held with relevant groups, representing landowners-users and other interests, to explain the special areas of conservation process.  These have proved to be beneficial and similar meetings continue to be held.  However, while I was in Opposition, I was very conscious that notwithstanding the meetings and briefings that were taking place, the SAC message was still not getting through, and that events that would profoundly influence the lives of many people were felt to be taking place a world away from them.</P>
    <P>I am currently assessing all aspects of the implementation process in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;An Action Programme for The Millennium&rdquo; in order to ensure that the SACs are put in place with the full involvement of all participants in a spirit of real partnership.</P>
    <P>I intend in the near future to put in place improved arrangements for local liaison and involvement.  I will be placing considerable emphasis on the role of the national liaison committee whereby at regular intervals my officials, with those of the Department of Agriculture and Food, meet farming organisations to discuss issues arising in the context of the day to day operation of the SAC process, and to achieve smooth and efficient resolution of any difficulties that may arise.</P>
    <P>Similar liaison arrangements exist between my Department and other conservation bodies.  As the need arises meetings on more specific issues or concerning individual sites take place between local officers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department and those affected by SAC designation proposals in their areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 30 together.  During a meeting which I had recently with the chairperson and artistic director of the National Theatre Society Limited, the question of a voluntary severance package and the capital development needs of the Abbey Theatre were raised.  I explained at the meeting that, with regard to the voluntary severance package, I was awaiting the recommendations of An Chomhairle Ealaíon in the matter. As for the question of the capital development programme for the theatre, I did express my preference for the retention of the Theatre at its current site in Lower Abbey Street, Dublin. However, no costings were discussed at the meeting since at this stage there are no funds at my disposal to fund a capital development programme for the theatre.  All the capital funding which is at my disposal under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 &mdash; in respect of the national cultural institutions of the State and the Cultural Development Incentives Scheme &mdash; has by now been allocated.</P>
      <P>I have received a request from the Secretary of the Players' Council of the Abbey Theatre to meet me on the subject of a voluntary severance settlement for the company of actors and while I have been unable to meet the council to date.  I will do so shortly.  In this regard, I should point out that my Department was involved in tripartite discussions with An Chomhairle Ealaíon/the Arts Council and the National Theatre Society Limited some time ago on matters of common concern. During these discussions, the question of a voluntary severance package for the society's permanent company was raised.  It was agreed that the society would develop such a proposal and submit it to An Chomhairle Ealaíon in the first instance.  An Chomhairle would consider the proposal and recommend a course of action to my Department, which would respond to An Chomhairle's views.  Any voluntary severance package would require the sanction of the Department of Finance as to its terms and costs. The proposals of the National Theatre Society Ltd.  on a voluntary severance package have been submitted to An Chomhairle and copied to me as a courtesy.  I am awaiting An Chomhairle's recommendations in the matter.</P>

In this context, the Deputy will note that this project was signalled as a project for funding under the terms of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 and £7.5 million in European funds from this programme has been earmarked towards the construction of this extension, with the remainder to be provided through private funding.</P>
      <P>The Board of Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery of Ireland have primary responsibility for all aspects of this project, including decisions regarding the purchase of lands, the terms of reference for the award of the architectural competition, the design brief and planning application involved.</P>
      <P>The board lodged a planning application with Dublin Corporation, in respect of this major extension to its existing premises.  I understand that while planning approval has been granted by Dublin Corporation, an appeal against this decision has been lodged by third parties with An Bord Pleanála in the matter.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any specific aspect of the proposed development.</P>

      <P>On 4 June last a Film Co-Production Agreement between Ireland and Australia was initialled in Dublin by my predecessor and the Ambassador of Australia.  This procedure signalled the satisfactory conclusion of negotiations between the two countries on the facilitation of film co-productions.  The final steps to formal ratification of the agreement are now being taken by the Australian and Irish authorities. I anticipate that the agreement will be ratified by early next year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, administrative arrangements were put in place earlier this year between Ireland and Australia to facilitate an AustralianIrish co-production, in respect of which the Irish element of the filming took place during the summer in Achill, County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council of Europe's European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production is under active consideration by me as a possible instrument to facilitate co-productions with member <Col N="337" /> states of the Council of Europe, thereby perhaps avoiding the need having regard to staff resources, to negotiate a multiplicity of bilateral co-production agreements.</P>
    <P>Bilateral contacts have in the past been made with France and Israel regarding the question of establishing co-production agreements with those states, but there have not been any recent developments in this regard.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to expand further the substantial level of support already being given to the Hunt Museum by my Department.  A sum in excess of £1.1 million was provided by my Department in the form of EU related Structural and Exchequer funds in addition to that substantial assistance provided by other agencies to help convert the Custom House, Limerick, to house the Hunt Museum.  The proposers of the Hunt Museum project put forward the project on the basis that it would be self-sustaining after the initial start-up phase.  Accordingly a commitment was given to provide an annual grant for a period of five years of not more than £100,000 at 1995 prices to help the museum in its first operational phase on the understanding that after an initial period of five years the Hunt Museum would then be self-supporting. This situation will be reviewed in due course in the light of the experience of the actual operation of the museum which was opened to the public earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Apart from the ongoing aid being provided to the Hunt Museum by way of direct grant the recently enacted National Cultural Institutions Act provides that the Hunt Museum may avail of an indemnity provision under the Act in respect of exhibitions originating from outside the State. I am anxious to explore how this option may be exploited in the future and hope that this provision may be utilised by the Hunt Museum to develop a comprehensive programme of specialist exhibitions thereby enhancing the standing of the Hunt Museum as an important cultural institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the museum is already putting in place a sustainable operation with over 20,000 paying customers in the first seven months of operation and that in addition there have been considerable moneys collected by way of voluntary donations other than in the form of admission charges.  I understand that valuable links are being and have been forged with the local community and educational programmes are being developed.  I am pleased to say that on the basis of the foregoing the Hunt Museum would appear to be well into the process of becoming a major <Col N="338" /> cultural force in the Limerick region thus justifying the faith of the Hunt family who made the very generous donations of the core collections that have made the Hunt Museum a living reality.</P>

      <P>Under Phase II of the Cultural Development Incentives Scheme, which my Department is administering under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, an offer of grant assistance to an absolute maximum sum of £650,000 was made on 27 February 1997 towards the cost of developing the Tipperary Excel Arts Centre project in Tipperary Town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Tipperary Excel project is one of 39 projects to which offers, in principle, of funding were made under both phases of the Cultural Development Incentives Scheme (CDIS), The level of interest in this scheme was such that it was possible to offer funding to only a small number of the groups who applied for assistance and, in the vast majority of cases, the funding offers made were considerably less than the grant sought.  Nevertheless, all of the groups that were offered funding declared that they were able and willing to take up the offers <Col N="339" /> made and to develop the projects as outlined in their proposals.</P>
    <P>My Department has been obliged, in order to ensure the successful operation of the scheme, to seek certain guarantees from each project promoter in relation to issues such as:&mdash;</P>
    <P>the availability of matching funding to ensure the satisfactory completion of the project within the time frame of the Operational Programme;</P>
    <P>the availability of funding to cover subsequent running and maintenance costs of the facility;</P>
    <P>the continued use of the facility as a centre for cultural activity.</P>
    <P>In relation to Tipperary Excel.  I am aware that the promoters are experiencing difficulties in putting together a viable financial package.  I have been in communication with the promoters over the last number of months and have made it clear to them that there are no additional funds available to me under the CDIS, or any other source, to allocate to this project.</P>
    <P>My offer of grant assistance of £650,000 stands, but it is subject to the promoters being able to present a viable financial and development plan by the notified deadline of 24 October 1997.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my written reply to Question No. 212 of 7 October 1997 regarding reception of Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>At present, Teilifís na Gaeilge operates as an RTE service under the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1993.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, RTE was given responsibility by Government of constructing the technical infrastructure necessary for the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a separate national service and, pending the establishment of separate legal structures for Teilifís na Gaeilge, of assuming responsibility for staff, programmes and operation of the service.  Accordingly, the issue raised by the Deputy is the day to day responsibility of the RTE Authority on the advice of Comhairle Theilifís na Gaeilge and I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
      <P>However, in accordance with long-standing custom, I am prepared to furnish to the House information supplied by RTE in response to questions relating specifically to improvements in reception of national broadcasting services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE informs me that Teilifís na Gaeilge is available to more than 95 per cent of the population <Col N="340" /> on the UHF Band.  RTE estimates that about three quarters of the population can receive that service using their existing receive equipment and that some 20 per cent would require a new UHF aerial if they wish to receive service.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that one of the functions of An Chomhairle Ealaíon &mdash; the Arts Council is to promote the practice of the arts.  Operating independently under the Arts Acts, 1951 and 1973, and with an allocation of £20.834 million available to it in 1997 to fund its operations, An Chomhairle carries out its work in this regard autonomously through a wide range of policies and programmes which, among other matters, are designed to provide financial assistance and other support services for individual artists.  Support for the individual arts practitioner is, therefore, one of the fundamental elements of the work of An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  An Chomhairle discharges its responsibilities in this regard through the various bursary and award schemes it operates for artists in such disciplines as the visual arts, music, drama, literature and film, and also through the operation of the Aosdána scheme, which provides to its qualifying members an annual payment or <i>cnuas</i> of the order of £8,720 to allow them to concentrate full-time on their work.  In addition, and uniquely, the Irish Government does not levy income tax on the earnings of individual artists from their creative work.  I believe the above information clearly demonstrates the State's high level of commitment to the individual arts practitioner through the forgoing of income tax by the Revenue Commissioners and through the provision of direct financial assistance by An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be pleased to note that I have agreed to meet a delegation from the Association of Artists in Ireland on 4 November next to discuss a number of issues which are of concern to that organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I had the honour of officiating at the official opening of the National Museum at Collins Barracks, an event also attended by the Minister of State at my Department, and by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the criticism that there has been a failure to make proper preparations for the opening of the new National Museum of Ireland facility.  The staff of the National Museum, the Office of Public Works and my Department, with the co-operation of the Army, have been engaged over the past four years in continuous and detailed planning and preparation for the opening of this facility.</P>
      <P>The first phase of this major development opened on 18 September last.  The restoration of the magnificent Clarke Square is now complete and it represents the centrepiece of the barracks and the focal point for visitors with its remodelled arches, exhibition galleries and visitor facilities. To date, over 20,000 visitors have attended the new facility and the response from the public has been extremely positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies should be aware that the new museum has now opened with a series of contemporary and innovative exhibitions, a museum café and gift shop, a community room and audio-visual <Col N="343" /> theatre.  Up to thirty new members of staff were also employed recently for the new museum including attendants, sales assistants and tour guides.</P>
    <P>Due to the industrial dispute, I accept that some exhibitions remain incomplete.  However, the number of exhibits involved is relatively small.  The new museum has on display hundreds of artefacts ranging from ceramics and glassware, silver and furniture to costume and folklife many of which have never been seen before.  The exhibition galleries have been completely fitted out with new state of the art display cases and lighting and the use of interactive multi-media computers greatly assists in the enhancement of the visitor experience.</P>
    <P>To place in context the number of exhibits which are now on display in Collins Barracks, the Deputy should be aware that a series of exhibitions have been developed over three floors of two blocks of Clarke Square.  It is estimated that the average amount of time spent by visitors in the exhibitions ranges from one to three hours.</P>
    <P>I stress that on my appointment as Minister, I inherited a situation of industrial action among the professional and technical grades in the National Museum.  There is a compelling need to resolve this industrial dispute.  The National Museum is at a key point in its development, with the recent opening to the public of phase 1 of the Collins Barracks project.  It is my earnest wish that a practical solution to the dispute is reached in order that the National Museum is in a position to tackle the many challenges that lie ahead at this key time in its development.  Like all Ministers, however, I am required to consider all claims for promotions and additional staff within my Department in the context of the wider public sector pay and staff numbers policy, and this dispute can only be resolved within that framework.</P>

      <P>The corncrake grants scheme, operated by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, is jointly funded by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.  Since 1992 this scheme has received State funding through the NPWS amounting to £269,000, including a grant of £64,000 in the current year. The Irish Wildbird Conservancy has advised that a total of 148 singing males were recorded in 1997, a reduction of some 20 per cent on the number, 184, recorded in 1996, and a reduction of almost 15 per cent on the number, 174, recorded in 1995.  The figures are disappointing and do not adequately reflect the resources and commitment to the scheme of the project partners &mdash; the NPWS, the RSPB and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy.</P>
      <P>While the corncrake grants scheme has proved to be a valuable interim conservation scheme for the corncrake, the project partners have agreed that the future strategy for corncrake conservation will be based largely on SAC compensation measures operated through the rural environment protection scheme, managed by the Department of Agriculture and Food, and by my own Department.  Under these measures and subject to EU approval, participating landowners can attract grants of up to £77 per acre for up to 100 acres, with lower rates thereafter, for farming in an environmentally-friendly way.  Discussions are well advanced with conservationists, farmers' representatives, the Department of Agriculture and Food and farm planners under the REP scheme, to agree an appropriate prescription for corncrake-friendly farming.  The measures principally relate to dates of closing of meadows, dates of cutting hay and silage and mowing from the centre out.  Further discussions are planned between the corncrake conservation scheme partners to monitor progress and to adopt a detailed strategy for corncrake conservation in 1998.  This, together with the purchase and lease back of corncrake habitat by the NPWS for management in a corncrake-friendly way, will provide a solid conservation strategy for the corncrake in Ireland and reflects the deep commitment of all parties to the conservation of this important species.</P>

      <P>I understand that site SMR 5:11 has never been delisted.</P>
      <P>The sites and monuments record for County Wicklow was first produced in 1986.  This SMR was a paper survey of all known or suspected archaeological sites in the country which were identified on the basis of old maps, aerial photographs and other documentary sources.  Sites however can only be confirmed from field inspections and the SMR has been updated on the basis of such fieldwork to become the record of monuments and place established under the terms of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994.  It is these updated records which afford legal protection to all sites included in them.</P>
      <P>While site SMR 5:11 was included as part of the SMR for County Wicklow, subsequent field inspections identified it as being a dried-up pond. Its greater dimensions measure some 45 metres by 30 metres.  Most experts determine the Rathturtle Moat, an adjoining important archaeological site, to be of Anglo-Norman or Viking origin. Nevertheless there remains a possibility that the Rathturtle site is prehistoric in origin.  Wetland or pond areas containing archaeological artefacts have been located near a small number of prehistoric ritual sites.  To cover the remote possibility that SMR 5:11 could contain archaeological artefacts it was decided to include it in the RMP.  The National Monuments and Historic Properties Service of my Department is, therefore, in a position to take steps to protect the site if it proves to be of some archaeological interest.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Questions Nos. 205 and 211 of 14 October 1997.  As indicated in that reply, contacts between the person in question and my Department have been ongoing since January of this year regarding his proposals to establish an Irish based cable-only music television channel.  I met the person in question on 8 October 1997 in order that he could brief me personally on the proposal. In the course of considering the proposal, my Department consulted the Independent Radio and Television Commission (IRTC) as a matter of courtesy.  The Independent Radio and Television <Col N="346" /> Commission asked me to defer a decision until they had the opportunity to meet and discuss the matter with me.</P>
      <P>I had a meeting with the chairman and members of the Independent Radio and Television Commission yesterday, 22 October 1997, at which this matter was discussed.  I will make my decision when I have considered all the relevant issues associated with this proposal.</P>

      <P>I understand that there is some limited demand from local interests for late opening but this has to be viewed in the context of the additional cost involved in extending the opening hours of the waterway.  Accordingly, it is not my intention at this time to provide for an extension of the hours of navigation.</P>

      <P>At the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London on 30 June 1995, heritage matters were discussed and it was agreed that there was potential for developing increased North-South co-operation on matters relating to the heritage.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department subsequently met officials of the Environment Service, Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland, in Belfast and engaged in wide-ranging discussions in relation to heritage issues.  It was agreed that the officials would meet annually as a steering committee to review progress on these issues.</P>
      <P>A working group at professional level on underwater archaeology has been formed, reporting to that steering committee.  Officials from both sides meet to share knowledge and experience in relation to the use of thatch on vernacular buildings and report to the steering committee. A North-South study of historic thatch is currently being undertaken.  The establishment of a North-South Standing Committee on Inland Waterways is currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>In relation to the natural heritage, an international designation group consisting of officials from Ireland and the UK meets annually to exchange information about conservation matters.</P>
      <P>I should add that there are regular contacts between officials of my Department and their counterparts in Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of EU Directives and international conventions.</P>
      <P>In addition, I understand the independent statutory Heritage Council is developing strong links on heritage matters with Northern Ireland bodies, such as the Historic Buildings Council, the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside and the National Monuments Council.</P>
      <P>Culture and heritage is one of the areas which the Framework Document envisages could come under a North-South body.  Co-operation on the heritage may well arise in discussion under strand II of the multi-party negotiations currently taking place in Belfast.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that direct support in the form of funding for the different art disciplines, such as music, is the responsibility of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council.  Although it operates under the aegis of my Department, An Chomhairle enjoys statutory independence in its funding decisions.</P>
      <P>My Department is directly involved in the support of our creative musical talent through the operation of the business expansion scheme for new artists, whereby new and emerging talent can avail of the tax incentives available under the scheme.  The intention is that this tax incentive will help attract investment into a high risk industry and assist new artists at a particularly vulnerable stage of their development.  Since its introduction in April 1996, a total investment of £1,555,000 in respect of 12 new artists has been certified.  I am conscious that the scheme is still relatively new and I am keeping its operation under review to ensure that it realises its full potential, to the greater benefit of the creative artists themselves, of the music industry generally and of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Irish music industry, as one of our more successful cultural industries, has already achieved international success far beyond what might have been expected from such a small domestic population base and consequently has an important role to play in the continuing economic and social development of the State.  I am considering what further steps are necessary to exploit the industry's potential to the full.  In this regard, I will have regard to the recommendations of the FORTE report on the music industry in these deliberations.</P>

      <P>Funding for the various cultural institutions which come within the remit of my Department, including the National Archives, is allocated having regard to the overall financial resources available to the Department and the needs of the individual institutions.  Historically many of these institutions have not had sufficient resources to play the central role they should.</P>
      <P>The National Archives is currently constrained by lack of space from accepting all records due for transfer.  There has for some time been a pressing need for additional storage space at the National Archives premises at Bishop Street through the vacation of the floor 1 area by the Government Supplies Agency to meet short-term storage needs.  I am pleased to be in a position to confirm to the Deputy that the floor 1 area to which I refer has now been vacated and that it is hoped that this area will be available for use by the National Archives by the end of February next.  This will enable the Archives to accept all Government Department records at present overdue for transfer.</P>
      <P>A major project estimated to cost some £13 million is proposed for the adaptation of the warehouse at the rear of the National Archives premises which would meet its accommodation needs well into the next century.</P>

      <P>I visited Washington, Boston and Rhode Island in the USA during the period Monday, 13 October to Saturday, 18 October 1997.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to greater access for people with disabilities in all areas and my first purpose in making the trip was to explore, in the American context, the growing participation in the arts by people with disabilities. I met the president of the Very Special Arts Project in Washington, who had visited Ireland in November 1996, to participate in a conference held in Cork entitled &ldquo;From Margin to Mainstream: Equal Opportunity for People with Disabilities International Conference&rdquo;.  This was a very valuable meeting and I have no doubt but that the experience of those involved in the Very Special Arts Project in the USA can help significantly with the work which is taking place in Ireland in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also in Washington, I visited the Kennedy Centre and met the president of the centre.  I had a very useful meeting with the chairperson and chief of staff of the National Endowment of the Arts in Washington.  In a wider context, I discussed <Col N="352" /> the arts in general &mdash; the visual arts, dance, music and theatre &mdash; with the representatives of those bodies and with the commissioner from the Mayor of Boston's Office of Cultural Affairs.</P>
    <P>My second purpose in visiting the USA was to address the World Canals Conference in Rhode Island.  Ireland will be hosting this prestigious international conference in 2001 and my visit afforded a very valuable opportunity to project the image of Ireland's waterways as a highly attractive tourist destination, not only in terms of their heritage value, both built and natural, but also in terms of their very considerable scenic and angling potential.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the establishment of a music conservatoire in Ireland and, in this context, the third purpose of my trip to the USA was to visit the New England Conservatory in Boston.  I was delighted to meet the provost of the conservatory and its vice-president for institutional advancement and international affairs.  I will have discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Education, shortly in regard to this aspect of my visit.</P>
    <P>I also visited Boston College, where I met the president and vice-president, together with the director of the college's centre for Irish management and a director of its Irish studies programme. I had a very valuable meeting with members of the Boston Irish Famine Memorial Committee and was also pleased to pay an official visit to an art exhibition entitled &ldquo;Redressing Cathleen: Contemporary Works from Irish Women Artists&rdquo; at the McMullen Museum of Art, Boston College.  I assure the Deputy that I availed of every opportunity which the visit presented to project a very positive view of Ireland in the context of the richness of its heritage and culture, particularly for visitors from overseas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has been following international developments relating to the introduction of terrestrial and satellite digital broadcasting with particular reference to the implications of its introduction on Irish broadcasters and on audiences here.  I should say that there are conflicting international opinions regarding the relative merits of either terrestrial or satellite digital broadcasting and the impact of the introduction of either form of digital broadcasting in this and other countries is far from clear.  It will be important to develop a policy on the introduction of such services here which is specifically tailored to broadcasting in Ireland.  I recently had an informal discussion with the chairman of RTE during the course of which he indicated that RTE would be making a submission to my Department on digital broadcasting in the immediate future.  I am confident the RTE proposals will be of significant assistance to me in developing a national policy in this area which I regard as a priority.</P>

      <P>The promoters of the Duhallow Arts and Culture Centre project were advised on 25 June 1997 that the application submitted under phase II of the cultural development incentives scheme had not been successful at that stage.  However, they were further informed that the project had been placed on a stand-by list of projects which would be reconsidered for grant assistance in the event that some of the projects which have received offers, in principle, of grant assistance under the scheme were not in a position to proceed within the timescale of the current round of Structural Funds, which expires at the end of 1999.  At this point in time I do not foresee a situation whereby funding will become available in this scenario.  However, if such a scenario should arise, I will be in contact with the promoters of projects on the stand-by list at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>Funding resources for the various institutions which come within the remit of my Department, including the National Gallery, are decided having regard to the overall financial resources available to the core collecting institutions of the State.  Historically many of these institutions have not had sufficient <Col N="357" /> resources to maximise their potential in the way they should in Irish society.  However, within these constraints, funding provided by the State by way of separate Vote to the National Gallery including staff costs, amounts to £2.11 million in 1997.  This does not include significant expenditure through the Vote of the Office of Public Works on developing the National Gallery including the major refurbishment of the north wing recently reopened to the public.</P>
      <P>In addition the gallery is entitled to avail of a tax relief provision which is designed to encourage donations or heritage works of art to our core collecting institutions.  Through this measure the National Gallery has received important donations of significant art works &mdash; the art archives of Jack B. Yeats valued at £400,000, a painting of his entitled &ldquo;The Beggarman in the Shop&rdquo; valued at £160,000, and works of art by James Craig, William John Leech and Jack B. Yeats valued collectively at £125,000.</P>
      <P>Apart from the State's contribution to the income of the National Gallery, the gallery itself generates its own income from a number of sources, notably from the George Bernard Shaw and Sir Hugh Lane bequests, and from the gallery shop and restaurant.  Taken as a whole the gallery has substantial resources at its disposal, although by international standards, the amount of resources must still be considered modest.</P>

      <P>A constitutional referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty will have to be held before the Treaty can be ratified.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with my Government colleagues, I generally welcome the provisions of the draft Treaty.  I particularly welcome the protocol designed to enhance public service broadcasting and, in particular, to secure the funding arrangements for such services in the Union.  I also welcome the provision which will allow people to correspond with the institutions of the EU in the Treaty language of their choice.  It is of great significance that this provision also embraces the Irish language.  The amendment to Article 128 designed to ensure respect for and to promote diversity of cultures within the Union is an <Col N="358" /> advance on the existing provisions of the Treaty relating to culture.</P>
    <P>On the question of advancing international co-operation in areas within my ministerial portfolio, I and the bodies operating under my aegis will continue to actively participate in the deliberation of the formal international fora of which Ireland is a member both inside and outside the EU.

      <P>Tuigim nach bhfuarthas cás mar sin ón Údarás riamh.  Ach cás mar sin a fháil, beidh mise lánsásta é a scrúdú go báúil i gcomhairle leis na Ranna Stáit iomchuí.</P>

      <Quest>her views on the establishment of an all-Ireland committee on the arts in Ireland; if her Department has been in contact with the British Department for Arts in this regard; the plans, if any, she has to meet with her counterpart in the British Government to discuss this matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the Northern Ireland Arts Council have held annual joint meetings since the mid-1970s.  In addition, the two councils have also established a joint committee comprising the chairman, two ordinary members and the two directors.  This committee meets two or three times a year in addition to the annual joint meeting of the two councils to consider areas in which co-operation can be increased.  Next month sees the first meeting between the directors of the arts councils and <Col N="359" /> the British councils in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England.  The purpose of that meeting is to discuss the full range of cultural matters which are of common or mutual interest to them as policy bodies concerned with the arts and culture in these islands.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should also be aware that my Department is represented on the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council Education and Culture Working Group.  The agreed objective for the AIIC was that it would provide an overall framework for intergovernmental consultation on all matters of common interest and concern, with particular reference to the improvement of relations between the two countries.  It is my understanding that arrangements are being made for the next meeting of the committee which is scheduled to be held in Dublin before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In addition, culture and heritage is one of the areas which the Framework Document envisages could come under a North-South body.  Co-operation in the arts may well arise in discussion under Strand II of the multi-party negotiations currently taking place in Belfast.</P>
      <P>I am very much in favour, if possible, of increasing further the considerable links which already exist between arts organisations North and South and to this end I will be taking the first possible opportunity to discuss the matter with my counterpart in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>In addition to her income from her employment, the taxpayer received a lone parent allowance from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.

      <P>The purpose of the independent living fund is to provide people with disabilities with personal assistance services.  Currently, these services are provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association, funded by the Eastern Health Board, and by the Centre for Independent Living through the use of FÁS trainees under the community employment scheme.</P>
      <P>The Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities in its report, Towards an Independent Future, which was published last December, set out the requirements for the development, <i>inter alia,</i> of personal assistance services.  On foot of the report, an additional £3.688 million was provided this year, of which £226,000 was allocated to personal assistance services.</P>
      <P>An advisory group on personal assistance services set up by one of my predecessors explored the option of establishing an independent living fund as a means of funding personal assistance services but considered that it would be too cumbersome to administer.</P>
      <P>I met a delegation representing the Centre for Independent Living on 22 September last and discussed in detail the various issues in relation to personal assistance services.  The further development of existing services, under the brokerage of the health boards, will be considered in the light of the resources which may be made available to my Department in 1998.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that bills amounting to £11,551,673 were issued by the health agencies in 1996 and cash receipts for the same period were £3,853,992. The receipts for 1996 are, by and large, settlements from previous years and do not therefore relate to the bills for 1996.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is often a considerable time delay between the issue of bills and reimbursement.  In many cases litigation is involved, and as a consequence it can take a number of years to recover outstanding moneys. Bills issued often overstate the position as they include cases which on examination will be shown not to meet the criteria of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1986 relating to liability for charges in the case of road traffic accidents.</P>

      <P>The numbers of cases in <Col N="368" /> receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme from 1995 to June 1997 are shown in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The average weekly rent supplement payment differs in each health board as the rents charged for accommodation vary across each health board to reflect market forces and local conditions. Weekly rent levels are also set according to family size.  For example, in the Eastern Health Board area the maximum rent limit for a single person is £40 per week and the average weekly rent supplement paid is £32.95 while total expenditure for the year 1996 on rent supplements was £34,288,000 and the number of recipients was 34,841.</P>
      <P>A housing review group was set up by the Government in July 1994 to examine rent and mortgage interest supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>In the report presented to Government in December 1995, the housing review group recommended that there should be &ldquo;an integrated approach to the assessment of housing need and that the allocation of housing resources should be adopted within a single legislative framework&rdquo;. Subsequently the Department of the Environment established an interdepartmental committee to advise the Government on the implications of transferring responsibility to local authorities for meeting the housing needs currently being met under the SWA.</P>
      <P>The work of the committee on the main issues arising from the transfer of the administration of rent and mortgage supplementation to the local authorities is well advanced and the committee's report is expected by the end of this year.  Its findings will then be considered.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the disadvantage suffered by claimants of short-term social welfare benefits such as unemployment assistance and disability benefit where they are denied the right to claim a child dependant allowance for a dependent child who is continuing in full-time education beyond the age of 18 years; the plans, if any, he has to redress this unfair situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable to recipients of social welfare payments in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years.  Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.  This is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in the area of income support for children, available resources have in recent years been channelled towards providing substantial improvements in child benefit. This represents one of the most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  Child benefit is of particular importance to families on low incomes as it is not taxable, is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc.  Therefore, it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
      <P>Further enhancements of the system of income support for children are a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in reply to an earlier question in this case on 9 July last, payment of lone parent's allowance was refused on the grounds that the person concerned and her family were being adequately maintained.  The maintenance threshold in her case is £143.50 a week and her maintenance payments are considerably above this figure.  If she is making regular mortgage repayments these may be offset against her maintenance payments and could bring her below the threshold for entitlement. However, efforts to date to get evidence of mortgage repayments have not met with success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute's origins can be traced to lost promotional outlets due to voluntary early retirement schemes in the late 1980s, which decreased the number of promotional outlets within the National Museum.  The small staffing pool in the National Museum served only to accentuate the lack of promotional opportunities, and a consequent build-up of frustration amongst the professional and technical staff resulted.  The situation came to a head in early 1997 when the recruitment of new staff with skills in particular disciplines such as conservation, marketing, information technology etc.  was initiated.  These particular skills which are essential in a modern museum, had not been provided previously in our own National Museam.  The staff now in dispute were aggrieved at the creation of six new posts, each to be filled by public competition, when promotions were not available to the exising National Museum staff.  The staff then embarked upon the present course of industrial action in an effort to secure promotions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to stress that on my appointment as Minister, I inherited a situation of industrial action amongst the professional and technical <Col N="371" /> grades in the National Museum.  It is my view however that there is a compelling need to resolve this industrial dispute.  The National Museum is at a key point in its development, with the recent opening to the public of phase one of the Collins Barracks project.  It is my earnest wish that a practical solution to the dispute is reached in order that the National Museum is in a position to tackle the many challenges that lie ahead at this key time in its development.</P>
    <P>Like every Minister, however, I am required to consider all claims for promotions and additional staff within my Department in the context of the wider public sector pay and staff numbers policy, and this dispute can only be resolved within that framework.</P>

      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium identified a range of policy issues in relation to the provision of sports facilities.  It is my intention to review sports policy and, in this context, the possibility of more joint venture provision of national and regional sports and recreational facilities, including tax incentives to encourage private sector involvement will be considered.</P>

    <P>In the case of the urban dimension of the pilot project, the ERC recommended that the focus be on schools which already had disadvantaged status and were located in the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. A total of 33 schools were selected for inclusion in this phase.  In the case of these schools, the ERC recommended that the approach which <Col N="377" /> should be adopted should include the introduction of a maximum class size of 15:1 for all junior classes.</P>
    <P>In the case of the rural part of the scheme, the ERC recommended that the focus should be on schools nationwide with fewer than five teachers. In the case of these schools, the ERC recommended that the approach which should be adopted should include the appointment of a locally-based co-ordinator to serve each cluster of rural schools.  A total of 123 rural schools were selected and these are grouped into 25 clusters.</P>
    <P>All the selected schools, both urban and rural, receive special funding for the purchase of materials and equipment and to support out-ofschool initiatives.</P>

      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for review this year.</P>
      <P>The universities have argued that the true cost of these charges would on average amount to £400 in the 1997-98 academic year and that, increasingly, the services have required subvention from other areas of their income.  The need for improved student services has also been highlighted by both the universities and the technological sector.  In the light of these arguments and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250.  I would point out that students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means-tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>I have also requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  I would also mention that I have increased the student representation on the working group, to four students.  I expect that this framework will be available by the end of November and in anticipation of the publication of the framework, I have requested all institutions to consult with students' unions on the application of funding for improved student services.</P>
      <P>I have decided on the level of the fee for the current academic year.  I have not taken any decisions about future arrangements in relation to the charge.</P>

      <P>I understand that it was the general practice of the third level institutions to regard mature students as students who were at least 23 years old.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs administers the third level allowance scheme.  To be eligible a student pursuing an undergraduate course must be at least 21 years of age while a student pursuing a postgraduate course must be at least 24 years.  The scheme is aimed at encouraging people on unemployment assistance to return to college and is not confined to mature students.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs uses the Department of Education and Science's definition of mature students for unemployment assistance purposes, as only students who were at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry to a third level course may sign on for unemployment assistance during the summer.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding for a number of initiatives in the third level sector to improve access for pupils from disadvantaged areas.  These initiatives involve linkages between the colleges and local second level schools and incorporate supervised study facilities, extra tuition <Col N="382" /> for pupils, information and advice for parents and pupils, including seminars, mentoring and support teaching in key subject areas.</P>
      <P>Proposals specifically relating to disadvantaged students have also been received from the university sector by the Higher Education Authority and £260,000 was provided in 1996 for initiatives in a number of colleges.  The proposals, by their nature, are multi-annual in character and further funding is being allocated to this area in 1997. These initiatives, which build on existing programmes and involve links with second level schools, should result in an increased intake of disadvantaged students in 1997-98.  Of their nature they need some time to build up and the intake for the academic year 1997-98 will be the starting point for a number of them.  The colleges aim at present to reserve at least 200 new places each year for disadvantaged applicants.  Support for college proposals is very firmly based on the intention of meeting the targets set and annual progress reports will be submitted to the Higher Education Authority on each of the programmes funded.</P>
      <P>In the technological sector the Dublin Institute of Technology has a comprehensive set of activities in which the college is interacting with different disadvantaged groups in Dublin city.  There are currently a number of courses in place for mature students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Dublin Institute of Technology proposes to set aside a further number of places for students from disadvantaged areas who do not meet the normal admission criteria.  Similar initiatives have also been undertaken in a number of the regional technical colleges.</P>
      <P>In July I established a joint education/industry task force to improve the supply of technicians for high-technology industries.  As a first step, I have recently announced an initiative whereby colleges and industry will jointly recruit, educate and train technicians.  In seeking applicants for the courses, the aim is to attract the kind of applicant who might not before have considered a technician career.  These applicants might include, for example, mature applicants who may have been out of the workforce for a while and underemployed or unemployed persons, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  This is a most important initiative in providing a second chance for people to acquire technical qualifications while addressing one of the clear areas where skills are needed in the economy.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the third level sector operates very pro-active programmes with second level schools to encourage students from disadvantaged backgrounds to proceed to third level education and further improvements in these initiatives will continue to be made as resources permit.</P>

      <Quest>if he has signed a delegation order assigning responsibilities and powers to the Ministers of State within his Department; and, if so, if he will give details of the powers assigned or to be assigned in those orders.</Quest>

      <P>Under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1977 orders are made by the Government where statutory powers are delegated to Ministers of State.  Where the powers delegated do not derive from a specific Act of the Oireachtas the Attorney General has advised that an order cannot be made.  There is relatively little specific legislation relating to the powers and functions of the Minister for Education and Science which therefore makes the Department of Education and Science different from most other Departments as regards the delegation of functions to Ministers of State.</P>
      <P>The functions which have been delegated to Deputy Noel Treacy, relating to scientific and technological research and development in the third level education sector involve no specific statutory powers and duties.  Accordingly, a Government order has not been made relating to that delegation.</P>
      <P>In the case of Deputy Willie O'Dea, functions relating to youth affairs and adult education have been delegated to him.  Of the functions delegated, the only functions which have a specific statutory basis are those arising under the Youth Work Act, 1997.  An order relating to those functions has been prepared by my Department and the parliamentary draftsman's office and will be made by the Government in the near future.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will review the eligibility criteria for participation in VTOS to repeat the leaving certificate in order that women, who do not pass a means test for lone parent's allowance or unemployment assistance, could be considered for such a place particularly in relation to the case of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford.</Quest>

      <P>Vocational  training  opportunities scheme (VTOS) courses are conducted by the vocational education committees.  Application for admission to a VTOS course should be made to the appropriate vocational education committee. Criteria laid down by my Department govern the admission to VTOS courses.  These criteria require VTOS participants to have been on the live register for at least six months prior to admission to VTOS, or to have been in receipt of a disability allowance or a lone parent's allowance.</P>
      <P>The details supplied say that the person in question was refused admission to a VTOS course on 27 June 1997.  It would appear, however, from inquiries made from County Wexford Vocational Education Committee and the Town of Wexford Vocational Education Committee, that she has not applied to either of them to go on VTOS this September.  It is understood that she did apply to Town of Wexford Vocational Education Committee in 1996 and was not eligible, because she had not been on the live register for six months nor in receipt of lone parent's allowance.</P>
      <P>The main aim of VTOS is to provide a second chance educational opportunity to long-term unemployed persons who have demonstrated through the signing on process that they are unemployed and seeking employment.</P>
      <P>It is on that basis that substantial aid is made available from the European Social Fund. Accordingly, I would not feel justified in broadening the terms of the scheme.</P>
      <P>If the circumstances of the person in question have changed since 1996, an application from her to join a VTOS course now would be considered by the vocational education committee.</P>
