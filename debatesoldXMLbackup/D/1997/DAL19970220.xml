      <P>It is proposed to take expressions of sympathy on the death of the Leader of China; No. 3 &mdash; Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 6 &mdash; Credit Union Bill &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that expressions of sympathy on the death of the Leader of China shall be confined to the Taoiseach and the main spokes-persons for the Fianna Fáil Party, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Democratic Left Party, who shall be called upon in that order, and should not exceed five minutes in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government, I wish to express our deepest sympathy to the people of China on the death of Deng Xiaoping. He will be remembered as the leader who oversaw the development of the world's most populous country from feudalism to a fully fledged modern economy.  His decision to open his country to the outside world has led China to occupy a major position on the world stage.  He lived through almost an entire century of turmoil and remarkable change in China, driving forward its economic reform programme and improving dramatically living standards for its people.  He leaves behind a formidable legacy and a daunting challenge to his successors.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach in expressing my condolences to the Chinese Government on the death of Deng Xiaoping who was one of <Col N="478" /> the architects of modern China.  A companion of Chairman Mao on the long march, he served the Chinese revolution even though later he sometimes fell out of favour.  As Mao's successor and ruler of China, his great service was to open up and modernise the Chinese economy and to expose it to international trade and investment. Ireland values highly its important trading relations with China, which is the most heavily populated country in the world, and looks forward to its future growth.  Deng also defused tensions with other countries so that China continued to become a positive factor for world peace.</P>
      <P>No one should underestimate the enormous difficulty of both governing and feeding a huge population of over one billion people and of maintaining a cohesive society.  Nevertheless, I hope Deng Xiaoping's successor will be able to carry the process of liberalisation a step further to include political democracy and a deeper respect for the national, cultural and religious rights of separate peoples governed by China, such as Tibet, and with regard to human rights in his own country, never allow incidents, such as those which occurred at Tiananmen Square, to happen again.</P>
      <P>Deng died on the eve of the return of Hong Kong to China.  We have valuable trading links with Hong Kong where there is a significant Irish population.  I hope the transition takes place peacefully and smoothly, and that the traditions and experience of Hong Kong will have a quietly beneficial effect on the future peaceful evolution of China which poses formidable challenges to its future rulers.  I look forward to the further integration of China into the international community under Deng's successors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, join the Taoiseach and Deputy Ahern in paying tribute to the memory of the senior Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, who died yesterday and to express our sympathy to his family, the people of China and, indeed, the Chinese community in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deng, more than anybody else, was responsible for introducing and carrying through those reforms in 1978 which set China on the road to economic modernisation and helped transform that country into a modern socialist state with Chinese characteristics.  The whole world recognised how remarkable those economic achievements have been.</P>
      <P>China was fortunate to have a man of such courage and leadership to guide it through the recent decades.  Now that the period of China under Deng has finally come to an end, we offer our best wishes to those who will succeed him in the awesome task of leading the People's Republic of China into the 21st century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, in the expression of sympathy on the death of Deng Xiaoping.  He made a <Col N="479" /> very major contribution to the development, and particularly the economic transformation, of modern China.  It was a matter of regret to me and to many that the economic evolution and development of China's affairs was not mirrored in the development of political or human rights. At this time we should not forget the incident at Tiananmen Square and, in particular, that the independent country Tibet continues to be occupied by China and its people harassed and deprived of their basic human rights.  I hope after Mr. Deng's death it will be possible for China to continue its economic development, particularly with the accession of Hong Kong later this year, and that side by side with its economic development we will see a development in its respect for human rights and the rights for minority peoples under Chinese control.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I join the other party leaders in this House in expressing my deepest sympathy to the Chinese people on the death of Deng Xiaoping.  He was a major figure in the politics of China stretching back to the long march, but he came into his own about two decades ago after the death of Mao Zedong when he helped guide China through a dramatic transformation, both politically and economically.  I hope, as others do, that continued transformation will be enabled under new leadership, in particular, the transformation of and reintegration of Hong Kong into China, which I hope will proceed in a peaceful way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the Bill.  It goes some way towards dealing with the problems in housing estates.  It gives rights to the many thousands of decent law abiding tenants in our communities.  It will give local authorities an opportunity to effectively tackle some of the major problems in this area.</P>
      <P>The Bill is intended to deal mainly with drug-related problems in Dublin.  However, the problem of anti-social behaviour in housing estates and other communities is not confined to Dublin. The same type of anti-social behaviour is a problem in large rural housing estates.</P>
      <P>Drugs were mentioned as the source of one of the main problems giving rise to anti-social behaviour.  In my constituency there are other major problems including that of young people on motor bikes racing through housing estates at 2 a.m. or 4 a.m.  Old cars that are no longer road-worthy are used by young people to terrorise young and old people.  They have races through housing estates and are a cause of concern to parents who are worried about the safety of their children and the public in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always been difficult for a housing officer or a local authority to deal with those problems. This is a worthy Bill.  However the problem with Bills that devolve more powers to local authorities is that they are usually not backed up by the necessary finance for local authorities to take on additional staff and to have the wherewithal to put in place the project set out in the Bill. Housing officers in local authorities find it difficult to cope with the additional legislation and the problems arising from the management of housing estates.  A housing officer in County Wexford, Niall McDonald, adopts a hands-on <Col N="482" /> approach to all the problems in housing.  If he was to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., he would not be able to carry out his duties properly.  Time does not matter to housing officials who work unsociable hours while visiting communities in their attempts to initiate and focus housing operations. Housing officers must negotiate house building projects with the Department, help allocate housing, meet housing applicants and deal with travellers, estate management and housing repairs.  Their workload has increased to such a degree that it is almost impossible for them to deal properly with these various problems and issues.</P>
    <P>It is fine to introduce legislation which expresses the aspirations required to deal with this problem.  However, the Minister of State must make finance available to local authorities to enable them to employ additional staff to deal with specific areas.  I am not calling for a wholesale recruitment of staff by local authorities. However, there is a need to deal effectively with existing problems and the Minister of State, in cooperation with the Minister for Finance, should consider the allocation of personnel to specific areas such as housing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the role of the Garda Síochána, legislation is enacted by the House and passed on for implementation without the appointment of additional gardaí or the provision of additional finance.  Members of the force are in a practically impossible position when trying to deal with the large volume of legislation for which they are given responsibility.  That legislation deals with issues which were not relevant ten years ago, such as problems with drug abuse and anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>With the Minister of State provide clarification in respect of some of the sections of the Bill and how they will be implemented?  For example, the Bill states that a local authority tenant will have the right to apply to the District Court for an excluding order against a member of his or her household who is engaged in anti-social behaviour. That is an acceptable aspiration but who will pay the fees charged by a solicitor or barrister responsible for taking a case to court?  The Minister of State is aware that 60 to 70 per cent of those living in local authority housing estates are unemployed.  These people do not have the financial resources to employ a solicitor.  Will free legal aid or local authority funding be made available to people who wish to apply for an excluding order?  Will the Minister of State clarify the position?</P>
    <P>Another area to which the Minister of State referred involves stopping rent at source.  It would be far better for people claiming social welfare benefits to have their rent stopped at source on a weekly basis by the Department of Social Welfare for payment to local authorities.  This is happening in specific and rare cases at present.  I believe the Department of Social Welfare is reluctant to become involved in this area because of the problems that might arise.  However, it <Col N="483" /> would be of major benefit to local authority tenants. If people do not pay their rent it is allowed to run for between four to 12 months until they build up arrears of £1,200 to £1,500.  They find it impossible to pay such arrears because they have no source of income other than social welfare benefits.  They then face court orders and eviction.</P>
    <P>Members are aware of the emotions which surround evictions and tenants usually put pressure on politicians to ensure that they do not lose their homes.  In the case of an eviction, local health boards must pick up the tab and provide housing for the spouse and children of the evicted tenant. It is ridiculous that, on one hand, tenants are evicted by local authorities while, on the other, health boards must pay the price.  The children of evicted families have the right to be cared for and not merely thrown on to the streets.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's sentiments in respect of stopping rent at source are worthwhile.  This provision should be extended to all local authority tenants who want to avail of it.  If people get into difficulties with arrears, the stopping of rent at source should be given immediate consideration. In conjunction with local authorities, the Departments of Social Welfare and the Environment should develop a practical scheme.  I believe tenants would welcome it because they could rest assured that their rent would be paid weekly.  Every householder wants to ensure that they will not be evicted from their homes.  Will the Minister of State give serious consideration to this problem?</P>
    <P>Members received documentation from the Franciscan social justice group which is concerned that the Bill may increase the numbers of homeless people.  The problem of homelessness is largely confined to Dublin but it is extending to rural areas.  The problem is escalating and becoming widespread for many reasons and young people in towns such as Enniscorthy and Wexford are living rough.  Will the Minister of State comment on the observations made by the Franciscans that this Bill may lead to a further escalation of the problem?  The Franciscans are concerned that, instead of the local authorities and the Departments of Health and the Environment dealing with the problem, it will be loaded on to voluntary bodies and groups.  These organisations do not have the financial resources, manpower or accommodation to deal with the problem of homelessness among young people.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of a public order Act and the establishment of a section in the Environmental Protection Agency to deal with noise control, etc.  I had believed that adequate legislation and measures existed in this regard.  However, the local authorities do not appear to be interested in becoming involved in the personal problems experienced by people living in housing estates under their control.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to housing estate management.  I appreciate that she allocated <Col N="484" /> money which has been put to worthwhile use by various local authorities which drew up priority lists for the upgrading of housing estates. However, this could be made more flexible.  The local authority in my constituency has provided new footpaths, roadways and, in some cases, windows. I do not want to say much more about that because I may be overstepping the terms of the provisions set down by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>More often than not, housing estate structures are maintained to a good standard and the local community plays its part by cutting the grass and keeping estates in a respectable condition.  However, in most housing estates there are three to four families with eight to ten children who live in overcrowded and unsuitable conditions.  The Minister of State must take account of the social problems caused by overcrowding in some houses.  In managing housing estates, the local authority should look also at the structure of housing some families are living in and should be given the leeway to modernise and extend them to make them more suitable for large families.  In most housing estates, there are not many large families, but in two of the housing estates on which money was spent last year to bring them up to standard, we still could not deal with the problem of overcrowding in two or three houses.  The Minister of State must look at all of the problems within a housing estate.  In addition to making them look well from the outside, we must deal with the personal problems of families.  Allocations to local authorities should be more flexible to enable them to do that.</P>
    <P>Although drugs have become a problem not just in Dublin but right around the country, there are other problems that must be dealt with, for example, speeding cars and motorbikes, noise late at night and in the early hours of the morning etc.  I welcome the Bill which will strengthen the powers of local authorities, but I would like to know how it will be determined that a family is engaging in anti-social behaviour.  Will it be up to the local people to finger those involved in undesirable activities, or will it be up to the housing officer or the Garda Síochána?  How can one be certain one has a foolproof case?  Few people would want to take on their neighbours in court if they were not sure of winning.  In the past it has proved impossible to deal afterwards with families who had been unsuccessfully brought to court by the local authority and their neighbours.  The Minister should define what would amount to a foolproof case and who will make the final decision on whether to go to court.  Generally speaking, if a complaint is made to a housing officer about a family, he will give them a warning or threaten them with eviction.  In rural Ireland at least, that usually brings them to heel.  Perhaps the existence of the Bill and the threat of legal action might make people behave more responsibly.</P>
    <P>There are problems in housing estates that have to be dealt with.  The Minister of State is <Col N="485" /> going the right way about it, but she must provide more finance to local authorities to deal with them.  Currently a housing officer and three or four clerical staff deal with all the problems of housing.  Perhaps the Minister should consider introducing a scheme such as one which operates in the voluntary sector.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the Respond housing operations in the south-east where the management of the housing scheme is operated by the tenants who run a strict regime.  The tenants in such a scheme are made very much aware of their responsibility for their own house and their neighbour's, and of their responsibility to collect rent and maintain law and order.  In Enniscorthy town we have a very fine Respond scheme.  The tenants in that scheme will not tolerate other tenants stepping out of line and that is because these tenants were called together at the beginning and made aware of what the Respond organisation expected of them and the penalties involved.  It was made clear to them that the scheme was theirs and that they were responsible for it.  Politicians working on local authorities should, perhaps, adopt the same attitude and become more ruthless in dealing with tenants. We should make it clear when houses are allocated that we will not tolerate abuse by tenants of their own or their neighbours' houses.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to implement what the Minister of State has in mind.  Every local authority has revenue collectors calling from door to door to collect rent, and they would be very much aware of it if a family were engaged in unacceptable behaviour.  This should be nipped in the bud and not allowed to drag on so that the people involved feel they have a right to continue with their abuse of their neighbours and their anti-social behaviour.  When this Bill is passed the Minister of State should call the county managers and housing officers together and explain to them what she expects from them.  The revenue collectors have a major role to play.  They are probably the people the Minister of State should speak to first because they deal on a daily basis with the tenants of our housing schemes and can get the message through to tenants that we will no longer tolerate the type of anti-social behaviour that has been prevalent in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a good one, but the Minister of State still has work to do to convince local authority personnel that they need to be more vigilant and concerned, and more caring about the very good tenants that live in our housing estates.  She also needs to make more funds available to local authorities to enable them to fulfil the aspirations in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very welcome because it addresses the very serious problem of anti-social behaviour in housing estates which has been crying out for a solution for many years.  It seeks to correct and limit the most appalling misery which a small number of unscrupulous people have visited on those who live beside them.  It seeks to address the use of local authority housing estates <Col N="486" /> as a base for illegal drug dealing.  It seeks to put an end to the ability of a small group of very well advised gangsters to use a veneer of impoverishment to support illegal activities that they have engaged in from housing estates.  It is, indeed, indicative that most of the leading drug barons are local authority tenants, despite the fact that some of them are multimillionaires.  The Bill is welcome because, at last, it seeks to address outrage in a meaningful way.  It is time we analysed and fully understood the nature of the forces and the personalities that allowed such a ridiculous situation to continue for so long.</P>
      <P>The Bill is also welcome for more fundamental reasons.  It sets about creating a balance between the rights of tenants in local authority estates and the obligations and duties of these tenants to respect the valuable property they have been entrusted with and to behave in a civilised manner towards their neighbours.  I hope it marks an end to the era where those who led opinion did so by advocating untrammelled rights for the individual with no reference to their obligations to their communities and to their neighbours.  I hope we have seen the end of an era where those with influence saw fit to constantly harp on about the rights of offenders with near total disregard for the rights of law-abiding citizens to live their lives without fear of intimidation and harassment by people who are simply, in many cases, just thugs and gangsters.  Perhaps an illustration or two of the type of realities I am alluding to might be useful.  Week in week out people come to my advice centres begging me to intercede with the local authority to get them transferred out of their present dwellings because their lives have been made intolerable by the activities of some of their neighbours.  The housing in which these people live is quite good, indeed in some cases excellent.  It is centrally located and would be in great demand if the tenants did not have to suffer aggravation from anti-social louts.</P>
      <P>Week in week out people tell me of their intense misery because their neighbour happens to be a drug dealer, with all the attendant intimidation and the constant stream of drug addicts seeking a fix and prepared to do anything to get one.  Yet, despite their consuming anxiety to be transferred to a drug free zone these tenants are not prepared to give the name of the drug dealer because they are too afraid.  Such intimidation dominates their lives and they illustrate their misery with tales of strung out addicts on landings, discarded syringes and accounts of the truly awful behaviour of demented addicts.  It is remarkable that it has taken until now for action to be taken to curb such behaviour.  The fact that it has taken so long gives credence to the adage that one half of society does not know how the other half lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill lays a firm basis to curb the use of local authority housing estates for drug dealing. It prepares the ground to make effective action possible against those who are involved in harassment and anti-social behaviour.  It is another clear indication from the Government that there will <Col N="487" /> be no toleration of drug dealing and that every strategy will be used to eliminate it.  The Bill accords with the well established principle that careful management of housing estates can contribute to curbing the drug menance.</P>
    <P>The Bill is sophisticated to the degree it recognises that in some households the problem may be the behaviour of one or two individuals who are engaged in unacceptable activities.  It provides for specific orders to be targeted against those individuals who are a menace to the community without penalising the remainder of the family who may be fine people.</P>
    <P>The provisions designed to deal with the intimidation of witnesses are necessary as are those which allow evidence in court to be accepted from the Garda, housing officials and health board officials.  Intimidation, including death threats, has been used effectively by those engaged in criminal activity to terrify their neighbours into not giving evidence against them in court or to go to the Garda.  The provisions for the efficient exchange of information between the various agencies, especially between the Garda and the housing authorities, are an important step forward.  They should greatly improve the capacity of the agencies to confront crime together.</P>
    <P>The definition of anti-social behaviour is somewhat restrictive.  It is surprising that it does not embrace the concept of zero tolerance of anti-social behaviour.  We must ask what level of anti-social behaviour is tolerable and why.  Why is damage to property accepted to a degree?  Is a signal being given that a certain level of vandalism is acceptable or that the possession of drugs for personal use is acceptable?  The Minister of State should clarify these matters in her reply.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill which give local authorities the power to refuse to sell or let a dwelling because of evidence of anti-social behaviour on the part of a tenant or a prospective tenant are an important improvement.  A clear message must be sent to the minority who, with skill and encouragement from certain quarters, exploit the good nature of local authorities.  There should be no hiding place for those who are not genuine in their relationship with local authorities.  It is important that the Bill makes provision to sustain that principle.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the mandatory deduction of rents from social welfare payments is also welcome and I agree with the points made by Deputy Browne.  It was daft that one arm of the State could allow its contribution to the welfare of society to be exploited and to militate against the effective operation of another part of the State's apparatus.  The provisions which deal with squatters are necessary and enlightened.  The Bill is coherent in its attack on unacceptable behaviour in local authority estates.  This is an important message to a small number of people who have exploited the system by squatting to further their <Col N="488" /> sinister objectives.  It is essential that no doubt is left that such activity will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the Bill need further clarification, particularly estate management and tenant participation.  I welcome the initiatives taken on these matters but there is scope for further development.  It is fundamental to progress in this regard to get the concepts and practices right.  It is important that those who seek to exploit tenants' organisations are prevented from doing so.  Some people with carefully designed political agendas seek to exploit and manipulate tenants' organisations. It is important to have clear definitions which will work for tenants and their participation in tenants' organisations and participation in those organisations should be restricted to those who live in the defined community.  People from outside the area should not be allowed to worm their way into the communities and manipulate events by direct or indirect participation. Unless we can achieve good practice in this regard there will be serious problems in the future.</P>
    <P>The capacity of estate managers to carry out their functions will be fundamental to the success of this Bill.  The Minister of State should put special emphasis on the need to train managers in the science of estate management.  There is great scope for improvement in this regard and a great need for an emphasis to be placed on direct and rapid action to deal with problems.  The inability of local authorities to act decisively and quickly lays a foundation for further anti-social behaviour. It is essential that a clear signal is given that anti-social behaviour will be tackled rapidly, effectively and fairly.  The Department should convey this message to the local authority officials charged with the management of housing estates.  This Bill gives them the tools to do the job and action should be taken rapidly.</P>
    <P>One of the main problems in estate management in Dublin city is the perception that the local authority was not able to deal with those who behaved outrageously and there is a good deal of evidence to support that view.  Such people were allowed to continue their behaviour while the local authority was for the most part paralysed and unable to respond.  Some of that paralysis was generated by the legal framework within which the local authorities work.  However, they could have been more vigorous in tackling the problem.  I hope the Bill will deal with this shortcoming.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Browne on the need for the Minister of State to impress upon those charged with the responsibility of estate management that they have an obligation to see that the Bill is implemented.  This Bill is a good step forward and has the potential to improve greatly the quality of life of a large number of people resident in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on this Bill.  She has been one of the more reforming Ministers of State and made a considerable <Col N="489" /> contribution on a number of issues.  This is an important much needed Bill.  Those of us who represent local authority areas have experienced the difficulties the Bill seeks to address.</P>
      <P>I resent this House and the institutions of the State not being able to defend the rights and entitlements of individual residents, particularly in local authority housing estates.  We cannot continue to allow elderly people, who have made an outstanding contribution to the State and who have probably reared their families as well adjusted and good citizens, to live in circumstances of great unhappiness.  Will this legislation deal effectively with that issue?  I am not sure it will.  The Minister will be dependent on other arms of the State which, until now, have not been able to respond properly.</P>
      <P>That the drugs problem in housing estates is being tackled is good.  This Bill will be a powerful weapon to the Garda and the courts in dealing with that issue but it is a small part of the problem in local authority housing estates.  The big problem concerns intimidation of people in their homes.  It is not associated with drug taking or drug abuse.  It takes several forms.  For instance, a family may want a house in a particular housing estate for a family member.  They will initiate a procedure of intimidation so that the house they want will be vacated.  They do not expect to win at the end of a week or a month but they intimidate a family relentlessly.  The family ends up in the clinic of a public representative seeking a transfer.  Frequently the perpetrators of intimidation succeed in their objective to have the house vacated and then persuade either the letting authorities or vetting committees that the applicant they have in mind should be accommodated. It is unfortunate that has happened.  That is one element of intimidation.</P>
      <P>Another area of intimidation relates to the infamous gangs of youths who congregate outside individual houses.  The Garda say they can do nothing because these youths have not committed a crime.  However, the householder concerned lives in fear.  Many decent families have been intimidated out of housing estates.  This is likely to continue because of the hierarchy of crime the Garda has to deal with.  I do not know whether we can do anything about it.  Recently, a family who had lived happily in a local authority housing estate, which I represent, for 20 years threw in the towel and left to move into insecure accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to put another incident on the record because those who are not directly affected or are not concerned with either representing or working in these areas cannot comprehend what precisely is going on, apart from the drug issue, which is frequently highlighted for the wider public.  It concerns a family who requested and got a transfer within a housing estate.  Their lives turned into a nightmare.  For three years neither the Garda, the housing authority, the welfare adviser or the Eastern Health Board could solve the problem.  The householder <Col N="490" /> simply asked gangs of youths to move away from his property to give his family some peace.  That gave rise to tirades of abuse against him, his wife and children as they went about their business and the householder was beaten up on a number of occasions.  The family reported incidents to the Garda but in the scale of crime it did not appear that important.  The gardaí probably did the best they could but nothing happened to remedy the problem.  This is all about the effect of anti-social behaviour on individual families in housing estates.  Recently the householder asked the gang to stop tormenting the family cat.  A member of the gang took the cat off the wall and threw it to an Alsatian who mauled it to death in front of the family.  On the scale of crime that may not seem a major issue but it was for that family.  When they reported the matter to the Garda they were told it was not a matter for them but for the ISPCA.  That is what we have to deal with in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have given a pen picture of what I consider anti-social behaviour, apart from the drugs issue. Fear is also an issue.  Can this legislation deal with this anti-social behaviour?  If a gang of 20 sits on an elderly person's wall at 2 a.m. shouting, laughing, drinking, throwing cans and rubbish across the wall, can we deal with that issue under this legislation?  We have been in touch with the Garda about it but they can do nothing.  They can speak to and discourage the youths but as soon as they leave the youths return and cause havoc for an elderly person living alone.  Let us not give the impression that we can solve these issues, through this legislation, if we cannot.  This is good legislation but the Minister will be dependent on the Garda, the courts and the local authorities to ensure it can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The concept of an excluding order is a good one because it seeks to pluck from a household somebody who may be causing a problem either in the household or the neighbourhood.  That is a good advance and will make a difference.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about good estate management. This is a vague term which is open to interpretation. The Minister and I have a commitment to housing travellers.  I am concerned the Minister may hand to local authorities and communities a stick with which to beat him.  They may begin to quote good estate management as something to be used against accommodating traveller families. I would hate to see that finding any credence in legislation.  That is not the Minister's intention but it might be used to put pressure on local authorities to take that interpretation of good estate management.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the deduction of moneys from social welfare to make up local authority rents which are not paid.  I am surprised the Minister has not gone further and dealt with people in waged employment who have rent arrears.  A distinction should not be drawn between social welfare recipients and those in waged employment when dealing with rent arrears.  When one considers the position of social welfare recipients, <Col N="491" /> there does not seem to be any justification for people in waged employment to have rent arrears.  No distinction should have been drawn in the Bill between them.  The provision under which health boards will have their right to refuse or withdraw a rent supplement for private accommodation will be welcomed by those involved in the management of estates and residents.</P>
    <P>To what extent does the legislation cover private estates in which the local authority has purchased one or more houses?  In cases where a significant number of houses have been purchased by the local authority one could deem the estate to be a local authority one.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation but its implementation will be heavily dependent on the support of State agencies.  The Bill is welcome in so far as it seeks to improve the lot of local authority tenants, but I question whether it can achieve this for the reasons I outlined.  The problem in many estates is at a crisis level and the good and decent residents have lost faith in the ability of State institutions to provide protection for them so that they can get on with their lives with some degree of security and freedom from fear.  We will have to wait to see whether the Bill achieves this.</P>
    <P>The one point about which I am certain is that if we do not take significant action to improve the environment in these estates and increase the educational and employment opportunities the problems will escalate.  The Garda, welfare officers, education officials and teachers in my constituency are extremely concerned about the number of youngsters in some estates who are out of control and slipping through the various nets. By the time many of them are teenagers they are capable of committing serious crimes.  A 15 year old youth from a housing estate in my constituency who had been detained in a detention centre for various reasons managed to escape.  The local community lived in fear of that individual who had guns in his possession.  Yet he was allowed to roam about freely for a week before he was eventually returned to the detention centre.  I could give many similar examples to illustrate the serious problems in many estates in my constituency.</P>
    <P>This Bill on its own will not tackle the problem. If the Minister does not have the support of the Garda, the local authority and the education authorities in implementing the Bill in local authority estates then she will not make much progress. The Bill is a step in the right direction but adequate resources must be provided if it is to be fully implemented.  I will look with great interest to see how it improves the lot of residents of local authority housing estates.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's response to these points.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as a member of Dublin City Council, one of the largest local authority landlords in the State which has housing estates in the county and city.  The pressure for this legislation has come from members of local authorities in Dublin and, in particular, the Dublin Corporation housing committee because most of the problems associated with housing estates have arisen in Dublin.  Dublin Corporation has responded to this by setting up a housing estate management section.  It is beginning to build up a database of cases and this legislation will allow it to tackle this serious problem.</P>
      <P>The problem is mainly drug related.  This Bill will allow local authorities to target drug related anti-social behaviour in estates in Dublin.  A report in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on Friday 14 February referred to the seizure of £10,000 of heroin in a flats complex in Kilbarrack and the arrest of a couple in their thirties.  This case is typical of the problem which this legislation attempts to address.  The people involved were in prison previously but are still tenants of Dublin Corporation. Families living in the same complex are going through a nightmare as there is constant traffic to and from one flat where people acquire drugs.  These families live in terror, with constant fighting and Garda raids.</P>
      <P>In the past the corporation has attempted to remedy the situation via the courts.  Last week a case was adjourned until May because of legal problems that frequently arise when this type of problem is tackled.  In one or two cases, the corporation has successfully dealt with such a problem but it had to do so through other mechanisms. A proposal, with which the Minister of State is familiar, to carry out refurbishment work in the flats complex in Kilbarrack had to be abandoned. The corporation and the Department of the Environment agreed that the complex should be demolished and the people rehoused in standard housing accommodation.  However, the problem remains of what to do with those tenants involved in anti-social behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will allow the corporation and other local authorities to deal with tenants who have used their accommodation, provided by the taxpayer, as a base from which to trade.  Over the past year we have witnessed the anti-drugs campaign, which sprang up spontaneously as a reaction to the inability of local authorities and other agencies to deal effectively with the problems caused by drug dealing and drug addiction.  I pay tribute to Operation Dóchas which came into operation late last year and has been very successful. The momentum has to be maintained. The setting up of the Criminal Assets Bureau and the results achieved so far to break up the top layer of drug barons through the seizure of their assets are welcome.  Communities affected by the drug scourge and devastated by drug barons strongly believe assets seized by the bureau <Col N="493" /> should be ploughed back into the communities. These resources should be used to provide facilities to train and educate young people and to repair the damage caused by this trade.</P>
    <P>It is not exclusively a local authority problem. Drug dealing takes place in the private rented sector and this Bill should be extended to cover it.  Private landlords should act more responsibly when renting their properties.  At one time prospective tenants had to provide landlords with a reference but that day is probably gone.  That was an attempt to prevent anti-social behaviour.  I have received reports from constituents who have been kept awake at night because of fights, drug dealing and other forms of anti-social activity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section which allows for the exchange of information between health boards, local authorities, other agencies and in particular, the Garda.  Local authorities will be able to collect evidence to enable them to deal with anti-social tenants.  The absence of such a provision in the past has been a severe handicap.  I also welcome the provision dealing with the collection of rents from people who receive payments from the Department of Social Welfare.  Dublin Corporation receives £25 million in rent annually.  Its last report listed rent arrears of £5 million which is 20 per cent of annual revenue.  In the past some categories of social welfare recipients were able to pay their local authority rent through a budget system.  That scheme was limited and I welcome the fact that it has been extended.  It will allow those who fall into arrears through bad housekeeping or budgeting to pay their rent through the social welfare system instead of rolling from one financial crisis to another or receiving eviction notices or ending up in court.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the early enactment of this legislation as it has been in the pipeline for a long number of years.  It will result in better estate management and will improve the image of local authority estates which have taken a bashing.  A previous speaker referred to social integration policy which is a hot potato in my constituency as I am sure it is in others.  People who examined local authority estates and saw these problems unfairly associated the problems with local authority tenants.  This has led to a resistance to the policy of social integration.  The sooner we have legislation in place that allows local authorities to get tough with people who use local authority housing to engage in criminal behaviour, the sooner we will have a better housing estate management system.  We will then be in a position to improve the image of local authority housing estates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is a measured response to a problem that afflicts not only large urban estates but every urban and rural parish.  Those who believe it is solely an urban problem are seriously mistaken.  I represent one of the most rural constituencies and it has a serious drugs problem.  Deputy Kenny referred to recent drugs finds in his constituency that were <Col N="494" /> reported in a local newspaper.  Two weeks ago cannabis resin to the value of £500,000 was found in my constituency.  The drugs problem affects everybody and the Bill seeks to address it as it manifests itself in a particular area.</P>
      <P>The hallmark of the Government's policy in this regard is recognition of the threat posed by drugs to our communities and the adoption of a multifaceted approach to address it.  This is not stand alone legislation but part of an intricate web of measures the Government has put together to provide for intervention at appropriate stages through the education and health systems and the allocation of additional resources to the Garda.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau headed by Barry Galvin.  Almost on a weekly basis we hear about the assets of drug barons being targeted and seized by the CAB.  These criminals have acquired lavish lifestyles on the backs of drug addicts and their pushers and it is heartening to see progress being made in this area.  The drug barons are being hit where it hurts most &mdash; in their pockets.  I favour targeting the resources seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau on communities that have been most affected by the drugs problem.</P>
      <P>To a certain extent we are now reaping the reward of poor local authority housing planning over the past 20 or 30 years.  The hallmark of local authority housing, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, was an almost ghetto-like concentration of persons of the one socio-economic class in communities with high levels of unemployment, little motivation and even less community spirit.  These communities were easy targets for drug pushers. It is interesting to note the methods used by some of the more high profile drug barons in recent times.  Many of them identified these areas as easy pickings and acquired, through various means, local authority houses to use as bases to peddle their trade.</P>
      <P>I welcome the change of emphasis in local authority housing plans.  The plan for social housing published some years ago by the then Minister for the Environment, Pádraig Flynn, moved significantly away from the excessive concentration of large local authority estates and changed local authority housing policy in a way that will make it more difficult for this type of problem to arise in future to the extent it has in some of the older estates.</P>
      <P>It is important that this legislation is not used as a big stick by the local authorities but we must encourage tenants in their own communities to avail of it.  They will feel intimidated on occasions and may not wish to avail of it but we must empower those communities to take steps to protect their own interests.  It is heartening to see what is happening in Dublin in particular where local communities are standing up to drug pushers in their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In availing of this legislation it is important to ensure there is as much consensus in terms of approach as is possible.  The &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;<Col N="495" /> attitude that existed in the past between local authorities and their tenants will not arise if action is taken under the provisions of this legislation. The Bill represents a challenge to local communities and to individuals in so far as they must be responsible for their own acts and face the consequences if those acts fall foul of the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the Bill which may be unfounded, and perhaps the Minister of State might address them when replying.  Concern has been expressed that we may be solving problems in local authority housing estates but creating others in the private rented sector.  It is important that persons identified as engaging in anti-social behaviour and who, under the terms of the Bill, have been excluded from local authority estates cannot avail of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to obtain rent subsidies from health boards and move into private rented accommodation where they can continue to peddle drugs.  That is passing the problem from one community to another.  That concern is widely shared, particularly by landlords in the private rented sector.</P>
    <P>The sharing of information will mean that owners of private rented accommodation can find out from local community welfare offices if a person seeking supplementary welfare allowance towards the cost of private rented accommodation has been excluded from a local authority estate.  That sharing of information is essential.</P>
    <P>I welcome the definition of &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; in the Bill which is drug related only.  The point raised by Deputy Flood is valid in that there is a danger the provisions of the Bill may be used to discriminate against travellers in particular.  There is often hostility in local authority estates towards members of the travelling community who are accommodated in their areas.  If the definition of anti-social behaviour was not as focused as it is in the Bill, it might be availed of in certain circumstances to discriminate against the travelling community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Government has introduced many measures in its response to the drugs problem and this is another essential element of that response.  I compliment the Minister of State on her foresight in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the principles of the Bill, I have reservations about its constitutionality and the rights of individuals under Article 40 of the Constitution.  Under the legislation local authorities will have the power to go to the District Court for an exclusion order to exclude mainly drug dealers from their homes.  I would prefer if resources were given to the Garda under the Criminal Justice Act so that the people concerned could be dealt with effectively in the courts and put behind bars, if space is available for them in our prisons.  That would be a much more effective way of dealing with such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> The Minister of State stated that this is the first Government to seriously address the drugs problem. That puts a question mark over the credibility of the rest of her contribution.  It is not true that this is the first Government to seriously address the drugs problem.  If I were a member of the Government I would be slow to make such a statement.  It addressed the problem last year &mdash; one and a half years after coming into office &mdash; after voting down nine Bills introduced by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue.  In a knee-jerk reaction to the appalling murders of Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin, the Government accepted most of what our spokesperson had asked it to accept the previous year.</P>

      <P>They could have been on the Statute Book two years ago if the Government had accepted them when they were first introduced.</P>
      <P>When people are excluded from their homes for anti-social behaviour, is some State agency not obliged to house them under legislation on the homeless?  When local authorities evict people for non-payment of rent, the health boards are obliged to step in and it can cost a great deal more than keeping them in local authority housing.  Some families have to be put up in hotels until the local authority finds alternative housing for them.  What will happen to a person who is rendered homeless under this legislation? While I presume people have a right of appeal to the courts, have they a right of appeal to the Minister?  Each of the 88 local authorities applies its own standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 29 January 1997 I tabled a parliamentary question about a person whose marriage had broken up and the family home &mdash; a local authority house bought through the tenant purchase scheme &mdash; had to be sold.  When the house was sold the woman concerned had approximately £1,000 and no home for herself and her child.  The local authority was not prepared to place her on the housing list because she had got a local authority house in the past.  The reply from the Department stated it was a matter for each local authority to assess housing need and to make a scheme of priorities for the letting of houses under sections 9 and 11, respectively, of the Housing Act, 1988.  The reply also referred to the guidelines issued to local authorities in this <Col N="497" /> regard.  The woman concerned had no comeback other than to go to the courts.  Most women whose marriages break up do not have the necessary resources to take a matter to court and free legal aid is not easily available.  It is important that the legislation we enact is enforced in a proper manner.  It is not sufficient for a Minister to state that issues of fundamental concern are a matter for local authorities.  I am sure all Members would agree that people should not be prohibited from putting their names on the housing list merely because they have been housed by a local authority in the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with the right of a local authority to deduct rent from social welfare allowances.  It should not be necessary to evict people for non-payment of rent for a local authority house.  Some 83 per cent of people in local authority housing are in receipt of a social welfare allowance.  Under some social welfare schemes rent could be deducted from payments and every tenant in a local authority house should be given the option of having their rent deducted in that manner. The payments could be transferred to the relevant local authority and it would not be necessary for people to collect rent each week.</P>
    <P>Many tenants would like their rent deducted in this way.  There have been court cases in my constituency for non-payment of rent to the local authority.  A deserted wife in receipt of approximately £110 per week who was evicted from her home would have loved to have her rent deducted from her social welfare allowance.  She had difficulty managing her budget because of the number of children she had.  While I welcome the section that deals with this matter, the Minister should given people the option of paying their rent in this way.</P>
    <P>As in urban areas, problems such as marginalisation are experienced in some estates in rural Ireland.  The Bill deals with the physical management of estates and I would ask the Minister, under peace and reconciliation funding, to select flagship projects to improve estates &mdash; for example, in areas where people are reluctant to take houses and where houses are boarded up. That funding is specifically earmarked for social inclusion, and to provide for one major flagship project would be of more benefit than paying out small amounts of money to various projects.  The objective should be that by the year 2000 any of us in this House would be glad to have our name on the housing list for those estates.  That issue, which is a major problem in cities and urban areas, should be addressed by us as legislators.  To the extent that funding is available under the peace and reconciliation programme, and with the focus on social inclusion, the Minister should talk to ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency to see if it is possible, even by way of a pilot project, to revitalise and raise the standards of estates.</P>
    <P>It is 27 years since health boards became independent of local authorities, a move which I supported. In that context one area that needs to be <Col N="498" /> addressed is care of the elderly.  In some cases health boards believe that because people in local authority houses have a roof over their heads they need not be concerned about them, while local authorities believe that people in psychiatric hospitals and homes for the elderly, even thought they may be ready for discharge, are already housed and are not a priority.  There is need for greater co-ordination and integration of services in providing care for the elderly.  That is an issue that must be addressed in the coming years because the number of elderly people in society is increasing repidly while the number of young people is rapidly decreasing.  Traditionally, families have taken on the role of carers, but that position is changing.  That issue must be addressed. The Minister should consider the adoption of an integrated approach to care of the elderly &mdash; I refer specifically to the role of local authorities and health boards.  If this were a health debate I would have much more to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill as part of a package of measures to tackle the growing drugs and crime problem.  While I commend the Minister for the speed with which she has acted in this important area in the past year or so, a crisis has developed as a result of widespread neglect of local authority estates during the tenure of successive Governments.  Many local authority estates in the Dublin area have become ghettos and no-go areas.  There are many reasons for that. There has been lack of proper management of those estates for many years.  While I put the blame squarely on the local authorities concerned for their lack of priority in estate management, there has been lack of support from the Department of the Environment in prioritising this matter and supporting local authorities who wished to take action on it.</P>
      <P>This problem is symptomatic of the neglect of poverty stricken areas, principally local authority estates.  There has been a lack of political will over the years to tackle problems relating to poverty such as unemployment, lack of education opportunities, poor housing conditions, poor design of local authority estates, lack of infrastructure and facilities and inadequate funding of services by local authorities.  Some local authority areas have been well maintained while others have been virtually ignored for years.</P>
      <P>To listen to Deputy O'Hanlon and some of his colleagues talk about the number of Bills they tried to introduce last year one would imagine the problem could be dealt with by legislation alone. If that were the case the drugs and crime problem would have been solved a long time ago.  This complex problem must be tackled on various fronts.  Substantial investment is needed in education, health services and training as well as housing.  People should not try to hoodwink the housing.  People should not try to hoodwink the public in terms of the mountain that must be climbed to come to grips with the drugs and crime problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> My remarks are not directed at the present Minister or at the Department of the Environment. This is a multi-faceted problem, part of which results from inadequate policing of the areas concerned.  If the Garda had been more pro-active in dealing with anti-social problems, the present crisis would not exist.  The attitude adopted by the Garda is similar to that adopted by local authorities, where there is one service for middle class areas and a different and inadequate service for poorer areas.  I have seen the Garda react differently to problems in middle class estates and those in local authority estates.</P>
    <P>There has been failure to tackle problems affecting local authority estates.  An example is the problem of roaming horses which emerged five or six years ago.  There was no political will to tackle that problem and it was impossible to get a hearing from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry or the Government in general.  While legislation has been introduced recently in this area, it has not been implemented yet.  In my constituency roaming horses destroy green spaces, school and church grounds and so on.</P>
    <P>It has now become established practice for young people to own horses and to keep them in their gardens and elsewhere, which is dragging down the local authority estates.  This is an example of a problem in local authority estates which could have been tackled earlier but which was ignored for so long that we now have a crisis which will be difficult to deal with.  A similar problem with juveniles driving stolen motorbikes and cars over open green spaces was also ignored. We have a mountain to climb in trying to come to grips with the crime and drugs problem in local authority estates.</P>
    <P>The sense of lawlessness in most local authority estates, particularly in Dublin, is demoralising for the vast majority of people who are trying to live peaceful lives and to rear their children.  Neglect by Government has led to a great sense of hopelessness and helplessness among law-abiding tenants. It is difficult to defend the record of previous Governments in this regard.  As other Deputies said, those of us working in the Dublin area are inundated with pleas to arrange transfers out of estates which have become intolerable because of the level of lawlessness and drug dealing. People want transfers to quieter areas which are not as badly affected so they can live in peace with their families.  It is difficult to represent these people properly when we cannot get a proper hearing at official level.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this important legislation.  We need to adopt the carrot and stick approach.  Because this problem has reached such proportions, we need to take a hard line on drug dealing and general anti-social behaviour among local authority tenants in order to protect the rights of the vast majority of law-abiding tenants.</P>
    <P>Greater emphasis has been placed on estate management in recent years and this is a welcome <Col N="500" /> development.  The key to improving local authority estates is to empower the tenants to play a greater role in the management of their estates. Otherwise, people who are or have the potential to be good community leaders will give up on their areas and ask Deputies to get them transfers to other estates.  This has happened in too many estates.  We need to put more resources into providing training for tenants organisations.  Local authorities must focus their attention on the importance of estate management.  In the past many critical decisions were made at local authority level without any reference to the people affected by such decisions.  There was no tradition of consulting with tenants about what was best for their areas.  However, we are gradually realising that those living in local areas are the best people to advise on how to proceed in relation to the type of structures needed to deliver good management of local authority estates.  We need to put more resources into the development of estate management.</P>
    <P>I look forward to discussing the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage.  The provision for exclusion orders is welcome.  We are all familiar with the situation where an individual is involved in anti-social behaviour or in drug dealing, but the local authorities are slow to evict them because there may be a partner and children living with them.  I am glad local authorities can now remove the individual concerned from the home while the rest of the family, who are often living in fear because of intimidation, can remain in the house or flat.  However, I am concerned that this does not get to the nub of the problem.  I am familiar with a growing problem of young men involved in the drugs trade who have no fixed abode.  Some local authority areas have many lone parents who are vulnerable and who are living on the margins.  They are often targeted by people involved in drug dealing and offered money in exchange for allowing an address to be used or a dealer to live in the flat or house while he carries on his trade.  Many of these people are not registered for rent.  We need to tackle this problem which is bigger than the use of exclusion orders suggests.</P>
    <P>As regards evictions, too often local authorities have concentrated their efforts on people with big rent arrears.  There is no doubt that rent arrears in the Dublin Corporation area are out of hand. Many people are in serious financial difficulties as a result of bad management and they often have rent arrears of £2,000 or £3,000 before the local authority takes action.  We should not evict people solely on the grounds of rent arrears. While recent developments are welcome, such as the setting up of MABS, I would like rent deductions from social welfare payments to be extended to anyone on social welfare.  In addition, this Bill should allow the Department of Social Welfare to put an order on somebody's payment when their rent arrears are £300 or £400, before they get into serious difficulties.  Local authorities should be able to step in at an early stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> The provisions for the exchange of information between different agencies are important, but do they go far enough?  The Bill states that local authorities may request information.  However, it will still be difficult for the gardaí to pass on information about a person's record.  We should consider including a separate clause in the tenancy agreement under which prospective tenants would give their permission to allow information to be exchanged.</P>
    <P>Health boards are obliged under law to provide a rent allowance to those who are unable to provide accommodation for themselves or obtain local authority housing.  This is a source of much concern in certain areas and the health boards in general &mdash; I am a member of the Eastern Health Board &mdash; are getting a bad name as a consequence, although they do not have any role in policing the arrangement.  Under the Bill they will have the right to refuse to provide a rent allowance to those who have been evicted from local authority housing.  The Bill should be extended to allow them to refuse to provide a rent allowance to existing tenants in the private rented sector who are know to be engaged in drug dealing and anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>On housing policy, the details of this year's allocations under the house building programme were announced in recent days.  There is a need to rethink, particularly in the Dublin Corporation area, whether it is right to continue building new houses to a high standard when there are local authority estates which have become no go areas. We should consider transferring funds from the house building programme to the estate improvement programme to bring every housing estate up to an acceptable standard to allow tenants to live in peace and quite.  Many of these estates are of poor design.  The &ldquo;no man's land&rdquo; between estates is a breeding ground for anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation of £3 million announced recently by the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, to tackle the drugs problem. Dublin Corporation is to receive £1.25 million of this which it will match from its own resources.  It is essential, however, to accelerate the programme of improvement works if law and order are to be restored in local authority estates.</P>
    <P>No policing or estate management programme will solve the problems in Finglas South in my constituency where there are estates to which one cannot gain access by road and where, following construction, mounds of rubble were left and seeded which now provide a perfect playground for those on motorbikes and people with horses as well as hiding places for those engaged in drug dealing.  There is a need to rectify these design problems if we are ever to resolve the general problem of lawlessness.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill dealing with squatters, some of whom are engaged in drug dealing, surprise me.  Squatting should be classified as an anti-social activity.  It is a source of many problems in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> I welcome this overdue Bill and I look forward to dealing with its many provisions in dealing on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  A few months ago the Minister of State advised the select committee of which I am chairperson that she would deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>The matter before us is, in many ways, one of the most difficult issues we have had to face for some time.  On the one hand, nobody can deny that anti-social behaviour by neighbours is making life miserable for large numbers of people throughout the country.  Most individuals and families have enough problems to deal with, in terms of finance, employment and health, without having to put up with constant aggravation from one or more neighbours.  It is almost impossible to over-estimate the potential of persistent anti-social behaviour to inflict serious and sometimes permanent damage on innocent parties.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, as we strive to improve legislation to deal with anti-social behaviour, we must adopt a prudent approach and ensure that the basic human rights of all individuals are protected. In other words, we must take every possible step to ensure new provisions are fair, effective and feasible.  Therefore, any changes to local authority housing legislation must maintain the delicate balance between the rights of each individual to a peaceful and non-threatening environment while at the same time making sure the law is not used to unjustly victimise individuals who are seen to be social misfits.</P>
      <P>I have every sympathy with the Minister of State as she addresses this sensitive issue because the many problems of anti-social and criminal behaviour are being further aggravated by the menance of illegal drug usage.  The drugs problem has given us not one but many groups of individuals with the potential to create enormours social disturbance and upset.  The drug barons and dealers, without the slightest sense of human compassion or care, use the absolute misery of the drug addict as a direct route towards personal advantage and financial gain.  They are without the slightest element of pity or consideration for their many victims.  Far more numerous, we have the ever increasing number who have destroyed their lives as a result of developing a drug addiction. Most of them have almost lost their sense of self-preservation or respect and simply live for the temporary physical life which they can get only from a drug fix.</P>
      <P>Three extremely worrying trends are evident in relation to the drug abuse problem.  Drugs seems to have become more widely available by the years.  A few short years ago one tended to associate the selling and use of drugs with a relatively small number of outlets, mainly in our larger cities, but it now seems that drugs are available almost on demand at many events such as discos which are attended by the vast majority of our young people.  This is an appalling scenario.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> The variety of available drugs is ever on the increase.  In recent times, our health and social services seems to have been almost totally overrun and are not capable of dealing fully with even a fraction of all drug abusers.  The all important integration of the efforts of the different agencies of State seems to be missing, which is a tragedy for all concerned.</P>
    <P>It is good idea to tackle a single troublemaker who may cause misery for a number of people and families.  The victims are often the most vulnerable, the elderly or young women living alone or with their children.  However, there is a major danger that the Bill will withdraw all support from those who are proven troublemakers.  This is a clear recipe for adding significantly to the numbers of homeless on the streets.  We must find new and effective ways of dealing with people who have major difficulties and cause this kind of disruption in the community.</P>
    <P>There has been major social change in Ireland and, unfortunately, much of it has not been good. I agree with many of the points made by Deputy Shortall.  She may be critical of previous Governments, and we can all be critical, but the issue is much wider.  We have sought this legislation for a long time.  It is important that when the Bill is enacted there is hope for the people in the communities affected by the current situation.</P>
    <P>Last week two young women came to my clinics to tell me of their experience of intimidation and abuse in the community.  A husband and wife with three young children were at breaking point because of the conduct of neighbours.  We all know about it.  It has gone on for a long time.  We must tackle the problem and, therefore, I welcome the Bill.  At the same time, we must remember that these problems exist due to neglect, social exclusion, bad planning over the years and the fact that people have been marginalised.  We have spoken about them for many years and I am sure the Minister of State spoke about them when she was in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the way local authorities build houses.  In one instance we built 600 houses without a shop, a church or a school.  I understand that some of these things must follow but in the initial stages if a person wanted an aspirin or a bottle of milk he had to go nearly half a mile down the road.  That was the result of planning which was before our time in public life and we are now paying dearly for it.</P>
    <P>In making these points, I am very conscious of the rights of the individual.  While I am in favour of giving more power to the local authourity, we must not lose sight of the role and the responsibility of the Garda.  The case of an elderly person who lives alone comes to mind.  The person has terrible problems with people who live on the floor above.  This woman's life has become a pure hell because of these problem people who were moved there by the local authority.  I have been in contact with the local authority but what can they do except talk to them?  Effective action is <Col N="504" /> What is needed in such instances.  I know I am not talking in a vacuum because most Deputies who contributed have said likewise.</P>
    <P>Huge resources must be invested in the estates. The open spaces which were to be used for recreational purposes and the alleyways are all now being used by the drug pushers and people engaged in anti-social behaviour.  People come to us regularly complaining about young people congregating in the alleyways.  They drive motorbikes and cars stolen in other parts of the cities and taken to these areas.  There must be a co-ordinated approach and I share the concerns expressed by others already.</P>
    <P>Estate management which was mentioned is very important.  Houses and flats were built many years ago in an area in Mayfield, Cork, to respond to the housing needs of the day.  In the short time that I was a Minister with responsibility for this area, I initiated a new development for this area, I initiated a new development there and it is being continued.  Many people are looking to this legislation to solve these problems.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy has stated that 99 per cent of people in those communities are excellent tenants and neighbours, and I accept that.  Nevertheless, it is unacceptable that such a large number of people seek transfers because of a small element of troublemakers.  We must ensure this Bill, while giving protection to those who may be affected, sends out a clear message that troublemakers will be taken on once and for all and removed from the community in which they have created the problem.  People must not continue to live in a hell for the rest of their lives because of troublemakers.  The local authority says hundreds of people are seeking transfers because of them and they cannot agree to them all.  It is unacceptable for this House to allow that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>Aspects of the Bill can be teased out on Committee Stage.  I hope at the end of the day the Bill will reflect the need in the community and give hope to the families and people who are suffering torture because of disruptive tenants or unsocial neighbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult and complex Bill.  The Minister of State has tried to do something in the context of the urgency particularly with regard to the anti-social behaviour associated with drugs as defined in section 1 (1) (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a presumption that the crisis is only in urban areas.  A 20 year old girl from a midlands town in my constituency was the subject of blackmail 12 months ago.  As a result and in the context of a relationship, she was recorded on video which was shown to these horrific operators who enjoy a quality of life which is unparalleled in the legitimate professional areas.  She had not disclosed the matter to her family because of the fear.  She was used for seven or eight months before she eventually went to the Garda.  Shortly afterwards, the persons, on whose behalf she had been required to leave for Dublin by train on a Friday evening and go to the Botanic Gardens <Col N="505" /> and the Phoenix Park to collect drugs for distribution in the midlands, threatened her verbally and, subsequently, one of her suppliers accosted her as she walked home.  She was stabbed and had to have nine stitches.  That is not a rare occurrence. That girl comes from a stable background and a respectable area.  Through no fault of hers she was involved in very anti-social behaviour. That example illustrates there can be major difficulties in defining and establishing what is anti-social behaviour, particularly when the courts are excluded from a role beyond that provided in section 3, which gives them a certain authority.</P>
    <P>There is a presumption in the Bill that people who are anti-social come from a certain area and social class; that they may be tenants in a county council estate.  The Bill does not acknowledge that many successful people involved in the drugs trade come from well to do areas, live in big houses and have a quality of lifestyle that is above and beyond that enjoyed by the middle or wealthy classes.  The poor can be forced into anti-social behaviour and criminal activity, but we should not tolerate that behaviour simply because people are poor.  Protection of people and their property is enshrined in the Constitution but we must be careful to ensure that people are not forced into homelessness because of their anti-social behaviour.  I am sure that is not what the Minister intended.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) (b) states that anti-social behaviour is any behaviour which causes or is likely to cause any significant or persistent danger, injury, damage, loss or fear to any person living, working or otherwise lawfully in or in the vicinity of a house provided by a housing authority.  Who defines what is significant, persistent or a danger?  Will those accused of such behaviour have a right of appeal?  A definition of anti-social behaviour is often based on the opinion of a person who does not have professional training.  Section 3 deals with excluding orders.  Under that section there is an advantage in that one must go to court to apply for an excluding order in the same way as one must go to court to apply for a barring order. I remember the debate on that legislation because I was Minister when it was introduced.</P>
    <P>This Bill is intended to mainly address the drugs crisis.  However, there are many other anti-social behavioural problems.  We see children begging on the streets, but because of the difficulties faced by gardaí in dealing with them they often have to leave them there.  Boys and girls are involved in prostitution, many of them to feed a drug habit.  Prostitution, soliciting and importuning are illegal but young people sell their bodies to obtain money to buy drugs.  They may walk quietly, and almost respectfully, back to their council estates, nevertheless their behaviour is anti-social.  Local authority officials can decide their behaviour is anti-social and evict them from their homes.  These matters are of grave importance. Those engaged in a drug promotion campaign here are the fat cats.</P>
    <P>The Bill should consider anti-social behaviour <Col N="506" /> in a wider light.  We have been proud of our athletes over the years.  I do not recall any of them undergoing random tests that showed they were drug users or abusers and that is to their credit. However, some rock bands that have come here in recent times have published their support of drug use and abuse.  Those rock bands play to large crowds for which planning permission is now required.  Members of rock bands should subject themselves to random tests to establish if their behaviour is anti-social, otherwise much behaviour is desguised.  There will be an opportunity to consider the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage.  We should not diminish the constitutional rights of law abiding citizens in favour of something that is not properly defined.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on this excellent Bill.  Many local authorities have waited a long time for such legislation to come before the Dáil.  I have been involved in the local politics since 1979 and members of local authorities are aware that problems in most towns are caused by anti-social behaviour, some of which is drug-related and more of it is not.  Local authorities have not had the power to evict tenants who engaged in anti-social behaviour and their neighbours have had to put up with all types of disturbance, including late night music, parties, etc.</P>
      <P>People, irrespective of where they came from, who were given a council house, say, 30 or 40 years ago had respect for their homes.  Many fine families were reared in council houses.  I was reared in a council estate in Father Angelus Park in Westport and I am proud of that.  There are 40 houses in that estate.  I should not give away my age, but I was the first baby born in that estate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>At a later stage, I hope. Speaking as an auctioneer, I can tell Members that the houses in that estate are selling for £60,000.  That is because the tenants had respect for their homes, their neighbours and the general community from the day they moved in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Westport is a beautiful town and it attracts many tourists, some of whom, when they see the beautiful scenery, decide they want to live there.  I hope at a later date the Minister might introduce legislation on how local authorities allocate houses. They do their best with the procedures in place. A points system does not operate in my constituency. Housing officers in my area consider most people on the local authority housing list are entitled to houses, but sometimes the present procedure is not fair because local people do not live in poor accommodation.  In the past people from other towns, cities and countries have lived <Col N="507" /> in caravans in the Westport area &mdash; I am not speaking about itinerants.  They know that local authorities will provide houses in the near future and move into accommodation which is in bad condition.  Often we do not know from where these people come but they are housed nonetheless. Local people then discover that they cannot obtain housing.  They must move their families into alternative accommodation, which is not as bad as that occupied by the first group, and pay high rents.  This problem must be given due consideration.</P>
    <P>In the past I raised the issue of rent arrears with my local authority.  I am glad the Minister of State made provision in the Bill to allow people to pay their rent from their social welfare benefits. This should be extended to those whose rent is not in arrears but who wish to pay it that way.  It is very important that people feel secure in their homes.  However, it sometimes happens that those experiencing financial difficulties will not pay their rent because they live in local authority housing.  Therefore, it is a good idea to deduct rent at source because local authorities often experience difficulties with people paying rent. People should pay their rent and, to be fair, local authorities make every effort to assist those who attempt to pay rent arrears.  The section of the Bill dealing with deduction of rent at source by the Department of Social Welfare should be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>It is time to reconsider the amount of money &mdash;£10 per person, 25 per cent of which is paid on rent &mdash; people are allowed against their rent by local authorities.  This should be increased. People who receive and increase in social welfare benefits often lose it when their rents are assessed.  It is wrong that people who receive a social welfare increase of £3 to £4 to purchase clothes or shoes for their children should have to pay £2 of it to the local authority.  Will the Minister of State ask the local authorities to increase the amount?  It has stood at £10 since I became a member of my local authority and it should be increased to £15.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent Bill and I compliment the Minister of State and the Government on its introduction.  The Minister of State recently visited Westport and opened three beautiful housing estates, each of which offers accommodation on a per with that seen in private estates.  An auctioneer would have no difficulty selling those houses.  Taxpayers provide the money to build such houses and it is right that tenants respect them.  However, we should deal with anyone who abuses a local authority house.</P>
    <P>The local authority in my area has a major problem with people who, for various reasons, move out of the houses it provides and leave them in such a state that it costs £20,000 to £25,000 to repair them.  The Bill should include provision to prosecute people who destroy local authority houses, which are public property.  We should deal with people who do not respect their <Col N="508" /> homes or damage them.  It is time that legislation was introduced in this regard and consideration should also be given to the issue of people on social welfare who decide to live in isolated areas of County Mayo, having holidays there.  Such individuals benefits from a good social welfare system and they like to live near the sea.  I call on the Minister of State to look into this matter which is becoming a problem in Westport.</P>
    <P>For many years there have been calls for legislation to deal with anti-social behaviour.  Other Members stated that drug abuse is no longer an urban problem and I confirm that.  On Monday last, local radio news reported a major seizure of ecstasy in Westport.  I compliment Superintendent Malachy Mulligan, Sergeant Willie Keaveney and Garda Hyland who visited schools in the area to advise young people not to use drugs.  A message has gone out that drug abuse will not be tolerated in our town.  We must deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Excellent legislation was introduced during the past two years in respect of the problem of illegal drugs.  This matter was debated by the House last week in connection with prisons and legislation introduced by the Government, which identified and dealt with the problem.  Past Governments were aware of problems with drugs, housing and other issues but they did not deal with them.  The Minister of State has come to grips with the problem of housing and introduced some excellent schemes.</P>
    <P>The majority of local authorities experience difficulty in purchasing land to build houses. Legislation must be introduced to prevent developers making quick bucks by buying such land and building houses on it.  Westport, Castlebar and other towns have experienced problems with major developers because the property market is buoyant, the economy is booming and there is no difficulty selling houses.  People are now in a position to buy two or three houses.  Local authorities cannot compete with the major developers in respect of purchasing land.  There is a need to introduce legislation to provide that a certain proportion of property for sale should be made available to local authorities to build housing.</P>
    <P>Like other towns, Westport has a housing problem.  However, the construction of 100 houses in County Mayo was announced earlier in the week.  Major funding has also been made available for social housing schemes in Castlebar, Mulrany, Claremorris and Kiltimagh.  This is good news because people will be removed from the housing list when these houses are built.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has a great understanding of her brief and is aware of events.  This is an excellent Bill and I am sure she will consider any changes which might be required on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the lack of green spaces provided in certain local authority housing schemes which has caused many problems.  Such spaces must be provided for children to play football, etc., when they come home from school.  I understand that this cannot be achieved in <Col N="509" /> respect of urban housing schemes but legislation should be put in place to ensure that green spaces are allocated to major housing estates.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has done well and she should keep up the good work.  She understands this area and has dealt with many of the problems discussed by local authorities in the past.  I have no doubt that she will return next year to complete her work.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on introducing this important Bill.  I accept her bona fides in this area but perhaps the focus of the legislation is somewhat narrow because it might appear that we are focusing our attention on one section of the population.  This is a widespread problem and it is as prevalent among the middle and upper income groups as among those on social welfare.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the quality of housing that has been designed and built by local authorities since she took office. The quality of such housing was always good but there have been improvements in design.  Local authority houses were always straightforward in construction &mdash; four walls and a roof.  However, beautiful designs are now utilised and the use of brick and other modern materials developed in this country have enhanced the appearance of these houses.  So much so that one often cannot distinguish between local authority and private houses.  In many cases the local authority houses surpass those built by private developers.</P>
      <P>I live in Cavan town and my local authority hopes to invite the Minister of State to open a development of two-storey, red brick houses before the general election.  Strangers inquire who the developer is and whether the houses are for sale.  That is a welcome change and the people who are allocated those houses will take pride in them.  It is only fair to say that the great majority have been good tenants but, as in all walks of society, there are some abusers.  In this modern decade, abuse takes the form of drug abuse, drug pushing and using homes as a base for business without obtaining planning permission.  We can deal with that in the context of council housing, and I would make no apology for turfing people out on the side of the road if they dare to use what has been provided by the State as a base for peddling drugs or for any other anti-social activity.  I fully support the granting of any powers that are necessary to deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People also get involved in other activities such as dealing in scrap or timber.  To the annoyance of their neighbours they use their front lawn or back yard.  They may repair cars on the side of the street and cars are parked not only in front of their own house but are lined up in front of their neighbours' houses.  It is only a small number of people who do this, but it causes annoyance, anger and rows, and must be stamped out. <Col N="510" /> We have the means of dealing with that in this Bill, and I fully support it.</P>
    <P>Good people sometimes have difficulty in managing their income.  Many couples would like their rent deducted from their social welfare payments. They would know then where they stood financially; the rent would be paid and they could live on what was left.  It should be possible to bring in a provision to enable that to be done.</P>
    <P>We frequently read in the papers about people from middle and higher income groups, and some very well known high society people, being brought to court for drug abuse.  They are obviously somebody's neighbours and are engaging in this activity.  If it can be proven that those people had a housing loan from a local authority, and it would be easy enough to prove, the loan should be called in.  That would be a way of getting at those people who would dare to abuse the privilege of a loan they received from the council to set up a home and use it for a purpose for which it was never intended.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is that a planning permission states exactly what it is for.  The planning permission for a house states that it shall be used as a private dwelling and for no other activity.  Anyone who wishes to set up a business in a private house has to apply for planning permission for change of use.  If, for instance, a person sets up a panel beating business without planning permission, he will be served with a notice from the planning officer, and if he does not heed it and close down the business he will be brought to court.  Activities like drug peddling are a dirty illegal business, worse than an illegal panel beating business or shop.  They are in contravention of the planning laws and should be dealt with in that context.  People have told me that their neighbours are causing a nuisance and want to know if there is anything the State can do.  The Garda Síochána can be called in, but they are often powerless to do anything.  However, if it can be proven that their activities are in contravention of the planning laws, it should be possible to broaden the base of this Bill to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>There are many fine families living in local authority houses &mdash; Deputy Ring was proud to state that he came from a local authority house &mdash; but, as in all walks of society, there are bad apples and they must be dealt with no matter where they live.  They should have no place in this country to ply their evil trade.  This Bill is a start in dealing with the problem.  There is a concentrated effort to stamp out drug pushing and people are helping the Garda Síochána with information.</P>
    <P>There was a major seizure of drugs in County Cavan.  I join in complimenting Superintendent Jack O'Connor on his marvellous work.  The drug problem exists not only in large cities.  As the Garda Síochána move in on them in the large urban areas, the people involved in the drug trade move to the country hoping that their activities will not be detected and that they can draw <Col N="511" /> younger people into abusing drugs.  I am delighted that on this occasion the Garda were able to nip this in the bud.</P>
    <P>I again compliment the Minister of State and I look forward to her visiting my county.  Given all the invitations she has received, she will be very busy, but she is obviously a very popular Minister who is doing a good job.  The quality of housing being built under her stewardship is commendable. Long may her good work continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is laudable and it should help local authorities to deal with difficult situations.  However, even before it gets off the ground, legal questions arise.  I am sure they will be dealt with by the legal eagles in due course.</P>
      <P>Estate management should begin before any building takes place.  In planning large housing estates we should first provide shops, health facilities, a Garda station, etc.  We went wrong in the past by building large housing estates without putting in proper services.  When problems arose the Garda Síochána and other facilities were not near at hand to deal with them.  In small communities everybody knows everybody else, but it is now common not even to know one's neighbour.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to hear how different types of anti-social behaviour can arise, and how people try to acquire a second or third house in a housing estate by intimidating their neighbours. This is common not just in the city but throughout country areas.  If people want to get a house for their son or daughter they harass their neighbours by having noisy parties with loud music, throwing rubbish on to their neighbour's property and engaging in other types of intimidation.  It is not an answer to transfer the neighbour to another estate.  We must tackle the problem head on and deal with it without fear or favour.</P>
      <P>Halting sites are also a problem.  Is it fair to put a halting site beside an estate in which people have lived for a long time?  This problem must be looked at from the point of view of the settled community as well as that of travellers.  Settled people must be consulted.  I do not believe halting sites are the answer in many situations.  Many people are now of the view that small group housing estates would be a better solution because of the possibility of having health, education and other facilities near at hand.  There is plenty of money for halting sites.  The Minister should think again and consider the settled community. It takes years to develop a proper community and it would be unfortunate to upset communities at the stroke of a pen, especially at a time when a lot of money is available to local authorities for such developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I praise the provisions on the attachment of money from social welfare allowances.  Perhaps the Minister of State would go a step further and tackle those who have incomes and are in arrears <Col N="512" /> of rent.  Everybody should be seen to pay their way to at least some degree.  Waiver arrangements exist and the local authorities always consider cases of hardship sympathetically.  However, the attachment provisions are welcome because it is difficult to accept that people may spend money on frivolous times but will not pay rent arrears to the local authorities.  The provisions to deal with squatting are also welcome because it presents problems for local authorities.  Any measures to assist the local authorities in this regard are praiseworthy.</P>
    <P>Another problem which arises concerns people who move out of local authority houses but retain a legal hold on them.  They often leave the houses in bad repair and they cannot be used by other tenants.  Perhaps legislation should give the local authorities powers to repossess houses which are not properly looked after and to reincorporate them in the housing stock.</P>
    <P>The Bill has good aspects, although it may encounter some legal difficulties.  I hope it will not leave people homeless and, thereby, exacerbate one problem by tackling another.  The resolution of local authority housing and tenant problems requires an interdepartmental approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill highlights starkly the differences between the ideal and the real.  The Bill's ideals are shared by us because we have experiences of anti-social behaviour in estates. However, I am not sure of the definition of anti-social behaviour and its consequences.  If it refers to dealing and using drugs and the consequent problems, we are at one with the Minister of State.  However, if the definition seeks to go beyond that there may be problems with the constitutionality of its interpretation.</P>
      <P>Every year millions of pounds are spent on repairs to local authority houses.  Why?  Have good management practices been put in place by the local authorities in question?  When a person is offered a tenancy there are conditions to which he or she must agree.  Do the local authorities carry out their functions in good estate management? In the past the person who collected the rent from the local authority tenants could report on houses that were not being properly looked after and constructive action could then be taken to avoid further decline.</P>
      <P>It can take six to nine months for a local authority to repair houses after tenants have left. There are no obligations on those tenants who leave houses in bad condition, some of whom buy new houses.  The Minister of State should communicate with the local authorities to find out how they are performing their functions as they have abrogated their responsibilities.  Valuable resources are wasted carrying out repairs and valuable income in rent is lost on properties which are empty and prone to further vandalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is laudable to take action against people who misbehave but the Minister of State should reconsider the definition of anti-social behaviour.  She should also consider the effects of the Bill.  Its <Col N="513" /> provisions require very little proof or evidence and much of that can be based on subjective hearsay. For example, a person in an estate may be considered to be involved in anti-social behaviour which may amount to no more than idiosyncrasies which are not to the liking of his or her neighbours. If a residents' group reports the person to the local authority it may take action on the basis of that evidence to remove the person from the tenancy.  However, that person may be mentally deficient and need the support of other community services.</P>
    <P>There are about 5,000 homeless people and if the anti-social behaviour definition is applied to the extreme many more could be added to that number.  It is possible that families could be divided if, for example, a husband is acting in an anti-social manner and separated from his wife and children.  Is that not detrimental and anti-social in itself?  We must examine the consequences of the steps being taken by legislation.</P>
    <P>At a conference in Dublin a local authority housing officer spoke on how this Bill would be dealt with.  I was concerned it was indicated that housing officers would rely on information gleaned from the residents in estates.  Residents' associations could provide such information.  It could also be provided by vigilante groups who, although they are well intentioned, are subjective in the views they may express to the manager.  Is the manager to take action on the basis of something that is subjective rather than objective?</P>
    <P>I refer to the legal and constitutional issues that may arise.  Article 40.3 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;The State ...guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the landmark decision in Ryan <i>v.</i> the Attorney General in 1963 the issue of the unspecified personal rights arose, in so far as it was claimed that the right to bodily integrity was a specific personal right latent in the general expression.  It was held by the High Court and endorsed by the Supreme Court that the personal rights which may be invoked to invalidate legislation are not confined to those specified in Article 40 of the Constitution but that they include all those rights which result from the Christian and democratic nature of the State.  In the further High Court case Mr. Justice Kenny cited a papal encyclical in support of his argument that the guarantee in Article 40 is not confined to the rights specified in it but extends to other personal rights, such as food, clothing, shelter, medical care and the necessary social services &mdash; the rights which are necessary and suitable for the proper development of life.</P>
    <P>When this is combined with the general spirit of the Housing Acts, 1966, 1988 and 1990 which embody a commitment to the provision of housing for those in need, it creates a framework within which the local authority must operate. The Housing Act, 1988, also defines a homeless person.  Its provisions enable housing authorities to secure a range of suitable accommodation for <Col N="514" /> homeless persons and to alleviate homelessness as far as possible.  The Bill appears to be contrary to the spirit of existing legislation and the Constitution. It was drafted in response to the issues identified and the recommendations of various interested parties under the housing management initiative, set up by the Minister.  An extract from its report states:</P>
    <P>Anti-social behaviour will be carefully defined so as to focus especially on drug pushing and related activity, including serious anti-social behaviour, such as violence, threats, intimidation or coercion.  It will not, therefore, cover all forms of anti-social behaviour and for the purposes of general housing management however a wider more inclusive definition should be used by the authorities.</P>
    <P>It further recommended there should be a co-ordinated multi agency approach to dealing with problems of anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>In the Bill the term &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; has been loosely defined.  It includes a wide range of behaviour which may or may not be related to drug dealing.  There is no provision for an alternative means of dispute resolution.  Eviction exclusion orders, which should be a last resort, appear to be the only option.  The explanatory memorandum describes it as forming part of a wider range of measures being undertaken by the Government to deal with the issues of drugs and related crime.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to regulate the behaviour of local authority tenants by imposing severe sanctions on those who are believed to behave in an anti-social manner.  While the new legislation is important &mdash; we welcome part of the response to the issue of drugs and related crime &mdash; it does little to affirm the role of local authorities whose function is to provide housing for those in need. Generally the regulation of anti-social behaviour is a matter for criminal law and not appropriate to civil law.  While a case may be made for society to have available to it protective measures, such as exclusion orders, these measures should be capable of being applied to all citizens in special and defined circumstances.  The Bill imposes severe sanctions which are applicable only to local authority tenants.  Surely this constitutes an unfair and unjust attack on the rights of local authority tenants?</P>
    <P>There are general concerns about the Bill.  The standard of proof required in respect of anti-social behaviour is particularly low and applicable only to local authority tenants.  The definition of &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; is much wider than anticipated. The provisions of the Bill, combined with existing powers for local authorities, can serve to remove all access to housing.  Those on low incomes who have obtained local authority housing on the basis of need can be evicted and, effectively, thrown on the voluntary organisations to deal with them.  The local authority can go back over a number of years if it considers the person is or has been engaging in anti-social behaviour. <Col N="515" /> It is possible that people may have been involved in anti-social behaviour but the time span needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a narrow range of punitive legal sanctions, including eviction orders and the removal of entitlement to rent allowance.  There should have been a much wider range of options. I ask the Minister to examine other options of dispute resolution before eviction is considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is an important and practical measure to deal with one of the problems of the day.  I wish to refer to exclusion orders and compulsory deductions in respect of housing authority rents.  In relation to exclusion orders the Minister began by saying that, broadly speaking, the Government is tackling the drugs problem.  In the past, successive Governments have adopted various measures and proposals to deal with the drugs problem and I am certain that Governments in future will do the same.  This is a problem which affects all parties.  It is over and above politics and all parties must support the necessary measures, otherwise we will not find solutions.</P>
      <P>I realise we are getting near an election.  The Minister began by saying that this Government is the first to seriously address the drugs problem. Which problem?  There are a series of drugs problems. It is a good PR statement but please let us get away from that in relation to drugs.  Let us have a responsible attitude to one of the most pervasive and dangerous problems that face youth, especially in areas of great disadvantage. The Minister is familiar with those areas and sympathetic to dealing with the issues arising in areas of great disadvantage.  No one or two measures and no division between people will help in tackling this problem.  If we are to tackle the problem in areas of great disadvantage we need project teams who will tackle the different issues.  We are slowly achieving this.  The difficulty is not a lack of funding as the Government and its predecessor provided funding for health board programmes but rather securing the co-operation of local communities. Regardless of the number of officials appointed or laws in place it will be impossible to wipe out the drugs problem without the support of local communities.  We must start at the bottom, by which I mean local communities, and work upwards.  Public servants in all sectors must work with and support communities in their areas and not merely visit them from time to time.  All the indications are this co-operation will pay dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not to take from the work being done by the Garda, health board officials, local groups, health boards and local authorities.  These bodies find it difficult to deal with the problem on their own and I appeal to the Minister to ensure a co-ordinated approach at all levels.  Otherwise we will only fool ourselves and will not solve the problem.  I make these points on the basis of my experience in this area.  Regardless of the statements <Col N="516" /> made or the number of officials who visit areas to see the problem at first hand, we will not solve the drugs problem in areas of intense disadvantage without a co-ordinated approach which has the support of the Government and all the parties involved.  Measures to deal with educational deprivation and other types of disadvantage must be implemented at the same time. Some schemes and measures are a step in the right direction but we must ensure they eliminate problems so that they do not emerge again six months later.  The Government and its predecessor invested much money in child care and in the implementation of the Child Care Act. However, one still sees a small number of children begging on the streets of Dublin, while others are involved in prostitution.  How can these problems still exist when millions of pounds have been allocated to deal with them?  The same applies to the drugs problem, which is why project teams must be set up in communities.  Children involved in drugs normally have a long history of deprivation and disadvantage.  The different aspects of the problem must be tackled and the only way this can be done is by the establishment of project teams.  If necessary the public servants on these project teams should be paid extra or rewarded on the basis of what they achieve.  If they are to properly tackle the problem they must live with it until it is solved.</P>
    <P>The public is aware of the measures being taken to deal with this problem, yet it still sees evidence of it on the street.  Many of the housing and economic problems have been dealt with but many more problems still need to be tackled.  This Bill is only one of the measures needed to help the Garda and local communities deal with this problem.  If one person in a flat complex deals in drugs he can take over the entire complex and put the other residents through so much torture that they leave.  Law and order does not prevail in such cases.  I was involved in an experiment where local gardaí carried out intensive policing outside and inside a flat complex over a period of six months.  There was virtually no problem during that period, after which the gardaí were deployed to other duties.  It has now been decided to demolish the complex.  This will probably make it easier for the gardaí to deal with the problem but it represents a defeat for those people who believe in democracy, development and good housing estate management.</P>
    <P>The exclusion order may seem draconian but it is necessary to deal with people in flat complexes who are involved in drugs.  Previously entire families were evicted because of the actions of one person.  The eviction of an entire family meant that the local clergy and teachers could no longer help the other children who sometimes also became involved in drugs.  The exclusion order will be very helpful to Dublin Corporation and other local authorities which deal with these problems on a daily basis.  Difficulties arise in terms of where these people subsequently go, but one must be able to take the necessary action. <Col N="517" /> Communities affected by drugs will very much welcome this measure, which also covers people who engage in anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>Section 16 amends the Social Welfare Acts to allow for the deduction of local authority rents at source from social welfare payment where arrears exceed a certain level or are unpaid for a certain period.  The amount deducted cannot exceed the weekly rent payable.  I would be very worried if it could exceed it given that local authorities and landlords always want their money in a hurry.  There are measures to allow for such deductions on a voluntary basis and they have been successful.  A method of dealing with these problems which suits everybody involved has been built into the system and if there are outstanding issues they can be dealt with.  It strengthens the position of local authorities and helps to deal with poverty.  Questions were raised when this was introduced on a voluntary basis and the record will show that members of the Labour Party and Democratic Left questioned me comprehensively about it.</P>
    <P>Community welfare officers, rent supervisors of the local authority, organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent De Paul and others helped to solve the problem.  It was found that with a budgeting approach the outstanding problems were isolated.  When a budgeting approach was not used everything was a problem and nothing was kept in order.  When people tackled problems using a budgetary approach they saw what was needed and could do their jobs better.  The money advice and rent deduction systems have worked well.</P>
    <P>I am wary of this proposal because a compulsory power will be given to local authorities to make deductions.  There should be consultation with the groups involved before a compulsory power is agreed to ensure we do not allow something the Minister of State does not intend.  It is a question of linking this compulsory power with the community welfare officer and the budgeting system operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  It is wise for the Minister to place an upper limit on deductions.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum points out that the operation of these arrangements, including the circumstances in which the deductions may be made, will be subject to regulations made by the Minister for Social Welfare after consultation with the Minister for the Environment.  When the regulations are drawn up it may be possible to tie in everything.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows health boards to refuse or withdraw supplementary welfare assistance towards private accommodation in the case of persons convicted, excluded or removed from, or refused local authority housing, due to anti-social behaviour. It gives health boards a degree of control. Unfortunately, it is necessary.  I agree with the Minister on that.  These measures should not have been brought in ten, 20 or 30 years ago, as has been suggested, because the same problems did not exist then.  At that time, we had transfer <Col N="518" /> orders, leases and ground rents which were supposed to control behaviour on estates.</P>
    <P>Most of these measures are gone and as a result there is severe anti-social behaviour restricted to particular areas to a large extent.  However, that is a subject for separate debate on the current operation of the social housing policy.  Certain communities are concerned about the operation of this power and while all parties support it, its operation needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures.  Questions have been raised about their constitutionality but our learned Attorney General can sort those out for the Minister.  These are good, practical, important and immediate measures to tackle problems in estates, especially in Dublin, where drugs are a problem.  The exclusion order, in particular, will help those interested in solving these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> As a member of two local authorities I welcome the Bill.  This legislation has been needed for years.  I am satisfied it will be applied with sensitivity and care but it is necessary to restore a balance in the right of people to housing and to live in peace and expect their neighbours to make an effort to live in harmony with them.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister examine the lack of protection for long-term residents of, for example, mobile home parks when considering this or subsequent legislation?  It affects a small number of people but I have come across two serious problems in my constituency.  Many of the people involved are Irish who have retired here from England on the basis of advertisements placed in Irish newspapers in Britain.  There have been great advances over the past two years in controlling conditions and protecting tenants in private rented dwellings but the people in mobile home parks do not fall within the protections already enacted.  They buy or rent a site from the owner of a park and return to Ireland on the basis of advertisements which guarantee them peace, security and various types of back-up in their retirement.  A number find that what has been promised is not available and they have no redress in law to follow it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have followed one case for the past year.  We tried in the first instance to get the local authority to use powers under current housing legislation to enforce minimum standards and conditions and to ensure registration of such properties.  We found legislation did not allow the local authority to do that. We were then referred to the Environmental Protection Agency in regard to noise regulations and the Director of Consumer Affairs to see if the advertisements through which these people were first attracted to sites could have been deemed to be false advertising.  We followed these tangents to try to get some relief but none was forthcoming. It is not a huge area of need but I expect it to increase as our elderly population grows.  I know the Department is reluctant to give any recognition to temporary dwellings but in these <Col N="519" /> cases the dwellings are long-term; many of them are in better condition than some houses in similar areas.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the needs of these vulnerable people and ensure they are afforded the same protection as people who live in standard rented housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who participated in the debate and appreciate their support for the Bill.  The fact that the debate was so comprehensive is an indication that housing is an important part of the daily lives of our constituents, some of whose communities are facing serious problems including drug dealing and other anti-social behaviour which is clearly defined in the Bill.  It is also clear from the debate that this House is sending out a clear message to drug dealers that their activities will no longer be tolerated.  We are also sending out a message of hope to communities currently in the grip of heroin.</P>
      <P>I outlined the reasons for the Bill in my opening contribution.  It is not a panacea for all the ills people are experiencing but part of a strategy to deal with the drugs crisis affecting, in particular, estates in our cities.  One element of that strategy is the question of estate management which applies not only in these communities but in all local authority estates.  Estate management was referred to by many speakers and it is an aspect of housing policy to which I am committed and wish to see developed in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods made the point that we can only succeed in this strategy if we have true partnership and co-ordination between the statutory agencies and local communities.  That is the fundamental principle upon which our approach is based.  We must have unity of purpose and the unity of purpose displayed in this debate will enhance the possibility of our succeeding in the fight against the serious problems facing communities.</P>
      <P>I want to address some of the concerns raised and the hypothetical implications of some aspects of the Bill.  A number of Deputies were concerned that the definition of anti-social behaviour was too broad and that at some time in the future these measures might be used for unintended purposes.  The definition of anti-social behaviour has been carefully defined with particular reference to drug pushing and related serious violence or threats of violence to individuals.  Possession of illegal drugs solely for personal use does not come within this definition nor does vandalism or damage to property unless the damage is being used to intimidate or threaten.  It also avoids vague concepts such as nuisance which could be taken to include issues such as playing loud music late at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quill suggested that the problem of anti-social behaviour be left to the operation of the criminal code, a point echoed by other Deputies.  Those involved in anti-social behaviour <Col N="520" /> may be subject to sanctions under the criminal law, but criminal proceedings are not primarily the answer to the problem this legislation is designed to address.  To take that approach would be a betrayal of local authority tenants by local authorities and a cop-out on our part.  It is essential that effective measures are available to protect the rights of tenants by dealing speedily with the problem rather than depending on the threat of prosecution.  Tenants are looking to local authorities to uphold their rights to the quiet enjoyment of their estates.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies voiced concern regarding the possible constitutional or civil liberties implications of the measures.  Most legislation is likely to involve some degree of intrusion into individual freedoms, but the key consideration is to strike a balance between individual rights, whether enshrined in the Constitution or elsewhere, and the public interest.  The peaceful enjoyment of one's home is a basic civil right.  The legal issues in the Bill have been carefully considered in my Department and by the Office of the Attorney General in its drafting.  The provisions are limited to specific circumstances and are designed to address clearly identified problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern expressed concern that the Bill would result in wide-scale evictions and extreme pressure on the agencies providing accommodation to the homeless.  That is not the case.  The Bill will not make any change in the fundamental legal provisions relating to repossession of local authority houses under the Housing Act, 1966.  More importantly, the new measures will be used sparingly.  They will apply only to serious activities and used only as a last resort.  Local authorities do not have any vested interest in evictions.  The deterrent effect of the Bill is possibly its most important attribute.  It is important to bear in mind that those excluded under the Bill will have considerable resources available to them; some will have used their local authority dwelling as nothing more than a base for their drug pushing activities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the exclusion order, we must ensure that where the last resort is taken and an individual is excluded from a household, the remaining members of the household will not be evicted.  That is a protection to ensure unnecessary numbers of people are not evicted if such a course is adopted by a local authority.  I want to allay people's concerns in that regard and point out that considerable progress has been made under the homelessness initiative to ensure the service is streamlined, that it is meeting a need and is supported both financially and in terms of good administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern also raised the question of delays in the court process including the question of amendment to the District Court rules and arrangements to speed up proceedings in the District Court.  Section 2 effectively amends the District Court rules to provide that, where it has not been possible to serve a summons by registered <Col N="521" /> post, it may be served by ordinary post without the delay of having to go back to the courts for specific permission to do this as is currently the case under provisions in the court Acts and the District Court rules.  This will help to address a major delay local authorities experience in dealing effectively with tenants engaged in anti-social behaviour where such tenants refuse to accept the service of summonses by registered post and the local authority is forced to go back to the court.</P>
    <P>On the question of speeding up access to the District Court, administrative arrangements are being pursued with the District Court to ensure cases involving alleged serious anti-social behaviour get priority in court lists.  A weekly sitting of the District Court already deals with Dublin Corporation housing cases, and all aspects of court procedures affecting local authority housing cases generally, such as court sittings, listings, districts, appeals and related matters, will be kept under review.  Other measures to reduce delay in the court process are already in place including the increase in the number of judges and support staff announced by the Government last July.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern also raised the question of tenant purchasers.  That matter is dealt with in section 13.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan queried the basis on which the consent of a local authority is required for the resale of a tenant purchase house.  The statutory basis for this is section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966 as inserted by section 26 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992.  The sale of a house to a tenant by a local authority is subject to certain statutory restrictions; the house must be used as a normal place of residence and should not be resold without the consent of the local authority.  These conditions generally apply for 20 years after the original sale of the house.  Under section 13 of this Bill the housing authority, in circumstances where consent is required, can refuse such consent where, for example, the tenant purchaser is a drug pusher.</P>
    <P>Deputies Lenihan and Ahern raised the question of appeal procedures.  The Bill provides for extensive appeal procedures including appeal against variation and quashing of exclusion orders.  Decisions on social welfare allowance will be subject to the Department of Social Welfare's appeals system.  Moreover, all decisions by local authorities are subject to a range of accountability procedures, including judicial review, investigation by the Ombudsman, general supervision by the Department of the Environment and, most importantly, oversight and policy control by the elected members who play a crucial role in ensuring fair treatment by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey raised the question of tenants giving evidence in proceedings.  Section 20 provides that the courts may accept statements by gardaí or officials of the local authority or health board as evidence of anti-social behaviour.  This will mean tenants will not have to appear before the courts and is an important protection because <Col N="522" /> of the serious incidents of intimidation in this regard in the past.  In some cases the courts have in practice accepted evidence from an official of the housing authority or a garda, but it is desirable to provide statutory backing for this as practice can vary widely and such evidence may be challenged as hearsay.  Local authorities that have been reluctant to take cases relating to anti-social behaviour because of the danger to witnesses will now be in a position to act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan questioned the making of interim exclusion orders on an <i>ex parte</i> basis.  As he acknowledged, the interim order procedure is designed to deal with emergency cases and making interim orders on an <i>ex parte</i> basis is justified in that context.  The Domestic Violence Act, 1996 contains a parallel provision and it is a matter for the courts to ultimately decide on the seriousness of particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to estate management, a key issue in resolving problems on estates.  I have already provided funding for pilot schemes to develop estate management programmes and this has enabled tenants to participate in the management of their estates.  I have also provided training for housing officials and urged county managers to adopt a new approach to estate management. This approach is bearing fruit.  I am pleased Dublin Corporation has accepted this challenge and is making great progress.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne referred to the question of additional resources.  The Bill was introduced as a result of requests from local authorities and in itself is a resource to enable them to act properly, effectively and in a targeted manner.  He also raised a question of legal costs in exclusion order cases.  The provisions that apply to free legal aid in the Domestic Violence Act will also apply in this case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flood queried if house purchases by local authorities are covered under the legislation. I am pleased to confirm that is the case. He also proposed that an attachment of earnings should be produced before making deductions for rent arrears.  Unfortunately, this could be a slow and costly procedure and would not facilitate prompt intervention.  I hope the other points raised can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a necessary measure designed to protect communities and it incorporates a good balance since we must ensure that people's rights are not unduly affected.  It is a product of practical experience.  It was introduced to deal with the difficulties faced by communities and local authorities in trying to resolve problems.  Some Members referred to the old days when the elderly were respected and the young protected.  In those days the challenges were different.  The TB epidemic destroyed the young, the vulnerable and the poor.  Heroin is now destroying the young, the vulnerable and the poor and we must ensure our legislation meets that modern epidemic.  The response of Members to the strategy outlined by the Government and the approach incorporated <Col N="523" /> in the Bill reflects a unity of purpose inside and outside the House to meet that challenge.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the first Bill specifically devoted to credit unions for more than 30 years.  Its purpose is to provide a statutory framework for the development and growth of the credit union movement and to enable credit unions to provide an enhanced range of services to their members.  I acknowledge the general welcome given to the Bill by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  The league is the representative body which has guided and overseen the development of the credit union movement since its foundation, a role it has carried out and continues to fulfil with diligence and integrity.  The achievement of the league in presiding over and guiding the extraordinary growth of the credit union movement is truly remarkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its journal, the league described the Bill's highlights as including &ldquo;provision for more flexibility on withdrawing shares and deposits, for allowing people under 16 to join credit unions, for loans to be made for periods longer than five years, for a credit union to participate in a savings protection scheme, for statutory fraud/dishonesty insurance, and to allow credit unions provide &ldquo;additional services' &rdquo;.  I will deal later with some of those matters and address important concerns also articulated by the league.  I am very pleased <Col N="524" /> to present this important Bill to the House.  It is the culmination of a great deal of work.  The need for the new Credit Union Bill is due entirely to the tremendous success which credit unions continue to enjoy in meeting the financial needs of their members.  Other financial institutions have indicated to me that they will want to press on me their views on this Bill.  They are welcome to do so.  They should, however, acknowledge that their track record of meeting the needs serviced so well by the credit unions has been one largely of disinterest.  I would like to sketch in brief the background of credit union development which has given rise to this new Bill.</P>
    <P>Credit unions are now such an integral part of Irish society that it is hard to believe they were unknown in Ireland some 40 years ago.  It was only in 1958 that the first credit union was formed here, and by the following year there were three credit unions comprising 200 members with a modest sum of £415 in members' shareholdings. As financial co-operatives, these initial credit unions were formed under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1913, but such was their success and growth in the succeeding years that it quickly became apparent that they needed a separate statutory base.  This led to the enactment of the Credit Union Act, 1966, which remains to this day the principal legislation governing credit unions.  The 1966 Act deals with the basics of credit union establishment, organisation, operations and supervision.  It outlines the conditions for the registration of a credit union by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and sets out the qualifications for membership of a credit union.  It provides for the rules of a credit union to be approved by and registered with the registrar and establishes the general provisions relating to a member's shares and deposits in the credit union.</P>
    <P>The Act allows the credit union to borrow money and to make loans available to its members, subject to certain conditions.  It deals with the powers, functions, duties and constitution of the credit union's board of directors and its supervisory committee and establishes the manner in which they report to the credit union's membership and are subject to the members in general meeting.  The Act also provides for the keeping of books of account by credit unions and for their audit, and it established the Credit Union Advisory Committee which has been a source of independent advice on credit union affairs to successive Governments for some time. It will be clear from this outline of the 1966 Act that many of its general features are being retained in its successor some 30 years later.</P>
    <P>With the support of the statutory recognition afforded by the 1966 Act, the number of credit unions grew from the three existing in 1959 to 336 by 1969.  The number of credit union members reached 169,000 in that year, and shareholdings exceeded £7 million for the first time.  In a little more than ten years, credit unions had become firmly established in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> The next legislative landmark was the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1978, Part III of which dealt exclusively with credit unions and specifically with providing updated powers of supervision for the Registrar of Friendly Societies. This became necessary because of the continuing success of the credit union movement in expanding the number of credit unions, its overall membership and the savings base.  Part III of the 1978 Act was a response to the fact that the 1966 Act provided the registrar with little or no powers to exercise any meaningful role in supervising a credit union once it had been established.  For the first time, the 1978 Act gave the registrar the power to inspect and investigate a credit union's affairs and, where necessary, to direct a credit union to suspend the acceptance of shares, deposits, loans and payments in certain specified circumstances.  It also enabled the registrar to call a special general meeting of a credit union and to appoint a person as one of its directors.  Many of these provisions are replicated in the new Credit Union Bill before the House.  Throughout this period credit unions continued to grow and prosper, and by the end of the 1980s there were more than 500 credit unions throughout the island of Ireland.  In addition, credit union membership passed the one million mark and the value of shareholdings amounted to some £650 million.  It was at this time that a general consensus began to emerge within the credit union movement that a new and wide-ranging stand-alone Credit Union Bill was required.  A working party comprising representatives of my Department, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the Credit Union Advisory Committee and the Irish League of Credit Unions was convened to identify the parameters for this new legislation.  The Bill before the House is consistent with heads agreed on the basis of the working party's conclusions.  If it was felt that legislative change was required in the late 1980s, it is even more urgent in the second half of the 1990s.</P>
    <P>Many credit unions are now offering services to their members that were never envisaged in the original legislation, and there is clearly a need to provide a proper statutory basis for current credit union operations as well as establishing a framework for the future development of the credit union movement in the years ahead.  With a sum of the order of £2 billion currently invested in the 434 credit unions based in the State, and notwithstanding the record of credit unions and the league in protecting members' savings, there is also a need to update the supervisory powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies since the last legislative change in 1978.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Credit Union Bill, therefore, is to consolidate all existing credit union legislation and to provide an updated framework for the development and regulation of the credit union movement in the future.  Unlike the 1966 Act, which continued to rely on provisions in the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts as far back as 1893, this Bill for the first time constitutes <Col N="526" /> a stand-alone measure for credit unions.  It repeals the 1966 Credit Union Act in its entirety as well as those parts of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts which formerly dealt with credit unions.</P>
    <P>There are many positive features to the Bill. First, the Bill supports and protects the essential ethos of the credit union movement.  Credit unions are non-profit-making financial co-operatives; they are mutual organisations and they exist only to serve their members and their members' community.  They provide a mechanism for redeploying the savings of credit union members to benefit and support the financial needs of other members of their community.  This has been achieved down the years through a largely volunteer and part-time workforce in the best traditions of community self-help.  All members of the movement, whether or not they are actively working in their credit union, are helping their community by investing their savings in that community.</P>
    <P>A second positive feature of the Bill is that it provides a framework for the development by credit unions of additional services beyond traditional savings and loans.  A number of credit unions are now selling insurance products and providing foreign exchange, and there is an increasing desire on the part of credit unions to exploit the opportunities afforded by technology for the development, for example, of an ATM network.  The provision of this framework in the Bill addresses a long-standing demand of credit unions which are anxious to provide improvements in service and a greater range of services for their members.  Many credit unions have shown commendable initiative in starting to provide some additional services on a pilot basis, but credit unions in general are very conscious that a lot of work lies ahead in bringing their services up to date.</P>
    <P>Third, the Bill adopts new limits for shares, deposits and loans.  For example, it accords greater scope for credit union members to increase their shareholding in their credit union. A new ceiling of £20,000 is included.  This represents a substantial increase on the current limit of £6,000 per credit union member which has been in place from the mid-1980s and provides considerable scope for credit unions to continue to grow their own resources.  These new resources will help provide an enhanced capital base which will allow them to expand and improve the range of services which they offer to their members.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House places a similar limit on the amount of deposits which may be held by each member and on the amount of a loan which any credit union member may receive.  A positive change in the area of loans is the removal of the maximum loan period of five years contained in the 1966 Act.  The new Bill enables up to 20 per cent of credit union loan funds to extend beyond five years and up to 10 per cent of loan funds to cover periods exceeding ten years.  Credit unions, therefore, are being enabled to extend their services <Col N="527" /> into medium and longer-term lending in a controlled manner.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the financial limits for shares, deposits and loans have attracted a lot of attention since the Bill was published.  While I am anxious to hear the views of the House in this area, it is only proper that at the outset of our consideration of the Bill, I outline the basis for the limits chosen.  First, the strength of the credit union movement is in catering for the personal financial needs of its members.  Credit unions are not commercial, for-profit banks and they are not building societies.  I do not believe that they should become banks or building societies.  It is my view and that of the Government that credit unions, in remaining faithful to their members, should not seek to diversify their activity into corporate or other commercial business.  One effective means of achieving this is to cap the amount of shares, deposits and loans applying to individual members of a credit union.</P>
    <P>Limits were a feature of the Credit Union Act, 1966, and its associated regulations, and in including limits in the Bill the Government is doing no more than maintaining an existing principle, one which I believe has broad support within the credit union movement as a whole.  I would also stress that banks and building societies are not free of controls either.  They too are supervised and regulated, and deposit and lending policies are also controlled by the Central Bank.  All financial institutions must be so controlled in the interests of savers, society and the integrity of the monetary system.  In this sense, there is nothing unique about the regime for credit unions.  It is part of the wider, necessary supervisory and regulatory system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins) Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the development at Mullaghmore, the Government decided on 28 March 1995 that the then application for retention and planning permission which had been lodged with Clare County Council was to be withdrawn and a management plan for the greater Burren area was to be prepared and presented for consideration by the public and interested parties.  As the Deputy is aware, this resulted in <Col N="528" /> the Burren National Park Study being published and released as a discussion document on 22 February 1996.  This study recommended that a network of facilities be provided throughout the north Clare area.</P>
      <P>This has resulted in a planning application for an entry point to the Burren National Park being lodged on 24 October 1996 with Clare County Council.  This entry point, I emphasise, is not a visitor attraction in its own right but part of a coordinated package of measures which will entail the provision of visitor facilities at the three population centres of Corofin, Kilfenora and Bal-lyvaughan in line with the policies that I have endeavoured to pursue since becoming Minister.</P>
      <P>A new visitor facility will be located at Corofin from which the national park will be managed.  It is proposed that this facility will comprise an audio-visual show, a graphic interpretative display, a nature study room for school groups, the park management headquarters and support for the Corofin Heritage Centre.  As regards Kilfenora, negotiations are well advanced between the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service of my Department and Comhar Conradh na Boirne which operate the Burren Display Centre and I hope these discussions will be fruitful.</P>
      <P>As I stated on previous occasions, it is relatively harder to identify how the recommendation made in the Burren National Park Study with regard to interpretation in or around Bally-vaughan might be carried out.  That said, however, officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department are exploring various options with regard to the interpretation of the Marine-Burren interface.</P>
      <P>I have previously indicated to this House that my main objective is to ensure that real and widespread consultation will take place with all interested parties before any decision is made on the siting of such visitor facilities.  Each such facility must be considered as a unique project, sited to minimise any adverse environmental impact and to maximise the economic benefits to the local community.  Such facilities are best sited in population centres.</P>
      <P>As regards the amounts paid to consultants for studies of the Wicklow and Burren National Parks, the Deputy will appreciate that, where a competitive tendering process applies, as is the case in these two instances, it is not the practice to release details of costs.  Considering the broad area covered in both studies and the subsequent recommendations made in relation to proposals which will help to develop the social and economic infrastructure of the various locales, these studies are excellent value for money and will prove their worth in the future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  As he pointed out, this House debated the Burren plan and he met a number of deputations from County Clare on this issue.  Could the Minister give us a timescale for the implementation of this plan?  I agree that consultation is important. <Col N="529" /> Perhaps he could also give us further information on the ongoing discussions with Corofin, Bally-vaughan and Kilfenora because I understand the Office of Public Works visited the Kilfenora Display Centre last week.</P>
      <P>The taxpayers should be aware of the costs of these studies.  Will the Minister agree that the study carried out by RPS Cairns on the Wicklow National Park seems to be the same as the Killarney park management plan and the Brady Shipman &amp; Martin plan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the hands of Clare County Council which has requested further information from my Department on an aspect of our application.  That information has now been provided. When a decision is taken on that application, we will be able to proceed with the other elements.</P>
      <P>There may be a need for further talks in Ballyvaughan and I am assessing the report on the Kilfenora talks.  I do not intend to cause undue delay if we can reach agreement on such consultations.</P>
      <P>As regards the costs of the studies, if we have learned anything from this saga it is that one cannot ask people to choose between expenditure in the shortest possible time and at the lowest possible figure but at the price of public consultation. One could not put a figure on the value of public co-operation.  The difference between the new projects when they come to fruition and what was originally envisaged is that while they will not have the 100 per cent support of everybody, they will have gone as near as possible to achieving a consensus, which is valuable in itself.</P>
      <P>It is not appropriate for me to make a comparison between the Wicklow and Killarney studies and others.  In a study with ecological, economic and social frameworks, there will necessarily be an overlap.  However, I have every confidence that the public got value for money in the Wicklow report.</P>

If there have been further express signals, of which the Deputy is aware, since 2 p.m. from Clare County Council to the Department, I will deal with them on my return.  On the timescale, there will be no undue delay.  If there had been at the very beginning a consideration of the complexity of the issue and a desire to consult properly, we would not now be involved in this process.  I will not join the Deputy in casting an aspersion on the consultants' study in Wicklow.  I am happy that the public got value for money in that case.</P>

      <P>I have not been concentrating my valuable time on investigating the source of the leaks.  I circulated the memo to my colleagues in Government in November.  A version of this memo appeared in a popular newspaper and a second version appeared in another newspaper in January and February.  What appeared in the newspapers contains some of the elements of the memo properly circulated to my Government colleagues. I cannot control matters in relation to the dissemination of documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met the trade union groups since publication of the Green Paper.  I am seeking the Government's permission to publish my legislative <Col N="531" /> proposals for discussion with interested groups.  The Bill will deal with most of the matters discussed in the newspapers, including public service broadcasting at a time of rapid technological change, the concept of regulation in a new environment, the future of Teilifís na Gaeilge, major sporting and special events, heritage matters in respect of which one might wish to protect the public's right of access, the structure within which new technologies might be developed and governance structures.  I will discuss all these matters once the heads of the Bill have been approved by Government.</P>

      <P>It is over a year since the publication of the Green Paper.  Will the Minister agree that he has had ample time for a discussion of his proposals in a White Paper and that we should have the legislation in front of us for implementation?  Will he agree that all we have to go on is the information leaked to the newspapers? RTE, as we know it, is likely to be dismantled, yet the RTE Authority and other interested parties within the broadcasting industry have not been consulted on the matter.  Will the Minister agree that the trade unions are worried about the proposed commission and the mixing of editorial and administrative structures? They are of the view that this approach should not be taken.  They are also worried about the privatisation of elements of the national public broadcasting service.  I presume they are referring to transmission facilities.  Does the Minister intend to hive these off?</P>

Every single matter raised by the Deputy can be the subject of consultation but I am at a loss to understand her attitude.  If I move forward, she will say that I am rushing the legislation and if I consult, I am delaying the process.  I wish she would make up her mind.  I can only state the facts.  I profoundly disagree with her suggestions and will be consulting on every one of them.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht</askee>
      <Quest>the number of farmers who will be affected by the designation of special areas of conservation; the number of these farmers who have been notified to date; and the agreement reached with the farming organisations in relation to consultations and compensation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins) Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that there are about 10,000 landowners/occupiers in areas to be designated as special areas of conservation.  The process of notification of proposed SAC designations will begin after I make regulations to give effect to the EU Habitats Directive.  I propose to sign these regulations on Wednesday next, 26 February.</P>
      <P>Since the middle of last year, I and my officials have had 15 meetings with farming organisations on all aspects of the implementation in Ireland of the Habitats Directive, including compensation for any restrictions arising.  There have also been a number of meetings with conservation interests. Considerable progress has been made on many issues, including compensation, procedures for consultation, conditions for farming in SACs, and on an appeals system.  It has been agreed that compensation will be payable for income and capital losses arising for farmers as a result of SAC designations.  The form and level of compensation is still under discussion and thus it would not be helpful to comment further on this issue at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process which will ultimately lead to SAC designation will begin when my Department writes to landowners/occupiers known to own or use land in proposed SACs.  They will receive <Col N="534" /> details, including maps, of the designation proposals, the conditions applicable to the sites, and information on appeals and objections mechanisms and compensation arrangements.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department will shortly initiate an intensive campaign to inform people about SACs and their implications and to offer detailed information.  Details of designation proposals will be advertised in local newspapers and on local radio.  These advertisements will inform the public of the designation proposals and give contact details, including a freephone information line which my Department will operate.  Public meetings will be held in various locations around the country at which staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service will listen to the concerns of farmers and others and explain exactly what SAC designations mean.  Those affected by designation proposals will have three months during which they can object, on scientific grounds, to the proposal. They can also object to the conditions proposed for their lands.  An independent advisory board will be appointed with equal representation between landowners and other conservation interests and with an independent chairperson to make recommendations to me on objections to designations or levels of restrictions arising from SAC designations.  Independent arbitration will also be available on the level of compensation to be paid, in the event of agreement not being reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the arbitration system?  Has compensation for turbary rights been discussed; and if so, what has been the outcome of those discussions?  Has compensation for those who collect seaweed along the seashore, which is used, as the Minister knows, for fertiliser, formed part of the discussions and, if so, what was the result of those discussions? What compensation is likely for those who have fish farms in an area which is designated as a SAC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Detail of the compensation has not been finalised so I am not in a position to give a detailed answer to the Deputy, but I am anxious to answer the questions she raised, which are very reasonable.</P>
      <P>Turbary and seaweed rights formed part of the talks.  In all of these talks, which we completed on Monday evening with the farming interests, there were requests for a period of time to consult with component organisations on the details of the discussions to date.  That is why I propose to sign the regulations next Wednesday.  That will simply implement the directive in a legal sense.  The process of designation is a subsequent one and the talks dealt with designation and issues of appeal and compensation.</P>
      <P>I recall clearly that turbary and seaweed rights were addressed.</P>

      <P>I note with interest that the Minister intends signing this directive next Wednesday.  Will he name the organisations with whom he has been consulting?  We all know that the IFA has been in consultation with the Minister and that it wrought a number of concessions due to its good powers of negotiation.  Are we, as Members of the Oireachtas, excluded from this process of consultation?  We have not yet been given the opportunity, even with the imminent signing of the directive, to debate the issue in the House or in committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The organisations which have been consulted include the usual representative conservation organisations who are aware of what has been happening, as well as the farming organisations.  There were a number of positive discussions with the ICMSA very early on.  There have been several meetings with representatives of the IFA.  All of the organisations were consulted.</P>
      <P>When Ireland joined the EU, it took responsibility for the implementation of directives.  We have been in default of our obligations to the Union by not implementing this Directive and signing it into law.  The signing of it simply establishes that about which we are speaking.  The designation is the important part, and it is on that point that there was need for consultation.  There was considerable confusion in the minds of the public about the process of signature and designation and I decided it was best to proceed with consensus and to have as many things dealt with as possible.  Hence, I allowed extra time for this.</P>
      <P>It is not true that the House will not have an opportunity to discuss it.  I have indicated to the Whips that when matters have been agreed between those involved, the farmers on one side and those with conservation interests and the public on the other, I will facilitate Members who wish to table a motion to note the process of designation and its outcome.</P>

      <P>The question seeks information from the Minister on the agreement on compensation and he referred to his discussions with various organisations.  He has not informed Members of this House of any of the details of the proposed compensation package.  That is a matter of extreme importance and of great concern to constituents in western constituencies who will be seriously affected following the implementation of this directive.

      <P>Unfortunately, it is very difficult to elicit answers from the Minister.  Will he agree that a large number of people, some of whom are involved in agriculture, are not represented by any of the organisations he mentioned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be as positive as I can.  There are those who are interested in conservation. One does not have to own land to be interested in the value of the directive or conservation. There are those who farm.  I am restraining myself in regard to Deputy de Valera's reminders to me about my constitutional role and returning to consult Members.  Deputy de Valera seeks to confuse matters deliberately in regard to the process of signature and designation. One could argue it is irresponsible to join the European Union and be unwilling to allow a discussion on the text of a directive &mdash; that is the signature process.  On the designation process the proposals must be submitted to the Government and Europe.  If people want to accelerate the process, they can do so by tabling a motion to note the proposals that are being made and agreed widespread support for this.</P>
      <P>I will afford Members an opportunity in the House to discuss the question of consultation.  It is nonsense to say there is not much point in discussing it after the signature process because Deputies are aware we cannot change the terms of a directive before us for signature before we discuss its implementation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is of importance to a large number of people but we have elicited very little information from the Minister on it.  There is no confusion in my mind on the difference between signing the directive on whatever date he chooses and its implementation.  I am asking <Col N="538" /> questions about the way in which farmers will be compensated for losses they will incur because of the major changes in the farm practices they will have to implement to comply with the terms of this directive.  Why is the Minister so reluctant to take Members into his confidence at this stage when he is having discussions on these details with outside organisations?  I am conscious this directive has been under discussion for many years.  Opposition Members dealt with this directive at meetings when other parties were in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No farmer participating in the schemes that will arise in adjusting the designated areas will be at a loss.  I look forward to hearing Members' reflections on it in the House.  After the signing of the directive, there will be a process of advertisement, provision of maps, consultation, the provision of a freefone service and information. Instead of the type of reluctance represented by some Deputies about this, a large number of people are looking forward to this new type of ecological management which implementation of the directive will mean.</P>

      <P>Níl soláthar sonrach i Vóta mo Roinne i mbliana le haghaidh caiteachais ar bhóithre sa Ghaeltacht. Tá mé sásta athbhreithniú a dhéanamh, áfach, roimh dheireadh Aibreán i gcomhthéacs chaiteachas mo Roinne ar oibreacha eile.

      <P>Rinne mé fiosrúcháin leis an Roinn Chomhshaoil faoin scéal agus chuir siad in iúl dom go bhfuair na Comhairlí Contae seo a leanas airgead breise i 1996 i gcomparáid le 1995 do bhóithre contae:&mdash;</P>

Nuair a cuireadh deireadh leis an scéim sin agus nuair a tugadh an t-airgead don Chomhairle Contae, scaipeadh an t-airgead breise sin ar fud an chontae uilig.  Níl ach mionlach ag an Gaeltachtaí ar na comhairlí contae áit a mbíonn an t-airgead seo á roinnt amach.  Is buille tubaisteach é sin do na ceantair iargúlta ar fud chósta iarthar na hÉireann go bhfuil an scéim curtha ar ceal ag an Rialtas seo.  Is iad na daoine áitiúla atá thíos leis agus tá na bóithre ag titim as a chéile ina lán áiteacha agus gan aon seans ann go bhféadfaí iad a fheabhsú faoin scéim atá an Rialtas seo tar éis a chur i bhfeidhm in ionad na seanscéime.

If an opportunity presents itself for me to visit Ring, I will be delighted to do so.

      <P>Faoi mar a chuir mé in iúl don Teach mar fhreagra ar Cheist Uimh 60 ar 8 Deireadh Fómhair 1996 agus ar Cheist Uimh 38 ar 28 Samhain 1995 tá sé mar chuid thábhachtach de Chlár an Rialtais chun Athnuachana go leanfar le bearta a chur i gcrích, trí chláracha gníomhaíochta Ranna Rialtais agus Eagras Stáit, le feabhas a chur ar an bhfáil, i gcoitinne agus go háirithe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, ar sheirbhísí Stáit trí Ghaeilge agus go dátheangach.</P>
      <P>Tá sé de cheart ag saoránaigh gnó a dhéanamh le hEagrais Stáit trí Ghaeilge nó trí Bhéarla de réir mar a roghnaíonn siad.  Ní mór go mbeadh seirbhísí á dtairiscint agus ar fáil gan cheist i nGa eilge chomh maith le Béarla agus go bhfeiefeadh an pobal go bhfuil fáilte roimh aon saoránach a roghnaíonn gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>Tá na prionsabail thuasluaite mar bhunchloch do na cláracha gníomhaíochta i dtaca le seirbhís trí Ghaeilge nó go dátheangach atá tarraingthe suas ag Ranna Rialtais agus ag Eagrais Stáit agus a bhfuil comhordú ar na feidhmeanna comhairle teagmhála, tuairiscithe agus measúnaithe ina leith á dhéanamh ag Bord na Gaeilge i gcomhar le mo Roinn féin.</P>
      <P>Cé go bhfuil dul chun cinn áirithe á dhéanamh maidir le feidhm a thabhairt do na pleananna gníomhaíochta, ní leor é.  Níl sé sásúil go mbeadh eagrais Stáit ag déanamh neamhaird de pholasaí teanga an Rialtais chomh maith le bheith ag séanadh a gcearta ar dhaoine gurb í an Ghaeilge a rogha teanga.  Caithfidh Rúnaithe Ranna agus Príomhfheidhmeannaigh na n-eagras Stáit athscrúdú a dhéanamh ar a bhfuil i gceist sna Treoracha agus sna Treoirlínte agus féachaint chuige go dtosnófar ag feidhmiú dá réir.  Scríobh mé chuig gach Aire arís an mhí seo caite ag iarraidh orthu iarracht speisialta a dhéanamh chun a gcearta teanga a chur ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag an bpointe seo measaim gurb é cur chuige na gcláracha gníomhaíochta agus feidhmiú na dtreoirlínte an bealach is fearr faoi láthair chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh agus, mar sin, níl sé beartaithe agam tabhairt faoi Bhille Cearta Teanga a ullmhú ag an am seo.  Mura n-éiríonn leis an gcur chuige sin, áfach, caithfear smaoineamh <Col N="545" /> ar iachall áirithe dlíthiúil a chur ar Ranna agus eagraíochtaí Stáit chun a cearta teanga a thabhairt don phobal.</P>

Tá toradh an suirbhé sin ag an Aire agus d'eisigh sé ráiteas faoi; aontaíonn sé leis an méid atá á rá agam.  Níl ann ach polasaí agus níl aon dualgas reachtúil le comhlíonadh ag an Stát maidir leis an nGaeilge.

Is trua go mbeadh sé sin ag teastáil: má léann éinne an tuarsacáil a luaigh an Teachta, feicfear go bhfuil taithí measctha ann: tá eagrais ann a dhein iarracht mhaith ach glacaim leis go bhfuil eagrais eile ann, cuid acu ina n-eagrais Stáit, nach bhfuil sásta iarracht cheart a dhéanamh.  Agus is iadsan a léiríonn an gá a bheidh ann go reachtaíocht.  Tá mé sásta an cheist sin a chíoradh.

Tá sé ráite agam cheana go ndéanfaidh mé é má tá sé ag teastáil. Tabhair seans dom.  An rud atá tarlaithe le píosa fada ná go raibh stádas bunreachtúil ag an nGaeilge agus bhí seans ag páirtí an Teachta an stádas sin a dhearbhú trí pholasaithe éagsúla.  Ach bhí saghas cur i gcéill ann i leith na Gaeilge a chuir déistean ar a lán daoine agus a chas iad i <Col N="546" /> gcoinne na Gaeilge agus tá níos mó déanta le cúpla bliain anois le daoine a mhealladh ar ais go dtí an Ghaeilge agus tá dul chun cinn déanta.

Ach i gcás na nGlasaigh i gContae an Chláir, tá siadsan fós ag fanacht le ráiteas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only answer questions in this House as Minister.  The process of reflection suggested by Deputy Sargent occurs to me regularly but, equally, I would respond in the same vein.  All I would hope for at this stage is that people would understand what I am trying to do, which is to resolve a matter with the greatest degree of consensus possible.  It is already a matter of public record that a planning application was lodged on 24 October 1996 with Clare County Council in respect of a limited level of visitor facilities to accord with the relevant recommendation in the Burren National Park study.  It is not correct to say I am using Gortlecka instead of Mullaghmore to confuse people.  When one applies for planning permission one has to give the correct address on the planning application. I am amazed at the number of people who have sought to see something sinister in that.  I have also said it is not an installation in its own right, it is an entrance arising from a proposal in the study.  The application made by the Commissioners of Public Works on my behalf is for permission for an entry point at Crag Road, Gortlecka and Knockaunroe through the Burren National Park comprising covered waiting area, toilets, ranger accommodation, ancillary parking, storage and signage.  The application proposes the removal of some elements and the retention and completion of other elements of a previously proposed visitor centre which will otherwise be backfilled and the land reinstated to its previous condition.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy de Valera's responsible question about whether there had been any further application from Clare County Council, I have given the information I am aware of, but if there are others in my Department &mdash; and there may well be &mdash; we will compile them and answer the question speedily.  She is entitled to that information. I apologise if I gave the impression that there are no further applications when in fact the Deputy may be aware of some.  If so, we will compile that information and respond.</P>

      <P>I will answer the question directly.  I am not entitled to impose my personal will on the resolution of any problem.  My personal opinion always has been that places of great scenic beauty and ecological interest should be left alone as much as possible and that visitor <Col N="549" /> facilities should be structured in areas of population. We have tried to bring the community together through a consultation process.  If I am not entitled to impose my personal will &mdash; I am not seeking to do so &mdash; it is important for those of us who are concerned about Clare and want a resolution of the issue that it be seen there are no winners or losers.  It is not a case of people getting everything they ask for.  There are matters that have yet to go before the courts.  There are also planning matters.  Deputy Molloy knows my view and what I am trying to do.  As in many other areas I am trying to achieve the best result possible by listening and consulting.</P>

I ask him to listen to a view I heard on New Year's Day around Gortlecka and Mullaghmore that the area was too valuable from an ecological and scenic point of view to have any facilities located there. The view was that it should revert to its natural state when the hazel and natural vegetation would quickly colonise and the area would, once more, become one of wild beauty.</P>

I ask him to use his considerable influence with many of our mutual friends to put to an end the dishonest suggestion that I used Gortlecka on the application as a way of masking Mullaghmore.  That is not the case.  The planning application is for an access, not a set of visitor facilities.</P>

      <P>The closing date for receipt of completed applications for assistance under Phase II of the cultural development incentives scheme, which was advertised on 15 November 1996, was 10 January 1997.  A detailed assessment of all applications received, including two applications in respect of projects in County Cavan and four applications in respect of projects in County Monaghan, is under way.  Following completion <Col N="550" /> of the assessment process, the advisory committee for the scheme will make recommendations to me regarding the level of funding, if any, that should be offered to individual projects.  The purpose of this process is to ensure that the best projects, taking all factors into account, emerge and are offered support.  I am aware of the Deputy's interest in the matter and I expect decisions will probably be made in early April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister justify allocating £39 million, under the cultural development incentives scheme, to 24 counties while excluding counties Cavan and Monaghan?  How can he justify allocating £9 million to his own county of Galway when there were outstanding projects for Cavan and Monaghan?  There is no shortage of newspaper reports in which the Minister was condemned out of hand for his neglect of those two counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This figure arose because people included the capital moneys for which I had responsibility.  For example, I have responsibility for piers in Inis Meán and Inis Mór.  When these capital moneys are added to the other moneys a certain percentage is arrived at.  To the best of my knowledge the sum spent in Galway, under this scheme, is about £1.345 million out of an allocation of £23 million.  The arts projects are assessed by the Arts Council while museum projects are assessed by the Heritage Council.  The projects are put on a shortlist and sent to an evaluation committee, on which the General Council of County Councils, the County Managers' Association and others are represented.  The committee draws up a shortlist which it submits to me.</P>
      <P>When the Deputy checks the facts I am sure he will want to withdraw the suggestion that I spent £9 million on projects for my constituency.

      <P>On the figure of £350,000, the Galway Arts Centre received £250,000, a cultural centre in Inis Oirr received £90,000, and the Galway Municipal Theatre received the remainder. The other figure included projects in Westport and Westmeath.  The applications for projects in Cavan and Monaghan will be treated fairly.  I agree with the Deputy about the importance of funding for arts and cultural projects in these counties.

The Minister sent me the list he read in reply to a parliamentary question.  Counties Cavan and Monaghan have been neglected by the Minister in so far as arts and cultural issues are concerned.

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>The appropriateness of the nature and level of the limits included in the Bill has generated comment by the movement.  The average shareholding of a credit union member is £1,000, while the average amount which such a member would have on deposit with a credit union is £100.  The average loan to each member borrowing from a credit union is £2,000.  When these are considered by reference to the £20,000 figure included for shares, deposits and loans in the Bill it is clear that substantial scope exists for credit unions to increase the level of share and deposit holdings of their members.  The same holds true for the credit unions' loan book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third issue which had to be taken into account is the relatively favourable taxation regime which credit unions enjoy, almost uniquely, among financial institutions.  They enjoy an exemption from corporation tax as a result of their non profit-making status.  More relevant to the question of shares and deposit limits is the subject of DIRT.  Savings in credit unions are not subject to DIRT, although members are required to declare dividend and interest income from their credit union savings in their tax returns.  I have no idea how faithfully credit union members discharge their liabilities in this regard, but the figures I have given for their average share and deposit holdings suggest that, by reference to current <Col N="553" /> experience, the average liability to DIRT is small.</P>
    <P>In changing the limits the Government had to take account of the favourable tax status of credit unions at this time.  In respect of corporation tax, this favourable treatment is fully justified by the social and mutual purpose of credit unions and the significant role they play in community life. However, it is also necessary to ensure that credit unions are not used as <i>de facto</i> tax avoidance schemes by unscrupulous individuals with significant personal wealth.  Neither the Government nor, I am sure, the League of Credit Unions wants such individuals to play ducks and drakes with the system, as a recent correspondent on the subject of taxation and credit union accounts memorably puts it.  Consequently, by raising the shares limit to £20,000 the Government has sought to strike a fair balance between giving scope for further credit union development while taking into account the experience to date.  The Bill provides that these limits may be increased at a later date as circumstances require.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the attention of the House to a number of modern legislative provisions to support the credit union movement.  The Bill includes updated provisions relating to the arbitration of disputes between a member and his or her credit union and makes improved arrangements for amalgamations or transfers of engagements between credit unions.  It also translates into credit union law the arrangements relating to winding-up in companies legislation, subject of course to appropriate changes, adopts the administration concept found in the Insurance Acts and allows for examinership.  In the case of the latter, the Bill takes on board a number of the recommendations made in the Company Law Review Group report.  Although these changes have yet to be implemented in company law, they are being included in this Bill as evidence of the Government's firm commitment to introduce state of the art credit union legislation.  I will elaborate on these changes later.</P>
    <P>A final significant feature of the Bill is the updating of the supervisory arrangements for credit unions.  As I already indicated, this work is discharged by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and his staff, who are attached to my Department. The registrar already has certain powers in this area under existing legislation, and these are being maintained and updated as necessary in the Bill.  In response to the desire of credit unions to expand the range of additional services which they may offer, the registrar will be given new powers to enable him to satisfy himself as to the capability of the credit union to undertake the additional services which it wishes to offer.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the wider scope of this Bill relative to existing legislation in such new areas as administration and examinership, the registrar will also be given a role in such areas to facilitate the orderly regulation of credit union affairs.  The registrar's decisions are subject to appeal in the High Court, <Col N="554" /> to ensure that he cannot overstep the powers given to him in the Bill.  The registrar is the State's supervisory and regulatory watchdog in regard to this part of the financial and monetary system.  The registrar is to Credit Unions what the Central Bank is to banks and building societies.</P>
    <P>Part I covers the first five sections of the Bill and contains a number of standard preliminary provisions.  Part II, comprising the next 20 sections, outlines the conditions for, and procedural provisions relating to, the registration of a credit union and its rules.  It deals with amendments to a credit union's name and registered rules.  It also establishes the conditions for membership of a credit union, and provision is made for a member's withdrawal or expulsion.  A right of appeal to the courts is provided against specified decisions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the credit union.</P>
    <P>A member may nominate in writing to the credit union a person or persons to become entitled to his or her property in the credit union on death, and necessary consequential and procedural provisions are stipulated.  Where no nomination has been made, the board of directors has discretion within certain limits to distribute or make payments from a member's property in the credit union to the person or persons whom the board judges proper to receive it in the event of the member's death, mental disorder or disability.</P>
    <P>Part III, which deals with the operation of credit unions, covers sections 26 to 52 inclusive, and sets out a number of the key parameters within which credit unions must operate.  It specifies that a credit union may do anything consistent with its objects, subject to the right of a member or the registrar to apply to the High Court to restrain a credit union from doing any act or thing which it has no power to do.  The general provisions relating to shares and deposits in the credit union include that the amount which a member may invest in shares and deposits may not exceed £20,000 in each case which is £40,000 in total savings; the dividend on shares may not exceed 10 per cent per annum; different interest rates on deposits may be set from time to time and the credit union may require minimum withdrawal periods of 60 and 21 days for shares and deposits respectively.  Subject to certain conditions, borrowing by a credit union is permitted.</P>
    <P>A credit union may also make a loan to a member, subject to a ceiling of £20,000, and a maximum interest rate of 1 per cent per month shall be charged on the amount outstanding.  Certain limitations on the period of loan offered also apply.  A credit union or a person acting under its authority may make, accept or endorse a promissory note or bill of exchange; make, vary or discharge contracts and acquire land for the sole purpose of conducting its business.  A credit union may, in addition, invest its surplus funds in a specified manner and establish a special fund for social, cultural or charitable purposes, subject to certain conditions.  It must also meet certain <Col N="555" /> requirements with respect to, for example, the establishment of a reserve, its participation in a savings protection scheme and the maintenance of insurance against fraud by its officers.</P>
    <P>Subject to the agreement of its members and the registrar's approval, a credit union may provide additional services to its members.  However, under the Bill, a credit union is prohibited from offering loans, subject to a condition that a member shall avail of an additional service.  A right of appeal to the High Court is provided against a decision of the registrar in this area.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals generally with the management of credit unions and extends from sections 53 to 76 inclusive.  It specifies, for instance, the general functions and duties of the board of directors, the supervisory committee and the other officers of the credit union, and outlines a number of associated procedural requirements.  Provision is made for the manner of their election, appointment, resignation, suspension and removal, for the remuneration of the treasurer and the payment or reimbursement of expenses to other officers.  A general prohibition is applied against any officer participating in a decision in which he has an interest and against any officer or voluntary assistant disclosing any information relating to the affairs of a credit union.  Officers and voluntary assistants who have receipt or charge of credit union funds may be required to provide security and shall be required to account for their actions.</P>
    <P>A credit union is also required to maintain a register and duplicate register containing certain specified information relating to its members and officers.  It must also make available for inspection by its members an abbreviated register containing certain particulars from the register.  On the application of 30 members, the registrar may appoint an accountant to examine the books and documents of the credit union.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill sets out in sections 77 to 83, inclusive, the arrangements for the notification, convening and conduct of the credit union's initial organisation meeting, its subsequent annual general meetings and any special general meetings.  The registrar, a body administering a savings protection scheme or a qualifying group of members may require the holding of a general meeting.  The credit union's tradition of one member one vote, irrespective of the size of the member's shareholding, is confirmed and the right of members to demand a poll on the questions before a general meeting is protected.  The registrar may also attend and be heard at a general meeting.  The requirements for the adoption and commencement of special resolutions are also specified.</P>
    <P>Part VI comprises sections 84 to 106 inclusive and contains a number of important provisions relating to the control and supervision of credit unions by the registrar.  It specifies that the registrar's role is to protect members' funds and the financial stability of credit unions generally.  To <Col N="556" /> that end he is given power to require credit unions to comply with certain specified ratios and may also issue directions in regard to advertising by credit unions.  In specified circumstances, the registrar may issue regulatory directions to a credit union in regard to the conduct of its affairs, subject to a right of appeal by the credit union to the High Court.  The registrar may also invite the court to confirm a regulatory direction, prohibit a contravention of the Bill or cease the provision of the additional services offered under Part III.</P>
    <P>While such regulatory directions are in force, winding up and other specified proceedings may not be initiated except by leave of the court.  In addition, the registrar may appoint an authorised person to inspect the books and documents of a credit union.  Under specified conditions he may appoint on his own initiative, or at the request of 30 members, an inspector to investigate its affairs or call a special general meeting.  Matters relating to the conduct of such an inspection or investigation, the subsequent report and possible prosecution proceedings are also dealt with.  On foot of an inspection or investigation, the registrar may appoint a director to the board of a credit union or suspend or remove from office one or more directors or members of the supervisory committee.  The registrar may also suspend or cancel the registration of a credit union.  In these cases, a right of appeal to the High Court is available to the person or persons concerned.</P>
    <P>This Part of the Bill also imposes obligations on the registrar.  For instance, he is required to prepare and maintain a public file on each credit union, and the Minister may prescribe fees for the exercise by the registrar of his functions under the Bill.  Certain administrative provisions relating to the classification of information and the delivery of documents are also included.  The Minister may authorise assistant registrars to perform the functions of the registrar who is required to produce an annual report to the Minister which shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill covers sections 107 to 124 inclusive and deals with the accounts and audit of a credit union.  It specifies the financial year of a credit union, the accounting principles to be followed, keeping proper accounting records and the maintenance of adequate control systems.  It establishes the duties of the directors in regard to the format, content and audit of the annual accounts and the report to members and provides that the Minister may make regulations regarding such matters.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in this Part for the election, appointment, resignation and removal of the auditor of a credit union and for the notification, convening and conduct of general meetings relating to the auditor.  His rights to obtain access to information and his duties to report to members on the state of affairs of a credit union are also included.  The registrar may also require the auditor to report to him on specified matters.  Officers and voluntary assistants of a credit union are required to give the auditor every assistance in <Col N="557" /> the preparation of his report.  In addition, the credit union is required to make available a copy of its annual report and accounts to the registar and to its members.</P>
    <P>Part VIII, comprising sections 125 to 127, inclusive, deals with the resolution of disputes and complaints relating to credit unions.  It provides that disputes between a member or former member and a credit union shall be settled in accordance with its rules, which decision shall be binding on all parties.  In certain circumstances, a member may apply to the Circuit Court to settle the matter.  Provision is made for the application of the arbitration Acts to the settlement of disputes and for making ministerial regulations relating to the establishment of a credit union complaints investigation scheme.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill from sections 128 to 132 inclusive provides for the amalgamation of two or more credit unions and establishes the necessary procedures for the approval of the terms of the amalgamation by special resolution of the members and for registering the rules of the successor credit union.  The procedures include the preparation of an information statement by the credit union for its members, the application to the registrar for confirmation of the proposed amalgamation, the publication of the necessary notice and the subsequent distribution of any funds to members.  Similar provisions are included in this Part where a credit union proposes in this Part where a credit union proposes to transfer its engagements to another credit union.</P>
    <P>Part X sets out in sections 133 to 136 inclusive the arrangements for the winding up of a credit union.  It provides that the registrar may, in certain circumstances, apply to the High Court for an order to wind up a credit union.  It also provides that a credit union may be dissolved in accordance with the Companies Acts by members or creditors.  An instrument of dissolution is required to contain specified information that shall be sent to the registrar for registration.  The credit union shall be dissolved from the date of advertisement of the dissolution, subject to a right of application to the High Court by a member or other person having a claim on the credit union's funds.  The registration of such a credit union may only be cancelled after the fulfilment of specified conditions.</P>
    <P>Part XI, covering sections 137 to 141 inclusive, applies to credit unions the concept of administration which is found in the Insurance Acts. The intention is that a credit union administrator would be appointed where a credit union was being mismanaged rather than necessarily having serious financial difficulties.  Provision is made for the appointment by the High Court, on the application of the registrar, of an administartor, or a provisional administrator, to carry on the affairs of a credit union as a going concern.  The effect of an administration order on a credit union is stipulated, and various procedural matters, including the termination of administration in certain circumstances, are dealt with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> Part XII proposes to apply the option of examinership to credit unions and extends from sections 142 to 170 inclusive.  Deputies will recall that the first 1990 Companies Act introduced the concept into Irish law, and it has since been frequently used to save companies which have found themselves in serious trading difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Company Law Review Group, in its first report in 1994, made a number of recommendations to improve the examinership process.  The principal recommendations made by the group which are now incorporated into this Bill are that (i) the petition to the court for the appointment of an examiner must be accompanied by the report of an independent accountant on the credit union's affairs; (ii) the court must satisfy itself that there is a reasonable prospect of the survival of the credit union as a going concern before it decides to appoint an examiner; and (iii) the general time period for examinership should be reduced from three months to 70 days.</P>
    <P>The examinership Part of this Bill provides for the appointment by the High Court or, in certain circumstances, by the Circuit Court of an examiner to a credit union if it appears there is a reasonable prospect of survival.  A petition to the court may be made by specified persons and must be accompanied, <i>inter alia</i>, by the report of an independent accountant containing certain information. In exceptional circumstances the court may allow the petitioner a period of no more than ten days for the submission of the report to the court before the petition is heard.</P>
    <P>A credit union shall be deemed to be under the protection of the court from the date of presentation of the petition.  The effect of such protection on the status of a credit union is described, and the court may make such orders as it thinks fit where a reciever or provisional liquidator already stands appointed to the credit union.</P>
    <P>The powers of an examiner are defined in this Part, and specified persons are required to cooperate with him in his work.  In consultation with members and creditors, the examiner shall prepare for consideration by the court a report containing proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement.  The court may also hold a hearing where evidence exists of a substantial disappearance of credit union assets.  Various procedural provisions are included related to the appointment of an examiner and the court's adjudication of his proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement.</P>
    <P>Part XIII deals with offences and civil proceedings in sections 171 to 179 inclusive.  It outlines the general provisions relation to offences which may be committed by credit unions, their officers and other persons for contravening the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The final Part of the Bill, Part XIV, provides in sections 180 to 188 for the maintenance of the statutory Credit Union Advisory Committee, the making of ministerial regulations under the Bill and various matters relating to records, documents and notices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> It is clear from this extensive summary that the Bill before the House is a lengthy measure.  I said at the outset of my remarks today that the Bill's overall structure and content is attributable to the extensive consultation process which took place between Government and the credit union movement over a number of years.  For my own part, I have had six formal meetings with the Irish League of Credit Unions representatives since taking responsibility for credit unions.  In addition, I addressed each of the last two annual general meetings of the league.  On every occasion the Bill was the main agenda item.</P>
    <P>It is unique in my experience that any economic sector should have been given the freedom to develop the legislative blueprint for its own future.  The movement has therefore had a major formative influence on the Bill.</P>
    <P>After the heads of the Credit Union Bill were agreed by Government, the league sought the continued involvement of the registrar in developing the detail of the Bill.  This in itself is a reflection of the interest and long-standing commitment of the league to the development of the Bill, and it is one which deserves a special mention by me today.  These further consultations resulted in a substantial measure of agreement between the league and the registrar by mid-1995. While there were certain areas where both parties agreed to disagree, the thrust of many of the Bill's provisions will be recognised from that agreement.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the agreement between the league and the registrar, it is the case that certain credit union interests have expressed reservations about various elements of the Bill.  In part this is due to the fact that since the agreement with the registrar was concluded, the Irish League of Credit Unions sought the inclusion of new provisions which were not previously part of the credit unions' agenda.  In some cases, I have not found it possible for policy reasons to accept the content of the agreement between the league and the registrar.  In other cases the parliamentary draftsman, together with the Attorney General's office, has determined that the terms of the agreement between the league and the registrar, or of the new proposals which came forward to me from the league, were either inappropriate or unworkable.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that in the movement's initial reaction to the Bill, misunderstandings and misapprehensions came to light as to the Government's intentions in one or two important areas. I would cite as a prime example section 41(4) dealing with the property of a credit union.  This reads: &ldquo;If the whole of a building held by a credit union ceases to be occupied for the purposes of the business of the credit union, the credit union shall dispose of its interest in that building as soon as it is practicable to do so.&rdquo;  Apparently this has been read to mean that where any part of the building held by a credit union ceases to <Col N="560" /> be occupied, the credit union is required to sell the building.  The opposite is, in fact, the case.</P>
    <P>The section is intended to mean that where the entire building ceases to be occupied, the credit union shall be sell the building.  Nor does it mean that the credit union cannot take in a tenant, lease part of the building and so on.  It is my intention to resolve such misunderstandings before the Bill completes its passage through the House.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of attending, addressing and responding to questions and comments at the special general meeting of the Irish League of Credit Unions last month which was specifically devoted to considering the terms of the Bill.  In this way I have been made aware at first hand of the views of the credit union movement on some of the Bill's detailed provisions.  Since the league's special general meeting, officials from my Department have had lengthy meetings, at my request, with the registrar and the league over a number of days to discuss the league's particular concerns.  I am pleased to report that all parties to the meetings felt the discussions were constructive in seeking to resolve a number of the league's difficulties.</P>
    <P>I have also received advice in recent weeks from the statutory Credit Union Advisory Committee and from individual credit unions.  In addition, representations have been made to my Department by other interests ranging from Government Departments to competitor savings institutions such as the banks and building societies. I should stress I have not yet met representatives of the banks or other savings institutions in relation to this Bill.  The Bill, as published, arises entirely out of the consultation process with the movement and the advisory committee, the parliamentary draftsman's consideration and my own judgement.</P>
    <P>The two-month period since the publication of the Credit Union Bill has proved to be beneficial in helping me to review a number of the Bill's provisions, and it is my intention to meet shortly with a number of the interested parties to discuss some of the details of the provisions.</P>
    <P>I said on its publication that the Bill is in good shape, primarily because of the expert contributions the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the credit union movement have made in its preparation. I would like the House to be aware, however, that arising from ongoing consultations, I expect to table on Committee Stage a number of amendments to the Bill following contacts with the offices of the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General.  I have no doubt that new issues will arise during the course of our debate on Second Stage which will give further cause for reflection on my part.  I assure Deputies opposite that I am open to considering all of the views and comments which may be made on the Credit Union Bill.</P>
    <P>I want this Bill to maintain the fundamental ethos of credit unions as community self-help institutions. In addition, I want to see them remaining <Col N="561" /> as important providers of personal finance to their members.  Correspondingly, I do not want to see them becoming banks or building societies.  This of necessity implies that some differentiation between credit unions and other financial institutions must be made in the Bill.  I am also anxious that the registrar should have appropriate supervisory controls over credit unions as they develop and expand their range of services.  Credit unions have an excellent track record of security for their members' savings, and I want the registrar to be able to act where necessary to resolve any emerging difficulties arising in any individual credit union, thereby preserving their excellent reputation as sound, community-based financial institutions.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This Bill is dear to my heart and the Minister of State's comments have not impressed me.  A series of meeting have taken place about this legislation.  The Minister of State said he attended a special meeting in Limerick. At that meeting a motion, requesting the meeting to instruct the league board to convey to the Minister that the Bill as published is unacceptable and to engage in negotiations with him with a view to securing amendments in line with the views expressed by the movement, was passed. The meeting dealt with many of the Bill's provisions, including the restrictions on credit unions, recognition of the league, pension schemes and new services under section 48.</P>
      <P>The Bill has given rise to a great deal of discussion among credit unions.  The Minister of State described it as a state of the art Bill.  I challenge that view because there is nothing new in it.  It merely erodes the influence of credit unions and the voluntary concept established over many years.  It also erodes the worthwhile provisions of the 1966 Act.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement has a successful national profile.  There are approximately 432 credit unions here with in the region of 1.6 million members.  Savings through credit unions amount to almost £2 billion and loans to approximately £1.5 billion.  There are approximately 600,000 borrowers and 10,200 volunteers working in credit unions.  The credit union movement operates on a voluntary basis.  It employs approximately 172 full-time and 583 part-time employees and this legislation attack the ethos of that organisation.</P>
      <P>I have first hand knowledge of what a credit union means to a local community.  It permeates every fabric of Irish life, it transcends the ruralurban divide and the political, religious, cultural and social life of our people.  Credit unions have lifted local communities out of poverty, unemployment and the hands of moneylenders.  They have given hope and dignity to people whose futures were very bleak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twenty years ago Tallow, a small town in east Waterford, had a high unemployment rate and very little going for it.  It got its first lift when a credit union was set up in the town.  An unoccupied <Col N="562" /> building was purchased, an enterprise centre was set up and approximately 100 jobs were created in ten years.  While 100 jobs may not be great in national terms, they are crucial in Tallow.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear parochial, but I must refer to Mitchelstown Credit Union, one of the largest and most successful credit unions in the country.  It developed, not due to a marketing campaign, but because of the service it provided to its members.  It is owned by members, run by members and sets out to serve their needs.  It has 4,000 young members and is one of the most innovative in the country in terms of new services, but they will be eroded by this legislation. It operates an ATM system and issues travellers cheques and foreign currency without commission. It also operates a children's savings scheme and was the first credit union to introduce savings stamps.  Its members travel to schools in the area to organise saving schemes among school children.  That credit union is community based and promotes many projects in the area.</P>
    <P>There is a strong commitment to the co-operative movement in Mitchelstown.  The success of the credit union was probably based on the philosophy of Horace Plunkett.  It is basically and agricultural area and in recent years the credit union established an agricultural committee.  Mitchelstown credit union is innovative, it operates on a voluntary basis and is well managed, but all its good work will be destroyed by the provisions of this Bill.  That credit union also operates a direct savings scheme for workers who can have their cheques paid into the credit union by their employers.  It also operates general and motor insurance schemes and has succeeded in eroding the urban-rural divide in the area.</P>
    <P>In national terms most people's lives have been improved by the credit unions.  Approximately half the country's population are members and in an election year it is important that we cater for those members.</P>
    <P>It would be great if the Government could claim credit for the good work of credit unions. We can be proud of what the credit union movement has achieved.  It is the most successful co-operative movement in the country.  It has enabled many people to become self-reliant and has created a community spirit among our people. The co-operative concept is strong in the Munster area.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that people and can be motivated by something other than material gain.  Credit unions do not make profits.  They are owned by members, run by members and are for the good of members.  Anybody who wishes to join can do so.  They are fundamentally different from other financial institutions and levelling the playing pitch should not impact adversely on the credit union ideal.</P>
    <P>If we are to believe the contents of the explanatory memorandum, the Bill has two main purposes, to provide for the development of credit unions and for increased regulation of the movement. In the past each credit union regulated its <Col N="563" /> own affairs.  We tend to go overboard with regulations. We should model ourselves on North America in this regard where there is very little regulation in a free market society that has large scale development and job creation.  If we over-regulate our credit unions we will simply kill the goose that lays the golden egg and destroy the voluntary concept that has developed in the credit union movement over many years.  Who will give up their free time to work in credit unions if they are subject to regulation by a faceless person in Dublin who has little interest in his or her local area?</P>
    <P>How can the Minister of State claim the Bill provides for the development of credits unions when they will be restricted in what they can do for their members?  The Bill restricts the amount of savings a member may have with a credit union, but there is no reason for such a restriction. Under current legislation people may save as much as they like with a credit union.  Is such a restriction a good development?  I do not believe so, and I will elaborate on that matter further if I have time.  The Bill also restricts to £20,000 the amount a credit union may lend&mdash; up to now the only restriction was the provision relating to 10 per cent of assets.  I understand the Minister's position, but in this day and age £20,000 is considered a very small loan and would not buy a 1200cc car or a new kitchen for the home.  Many credit unions have undertaken developments.  One credit union in the greater Dublin area grants substantially higher loans than that provided for in the Bill.  How can we regulate for what was done in the past?  The restriction is ludicrous and, instead of helping to develop credit unions, will retard their development.</P>
    <P>Up to now a credit union could invest in property or otherwise to benefit their community, but under this Bill they will be unable to buy property or invest funds over and above 0.25 per cent of surplus funds in the social and cultural aspects of their community.  Is that development?  The Minister indicated his intention to bring forward amendments and I urge him to apply commonsense in doing so.  The limit on loans should be based on a percentage, taking into account the size of credit unions, and members should have the right to decide what they wish to do with surpluses. The credit union in the Rosses in Donegal, with 250 members, would be considered a small credit union while the credit union in Tullamore has in the region of 25,000 members.  It is unacceptable to apply the samelimit in all cases. Lending by credit unions should be based on their membership and asset value.</P>
    <P>The Bill is modelled on the operations of the Central Bank, which controls the banking system. The Minister said he received several submissions, but it seems as if he only met people from banks and other financial institutions, otherwise somebody in his Department favours the banking system.  The banking ethos is evident throughout the Bill.  As a member of a credit <Col N="564" /> union, I believe it is not in the interests of banks and other profit-makers to operate on a corporate basis.</P>
    <P>In recent days we saw the results of the privatisation of a building society.  I support privatisation and believe in the free market, but people should not be allowed to earn £500,000 per year. Those people claim they deserve large salaries because the success of their companies depends on their management, but nobody is worth that amount of money.  In addition, many of those people have shares in the equity market, which have grown enormously.  We must curb the granting of such large increases in salaries, which is evident not only in the financial area but in all sectors of industry.  It is not good for society to see a small number of people getting such large salaries and it is very annoying to people who work hard and receive a mere 3 or 4 per cent increase each year.  We must legislate to prohibit the granting of very large increases in salaries because it has a bad influence on the community. While that practice is allowed in other areas, credit unions, which are voluntary organisations, are being restricted under the Bill.  There is a clear message there and we must take up the challenge in that regard.</P>
    <P>The 48 per cent provision relating to new services is ludicrous because it would take more than two years to introduce even the smallest service. Is the Minister seriously suggesting such a procedure is necessary for a credit union to, for example, make available a bus ticket to its members?  Surely there is a difference between the development of a major service and meeting the simple needs of members.  Many credit unions have not considered introducing new services. Will each credit union have to apply to the registrar to put a new service in place?  In that event the registrar would have to examine the accounts, which could take up to two years as there is a huge backlog in the office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  If additional staff are necessary to do that job, who will pay them?  Will that be a further cost on credit unions?</P>
    <P>I do not know who advised the Minister, but the provisions to be introduced by regulation are very offensive to credit unions.  Not alone does the Bill provide for the proper regulation of credit unions, it seeks to take over the entire movement. It dictates who shall sign cheques, who shall be paid, from where a credit union may borrow, how much it may lend to an individual and for what duration and who can be appointed to and removed from the board.  If the voluntary board member fails to comply with the provisions, he shall be guilty of an offence.  Beleaguered credit unions seeking release from the State will have to find considerable funds because their only right of appeal is to the High Court.  An amendment is necessary in that area and we on this side of the House intend to put forward such an amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The impact of the Bill will be to frighten credit union volunteers.  That is of concern to many <Col N="565" /> people whom I and my party have met.  A large number of representations have been received about this matter, including one received yesterday by Deputy Liam FitzGerald from Trinity Credit Union Limited, Donaghmede, Dublin 13.</P>
    <P>The strength of the credit union movement lies in the autonomy of each credit union and the fact that responsibility for the proper management of funds rests with the members.  Under the Bill that position will be changed.  There will be many empty buildings because the members will be frightened away, and the drive, philosophy and ethos of the movement will be killed.</P>
    <P>The following letter appeared in <i>The Examiner</i> of 13 February 1997, headed &ldquo;New law will hamper credit unions' ethos&rdquo;, written by Paddy Candon, Raheen, Rosbercon, New Ross, County Wexford, who, I understand, is a very influential man in the credit union movement, a sincere individual who believes in what he says:</P>
    <P>The Minister of State for Commerce, Science and Technology, Mr. Pat Rabbitte, has rightly and laudably acknowledged the self-help and mutual character of Credit Unions and is concerned that its ethos be preserved.</P>
    <P>The ethos of Credit Union is, of course, the ethos of co-operation, a distinct socio-economic system based on a set of well-defined principles.</P>
    <P>These principles underpin three fundamental. strands in the social and economic development of persons and groups:</P>
    <P>They uphold the dignity of the individual.</P>
    <P>They ensure fair sharing of the fruits of labour.</P>
    <P>They promote subsidiarty, encourage self-reliance and empower people to provide for all their needs through their own efforts.</P>
    <P>This is the real Credit Union ethos, which was uppermost in the minds of the founders of the movement in Ireland in the 1950's.  We tend to overlook the motives which promoted the pioneers to introduce Credit Union to Ireland.</P>
    <P>They were concerned that, having provided a mechanism &mdash; the Credit Union &mdash; for people to control their financial destiny, they would then begin to provide their other needs &mdash; food, housing, work, education, health-care etc. for themselves.</P>
    <P>Credit Unions have now reached a point in their development where this &ldquo;second-phase&rdquo; development can begin in a structured way.</P>
    <P>Legislation which arbitrarily and without good reason, hinders or frustrates this development is damaging the &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; which is of such concern to the Minister.</P>
    <P>If people, through their credit unions, supported by enlightened and enabling legislation, can achieve this independence, the pressure on Government agencies will be progressively lightened.  The benefits to society are limitless.</P>
    <P>The unnatural &ldquo;caps&rdquo; on shares, deposits and loans, the excessively intrusive regulatory regime, the frustration of the organic evolution of the Movement through Chapters and <Col N="566" /> League, limitation on the right &mdash; a natural right &mdash; to own property, all of which are features of the proposed legislation are anti-social.</P>
    <P>The overall thrust of the Bill is intrusive, tending to centralised control which is unwarranted in a movement which, founded on principle of self-help, self-regulation and self-responsibility &mdash; principles which should be encouraged in other areas of economic and social activity &mdash; has demonstrated the value of the co-operative approach to solving our problems.</P>
    <P>In a society notorious for over-centralisation, and attempt at centralised control of a social movement which has demonstrated brilliantly for over 40 years the value of genuine decentralisation is politically misguided and an insult to the intelligence and humanity of the 1.65 million voters and their families who have created the movement.</P>
    <P>This Bill takes away from the ethos of decentralisation. It will have a retarding effect on the movement because of the way it has been regulated over the years under the supervisory authority of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  This Bill has not recognised the role of the Irish League of Credit Unions, which has done great work since its foundation.  Were it not for it, we would not be debating this Bill.  The Irish League of Credit Unions should be the regulatory authority, rather than the friendly societies.  Its supervision, control and interest in this area must be admired.  Not one penny of members' money has been lost over the years and I am not aware of any volunteer having been charged in court for mishandling moneys.</P>
    <P>What registrar of friendly societies will do the work of 13,000 volunteers?  The last report the Registrar of Friendly Societies produced was for a number of years up to 1993.  He inspects credit unions only and it takes him up to two years to process their annual returns.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Water and Sewerage Schemes.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The three villages of Jamestown, Drumsna and Rooskey were part of a four village scheme originally earmarked for Cohesion Funds.  However, in 1996 the Minister for the Environment made a decision to remove the Dromod scheme from the four village proposal. I was glad that money was made available this week for the scheme and I thank the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three villages of Jamestown, Drumsna and Rooskey are located on the banks of the Shannon. The people have had major problems with <Col N="567" /> septic tanks and the ground on which they are built.  These four schemes should have been processed together.  What action has the Minister taken since he decided in July 1996 not to sanction these three schemes?  I appeal to him to allow the schemes to proceed.</P>
    <P>The need for these schemes is without question and the Minister has acknowledged that.  The local authority and county councillors have been pressing for some time for these schemes.  Sites are needed for new houses in these villages, particularly since two of them are located within a mile of the Masonite plant which has the potential to employ over 300 people.  It is imperative that action is taken to allow these sewerage schemes to proceed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to review the situation and to arrange for the provision of funding for these schemes this year.  The Minister may say they are of relatively minor importance in the overall sewerage systems proposed for the rest of the country, but they are of major importance to the areas concerned.  If these villages are to develop to their full tourism potential, they must have proper facilities such as a sewerage system. I hope the Minister will have good news for these villages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the need for sewerage schemes for the villages of Jamestown, Drumsna and Rooskey is fully accepted in the Department.  However, before going into detail in relation to them, I would like to refer to the broader picture in relation to water and sewerage services in County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>The provision of a modern environmental infrastructure in support of the whole economy is a high priority for this Government.  This commitment has been, and continues to be, well demonstrated by the huge investment in the water services programme throughout the country.  This week the Minister, Deputy Howlin, announced a greatly expanded water and sewerage capital programme for 1997.  At £150 million, this is the largest annual programme in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>County Leitrim benefits from this high level of investment in water and sewerage projects by the Government.  The south Leitrim regional water supply is a major project costing approximately £6 million, which has been funded by the Exchequer and is due to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition, Leitrim is benefiting considerably from EU funding.  Under the INTERREG II Programme, a European Union initiative for Border areas, Leitrim County Council is continuing with the planning of new sewerage schemes at New-towngore and Keshcarrigan, so that construction can commence this year, as well as improvements to the Carrick-on-Shannon sewerage scheme. These schemes will cost £750,000 approximately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of particular relevance to Leitrim is the application made to the European Commission for <Col N="568" /> Cohesion funding for the Lough Gill regional water supply scheme.  That application included a major water supply scheme for north Leitrim to include Drumkeerin, Manorhamilton and Dromahaire at a cost of over £9 million.  The Commission decision last July did not, however, approve the Leitrim schemes.</P>
    <P>In view of the need to provide the necessary infrastructure for this part of the county, the Minister has included the Manorhamilton water supply scheme in the 1997 work programme.  The local authority can proceed with the planning of this scheme.  The initial estimate is that it will cost £1.8 million approximately.  It will be funded from Exchequer sources.</P>
    <P>The continued development of the Shannon waterways is fundamental to the development and expansion of the local economy.  It is the Minister's priority to ensure the quality of water in these systems is maintained at its current high standard.  The Department has, accordingly, submitted an application to the European Commission for Cohesion Fund assistance to provide essential sewage collection and treatment systems in a number of towns and villages in Counties Leitrim, Cavan. Roscommon and Longford.</P>
    <P>Stage 1 of the scheme, costing an estimated £14.5 million, includes the Drumsna and Dromod sewerage schemes costing £625,000 and £800,000, respectively.  Stages 2 and 3 provide for a period of assessment of the results of the investment in stage 1, the construction of studge management facilities and the planning and construction of other projects which are deemed necessary as a result of the monitoring programme.  This will result in a follow-up application for Cohesion funding, if proven necessary, for Jamestown and Rooskey.</P>
    <P>The initial application was submitted to the Commission in December 1994.  To date, there has been no decision on it.  Because of the importance attached to providing amenities and infrastructure along the Shannon and to ensure and maintain a healthy environment the proposal Dromod sewerage scheme has also been included in the 1997 capital programme for water and sewerage services.</P>
    <P>I have said enough to demonstrate that County Leitrim is doing well under the water and sewerage programme.  Given the high level of demand from all areas of the country, it is simply not possible at this stage to allocate funds for every individual scheme or to say when each scheme will commence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. There are a number of Clare schools which are in great need of capital funding.  INTO representatives recently pointed out that there are at least five schools which could be described as nothing <Col N="569" /> less than a disgrace and which are in need of immediate attention.</P>
      <P>I have raised the matter of Kilmurry national school on a number of occasions.  I am again seeking support from the Department which has received the sketch plans.  The board of management wishes to send a deputation to the Minister to secure a commitment that capital funds will be provided next year.  A sum of £80,000 is required to enable the school maintain its high standards with the assistance of teachers, students and the local community.</P>
      <P>Tumagraney national school is also experiencing problems.  On 4 August 1994 the board of management received a letter from the Department in which it stated that a grant of 85 per cent was available to upgrade sanitary facilities at the school which were deemed to be inadequate.  It has been in touch with the Department on a number of occasions since then.  On 3 February it received what it considered to be a most disappointing response from the Department which stated that it was not in a position to increase the level of funding towards the cost of the project.</P>
      <P>Kilkee primary school likewise is experiencing problems.  It is awaiting the green light to allow the project to go to tender.  According to one of its teachers, in recent days there was a pool of water in one of the classrooms due to the bad weather in the west.  As well as being damp, there are no facilities for teachers, no indoor toilet facilities and no drinking water supply.</P>
      <P>The board of management, teachers, students and parents are extremely frustrated at the lack of action on the part of the Minister.  It is their hope that she will regard the matter as urgent. The local contribution has been collected.</P>
      <P>The new building for Gaelscoil Mhichíl Cíosóg in Ennis is badly needed.  The school has approximately 200 children and seven teachers in prefabs on the Gort road at Cois na hAbhna.  For some years the board of management has been working to secure a new building.  Further action is not required before inviting tenders to build the new school on land purchased by the Department near St. Claire's school.  The project was included on the list of schools to be included in the 1997 primary school capital budget published in <i>The Irish Times</i> last year.  This was in accord with the repeated indications from the Department.  The project is not included, however, on the more recent formal list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the parents have spent in the region of £10,000 to maintain the school buildings in their present condition, it is not worth spending any more money on them.  They are considered to be highly dangerous, because of cramped conditions, and genuinely unsafe.  As the Minister is aware, the teachers have decided to go on a one day strike on Monday, 24 February to draw attention to the matter.  A public meeting held on Tuesday, 11 February supported them fully and agreed to press for three demands, namely, that the gaelscoil be included in the 1997 primary school capital programme, that tenders be invited immediately <Col N="570" /> and that construction commence before 31 May.</P>
    <P>Knockanean national school is seeking funding for an extension but has been ignored to date by the Department.  Inis Cealtra national school is experiencing similar problems.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I hope the Minister will provide some practical help and not express pious platitudes.  Following a review of the primary school capital programme I hope she will be in a position to make further announcements before the summer break.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining my Department's position on capital funding for primary schools.  She is well aware of the cuts imposed in the period 1988-92 during which her party was in Government.  Since 1993 real progress has been made and communities throughout the country have benefited from increased investment in the primary school capital programme.  On taking office, the Minister was faced with a backlog of 300 major projects requiring urgent attention. Since 1993, major projects have been undertaken at more than 200 schools and grants have been paid in respect of more than 7,000 applications for assistance.  In this period, the Government allocated more than £97 million in capital funding to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this very significant progress, the Minister is aware there are a number of other primary schools, including schools in County Clare, in urgent need of funding.  The Minister recently authorised the progression of 27 projects to tender and contract stages.  However, there is need to keep tight control on finances and it was not possible to include all deserving projects in this process. The Minister will keep expenditure on the primary school building programme under review during the year and assure the House that schools in County Clare will receive every consideration at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the difficulty facing a number of schools in County Clare and is committed to eliminating all substandard schools on a phased basis as resources permit.  It is her intention to release a number of additional projects to tender and contract on a phased basis later this year.  The number of projects released will be contingent on the level of existing contractual commitments and the capital allocation available to the Department.  For this reason, the Minister is not in a position to identify specific projects which could be released later in the year.  The relevant boards of management will be informed when a decision has been reached within the Department.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Naas (Kildare) Secondary Schools.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Pupils from neighbouring rural schools are finding it increasingly difficult to <Col N="571" /> secure places, at secondary schools in Naas, County Kildare.  This cannot continue.  I am most familiar with my village, Caragh, County Kildare, but similar problems are experienced by neighbouring villages.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, Naas has been the urban centre to which the rural community of Caragh gravitates both for commercial and social purposes. Historically, parents in Caragh have had the option of sending their children to three second level schools.  Pupils have been refused places in the school of their choice and this has caused terrible problems for many families.</P>
      <P>There are 802 pupils attending St. Mary's secondary school at present.  It was built to accommodate 600 pupils.  Seven of the classes are in prefabs, two of which are 30 years old.  The extension to the school is at stage three and when those plans were submitted it was intended that the extended school would cater for 800 pupils.</P>
      <P>The school intake is 150 first year pupils, and 52 students are already on the waiting list for first year in 1997, seven of whom live in Naas.  There is a waiting list for every year from first to sixth, and the school cannot provide leaving certificate applied because of the existing accommodation crisis.</P>
      <P>There are 730 pupils attending the CBS in Naas.  It was also built to accommodate 600.  The new extension opened just last weekend and it was one of the most pleasant functions I have attended since my entry into public life since it was my old school where things have changed a great deal.  That school has four prefabs and no art room.  These are excellent schools but we place a terrible demand on them to try to provide students with an education.  They should be facilitated better than they have been to date.</P>
      <P>As the second level schools are based in an urban centre, it appears the urban population is getting priority of access to secondary schools. Families who have lived in adjacent rural areas for generations and who choose to send their children to rural schools do not seem to be given priority in the criteteria for enrolment.  This policy discriminates against rural communities and it cannot be tolerated.  The message to families in rural Ireland is that we cannot guarantee their children a place in a second level school unless they come and live in the towns.  We have a duty to the rural communities and it is important that the Minister addresses this issue.</P>
      <P>While I recognise the numbers attending secondary schools are in decline in many parts of the country, this is certainly not true of Naas and the surrounding area.  The town and its neighbouring villages continue to grow and unless the Department of Education takes action the situation will become chaotic.  Pupils who attend rural schools are entitled to the same access to secondary schools as their urban counterparts.  Urgent action is now required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Power for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to clarify the position on behalf of the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>There are three post primary schools catering for pupils in the Naas catchment area.  These are:</P>
      <P>The convent secondary school, the CBS and the vocational school.  The indications are that the three schools have sufficient pupil places between them to accommodate all pupils seeking second level places for next September.  The difficulty would appear to be that some pupils are unable to gain a place in the school of first choice.  The current policy on multi-school centres where there are a number of schools in the centre, as in Naas, is to ensure these schools can cater for all pupils seeking second level places.  This may result in pupils not getting a place in the school of first choice.  The Department must ensure, however, that existing accommodation is fully utilised, before providing additional accommodation.</P>
      <P>A building project has been approved for the convent school and this project has gone to tender. This will enable the school to cater adequately for its current enrolment and when completed, will not significantly alter the level of places available each year in the school.</P>
      <P>The CBS has applied for a permanent extension to the school.  This application is currently under examination in the planning section of the Department.  In the course of considering this application, a thorough examination of the overall needs of the centre, including the needs of the CBS, will be carried out.  Account will also be taken of the new housing developments in the area.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise, however, that before any additional permanent pupil places can be provided, the Department must ensure the existing places are fully utilised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I am delighted this subject has been chosen as I have been seeking to raise it since before the Christmas recess.  I am very concerned that if something is not done quickly to remedy this situation in Tullamore Garda Station, we could be here some day discussing a serious accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tullamore Garda Station is totally inadequate for today's needs.  It breaches health and safety standards and fire regulations in a number of serious respects.  A total overhaul and provision of a considerable extension is necessary as it is totally inadequate to serve the main town of <Col N="573" /> County Offaly as well as quite a large part of that county.  It needs to be fitted up not for the needs of the 1930s, when it was built, but for those of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I impress on the Minister the urgency of beginning building work as soon as possible.  I am quite concerned about the safety hazard it presents. The station was built in the early 1930s and was adequate to cater for one sergeant and 12 gardaí who were all male.  Today the building must cater for a staff of 47, seven of whom are women including three gardaí, three clerical workers and one cleaner.  It is unacceptable that there are not rest room facilities for the female clerical staff.</P>
    <P>The station has two cells that could not be described as luxurious accommodation.  Last year 500 prisoners passed through them.  As Tullamore is the main court centre in north Offaly, prisoners are held in the station regularly on their way to and from court.  The catchment area served by the station is approximately 40,000.  There is a greater demand on those facilities because of recent legal difficulties regarding court locations.  A number of courts that were held in other areas are now held in Tullamore.  Yesterday five prisoners were held in the two cells and there is no separate cell or toilet for female prisoners.  Members of the public do not have any privacy to conduct their business in the public office.  They must do so at a hatch open to intrusion from other members of the public and the gardaí.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that fire regulations are being breached daily at the station.  A fire officer inspected the building in late 1995 and discovered a number of serious breaches of the regulations. The only stairs in the building is a wooden structure. I would hate to be upstairs if there was a fire.  There is no fire alarm, fire escape or fire doors in the station.</P>
    <P>While space is not available in many stations to build an extension, in Tullamore adequate space is available at an adjoining site to build one.  The fire station vacated its premises next door when a new fire headquarters for the county was built some years ago.  Its previous premises is in public ownership.  It would be very straightforward to build a large extension, renovate the current building and provide the town and the county with a Garda station adequate to meet the needs of today.</P>
    <P>The Department, the Office of Public Works and the Garda authorities have given this matter attention.  I am concerned they might propose a short-term solution which would be a waste of money in the long-term.  Up to £90,000 could be spent providing a short-term measure to address the health and safety issues, but an adequate job could be done for approximately £200,000.  The matter is being examined by the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice and I expect decisions will be made in the coming weeks.  I urge the Minister to communicate with the Minister for Justice and impress on her the urgent need to deal with this matter to ensure we will not be back here debating a tragedy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gallagher for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to explain the latest position regarding work on Tullamore Garda station.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are proposals for a major extension and refurbishment of the Garda station and to provide the necessary room for expansion the former fire stations building adjacent to it has been acquired by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the accommodation provided in Tullamore Garda station is less than adequate.  As the Deputy knows, she visited the station in March 1995 to view conditions there. He can rest assured she fully appreciates the need for speedy improvements and the station has been accorded a high priority on the Garda building programme.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that concern was expressed about fire safety in the building.  The Office of Public Works recently provided an estimate of the cost for fire and safety works and an on-site meeting took place yesterday to examine this issue as a matter of urgency to see what remedial action can be taken.  It was agreed to provide an external fire escape stairs, an emergency lighting system and cabinets to enclose the fuse boards.  The Office of Public Works has been requested to carry out these works immediately. I assure the Deputy the Minister is following the matter very closely and is concerned that whatever remedial action is needed to ensure the health and safety of gardaí and staff working in Tullamore Garda Station is taken as quickly as possible.  I know that some minor measures such as the provision of fire blankets and fire extinguishers have already been taken.  Also a smoke detection and fire alarm system is being installed at present.</P>
      <P>Tullamore Garda Station is a high priority on the Garda major building programme.  However, there are a number of projects on it which remain to be completed before the major planned work on Tullamore Garda Station can begin.  I cannot, therefore, say at this stage when it will be possible to commence work on this station.  However, I assure the Deputy that the Minister is determined to tackle the problems there as soon as possible and there will be no avoidable delay in upgrading the facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to stress a great deal of work has been done in recent years to improve standards of accommodation at Garda stations around the country.  However, it is a large scale operation. This programme of improvement has a high priority with the Minister and the Government. This year more than £9 million was provided for building and maintenance of Garda stations.  The gardaí occupy 704 Garda stations and other accommodation, including married quarters, large complexes like Templemore and Garda Headquarters and a variety of smaller units. Many of the buildings occupied by them are old RIC and DMP stations designed for a different <Col N="575" /> era.  Many like Tullamore Garda Station need major upgrading or replacement.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work has been carried out in recent years to improve the position and I am sure Members will be aware of examples of improvements to Garda stations and of new <Col N="576" /> stations provided in recent years around the country.  Work on Tullamore Garda Station will start as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 February 1997.</P>

      <P>The medieval core of Dublin city has witnessed considerable archaeological investigation since the early 1960s.  In most instances the need for archaeological excavation has derived from the rapid pace of urban renewal which the city has witnessed in recent years.  Each individual excavation has advanced our overall understanding of medieval Dublin.</P>
      <P>My Department's remit is primarily concerned with the protection, conservation and recording of the city's archaeological heritage.  However, I am conscious that there are other &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; benefits which can be derived from this activity, which is perhaps what the Deputy is alluding to when he refers to development and promotion. Such archaeological activity does generate general economic and educational benefit, and there is an undeniable gain for the tourism interest. Excavation finds are often, initially, of only academic or specialist interest.  However, the amalgam of such data over time creates opportunities for others to extrapolate the information for the benefit of a wider audience.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>As I have stated in reply to previous parliamentary questions in this House, I published in September 1996 the report of the inter-departmental working group on strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage, which contains 64 recommendations spanning a wide range of issues.  Copies of the report are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, are currently considering the working group's report, with a view to bringing forward to Government for consideration a package of specific financial, administrative and legislative proposals, based on the recommendations in the report and taking account of observations received on those recommendations. Consideration of the issues involved is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to bring the package of proposals forward to Government shortly.</P>
      <P>As I have stated in reply to previous parliamentary questions.  I am very aware of the problem posed to owners of heritage buildings by the high costs of public liability insurance.  I understand that this is part of the general problem of the apparently high costs of public liability insurance in this country.  The issue of public liability insurance costs for heritage buildings is part of a broader issue, which is that of financial support for the conservation of buildings of heritage significance. The latter issue has been addressed in the report of the working group, who considered it more appropriate and practicable to offer financial support in this general way for the conservation of the architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>Recommendation 52 of the report proposes that public liability insurance costs be deemed on operating expenses against which full taxation relief may be claimed in respect of buildings qualifying for tax relief under section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982.</P>
      <P>Recommendation 52 refers also to the effects of the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995, on public liability insurance, both generally and in relation to listed buildings open to the public, and states that, according to the Irish Insurance Federation, the representative body for the insurance industry in Ireland, the Act would be at least one year in force before any such effects might be discernible. I understand that the main object of that Act was to simplify and clarify the law on occupiers' liability by giving it a statutory basis, and, hopefully, this will have a beneficial effect on the level of public liability insurance costs in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> I am also aware that my colleague, the Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology, Deputy Rabbitte, is currently overseeing the implementation of recommendations contained in a report entitled &ldquo;Report on the Economic Evaluation of Insurance Costs in Ireland&rdquo;, dated October, 1996, commissioned by him, with a view to reducing the burden of insurance costs, including public liability insurance costs, in the economy and improving the efficiency of the legal system as it relates to this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>No CSO statistics are available for employment numbers for the Irish film industry, because the categories in the labour force survey are too broad to allow the identification of employment in this sector.</P>
      <P>The central database on employment in the file industry is held by the audiovisual production federation of IBEC, which produces an annual report on the economic impact of film and television production.  It should be noted that, in the nature of the industry, many placements are on a short-term basis.  The annual reports of IBEC for 1993, 1994 and 1995 indicate the following number of placements in the industry: 1993: 3,772; 1994: 10,845 and 1995: 16,031.  The 1993 figure excludes details of those working on independent television production, as this information was not available at the time.</P>
      <P>In person-year terms, the figures for direct Irish employment are as follows: 1993, 480; 1994, 1,291; and 1995, 1,266.  Again, the 1993 figure excludes independent television production.</P>
      <P>I should also add that the above statistics relate to direct employment only and do not include employment generated through expenditure on Irish goods and services.  Nor do they include non-Irish residents employed on film production in this country.  Data for 1996 will not become available until the latter half of this year.</P>
      <P>The only other data available to me is in respect of 1991 and emanates from the Coopers and Lybrand Report on the Indigenous Audiovisual Production Industry, according to which, some 694 direct full-time equivalent jobs were created in both the feature film and the independent television production sector that year.  The report does not state the number of actual placements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Membership of the cinema and broadcasting branch of SIPTU also gives a good indication of the increasing level of activity in the industry.  In <Col N="583" /> December 1991, I understand that the branch had 496 members, that at the end of 1994 this number had increased to 815, that in August 1996 the figure stood at 1,378 and that at present membership totals 1,449.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Deputy's question concerning a review of the financial incentives available within the industry, I am pleased to announce that I have secured the consent of the Minister for Finance to the use of recoupments in respect of investments made by Bord Scannán na hÉireann &mdash; the Irish Film Board &mdash; from 1994 onwards, for the purpose of providing additional development and production loans to Irish producers.  The amount of recoupments currently available to the board is £764,000, but all further recoupments can also be utilised to provide additional loans to the industry.  An increase in the available amount of finance for film development and production in this country should result in a proportionate increase in employment.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the additional capital provision of £350,000 announced in this year's budget for Bord Scannán na hÉireann. This represents the State's contribution to the film training measure under the Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-99, which will be 75 per cent co-funded from the European Social Fund.  These resources are being directed entirely towards human resources training for the industry on the basis of initiatives being implemented by the national training committee for film and television.  The allocation of significant resources towards film and television will enhance the job creation potential of the sector by addressing the remaining skills shortages as well as enhancing the quality of employment by upskilling Irish personnel to better-paid employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 36 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>My reply to Question No. 126 on 22 October 1996 indicated that no application had been made or licence issued to the Ward Union hunt club under section 26 (1) (ii) of the Wildlife Act, 1976 since October 1988.  Following this reply there was an exchange of correspondence between the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department and the Ward Union hunt club in relation to the requirements for a licence under the 1976 Act for carted stag hunting.  Ultimately, this correspondence resulted in an application for a licence under section 26 (1) (ii) of the 1976 Act being submitted by the Ward Union hunt club on 30 December 1996 to the NPWS.  I understand that a number of complaints in relation to the Ward Union hunt club have been made to the Garda Síochána and these matters are currently under investigation.  In the circumstance, further comment by me at this stage would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>In meetings on 8 January last which I held with representatives of the Irish Council Against Blood Sports and the Ward Union hunt club, I had the opportunity to consider in detail the views of both organisations regarding the licensing of carted stag hunting under the 1976 Act. Following these meetings, I decided, pending the consideration and advice of the Heritage Council on the conflicting assertions regarding deer hunting, to issue a licence under section 26 (1) (ii) limited to 31 March next.  This licence is subject to the condition that I can appoint a person or persons to undertake the monitoring of the Ward Union hunt club.</P>
      <P>In relation to monitoring, an official from the NPWS monitored the hunt on 15 January last and I have since then arranged for an official from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to undertake ongoing monitoring of the hunt up to 31 March next.  The monitoring involves the furnishing of factual reports on the hunt dealing, <i>inter alia</i>, with the health and condition of the animal before and after the hunt, the treatment of the animal during the hunt, the conduct of the hunt and its followers and the impact of the hunt on the lands over which it passes.  The reports received will be passed to the Heritage Council to assist in their deliberations.  My intention is to ensure that the process of review put in place by me in relation to the licensing of stag hunting with hounds under section 26 (1) (ii) of the 1976 Act will take into account all issues and viewpoints, including those adverted to by the Deputies.</P>

      <P>At the time the certificates referred to by the Deputy were issued to the promoter's companies, there was no substantive information available to my Department indicating that the promoter was experiencing serious financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Information subsequently became available to me concerning the financial difficulties of the promoter, following the issue by me of a replacement certificate in respect of one project &mdash; which incidentally facilitated the completion of that project by another producer.  On foot of this I issued a direction to the promoter indicating that no section 35 funds were to be raised on foot of a certificate issued in respect of another project until outstanding issues had been answered to my satisfaction and this to be conveyed by me in writing. The promoter acknowledged my direction and confirmed that the equity finance and the section 35 funding sourced for the film project in question had been cancelled and would not be made available.</P>

      <Col N="588" /> I refer the Deputies to my reply to today's Priority Question No. 4 and to my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 121, 122, 123, 124 and 125 of 4 February 1997 and Nos. 55, 58, 59, 62 and 63 of 6 February 1997.</P>
    <P>Of the fifteen meetings, referred to in my reply to today's Priority Question No. 4, which I and-or my officials had with farming organisations since the middle of last year, six took place since the beginning of 1997.</P>
    <P>The status of lands in special areas of conservation (SACs) will be monitored on an ongoing basis by staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.  The conditions applying to some two-thirds of the land area of proposed candidate SACs have already been agreed by a committee comprising representatives of my Department &mdash; the Department of Agriculture &mdash; Food and Forestry, Teagasc, private planners, farming organisations and the relevant nongovernmental organisations.  I look forward to agreement being reached in a similar fashion in regard to the conditions which will apply to the remaining areas.</P>
    <P>Designation of proposed natural heritage areas (NHAs) will not take place until an amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976, has been passed by the Oireachtas.  As the designation of proposed NHAs will not result in any compulsory restrictions in farming practices, the question of compensation will therefore not arise.</P>

      <P>Media speculation on this topic talks about an environment where up to 500 channels might be available across Europe in the near future for those willing to pay for them.</P>
      <P>Given the trans-national nature of these services they will have to be regulated internationally. The regulatory framework for television across Europe is the EU television without frontiers directive, the primary objective of which is to ensure the free flow of television services across the national boundaries of the member states.  The European Commission came forward with proposals to revise the 1989 directive because the number of television channels across Europe had increased from 92 in 1990 to approximately 129 in 1993.  The revision of the directive proposes to cover new developments in the industry such as telly shopping and it also attempts to clarify the legal situation with regard to jurisdiction over cross-border broadcasting, especially where the protection of minors is concerned and it proposes new regulations on advertising.</P>

The amount of the increase in this case is £500.  However, information available to the commissioners indicates that the invalidity pension which the taxpayer receives from the Department of Social Welfare, and which is taxable, will be greater than his tax-free allowances.  As a consequence, the full amount of the pension which he receives from his former employer will be liable to income tax.  The tax rate which will apply will be 26 per cent as announced in the budget, i.e. 1 per cent lower than the current standard rate of 27 per cent.</P>

      <P>The cost to my Department of providing literature about European grants under these programmes during 1995 and 1996 was £17,785.71.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to the awarding of grants under the programmes are made by joint working groups comprising the relevant sectoral interests. The extent of co-operation between the various elements of each working group varies from group to group, and is partly dependent on the nature of each measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An unusual feature of the peace and reconciliation programme is the extent to which implementation of the various measures has been <Col N="592" /> devolved to intermediary funding bodies which are independent of Government.  This departure from the norm was strongly recommended in the course of widespread consultation in the eligible areas carried out by the EU Commission task force and the two administrations.</P>
    <P>Since that date the bodies have been actively involved in implementing the actions provided for under the measures.  ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency have set up office in Monaghan town, and all of the measures for which they are responsible are managed from there.  The office also provides a local focus for Co-operation North.  In this way liaison between the bodies is enhanced.</P>
    <P>Another innovative delivery mechanism involves county council-led task forces, operating in each of the six Border counties.  They are responsible for a wide range of actions and have a considerable degree of discretion in deciding how the allocation is to be spent.</P>
    <P>The Commission accepted that a small number of measures could not appropriately be devolved to intermediary funding bodies.  The Department of the Environment is responsible for the cross-Border infrastructure measure.

The co-ordinating committee is representative of the health board, voluntary service providers and parents and families of persons with a mental handicap.  It would be a matter for this committee to consider proposals for new services to be funded from any additional funding which may come on stream in 1997, including the proposals in question.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, additional funding of £12 million has been provided in 1997 for services to persons with a mental handicap.  Two million pounds will be used to meet identified needs in existing services.  The remaining £10 million will be used to put in place new services.  In addition to those persons with autism who will benefit from the overall provision of new residential and day care places for persons with a mental handicap in 1997, specific funding is also being allocated from the £10 million for the development of services to persons with autism in line with the recommendations outlined in my Department's policy document on services to persons with autism.  The request for development funding for the Irish Autistic Association's proposals will be considered by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee in the Western Health Board in the light of the additional funds which will be made available to the board in the near future.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a particular illness.  This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>

      <P>I am aware that in most areas there is an indefinite waiting period for the provision of secondary care orthodontic treatment for persons in category C.</P>
      <P>The health board orthodontic services are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan which provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through a consultant led orthodontic service in each health board.  A primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff.  This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and a service of high quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment it is important that resources are used to best advantage and for those most severely affected-handicapped.  Patients are, therefore, <Col N="598" /> assessed for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity-handicap.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the provisions outlined in the health strategy, the dental health action plan and the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years for developments in the orthodontic services, my Department in consultation with the health boards and their consultant orthodontists is currently reviewing the guidelines.  The objectives of this review are to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards and reduce the waiting time for treatment, having regard to the resources available to the boards.</P>

It is hoped to open Phase 1 to the public about the second half of this year.  Planning work is under way on further phases of the development which will not come on stream for some years.</P>
      <P>The new National Museum facility will provide, through the exhibition of material, including that from the Art and Industry and Folklife collections, much of it previously unseen, an outline of the history of Ireland from 1600 to the present day in a unique and imaginative setting appropriate to a National Museum at the end of the 20th century.  It will also provide much needed conservation, storage and research facilities.</P>
      <P>The theme of Phase 1 at Collins Barracks will be the excellence of craft and applied art as found in industrial and traditional products of postmedieval Ireland, hopefully reflecting the social and economic history of the period.  The teaching of industrial design and the use of craft and design to mirror the growth of the spirit of emerging nations will also be featured.</P>

This inventory will include in the case of each artefact a description of the artefact, detailed information as to its current location, as well as a photographic and paper record.</P>
      <P>Since the commencement of the programme, approximately 20,000 artefacts have been documented in the manner outlined.  Accommodation for 75 per cent of these artefacts has already been provided at the Collins Barracks facility, under Phase 1 of the development of the complex.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should also be aware that during the second reading of the European Commission's proposals for the revision of the &ldquo;Television without Frontiers&rdquo; directive last November, the European Parliament unanimously adopted an amendment which aims to ensure that the viewing public may continue to have access to major events, sports, live without the viewer having to pay additional fees for viewing.

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the increase in subhead C2 of my Department's Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> The increased funding for allocation in this subhead in 1997 in comparison with 1996 arises largely from the inclusion of a number of items for which there was no equivalent item in 1996 and from the pattern of payments for projects being assisted under the Structural Funds operational programme for tourism development.</P>
    <P>Provisions for which there was no equivalent in 1996, or in respect of which only a very small sum was provided in 1996, are those in respect of part of the exhibition fit-out costs of the inaugural exhibitions of the new National Museum facility at Collins Barracks and for part of the equipment and fit-out costs associated with the relocation of the Chester Beatty Library to the newly converted Clock Tower building in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allocations included in 1997 in respect of projects to be co-financed under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 19941999 the Deputy will be aware that the first phase of projects was approved under the cultural development incentive scheme last year.  Most of these projects were not in a position to undertake expenditure last year but commenced or are expected to commence in 1997 and payments will arise in respect of these during 1997.  Provision is also included relating to regional projects which are being co-financed by my Department under the programme i.e. the Crawford Gallery, Cork, which will commence in 1997 and a final payment in respect of the Hunt Museum, Limerick.</P>
    <P>Subhead C2 also provides funding in respect of various cultural projects and bodies which receive grants from my Department every year e.g. the Irish Manuscripts Commission, Marsh's Library, the Irish Architectural Archive, etc.  It also provides funding for a number of other relatively small projects including the James Joyce Centre, Dublin, provision for which was included in the budget.</P>

      <P>Discussions on the European Commission's proposal for a European guarantee fund to promote cinema and television production recommenced during the Irish Presidency of the EU in the second half of 1996.  These discussions had previously been suspended for some time pending receipt of clarification from the Commission of a number of concerns raised by member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a compromise proposal drafted and promoted by the Irish Presidency of the EU secured the broad support of a majority of member states at the Council of EU Culture Ministers held on 16 December 1996.  As unanimity within the Council is required if a European fund is to be established, <Col N="606" /> the Irish compromise proposal will form the basis for future work which will fall to the Netherlands Presidency of the EU.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school to which the Deputy refers has applied to my Department for additional staffing to address a range of current difficulties.</P>
      <P>The school in question is already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and as such enjoys a maximum class size of 29:1 and has the services of an ex-quota concessionary teacher post.  By virtue of its disadvantaged status, the school also receives a special increased level of capitation funding.</P>
      <P>The school in question is also included in the home-school-community liaison scheme where it shares the services of a locally based co-ordinator with another local school.  The school has also been allocated a remedial teacher post on a fulltime basis.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate teacher counsellor posts and resource teacher posts is governed by resource availability in any given year.  The teacher counsellor scheme was introduced on a pilot basis in 1995 with the appointment of 27 teacher counsellors to selected schools in the north inner city and Clondalkin areas of Dublin. The operation of the pilot scheme will be reviewed by my Department and the outcome of this review will determine the future course of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, I allocated a total of 10 resource teacher posts to primary schools. These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need as reflected by data submitted by applicant schools.  When I am next in a position to allocate additional teacher posts to special needs children, the needs of the school in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>The psychological service provided by my Department is available to a limited number of national schools, with priority given to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  Any extension of the service provided by my Department must take place on a phased basis, as resources become available for the purpose.</P>
      <P>Fourteen psychologists have been appointed by my Department in order to develop a psychological service for primary schools.  These psychologists provide a service to primary schools in the two areas which were part of the pilot project for the development of a psychological service at primary level, west Tallaght-Clondalkin and south Tipperary.  In addition, there is a service to primary schools serving disadvantaged areas in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Given the current level of staffing, it is not possible at present to offer this service in other areas.  The service is not available in Counties Louth or Monaghan.</P>
      <P>In general, the responsibility for the psychological assessment of children in national schools, where such is deemed necessary, is a matter for the regional health board, through the appropriate director of community care.  Consequently, the issue of when a psychological assessment may be arranged for the child referred to in the question is a matter for the regional health board.</P>

      <P>The operation Dóchas initiative commenced in the Dublin metropolitan area on 7 October 1996 and involves intensive policing by uniformed gardaí in areas of the city where there is greatest demand for a Garda presence.</P>
      <P>Members employed on the Dóchas initiative are primarily concerned with drugs related activity and these members are supported in this work by dedicated drug task units in each district in the Dublin metropolitan area.  It is important to note however that all members of the force have a responsibility for the enforcement of the drug laws.  The underlying philosophy underpinning operation Dóchas is that close contact and co-operation with the community is essential to tackle the level of drug abuse in those communities most affected by the problem.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that this initiative was reviewed in January 1997 and is considered successful in the context of the large number of successful searches carried out, the consequent number of seizures and arrests and prosecutions since its inception.  Based on its effectiveness, from October 1996 to January 1997, a decision has been taken that operation Dóchas will continue for the foreseeable future in its present format.</P>
      <P>In other cities and larger towns outside the DMA, all policing is carried out by the members attached to local stations who have received adequate training in the investigation of all criminal matters both during their initial training and at regular in-service training courses thereafter. In some of the cities i.e. Cork, Limerick and Waterford, these members are backed up by dedicated drug units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deployment of gardaí to meet local policing needs is constantly assessed by local Garda management in each district throughout the country.  Local circumstances and local needs in any specific element of criminal activity will vary from district to district and Garda management is satisfied that the present strategy is adequate and <Col N="617" /> sufficiently flexible to meet the many and varied demands on Garda resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>There are currently eight confirmed outbreaks of Newcastle disease in poultry in Northern Ireland.  Newcastle disease is a highly infectious disease, which affects poultry, pigeons and other birds.  While it can cause a high level of mortality amongst poultry, it does not pose any human health risk.</P>
      <P>Areas around the infected holdings have been declared infected areas and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland has imposed movement restrictions, including prohibitions on export of poultry, hatching eggs and poultry products originating within these areas, as well as slaughtering those flocks affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No case of this disease has been confirmed to <Col N="619" /> date, on this side of the Border, and in order to guard against its introduction, I have introduced the following additional measures for trade with Northern Ireland: all imports of poultry from Northern Ireland are now subject to an import licence issued by my Department; a supplementary health certification system for imports; additional controls have been put in place at the Border to ensure that no illegal movement of poultry, hatching eggs and poultry products takes place.</P>
    <P>In addition a voluntary scheme of vaccination using inactivitated and live combination vaccines has been introduced.  The vaccine is available on prescription at the request of a veterinary surgeon.</P>
    <P>I have also arranged for the issue to all flock owners and producers of an advice notice outlining the precautions to be taken and an information sheet on the clinical signs of the disease in order to aid them to protect their flocks.</P>
    <P>I would urge all involved in the poultry industry to show increased vigilance and would emphasise to producers in particular the need to be careful not to but stock from Northern Ireland without the proper veterinary certification.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the measures outlined above, taken in concert with sensible sound flock, security, strict hygiene and isolation controls will ensure this disease does not enter the State</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take to approve the 22 month special beef premium in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Waterford in view of the fact that there was enough land available as communicated to his Department and there was not a problem with his stocking density; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Payments under the 1996 suckler cow and beef premium schemes are limited by the application of a stocking density of two livestock units per hectare.  Stocking density is calculated on the basis of the forage area available to an applicant, the number of dairy cows needed to produce the milk quota, if any, allocated to the applicant and the number of livestock units represented by the number of ewes, male animals and suckler cows for which a premium application has been submitted in the calendar year.</P>
      <P>In this case the herdowner declared a forage area of 10.78 hectares and no milk quota.  This entitles the herdowner to payment on up to 21.56 livestock units.  Advance payments of 80 per cent have issued in respect of 10.2 livestock units under the beef premium scheme and 11.36 livestock units under the suckler cow premium scheme.  Payment of the remaining 20 per cent balance is expected to issue shortly.</P>
