      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 25a to 25d &mdash; Finance Bill, 1997 &mdash; Financial Resolutions; No. 3 &mdash; Bail Bill, 1997, Second and remaining Stages; and No. 41 &mdash; Youth Work Bill, 1997, Second Stage (resumed).</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) Nos. 25a to 25d shall be moved together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair; and (2) the Second and remaining Stages of No. 3 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>I understand that last night the Government circulated the draft heads of a Bill to Positive Action and perhaps other groups involved in the hepatitis C issue.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when we, as an Opposition party, will see the draft heads of the Bill?  Will he also indicate when the Bill will be presented to the House?  My party Whip has received no word that it will be listed within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>I understand from sources outside the House that the Government has set out three options in the draft heads of the Bill.  Will the Taoiseach indicate which option the Government prefers, or is it a case of trying to get the men, women and children affected by this scandal to divide among themselves?  It appears from what I have heard at second hand that the concerns of those involved in the transfustion aspect have not been addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its motion on the issue, which was debated in the House a few weeks ago, the Government <Col N="1418" /> stated that it would ask the Blood Bank to state its position regarding liability.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Government has received a reply from the bank on this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health is currently engaged in consultations on the basis of detailed documentation which is being considered by the interests directly affected.  When that consultation is concluded the Government will publish its proposals.  However, it is appropriate that the consultation proceed in its present format.  It will be pursued with great urgency and, when it has agreed on the heads of the Bill, the Government will arrange for the legal drafting of the words that will make up the statue, which is a different process to the drafting of the heads, to be undertaken with great speed.</P>
      <P>As this matter affects the rights of those concerned, it is prudent from every point of view, especially with regard to those most directly affected, that the necessary legal care should be taken with the next phase, which is the drafting of the detail of the Bill on the basis of the heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Taoiseach's reply that proposals were issued yesterday which will eventually lead to draft heads? Will he indicate if this is the reason the Opposition has not received the draft heads of the Bill, a practice which has been followed for the last 18 months or so?  When the Government announces to the media that the draft heads of a Bill have been circulated we normally receive them.  In this case we did not.  Is it the case that the draft heads of the Bill have been circulated with different options for different groups which, following consultation, will lead to the heads of a Bill and, ultimately, legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultation is taking place, which would not have great meaning if the Government had already reached definitive positions on everything.  Detailed consultation only commenced last evening when the Minister for Health gave, on a confidential basis, the documents on which he has been working to the people concerned so that they can make their input.</P>
      <P>It is sensible from every point of view that this consultative approach should be taken.  We do not intend to allow it to delay the matter and I have no doubt that those participating do not want delay either.  In view of this, I believe that the consultation process will proceed intensively and, once concluded, the Government's definitive proposals will be decided upon and published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest the consultative process is a bad idea.  However, it is amazing the media has the impression the heads of a Bill were circulated last night.  I did not give that impression.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must dissuade Members from the notion that the matter can be debated now.  Questions have been asked about the measure and replies have been given.  Let us not tend towards debate now because that is not in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle allowed us to establish that there are no draft heads of a Bill.  Did the Government receive a reply from the Blood Transfusion Service Board in relation to liability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy placed an incorrect construction on what I said.  The position is that documents which contain drafts of various proposals are being discussed.  However, they are not definitive Government proposals until the Government takes a decision on them.  It will not make a decision until consultation has taken place.  The Deputy should not attempt to put any other construction on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's second point, I suggest he table a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health.  It is a detailed matter concerning administration and it is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the heads of the Bill been approved by the Cabinet?  Will the Taoiseach consider moving the matter forward by publishing the Bill and ensuring consultation proceeds at pace following its publication?  The Credit Union Bill is a good model.  It was published and consultation continued during the various debates in the House.  A vastly improved Bill was passed last night.  It is a good example of how consultation can take place after the publication of a Bill and during its consideration.  Given the circumstances of the hepatitis C crisis, does the Taoiseach agree there is a huge onus on the Government to publish the Bill and proceed with it without undue delay?  There is delay in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a denial of the value of consultation if the Government approved and published definitive proposals before consultation took place.  The Government is acting appropriately in this matter.  It is holding consultations before the definitive proposals are published.  It is allowing those most directly affected to have their say first.  When a definitive decision is made by the Government on the proposals, everybody, including the Deputy, will have their say.  The proposals will be shaped by the consultations which will take place at all stages of the process.  However, the Government considers it appropriate to start by consulting those most directly affected first.  That is the appropriate way forward and the Deputy's <Col N="1420" /> suggestion would be an unnecessary dilution of the value of the consultations taking place with those directly affected.</P>

      <P>I did not misrepresent the Taoiseach's comments.  However, he gave the House a clear impression yesterday about this matter and it is stated in the media today that draft heads of the Bill have been published.  However, that is not the case.  The Taoiseach has given to each group options which appear to try to pit them against each other.  That is sharp practice.  I and my party have no difficulty with consultation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is important because confusion will arise from the comments about consultation and the ongoing preparation of the heads of a Bill.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that the commitment given by the Minister for Health a couple of weeks ago in a debate on an Opposition motion stands?  The clear commitment to the women involved and the House was that the Government would alter the terms of the compensation tribunal to enable aggravated damages to be awarded in the same manner as permitted in the High Court.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House there has been no backsliding on that fundamental commitment and that the women will be entitled to aggravated damages?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Our bail laws have been the subject of legitimate public concern for many years.  Since I became Minister for Justice, I made it clear that I regarded changes in our bail laws as a priority and I am proud that it is this Government which is taking decisive action on the matter.  This Bill is clearly one of the most important anti-crime measures introduced since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>I have taken the opportunity in the Bill not just to give effect to the amendment to the Constitution passed last November but to strengthen our bail laws generally.  This represents a fundamental rebalancing of our criminal justice system in favour of the victims of crime and the law abiding members of society generally.  In line with the constitutional amendment, the legislation will allow a court to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  It also contains new provisions relating to amounts of cash or equivalent securities which must be lodged as part of bail; attaching conditions, including conditions relating to good behaviour, to bail and allowing forfeiture of bail where the conditions are breached; and tightening up the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Bill should be seen in the context of the unparalleled programme of criminal law reform which I have undertaken <Col N="1423" /> since I had the honour to be appointed Minister for Justice.  It is appropriate to remind the House of what has been produced as part of that programme. An examination of any previous two and a half year period for any Minister for Justice will show that there have never been so many major changes to our criminal law and I have been heartened by the number of gardaí, lawyers and members of the public who have commented on the beneficial changes I and the Government have implemented.</P>
    <P>They include the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act, 1995 and the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 applies to drug trafficking offences and includes provisions allowing for detention, for up to seven days, of suspected persons, the issue of search warrants by superintendents in circumstances of urgency and restrictions on the right to silence.  The Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1996 amended the Constitution in relation to bail and paved the way for this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous) Act, 1997 will speed up aspects of court procedure in criminal matters.  It makes general provision, for the first time, for the issue of search warrants in relation to the commission of serious offences such as murder or rape and extends the application of certain other Garda powers.  It also allows for wider use by the Garda Síochána of stinger devices to stop stolen cars or cars that have been involved in crime.  The Criminal Law Bill, which has passed all Stages, restates and clarifies the existing law relating to arrest without warrant in relation to serious crimes &mdash; arrestable offences &mdash; and to Garda powers to enter and search premises to effect an arrest.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill provides protection for children against abuse and will include provisions to outlaw all forms of child pornography and trafficking in children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  The Offences Against the Person Bill, discussed in the House earlier this week, will provide a range of new offences to combat the distressing and relatively recent problem of criminal conduct involving syringes and blood.  The penalties provided range from five years to life imprisonment.  The Bill also provides for a new offence of harassment aimed at stalking; a new offence of abduction out of the State of a child by a parent in a tug-of-love situation, and a new offence of endangerment to deal with conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another.</P>
    <P>I brought into operation the anti-money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 as well as making regulations under that Act dealing with the seizure of imports or exports of cash associated with drug trafficking.  This Act, which was passed before I took up office, was essentially enabling and required the actions I took to make it an effective crime-fighting initiative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> I received approval from the Dáil for the terms of three important international conventions dealing with international co-operation on crime: the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the additional Protocol to the convention; the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime. These conventions, which have now been ratified, are important measures enabling Ireland to co-operate extensively with other countries in the fight against drugs and other serious crime.  There is evidence of the success of this co-operation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, establishing the bureau, and the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, allowing the exchange of information between various agencies, were introduced by the Government.  The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, allowing for the freezing of the assets of criminals, and the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996, dealing with child sex tourism, were accepted, subject to extensive amendment, by the Government.</P>
    <P>This morning I published the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Bill.  This legislation will deal with the problem of drug abuse in public houses, dance halls and other places of entertainment. It will also give additional powers to the Garda Síochána to prevent unlicensed dances such as raves where it is suspected there will be drug abuse.</P>
    <P>I and my colleagues in Government look forward to continuing this major programme of criminal law reform.  The measures being worked on include Bills on fraud offences, criminal insanity, indexation of fines, attachment of earnings and Europol.  Any fair-minded observer would recognise that the Government's determination to take whatever measures are open to it to tackle the problem of crime is evidenced by that legislative track record.  That is particularly the case with this legislation but legislation alone is only part of the answer.  A host of other anti-crime measures have been taken and it is relevant to mention that this Bill has been brought forward against the background of an unprecedented prison building programme designed to provide an additional 800 prison places, including a remand centre for 400 at Wheatfield.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the details of the Bill, the earlier parts of which largely follow the outline legislation published by the Government in the context of the referendum last November.  Section 1 provides for certain necessary definitions, the most important of which is the definition of a &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo;.  The approach I have taken to the question of defining &ldquo;serious&rdquo; in this context is to schedule certain offences to which the new regime will apply and to set a minimum term of imprisonment above which offences are to be regarded as serious.  For this purpose, a term of imprisonment of five years or greater is considered appropriate.  To decide on the offences <Col N="1425" /> to be scheduled involved an examination of existing criminal law but, recognising that certain offences which carry a penalty of five years or more are either archaic or not ones where the question of reoffending is likely to be relevant, not all offences carrying such a penalty have been included.</P>
    <P>The Schedule sets out the range of offences to which the definition of a &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; applies, subject to the five years threshold mentioned. The offences covered include the common law offences of murder, manslaughter, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, kidnapping, false imprisonment and rape.  A number of statutory offences are also included, for example, various offences against the person, sexual offences, offences concerning explosives and firearms, robbery and burglary, Road Traffic Act offences, offences concerning hijacking of vehicles, forgery offences, offences against the State, drug offences and public order offences.</P>
    <P>An argument may be made that, in the case of some scheduled offences which carry a potential penalty of five years or more, the crimes involved in particular cases might be relatively minor.  This issue would appear to be inherent in any approach taken to the question of defining a &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo;.  It would be difficult to attempt to determine this by, for example, setting a value in relation to goods stolen.  The circumstances surrounding a robbery can vary greatly, for example, the theft of someone's old age pension may not involve a large amount of money but could have devastating consequences.  The alternative approach, the one I have taken in the Bill, is to specify criteria, as set out in section 2, which will, in practice, allow the courts to take into account the fact that an offence may be a relatively minor one of its kind.</P>
    <P>I have provided in section 2, in accordance with the authority granted by the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, the new ground on which bail may be refused, namely, where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by a person charged with a serious offence.  The section specifies the criteria to which the courts are to have regard in making their decision.  These are the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence in respect of which the accused person is charged and the sentence likely to be imposed on conviction; the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence and the sentence likely to be imposed on conviction; the nature and strength of the evidence in support of the current charge; any conviction of the accused person in respect of an offence committed while he or she was on bail on a previous occasion; any previous conviction of the accused person, including a conviction presently under appeal; any other offence in respect of which the accused person is charged and awaiting trial.</P>
    <P>Having taken into account one or more of these matters, the court may then have regard to <Col N="1426" /> the fact that the accused is addicted to drugs.  This would be relevant in some cases in assessing the probability of offending if released on bail. However, in doing this I am not trying to criminalise drug addiction.  This fact can only be taken into account by the court where it is relevant to the question of whether a serious offence will be committed and after the court has taken into account one or more of the other matters.  I wish to stress that there is no question of a person with a substance addiction, who does not represent a threat to the community, being refused bail on the grounds of substance addiction alone.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that under section 2 the court does not have to be satisfied that any specific offence is likely to be committed by the accused.  If it was otherwise, an unreasonable burden of proof would be placed on the prosecution and the impact of the proposed change would be considerably weakened.</P>
    <P>As the Bill sets out a new ground on which the courts may refuse bail, and recognising the need to ensure the speedy processing of trials of those who are remanded in custody, I am providing in section 3 for the review of a refusal of a bail application if the trial has not commenced within four months of the initial refusal.  This is an important provision.  While it has always been the practice to give priority to trials of accused persons remanded in custody, this provision will highlight the necessity for all concerned in the prosecution of offences to treat these cases as priority cases and to avoid, as much as possible, a situation where an accused spends a long period in prison on remand.  Therefore, if the trial for the offence has not commenced within four months of the refusal the accused may renew his or her application for bail citing delay by the prosecution in proceeding with the trial.  The court may then, if it is satisfied that the interests of justice require it, release the person on bail.  It should be noted, however, that this does not automatically entitle the accused to bail.  Rather, the prosecution must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that the delay is not unreasonable but is due, for example, to the complexity of the particular case.</P>
    <P>It will be evident that the provisions of section 2 clearly contemplate the hearing of evidence concerning an accused's previous criminal history in appropriate cases.  This obviously gives rise to concerns about possible prejudice to a fair trial of the accused.  To reduce the possibility of prejudice, section 4 provides that where a court is hearing an application for bail the previous criminal record of the accused cannot be referred to in a manner which may prejudice a fair trial subsequently. To prevent possible prejudice the court will have power to direct that the bail application be held <i>in camera</i> or to exclude members of the public other than officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, bona fide representatives of the press or any other person whom the court permits to remain.  The publication or broadcast of any information concerning <Col N="1427" /> the criminal record of the accused which was referred to during the bail application will be prohibited. Anyone found guilty of breaching this prohibition could face a potential fine of up to £10,000 or imprisonment for up to three years or both.</P>
    <P>I move now to section 5.  Under section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, an accused may be released on bail on his or her entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties. There is no requirement in the Act that the accused person, or his or her sureties, must, prior to being released on bail, pay any money into court.  In practice in the majority of cases no money is paid into court &mdash; the accused is released on the promise that the bail money will be paid in the event of the accused's failure to answer bail.  Much criticism has been made of the apparently small amounts of bail money which are estreated where an accused has failed to turn up for trial.  This is accounted for to some extent by the fact that the estreatment process is seen as too cumbersome and lengthy to justify the resources required to pursue those who have not turned up for trial.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this should be the case and I am determined to remedy it.  To that end, section 5 will oblige an accused and any sureties to pay into court at least one-third of the amount fixed by the court before the accused is freed on bail.  The requirement to pay some of the bail money into court will have a number of beneficial consequences.  It will mean that at least some bail money is available for forfeiture or estreatment in all cases where there is default.  Furthermore, it appears that where the court insists on prior payment into court this has proven to be a great incentive for the accused to appear in accordance with the recognisance so as to secure the return of the money.</P>
    <P>One-third appears to represent a reasonable minimum proportion.  The court will have the option to accept from an accused or a surety, as security in lieu of the payment into court of the specified amount in cash, any instrument, other than title deeds to land, which is evidence of title to property.  Where it accepts as security a bank, building society, credit union or post office deposit book, it will make an order directing the relevant institution not to permit the balance in the account to be reduced below either an amount equal to that required to be paid into court or the current balance, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>Under section 23 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, a person's release on bail is conditional on his or her appearance before the court at the end of the period of remand.  That Act is silent on the question of imposing other conditions on an accused before granting bail.  However, the courts in practice attach conditions to the grant of bail in many cases.  Such conditions frequently include a requirement to report to the Garda at stated intervals or to surrender a passport. <Col N="1428" /> Section 6 of the Bill will oblige the court to attach standard conditions requiring the accused to refrain from committing any offence and to be of good behaviour while on bail.</P>
    <P>In addition the recognisance may also be subject to any other conditions which the court considers appropriate, including conditions requiring the accused to reside or remain in a particular district or place in the State, to report to a specified Garda station at specified intervals, to surrender his or her passport or other travel document in his or her possession, to refrain from attending any places which the court specifies and to refrain from having any contact with any per son or persons whom the court specifies.  These optional conditions can be varied on the application of the accused in cases where the court considers it appropriate to do so.</P>
    <P>Recognising the legitimate interest of any person who acts as surety in preventing the estreatment of the recognisance or the forfeiture of the amount paid into court, I am providing that the surety may be permitted to return to court for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of the accused where it is feared that he or she is about to contravene any of the bail conditions.  Such an application may be aimed at preventing the estreatment or forfeiture which would arise if the accused breaches a condition.  A member of the Garda will also be empowered to apply to court for a warrant of arrest where it is feared that the accused is about to contravene any of the conditions of his or her bail.</P>
    <P>A person arrested on foot of such a warrant must, as soon as practicable, be brought before the court which made the order directing that the recognisance be entered into.  The court may then either commit him or her to prison pending trial or until a fresh recognisance is entered into or further remand him or her.</P>
    <P>It is important that a person who puts himself or herself forward as a surety is in a position to meet the financial commitment which that involves.  It is also important that proposed sureties are suitable persons to act as surety.  To this end it is provided, in section 7, that the court considering a bail application which requires independent sureties will be required to satisfy itself concerning the proposed surety's financial resources, character, any previous convictions and his or her relationship to the accused.  This will also ensure, to the greatest possible extent, that the proposed surety is not only a reliable person but also one who can be expected to have sufficient influence with the accused such that the latter will be likely to comply with the conditions of his or her bail.</P>
    <P>Section 8 will permit the Garda to continue, as at present, to release on bail persons who have been arrested on foot of a court warrant.  It will substitute a new section for section 30 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  The new section takes account of the changes being made in procedures as a result of the provisions of section 5 concerning the payment of moneys into court and <Col N="1429" /> section 6 concerning the conditions to be attached to the granting of bail.  Section 8 provides that in cases where a court issues a warrant for the arrest of a person, and the warrant contains an endorsement that he or she be permitted bail by the Garda, the recognisance will be conditional on the accused's appearance in court as specified and the payment of the specified amount by the accused and his or her sureties as well as the conditions with which he or she must comply.  Only then will the person be released on bail.</P>
    <P>The present procedure for the estreatment of recognisances is seen by many as cumbersome. There is also the point made in the Law Reform Commission Report on the Law of Bail that in a significant number of cases judges appear reluctant to order estreatment for a variety of reasons. When estreatment of the money promised by sureties has been pursued, sureties have apparently been very imaginative at explaining the absence of funds when called upon at estreatment hearings to fulfil their promise.  Clearly, the system is open to abuse and liable to be treated in a cavalier fashion by those whose only interest is to frustrate the effective operation of the law.  I am proposing in section 9 to simplify and streamline the estreatment procedure by providing, in cases where an accused breaches a condition of his or her recognisance and where the court issues a warrant for that person's arrest, that it will at the same time order the estreatment of the recognisance and forfeiture of the amount paid into court.  This will allow the immediate estreatment of the moneys already paid into court and the liability to estreatment or forfeiture of the balance of the recognisances entered into will remain.  The onus will then shift to the accused or the surety to demonstrate to the court that circumstances exist which require it to vary or discharge the order for estreatment and forfeiture. This seems to be a reasonable way of approaching the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 9 will also permit the Garda to seek a warrant for the arrest of an accused in circumstances where they believe an accused has contravened a condition of his or her recognisance.  At present, section 13 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, gives the Garda this power where an accused has failed to turn up for trial.  Where a warrant is issued in such a case for contravening a condition of the recognisance, the accused and his or her sureties will remain bound by their recognisances and any money paid into court will not be released until proceedings in connection with the alleged breach are concluded.</P>
    <P>The matter of consecutive sentences under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, has been the subject of much discussion.  The Law Reform Commission, in its report, stated that the view might be taken that section 11 of the Act, which deals with consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail, has been deprived of some of its deterrent power because of the courts' interpretation of it to permit them to suspend sentences and their view that while each sentence <Col N="1430" /> must be proportionate to the offence, the overall sentence must be proportionate in its totality.  We need to send a clear message to those who commit crimes while on bail that the fundamental breach of trust this represents will not be tolerated and that anyone found guilty of such a breach should know they will be liable to suffer additional penalties.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 10 is to strengthen the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, in relation to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed by a person while on bail.  It proposes to do this by amending the 1984 Act to provide generally that where a consecutive sentence is passed following conviction for an offence committed while on bail, the total sentence to be imposed should generally be greater than would otherwise be imposed and that the commission of an offence while on bail should be considered as an aggravating factor warranting the longer sentence.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 deal, respectively, with the removal of references to peace commissioners from those sections of Part III of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, dealing with the granting of bail, and the repeal of sections 27, 30 and 33 of the 1967 Act consequent on the changes being made in this Bill.  The removal of references to peace commissioners arises from court decisions which held that peace commissioners do not have power to grant bail.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is a standard provision giving the Short Title of the Act and providing for bringing into operation the provisions of the Act by order made by the Minister for Justice.  As I indicated earlier, this Bill has been introduced against the background of the major prison building programme designed to provide an additional 800 prison places.</P>
    <P>Part of the Bill gives effect to the will of the people which was so clearly expressed in the referendum last November.  I believe the other measures contained in the Bill will also received widespread public support.,</P>
    <P>It is some 32 years since the judgement in the O'Callaghan case which restricted the grounds on which bail could be refused.  There have been numerous calls and attempts to change our bail laws, including efforts by my party in Opposition and rejected by Fianna Fáil in Government.  In fairness, I acknowledge that in Opposition Fianna Fáil then converted to the need for change.  The timing of its demands, however, was ill-judged as other actions were required prior to changes, such as an effective prison building programme.  I am satisfied the timing of the referendum and now this legislation was wisely implemented by the Government and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I will begin where the Minister finished.  She stated that the timing of Fianna Fáil's demands was ill-judged and that other actions were required prior to changes, such as an effective prison building programme.  This is the <Col N="1431" /> same Minister who, in the spring of 1995, stated on television that she believed the time had come for a referendum to change the law on bail.  The Minister's words ring hollow against that background and the fact that Fianna Fáil in Government referred this matter to the Law Reform Commission, recognising there was a need for a change in our bail laws.</P>

      <P>With apologies to William Wordsworth, two years have passed, two summers with the length of two long winters, since I first introduced in this House Fianna Fáil's Criminal Law (Bail) Bill on Wednesday, 3 May 1995. On that occasion I stated:</P>
      <P>There is a widespread belief that our criminal justice system does more to protect the perpetrators of crime than to deter them.  The flourishing body of jurisprudence on the rights of persons charged with criminal acts has all but eclipsed the sad plight of victims.  To contemplate the continuation of a system of justice which imprisons the elderly and the vulnerable in terror in their own homes is unthinkable.  A system of justice where wrongdoers appear to be licensed to roam the streets to plunder and pillage at will is equally unthinkable.  The scales of justice need to be realigned to take cognisance of the reality of life and crime in modern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Those words fell upon deaf ears.  The attempt by the Minister for Justice to hold a referendum on bail was thwarted by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  They had their way and, recognising there would not be a referendum to change the law on bail, I again came before this House on Wednesday, 27 September 1995 on behalf of Fianna Fáil to introduce the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, better known as the bail Bill.  It is important to repeat what I said on that occasion.  I stated:</P>
      <P>Over the past 30 years, the constitutional law of this State has developed in a manner that can hardly have been envisaged by its founders. This is no bad thing.  A Constitution must, of necessity, be a living document &mdash; alive to changes in society and technology which affect the lives of ordinary citizens.  There is, however, a danger that the vast volumes of jurisprudence which relate to the rights of accused persons will eclipse the equally important rights of their victims and potential victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution is a document which exists for the protection of citizens and society; it does not exist exclusively for the benefit of persons charged with criminal offences.  The Constitution ought to exist as a sword for the advancement of righteousness and justice as well as a shield for the protection of the accused.  It is the duty of this House to ensure <Col N="1432" /> that is so and to afford the people their right to wield that sword in the protection of their fellow citizens.  This is a Bill designed to let the people do just that.</P>
    <P>Another year passed before the truth dawned on the leaders of the rainbow coalition Government. Ultimately we had our wish and we had a bail referendum along the lines I proposed in this House in September 1995.  When it was faced with the hard facts, when it was told the truth, when it was advised of the plight of victims in the street and at home, this Government buried its collective head in the sand and ignored the right of the people to be protected when serious crime was escalating.  It refused to listen to the voice of reason again and again.  It voted down every reasonable, responsible measure brought before this House during that time in the belief that the problem was not as serious as it was.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte, the Marcel Marceau of the rainbow, stated during that time that I was imagining things, that I was seeing criminals coming out of every hedge, that I did not know what I was talking about.  This is the same &ldquo;Rip Van Rabbitte&rdquo; who recently stated that there was a need for a new Garda division in Tallaght and that there was a need to tackle serious crime.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, the whimpering Tánaiste, the man who stood idly by throughout the grim warnings that were issued across the floor of this House day in and day out, decided last week to make a tough speech on crime.</P>

    <P>Let us move on to the Minister's speech today. In breathtaking tones the Minister for Justice claimed credit for the following Bills.  She boasts of the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act, 1995 as if it were her own.  The essential provisions of that Bill were lifted by the Minister for Justice in the Seanad from Fianna Fáil's Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill of the same year.  The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 was completed by the outgoing Fianna Fáil administration and presented by the Government as a <i>fait accompli</i> following its taking office.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 is a poorly watered down copy of Fianna Fáil's Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996.  The Sixteenth Amendment of <Col N="1433" /> the Constitution Act, 1996 is virtually a photocopy of Fianna Fáil's Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1995.  The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997 contains little that is new.  Neither does the Criminal Law Bill.  The Children Bill lifts Fianna Fáil's Child Pornography Bill and also portions of other legislation presented by the party.</P>

      <P>The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bill where it deals with the most important matter, that of syringe offences is, for the most part, directly copied from Fianna Fáil's Punishment of Aggravated Robbery Bill, 1997.  The Minister made much play of the fact that she introduced anti-money laundering provisions in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  She did, 100 days after the Brinks Allied raid which I described at the time as the greatest political procrastination since Nero watched Rome burn.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, 1996 was consequential upon Fianna Fáil's Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, and the Government boasts of the provision providing for the freezing of criminal assets as if that were its own Bill.  It was accepted by the Government in Government time.  To that extent it made history. The Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996 is another Bill which was accepted by the rainbow coalition Government in a fit of embarrassment at public outrage.</P>
      <P>That is the record, and it speaks for itself. Every substantial piece of criminal law legislation which has been brought before this House over the past two and a half years was brought before the House by Fianna Fáil.  For the most part they were either accepted or copied by the Government. Bereft of any philosophy, ideology or new ideas of its own the Government has been obliged again and again to copy Fianna Fáil's legislation. I do not mind that the Government has done that. I welcome it.  What is difficult to take is the political expediency and opportunism exhibited by Cabinet Ministers again and again in boasting and blowing hot air about legislation which they did not introduce in the first instance but which they know was copied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bail Bill presented before the House today is a shallow attempt by a Minister bereft of original ideas who has cobbled together a facsimile of the Fianna Fáil Bail Bill which I published in May 1995.  Let me illustrate that that is the truth, lest there be any doubt about it.  Section 4 of the Fianna Fáil Bill states that &ldquo;a serious offence is an offence by virtue of which a person of full capacity and not previously convicted may be <Col N="1434" /> punished by a term of imprisonment for a term of 5 years or by a more severe penalty&rdquo;.  Section 1(1) of the Minister's Bill states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; means an offence specified in the Schedule for which a person of full capacity and not previously convicted may be punished by a term of imprisonment for a term of 5 years or by a more severe penalty.</P>
    <P>What is the difference between what I published and what the Minister copied?  Section 3(2)(a) of the Fianna Fáil Bill refers to &ldquo;the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence in respect of which the accused person is charged and the potential penalty&rdquo;.  Section 2(2)(a) of the Minister's Bill refers to &ldquo;the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence with which the accused person is charged and the sentence likely to be imposed on conviction,&rdquo;.  Can the Minister tell me the difference between the Bill which I published and her own Bill which she copied?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3(2)(b) of the Fianna Fáil Bill refers to &ldquo;the nature and degree of seriousness of the category of offence apprehended and the potential penalty,&rdquo;.  Section 2(2) (b) of the Minister's Bill refers to &ldquo;the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence apprehended and the sentence likely to be imposed on conviction,&rdquo;.  Section 3(2)(f) of the Fianna Fáil Bill refers to &ldquo;the nature and strength of the evidence in support of the charge,&rdquo;.  Section 2(2)(c) of the Minister's Bill refers to &ldquo;the nature and strength of the evidence in support of the charge,&rdquo;.  Section 3(2)(c) of the Fianna Fáil Bill refers to &ldquo;the conviction of the accused person in respect of an offence committed while on bail or on a previous occasion,&rdquo;.  Section 2(2)(d) of the Minister's Bill refers to &ldquo;any conviction of the accused person for an offence committed while he or she was on bail,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8(1)(b) of the Fianna Fáil Bill states that a court may &ldquo;exclude the public or any particular portion of the public or any particular person or persons except bona fide members of the press during the whole or any part of the proceedings.&rdquo;. Section 4(2)(b) of the Minister's Bill states that a court may &ldquo;exclude from the court during the hearing all persons except officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, bona fide representatives of the press and such other persons if any as the court may permit to remain.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11(2)(a) of the Fianna Fáil Bill states that a court may &ldquo;require the accused to attend at a designated Garda station between specified times on a daily or less frequent basis for the purpose of signing a book maintained at the station for the purpose of recording an accused person's attendance.&rdquo;.  Section 6(1)(b)(ii) of the Minister's Bill states as a condition of bail &ldquo;that the accused <Col N="1435" /> person reports to a specified Garda station at specified intervals,&rdquo;.  Section 11(2)(i) of the Fianna Fáil Bill states that the court may &ldquo;require the accused person to enter into a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.&rdquo;.  Section 6(I)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Minister's Bill states as a condition of bail &ldquo;that the accused person shall not commit any offence,&rdquo; and &ldquo;that the accused person shall otherwise be of good behaviour,&rdquo;. They are precisely the same.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2)(c) of the Fianna Fáil Bill requires the accused person to surrender his passport to a member of the Garda Síochána.  Section 6(1)(b)(iii) of this Bill states that the accused person must surrender any passport or travel documents in his or her possession.  There is no difference between the two provisions.  The Schedule to the Fianna Fáil Bill deals with common law offences, murder, manslaughter, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, kidnapping, false imprisonment and rape, the same wording as appears in the Schedule to this Bill.  The Minister gets ten out of ten for plagiarism.  The only question that requires to be asked is why it took her so long to come into the House to present Fianna Fáil legislation as her own.</P>
    <P>It appears the Minister is so insecure in her position that, notwithstanding the support of an army of parliamentary draftsmen, private secretaries, civil servants and advisers, she could not generate a single innovative provision in the Bill. Such plagiarism would not be worthy of an unfortunate student unprepared for his or her exams, but it represents a genuine attempt to present a new slant on the work of the best student whom she has copied.  The examining board, in the form of the electorate, will shortly give its judgment.  It was the electorate who directed the Government to prepare comprehensive bail legislation.  When the day of reckoning comes &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, said it will be in five weeks' time &mdash; the Government will not get a great mark for what I can only describe as this feeble attempt.</P>
    <P>Strangest of all is that the Labour Party, in particular, and Democratic Left to a lesser extent having strangled every effort by the Minister for Justice to hold a referendum on bail, still appear to lead the Government.  They are still in charge. The Tánaiste said at the Labour Party conference that we have what he describes as a centre-left Government.  He told the people that Fine Gael is a left-wing Government, and there is not a whimper from the poodles on the Fine Gael benches. Since when did the party of James Dillon, John Costello and Liam Cosgrave become a left-wing party?  The answer is since the Fine Gael Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach were faced down by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare who said that, in deference to their so-called civil libertarian wing, they would not allow a referendum on bail or allow Fine Gael to enact legislation for the protection of citizens.  The Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach have abandoned <Col N="1436" /> any semblance of the tradition of Fine Gael.  They have been subsumed by a Tánaiste and a Minister for Social Welfare who believe they can do what they like when they like, even to the extent that they can describe the Fine Gael Party in philosophical and political terms as something it never was.</P>
    <P>Very few could have foreseen the appalling vista of Ireland today where there exists the spectacle of contract killing, violent intimidation of gardaí and journalists, kidnapping of families and murders from beatings, shootings and stabbings, underpinned by a flourishing drug sub-culture and a growing awareness of a long-hidden underworld of serious sexual crime.  The arsenal of AIDS-infected syringes and automatic guns and rifles for hire and the genuine fear of families not only that the sanctuary of their homes may be threatened at any time by drug-craving thieves but that their streets are no longer safe for their spouses and children is a reality.</P>
    <P>This Bail Bill, which is the Fianna Fáil Bill in all but name, is predicated on the refusal of bail where a person is charged with a serious offence and the court is satisfied that bail should be refused as it is necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by the accused.  This fundamental development, long overdue in Irish law, will have a dramatic effect on our already burgeoning prison population.  On the basis of the Department of Justice's annual report on prisons, about half the annual prison population is made up of remand prisoners.  That Department has estimated that this change in the bail laws will create the need for about 600 more prison places, yet the Minister for Justice, at the behest of the Labour Minister for Finance, cancelled proposed prisons at Castlerea and Mountjoy.  The Minister for Finance made that decision unilaterally, without even seeking the opinion of the Minister for Justice and, like a political poodle, she backed him and said that he was right.  It was only when he said that perhaps he was not right after all that she said the decision was not right and we need the extra prison places.</P>
    <P>The Minister does what she is told, as does the Taoiseach when the Tánaiste wags his long finger in his direction.  Ultimately when the crunch came and the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, the rottweilers of the rainbow coalition Government, decided it was time to tame the poodles lest they were put out of office, the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach changed their minds and barked out of the same hymn sheet.</P>
    <P>About 3,400 people are refused bail every year under existing legislation.  The new bail law will result in a doubling of that number, yet there is no remand prison.  I came into this House on numerous occasions and called for the building of a separate remand prison, but that call fell on deaf ears.  The Minister for Finance could not provide the funds.  The Minister for Finance said &ldquo;jump&rdquo; and the Minister for Justice danced.  That is the sad truth of the matter.</P>

It is deplorable that, on a weekly basis, judges of the District, Circuit and High Courts say current sentencing policy is a joke.  There is no consistency in sentencing, just as there was no reaction from the rainbow coalition Government to an escalating crime problem when action was most required. Since there is an insufficiency of prison spaces, the revolving door clicks to the glee of young offenders who are secure in the knowledge that there is no penalty for their crime.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a desperate attempt to draw attention to this crisis.  The criminal justice system is in chaos when the independent Judiciary must stop imposing sentences on serious criminals to draw the attention of the Government to the lack of prison places.  The Government is not only insensitive to the needs of law abiding citizens, it is guilty of gross negligence in the discharge of its superior obligation, that of a sovereign Government to protect the lives and property of citizens.  The electorate will make its judgement in the near future in the knowledge that the Government is in dereliction of its most important duty, protecting their lives and property.  While few know why this is the case, a cursory glance at the Government's annual Estimates since taking up office gives a fair indication of the reason.  The Labour Party and Democratic Left have other priorities.  They have an insatiable greed and a parasitic attitude when dealing with finances that should be allocated to other Departments, particularly the Department of Justice. The Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach stand indicated in that regard.  They merely did what they were told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can no longer allow rapacious, hardened criminals to rule our streets, secure in the knowledge that they will never face a real prison sentence when apprehended.  I invite the Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; the North Korean connection &mdash; and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; who can see no problems from the back seat of his State Mercedes &mdash; to visit the Four Courts, Morgan Place or the Bridewell today where groups of young thugs will laugh their way <Col N="1438" /> through the courts system and for whom the prospect of jail means little more than a short recess with their friends.  They turn up their noses at the judge and the gardaí while the victims of this Government cower at the back of the courts. They are the real prisoners in this society of fear. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, should look the victims in the eyes and explain why the bail legislation took two years to photocopy. That is the sad reality and where the tragedy lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Progressive Democrats are on record as believing for many years that our bail laws, which are liberal and widely abused by persistent offenders, need to be amended.  The change in the law on bail, as sanctioned by the people in a referendum last November, is the culmination of a long and tortuous political argument in favour of change.  There has been no shortage of debate on the fundamental issues which arise when introducing such a change in our laws.  At the heart of the argument against change was that it would interfere with the presumption of innocence, a basic tenet of constitutional law.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes a reasonable change to the law. It contains important safeguards in the context of due process and the presumption of innocence. However, it would be dishonest if I did not say I am seriously concerned that the measures proposed have not been dovetailed with the provision of extra prison places, something which will be the subject of debate for many years.  When the provisions of the legislation are implemented people may challenge the right of the State to deny them bail while not providing separate remand facilities to deal with the requirements of remand prisoners who, under our law, are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  Unfortunately, the Government has not dovetailed the need to change our bail laws with the need to provide adequate spaces to meet the need that will flow from that change.  This has resulted from a disagreement within Government on the need for more prison spaces.</P>
      <P>In the face of massive public support and increasing evidence of escalating organised criminality, the Government ultimately agreed to change the law.  However, it has not yet faced up to the urgent need to provide more prison spaces. The Minister referred to an extra 800 spaces, which are badly needed, but they consist of a jumble of figures pitched into the future.  An accurate count of the number of spaces provided by the Minister since taking up office would show that no more than 200 have been provided.  While taking credit for some of the anti-crime measures introduced, she must also take political responsibility for the fact that there are not enough prison spaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our prison system is in chaos.  This night last week overcrowding in Mountjoy reached its worst level ever.  A total of 675 people were accommodated <Col N="1439" /> in the prison that night, a prison built to house 480 prisoners.  Such a level of overcrowding renders our prison system practically unmanageable and dangerous for prisoners and prison staff. Apart from the ongoing scandal of early release being used as a mechanism to deal with overcrowding, there is inadequate provision of necessary rehabilitative and drug treatment facilities, given the profile of the offender housed in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>The average annual cost of keeping an offender in prison is £45,000 and that cost has not been reduced.  It is almost double that figure to keep an offender in Portlaoise Prison.  A strategic approach to developing a more accountable and efficient prison service has not been taken.  After the Dominic Lynch debacle it was promised we would set up a prisons' services executive on a statutory basis.  We have not seen sight of a Bill on that.  It, like many other matters, has been pitched into the future.  What is the reason for the delay in bringing forward that promised long overdue reform?</P>
    <P>This Bill will allow a court to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. This has been debated at length and the fundamental reason for the delay in bringing the debate thus far is the argument about the presumption of innocence.  It is a founding principle of due process that one is innocent until proven guilty. The entire corpus of our criminal law is based on that fundamental tenet.  The rules of court, the training of lawyers, both solicitors and barristers, the procedural arrangements in the courts and in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the preparation of prosecutions and in the investigation by the Garda is governed directly by that sacrosanct tenet.  Conflict arose when it was evident the protection of the accused interfered the rights of law abiding citizens.  Nowhere is that conflict more stark than in the law relating to bail.</P>
    <P>The abuse of the bail laws was a major contributor to a loss of public confidence in our justice system.  It was also demoralising for our gardaí.  Gardaí spend much time and risk their safety in investigating and bringing criminals to court.  It is demoralising for them to see prisoners whom they know have a propensity to reoffend, being released on bail pending trial.  It has been accepted by the Government that the traditional notion of being innocent until proven guilty must be balanced against the fact that we have a criminal population, many of whom are persistent offenders who pose a risk to public safety if released on bail.</P>
    <P>The number of crimes committed by persons on bail is startling and has been steadily increasing with 2,791 crimes committed in 1992, 3,191 in 1993, 4,416 in 1994 and 5,440 in 1995.  There was an overriding and compelling logic and a political requirement that the Oireachtas should move to tackle this abuse of our bail laws.  I know the <Col N="1440" /> Government has also taken on board many of the suggestions made by the Opposition at various times in recent years.  They include tightening up our bail laws related to making a bailsman effectively a guarantor for the good behaviour of the accused while on bail and tightening up the treatment of the monetary aspects of bail.  These are welcome measures, but we are now introducing a change to our bail law which was urgently needed in the light of a diminishing confidence among many of our citizens given the abuse of bail by persistent offenders.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to consider the reasons the House is dealing with all stages of this Bill today. There has been no shortage of debate on this subject and there have been many attempts since 1968 to remove the imperative in terms of the O'Callaghan judgement which provides the basis of our law on bail, which we are now changing. The Constitution does not mention the word &ldquo;bail&rdquo;, but the constitutional dimension of the bail issue stems from the judicial interpretation of Article 44.4.1, which states, &ldquo;No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law.&rdquo;  By a process of judicial interpretation down through the years this article had come to be a guarantee that no person should be deprived of his or her liberty by stooping to methods which ignore the fundamental norms of the legal order postulated by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Prior to the O'Callaghan case in 1966, the right to bail pending trial was flexible.  Factors in favour of granting bail included the overall policy against remanding an accused in custody pending trial where bail could be granted in safety.  Those against granting bail included the courts considering the seriousness of the crime, the likely penalty, the strength of the case, the prospect of a speedy trial, the criminal propensity of the accused, the attitude of the prosecution and the capacity of the accused to abuse bail to interfere with the evidence of witnesses, etc.  The granting of bail was largely discretionary depending very much on the attitude of the judge and the facts of each case, but the decision in the O'Callaghan case swept all that aside.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court judgement swept away the previous <i>ad hoc</i> judicial approach and excluded from consideration any suggestion that the accused might abuse his or her liberty to commit crimes.  This notion of preventative justice was stated to be unknown to our system of criminal law and that case forms the basis of our difficulties until now.  We have the permission of the people to make reasonable amendments to the law which will introduce a fairer balance between the rights of the accused and the legitimate rights of law abiding citizens to be protected from persistent offenders with a previous history of abusing bail.  The Bill is well drafted and is mindful of the obligation of the State to protect the citizen and at the same time to protect the fundamental individual rights of suspects and offenders.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 3 which allows for a renewal of a bail application.  If the <Col N="1441" /> State has not got its act together in bringing a person to trial for the initial offence, the person who has been refused bail can bring the matter before the courts again and demand to be released.  It would not be right for persons to languish in a punitive institution such as Mountjoy Prison while the State had not got its act together in terms of bringing people forward for trial.  A person has a right to a speedy trial, but that right has been denied to many people because our courts have been very slow to process criminal trials.  This has improved of late due to the appointment of more judges.  Which I welcome. One could not stand over a position where per sons who are deemed innocent until proven guilty could languish in institutions, such as Mountjoy Prison, which, in so far as they are tailor made, are meant to accommodate convicted criminals.</P>
    <P>It would be improper and in breach of our international obligations in this matter if we were to allow persons who are presumed innocent to languish in such institutions with the general body of convicted criminals.  I have serious concerns about that matter. Will the Minister confirm the date she expects a separate remand facility to be up and running?  If the provisions of this Bill are brought into effect without the provision of a separate remand facility, we will run into big trouble.  We are already in breach of our international obligations.</P>
    <P>It is patently wrong for persons denied bail to mix with the general body of the convicted criminal population when they are deemed to be innocent until proven guilty under our law.  What action will the Government take?  An accelerated prison building programme was announced last summer after the terrible murders of Veronica Guerin and Detective Garda Gerry McCabe as part of an overall response package from the Government to the white heat of public rage.</P>
    <P>Bail reform was also agreed but the provision of an extra 150 or 160 cobbled together places is not an adequate response to the urgent need for a massive prison building programme to deal with the current level of overcrowding, let alone as a response to the exacerbated level which will result if a restrictive bail regime is introduced. Why has the Minister ruled out any involvement of the private sector in the financing, design and building of prisons?</P>

      <P>I have obviously struck a chord with the Minister because it is an undeniable fact that the Government has presided over a situation whereby on any one day 50 convicted prisoners must be released from our jails.  It has nothing to do with them finishing their sentences or rehabilitation or temporary release.  It is an unconditional, unsupervised goodbye.  That is a scandal for which the Government must take political responsibility.</P>
      <P>I asked for figures for the number of offences committed by persons while on so-called temporary release.  Of course, nobody takes account of such figures.  They are not available to Deputies who seek them in the House because they would be an appalling vista.  Since nobody monitors whether these people commit offences while on temporary release, there are no figures.  This is useful for the Government because if it were to admit these persons reoffended while on temporary release, there would be an appalling vista of contingent liability on the State for responsibility for such crimes.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice has settled claims taken by members of the public who have been assaulted or otherwise injured by persons on temporary release.  These deals have been done in secret by the Department with plaintiffs who have been injured by such people.  Confidentiality clauses have been attached to those settlements. What aspect of the public interest does that serve?  I imagine the Minister would argue it is not in the public interest for people to know about such attacks because the Government does not want to accept responsibility for the State which is ultimately liable for the offences of persons who should be in jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appalling that about 4,000 such people are constantly being released back into the community under temporary release orders.  Since there is no record of what they get up to when they are released, &mdash; whether they are at home watching television or out assaulting innocent members of the community &mdash; the Minister does not seem to be worried or have any information. <Col N="1443" /> We have a revolving door that is not monitored and which represents a panorama of potential liability on the State with responsibility for the activities of these people who should be in jail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of temporary release is a major headache for the Government.  If a survey were carried out on the activities of those given temporary release, no Government could stand.  This Government could not remain in office if the truth about what those people do when they are given temporary release were brought into the public domain.  That is why, when I ask a question of the Minister, I get the reply that the information I seek is not available and would involve a disproportionate amount of work in her Department to find those figures. That is the type of crooked reply one gets when one seeks such statistical information which should be made public.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Bill amends section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, because it was a source of contention.  The Act was meant to deal with the issue of persons who offended while on bail but the Law Reform Commission pointed out that the practice of the Judiciary on this meant that the courts interpreted section 11 to mean that the second sentence for reoffending on bail could be suspended and they tended to apply a test of overall proportionality to combined sentences. The aim of the section was to allow for consecutive sentences when a person abused bail and reoffended, but in practice this was not being effected by the Judiciary on a case by case basis. Section 10 of the Bill before us comes to grips with that and gives political direction in terms of the original objective of the 1984 Act.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give an indication of the likelihood of having a remand centre when the provisions before us are enacted?  Will she state the Government's response to the charge that we are in breach of our international obligations by not providing a separate remand centre?  How can we hold our heads up in terms of human rights obligations when we do not have such a facility?  The Bill deals with the issue of drug addiction and, as the Minister correctly stated, it does not set out to criminalise drug addiction.  It is only one of a range of issues which will be taken into account by the courts in determining whether there is a reasonable danger of a person committing an offence while on bail and, thus, triggering the mechanism before us to restrict bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is to be implemented for drug addicts the time spent on remand should be put to good use and facilities should exist for that category of offender.  They should immediately receive proper drug rehabilitation and counselling while on remand.  It would be wrong for offenders on remand to be thrown into the general body of the convicted population in Mountjoy without adequate and sympathetic treatment for their <Col N="1444" /> health problems.  This category of remand prisoner has a particularly high risk of suicide.  Statistics show remand prisoners as a whole are more likely to commit suicide, particularly if they are first time offenders or have drug and psychological problems.</P>
    <P>This category of young offenders exists.  If we are to deprive them of their liberty pending trial, in the interests of public safety, we owe them a duty to be sympathetic to their addiction and to use this time profitably to start detoxification, counselling and rehabilitation programmes.  For that reason, a separate remand centre is vital.  It would be wrong for such troubled young people to be thrown into the general chaos of Mountjoy. The prison already has a serious drug problem &mdash; it says something about the level of drug abuse there that one section has had to be designated drug-free.  There is a high risk of drug addicted remand prisoners endangering themselves and becoming ill while on remand and the Government must make provision for that.  While the measures before us do not solely deal with drug addicts, we must handle them sympathetically. On Committee Stage we will deal with various technical matters.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Bill as it was much demanded by the public.  About three weeks ago when Deputy O'Donnell introduced her Prisons Bill I took the kind approach and remembered it was difficult for Opposition Deputies to draft legislation.  Having heard her contribution today, however, I realise her problem was not the lack of drafting help but sheer incompetence.  As I said at the time, her Bill made no reference to a separate remand centre.</P>
      <P>There appears to be a further split between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil.  The Progressive Democrats contribution on this Bill takes the civil libertarian approach but if the canon from Cahirciveen were to get his hands on the Department of Justice, he would deliver hellfire and brimstone and lock people up forever.  I do not understand the Progressive Democrats contribution &mdash; it veers between flogging prisoners and being kind to them.  Deputy O'Donnell made no reference to a separate remand centre in her own Bill, yet it is the issue which most concerns her on this legislation.  Is that selective amnesia or selective memory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's canine contribution was about as effective as a whippet raising its leg against the wind.  Someone who heard him said the appropriate description of the Deputy's species was a cross between Daniel O'Connell and Mary Whitehouse.  I suggest that in future he should &ldquo;sit&rdquo;.  I listened with interest to his contribution earlier this week on the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bill, which consisted largely of a blustering rather than blistering attack on Democratic Left.  After hearing this morning's attack, one realises that Deputy Rabbitte <Col N="1445" /> is even more effective in his contributions to the House than one imagined.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue criticised Democratic Left in particular and the left in general for being soft on crime.  This Bill represents a considered balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of society.  Unlike Deputy O'Donoghue, I do not believe that the crime problem will be solved by laws alone.  Nor will it be solved by simply building more prison spaces, as suggested by the Progressive Democrats, or by tough sound bites.  To return to the canine analogy, Deputy O'Donoghue's bark is far more worrying than his bite.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left is not in the business of kidding the people.  Reform of the bail laws alone will not magically wipe out the crime which is plaguing communities throughout the country. Increased levels of crime in recent years have not arisen in a vacuum.  While each individual must bear responsibility for his or her actions, there can be little doubt that social factors such as poor educational opportunities, long-term unemployment and economic marginalisation all contribute to current crime levels.  The neglect of those areas can be firmly blamed not just on recent Governments but on those in the distant past.  It is disgraceful of Fianna Fáil to promote the &ldquo;hang 'em and flog 'em&rdquo; solution, after neglecting and isolating communities.  Many people would call this an oversight but I say it was deliberate.</P>
    <P>The slogan Democratic Left adopted during last year's referendum was &ldquo;Protect your Community&rdquo;. Any serious assault on social disintegration and increased criminality must start in local communities with schools, youth services, improved social and environmental amenities and above all locally-based employment initiatives such as the local employment service, all of which were put in place by this Government.</P>
    <P>The Bail Bill will allow judges, in certain circumstances, to refuse bail to those charged with serious offences.  However, we need to prevent those offences being committed in the first place. Neither Fianna Fáil nor the Progressive Democrats has devised such solutions.  They talk about the Government squandering our great resources but they never say where they would spend them. It frightens me that Deputy O'Donnell wants to save money on prison spaces.  Does that mean a cutback on prisoners' diets?  Will they no longer have televisions?  Will we no longer educate them in order to rehabilitate them?</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats paint with a broad brush.  They give no details but people suspect what they will be, and it terrifies them.  Up to 80 per cent of crime in urban areas is drug related.  This Government has introduced a number of initiatives designed to reduce the supply of drugs.  My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, the bane of Deputy O'Donoghue's life, last year <Col N="1446" /> published the report of the ministerial task force on drugs demand reduction.  This twin-pronged approach to the drugs crisis will have a significant impact on the level of crime being experienced in many disadvantaged communities.  My constituency, Cork North Central, got £1 million from that task force to prevent the spread of drugs, and that is where we should be putting money.  Dublin is a different case.</P>
      <P>The Children Bill contains a range of early intervention measures to ensure that youngsters embarking on a cycle of criminality are caught at the beginning, rather than at the end, of that cycle.</P>
      <P>Before the referendum, a number of individuals and groups expressed concern that the proposed reform of the bail laws could infringe fundamental civil liberties.  I understand and respect those concerns, and it is healthy and necessary for any constitutional change to be accompanied by an informed debate.  However, the concerns expressed were not justified.  The legislation has been painstakingly drafted to maintain hard-won civil liberties, while allowing courts the necessary discretion to refuse bail in certain very narrowly defined circumstances.</P>
      <P>In this regard I welcome the fact that, when finalising the legislation, the Minister for Justice took on board some of the concerns expressed by civil liberties groups on foot of the draft legislation. I am delighted that drug addiction will no longer be a stand-alone criteria for the refusal of bail.  Fianna Fáil asked for this.  Under the revised Bill, the fact that a person is addicted to drugs can only be taken into account in conjunction with one or more of the other criteria.</P>
      <P>I respect the stance adopted by those opposing this reform for civil liberties reasons, but I have less time for some of the contributions made by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to the debate on bail in particular, and the justice system in general.  Rather than adopting a cross-party, co-operative approach to criminal justice legislation, Deputies opposite have adopted an approach of &ldquo;our Bill is better than yours.&rdquo;  That was confirmed more than ever this morning.  It is a disgraceful approach to take to something as fundamental as the justice system.</P>
      <P>Recently, Fianna Fáil launched its criminal justice policy.  I was less than impressed.  It was a scanty document which consisted largely of recycled Government proposals and policies.  The one &ldquo;new&rdquo; proposal was the so-called &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policy.  Deputy O'Donoghue and his colleagues were very careful not to spell out exactly what zero tolerance means to them, as soundbites, after all, are best left unexplained. However, I can say what zero tolerance has meant in the United States where this policy originated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It meant a massive increase in police spending. How will Fianna Fáil's Progressive Democrats colleagues feel about that?  It meant a huge increase in complaints against the police by members of minority communities.  Translated <Col N="1447" /> into an Irish context, that means an increase in complaints against the Garda by the unemployed, drug addicts, members of the travelling community and other minority groups.  That is a recipe for social division not one for crime fighting.</P>
    <P>In New York, zero tolerance means that every crime, no matter how minor, is not only followed up but prosecuted.  Does Fianna Fáil really want our courts and prisons clogged up with parking offenders, jaywalkers and petty miscreants?  Is it saying that the Garda should no longer be able to exercise discretion to caution offenders?  Is it really saying that prison should be a first rather than a last resort?  It has no other answer because it has been responsible for most of the circumstances in which people commit crime in this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  This Government has done more to reform the criminal justice system than any previous administration.  We have done so with due regard for the rights of the individual as well as the rights of society.  We have introduced legislation following careful analysis rather than a quick glance at the latest headlines, which seems to be the Progressive Democrats' mode of operation.  That is just one of the many differences between this stable coalition Government, which works, and the right-wing partnership proposed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The people have rejected that even before being offered that option.</P>

      <P>I thank all parties for allowing this important measure to pass all Stages today.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, there has been a great deal of debate on this matter. One could almost say there has been 32 years of debate on this issue since the O'Callaghan decision dealt with bail here.  Our bail laws have been abused for too long and this legislation will address this problem.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kathleen Lynch for her support for this legislation.  This Bill and the other measures I have brought to the House are all the better for the fact that there are three parties in Government.  There is cross-party discussion and all points of view on matters are heard.  It is a measure of how often I am in the House with proposals that I have to listen to the same cant every time from Deputy O'Donoghue about the nasty man from Kerry, Deputy Spring, the nasty Taoiseach and the nasty Minister for Social Welfare. It is the same every time.  I am glad we are in an election year because then Deputy O'Donoghue will have a chance to refresh his quotations and read more books over the summer and winter when he is back in Opposition.</P>

It makes one realise that Deputy O'Donoghue and his party will not give two hoots what their Progressive Democrats partners think.  They feel that a Fine Gael Minister should disregard what his or her Labour or Democratic Left colleagues feel about legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell should take that message to heart and be careful of lying down with the dog in this Chamber, to use the analogy of lying down with dogs and getting up with fleas.  She might get up with more than she expects.  Fianna Fáil has no respect for partnership.  We have seen they were not good partners for either the Progressive Democrats or Labour.

      <P>In preparing his Bills over the past two and a half years, I can only assume the Deputy has had the help of barristers or solicitors who, if asked, would have told him there are certain ways of expressing legislative provisions.  If the Deputy expects me, as a legislator, to decide I cannot use the words &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;, &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; or any other merely because they have been inserted in one of his Bills, all I can say is that I am not as petty as that.  Nor do I believe the general public, quite properly concerned about crime, is that impressed by the petty party political point-scoring in which Deputy O'Donoghue and, to a lesser degree, Deputy O'Donnell have engaged in today.  This Bill should be supported by all parties. We should not waste time picking holes in it merely to demonstrate, for example, that I will <Col N="1449" /> get ten out of ten for my efforts while somebody else may get only eight out of ten.  That is not what we are about; we are dealing with serious legislation.  I wish Deputy O'Donoghue would emerge from the mould in which he has become so entrenched to the extent that, no matter what I do, he will not support any of my Bills as good legislation while highlighting some deficiencies or provisions he might have included if he were Minister for Justice.  He should grow up.  There are times when he can be gracious or magnanimous and command respect but he does not command respect for the kind of petty political party point-scoring in which he has engaged this morning.</P>
      <P>Given what the two Opposition speakers have said in the course of this debate and all the opportunities the Fianna Fáil Party has had, it is quite extraordinary they did nothing about this issue while in Government.  I remember them holding a big party about five years ago to celebrate and boast about the fact that, for 50 of the 70 years since the foundation of this State they had been in Government.  If we encounter problems, where does one point the finger of blame if not at the party which governed this country over those 50 years.  That is the logical conclusion to be drawn from that party claiming it had been in charge over that period.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Deputy O'Donnell spoke this morning.  I noticed that no member of her party intervened on Second Stage of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill.  It is unusual in the case of a debate on a Bill as serious as that for an Opposition party not to have even one speaker intervene.  I am glad to note Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donoghue have been converted.  Both had an opportunity, the Progressive Democrats to a lesser extent, to resolve the difficulties on bail, yet they did nothing. Deputy O'Donoghue eulogises today on all of the Bills he presented but when Fine Gael, in Opposition, introduced a Bill, Fianna Fáil's response in Government was to send it to the Law Reform Commission for examination.  The commission produced a fine report, having engaged in considerable research on the issue.  Deputy O'Donoghue should not endeavour to persuade me that was not a buck-passing exercise simply because the then Government did not want to accept Deputy Gay Mitchell's Bill on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Progressive Democrats were in Government with the Fianna Fáil Party for a few years, when their marriage was working reasonably, it made no endeavour to push its partners into doing something about bail.  The Pauline conversion did not take place until they were in Opposition.  It is very easy in Opposition to remark across the floor of the Chamber, that the Government is not doing anything.  That party had its chance but did not avail of it so its Members should not come bleating and crying that it is disgraceful it has taken so long to introduce this Bill.  Although I know Deputy O'Donoghue has not even reached the age of 50, his <Col N="1450" /> party has been in power for that number of years and had plenty of opportunity to do what this Government has done.  It is an incontrovertible fact that this three-party Government &mdash; with all its attendant benefits, representing, as it does, many different sectors of the population &mdash; has grappled effectively with this problem within a very short time.  All the huffing and puffing to the contrary, all the promises about what that party would do next time round, fall on deaf ears. Whenever possible, the Deputy should quietly applaud this Government outside the glare of publicity and the full Press Gallery often present to listen to his contributions, because all Members of the House recognise that this Bill, through a two-pronged approach, deals adequately with this issue.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient merely to give legislative effect to the result of the referendum on bail, so that judges can refuse bail whenever there is a suspicion that somebody will commit a serious offence while on bail.  We have broadened the provisions of this Bill to include issues that did not warrant the holding of a referendum, which could have been dealt with during all those years of Fianna Fáil Government.  All those cries about estreatment of bail and bail conditions could have been dealt with but were not.  The record will show, 50 or 100 years hence, that this Government amended the bail laws.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate many issues about prison accommodation were raised.  I wish I could will prisons into existence.  Even in having a porch built on to one's house, inevitably there is a two months' delay in obtaining planning permission, perhaps another four months to have an appeal dealt with by An Bord Pleanála, further delay in engaging a builder, plumber or whoever.  Even such a small project takes time.  How much more time is required to build something as significant as a prison?  This Government has committed approximately £135 million to an unprecedented prison building programme.  The last prison built here was commenced between 1986 and 1987 when the then Fine Gael-Labour Government was in office.  A new sod was not turned on another prison building.  Writing a phoney line, committing approximately £4.5 million in a phoney budget &mdash; which everybody knew would never see the light of day &mdash; did not amount to building a prison.  There had not been even one line of planning committed to paper, no quantity surveyor had inspected the site, not a single thing had been done other than build a wall.</P>
    <P>This charade must cease.  I visited Castlerea again the week before last.  The buildings are being constructed as I speak, the diggers, workmen, electricians, plumbers are all on site building the larger part.  Real, live, warm-bodied prisoners are housed in that prison as I speak.</P>

      <P>They are proof of its existence.  I fully accept that, while that prison building programme is being completed, nobody has any choice but to accept the continued existence of the revolving door system.  The revolving door was equally well oiled when I entered this Department on 16 December 1994.  The reason I know is that I read the contributions by Deputy McDowell and others in the Progressive Democrats when Deputy O'Donoghue's party was in Government in 1993-94.  A brief year after the Progressive Democrats had left Government, Deputy McDowell said: &ldquo;this Government [meaning the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government] is indicted because of the revolving door system, so many prisoners are being released every week due to lack of space in prison&rdquo;.  As the French would put it: <i>plus ca change, plus c'est la même chose</i>&mdash; the more things change, the more they stay the same.  Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy O'Donoghue ought not give me any lectures about the revolving door.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was well oiled when I took over this office.  Given our prison building programme it is this Government that will put the block on the revolving door.  I recognise it is taking hardearned taxpayers' money to do this but the people will accept that £135 million is a reasonable amount to ensure people serve their sentences. It is not just a promise.  The accelerated building prison programme has already produced almost 200 places in our system.  In two and a half years that is a huge record of extra places in the system.  By the end of this year I expect the wing of Limerick prison to be ready for occupation.</P>
      <P>The contract for the women's prison is about to be signed.  The contract for the remand centre in Wheatfield is almost ready for signing and Castlerea is being built.  These are not wishy washy promises or a phoney line in a phoney budget in a Government that existed with one party without a majority.  These are real facts and figures.</P>
      <P>I invite Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donoghue to visit Limerick prison and see the building that is taking place.  I invite them to go to Castlerea and dirty their feet in the muck and dirt on the building site and come back and tell me if the building programme is not being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the 400 place remand centre in Wheatfield, it is not today or yesterday that this country needed a separate remand prison.  I do not wish to harp on it but why was it not built before now?  It is being built now.  I say to Deputy O'Donnell, as she dwelt on this matter at some length, our remand prisoners are kept in a separate <Col N="1452" /> wing, the B wing in Mountjoy, which is set aside for remand prisoners who have a more lenient regime than convicted prisoners.  From time to time very recently sentenced prisoners are kept there until such time as a place in the other wings of Mountjoy become available.  They are moved quickly out of the remand prison.  Although we do not have a separate structure on a separate site the remand prisoners are separated as far as possible from convicted prisoners and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>When complete, there will be a small separate remand unit in Castlerea to allow for the movement of prisoners from the courts in the western counties into Castlerea.  A prisoner brought to a court in, say, Castlebar, on a Monday, having committed a robbery is driven 150 miles to Mountjoy and remanded in custody and perhaps another prisoner is moved elsewhere to accommodate that remand prisoner.  A week later the remand prisoner is driven the 150 miles back with all the time it takes a prison officer, the Garda or whoever is escorting to Castlebar or to the court to be remanded further.  When the Castlerea remand centre and full prison is open, a prisoner will be driven the 30 or so miles to Castlerea and remanded there.  As a result of other legislation passed he can be brought to the court nearest the place of detention where he is remanded.  In this instance in Castlerea it will be to a court about five miles away in Roscommon town.  The effect of building that prison with the remand unit and my dovetailing legislation to allow for a prisoner to be brought to a court nearest the place of detention will be evident to everybody.  Antiquated law existed all the years during which Fianna Fáil was in Government and the years in which the Progressive Democrats Party was in Government, but neither party considered changing it.  I am changing it with the backing of the Government to ensure we cut down on overtime costs, travel time, the risk of somebody trying to abscond and the time taken to bring people to court for sentence or release as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the provision for 400 remand places in Wheatfield.  By the time this legislation is enacted and implemented there will be a small overlap of time because the remand prison will not be ready until early in 1998.  I have no doubt there will be an overlap and I say that honestly because I cannot supply a magic prison for 400 places overnight.  We involved private industry in the design and building of this prison. They submitted tenders and a private contractor is building it.  The only area we did not move into &mdash; as is done in some other juridictions &mdash; is getting private industry to run the prison.  That is a step we have not taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the private sector financing any of the projects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this is a fallacy.  I have the money from the Government to spend on these prisons.  There is no less expensive way of raising <Col N="1453" /> money for our prisons than through the public coffers.  Private industry says it has masses of money.  In this instance I did not need its money because I have Government approval to spend the money.  If in the future we need yet another prison and the resources are not available most certainly one could consider asking private industry to finance it and lease it back.  It is not that much cheaper in the end because the State will ultimately pay back the money to private industry by way of large rents over the years &mdash; the same way in which the toll bridges are financed.  I am not ruling that out at some time in the future but in this case I have a commitment to the £135 million and I do not need to go out to the private industry looking for the money.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the companies who have been involved in our accelerated building programme. They have worked extremely hard with the officials of my Department and the Office of Public Works, under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Hugh Coveney, to ensure any hiccups along the way are immediately rectified. If something unusual is found on a site which makes the building more awkward there is an immediate response from the companies to assist in finding solutions.  The company in Castlerea which has received the contract is working hell for leather to fulfil its commitment.  I had the pleasure of meeting those people recently and I am pleased to say they are local builders from the area.  It is good to see a small local builder getting such a contract and they are all working extremely well.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the facilities will be in place in time to take up the results of this legislation, with perhaps a small overlap of a few months but no more.  As with any new legislation its implementation will take time.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell said that amounts of money I have announced for prison places is a jumble of figures.  I will try to write them more simply for the Deputy and send them to her.  They are not a jumble of figures, they are real figures.  In the two and a half year period I will have been Minister for Justice a real record will be left behind.  I defy any other Minister in this Department for two and a half years to match my record in my two and a half year period.  Previous two and a half year periods will look paltry in terms of the paucity of ideas and actions.  I have looked at the records prior to my taking office from the point of view of legislation and I find that no serious legislation of the type I have brought in was enacted during previous Governments.  Deputy O'Donnell is correct in saying overcrowding in our prisons is a matter of great concern to me and the public.  However, it can only be tackled by new prison places.  The prisons must also provide a humane service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch was right to express confusion about the position taken by the Progressive Democrats.  They do not want additional public spending yet Senator Honan recently told the Seanad that she wanted another prison in Portlaoise <Col N="1454" /> with 600 places.  This would entail additional expenditure of approximately £100 million.  Deputy O'Donnell also referred to the need for more prison places.  These can only be provided with public money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <P>The Progressive Democrats cannot have it both ways.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratio of prison officers to prisoners is very high in this country compared to others.  This reflects the violence in Northern Ireland over 25 years, which distorted the manner in which the prison staff grew because it was necessary to have a high ratio of staff to paramilitary prisoners.  The prison officers who went to the Curragh prison when it was opened came from other institutions.  This was the correct approach because, together with building new prisons we must incorporate modern technology and means of prison care.  Such measures will reduce the ratio of staff to prisoners to a manageable level, contingent with safety for staff and prisoners.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell inquired about the prison agency.  I have recently published the report of the expert group, which was chaired by an eminent businessman.  Work is continuing on the legislation to establish the agency.  The entire prison structure must be modernised and incorporated under a new agency.  Similar to the establishment of An Post and Telecom Éireann, there must be communication with the staff involved in the prison system to make the necessary changes. I will not promise, as perhaps my predecessors did, that this can be done immediately.  The views of approximately 2,300 prison officers, the staff in my Department, governors, etc., must be addressed in ensuring that the legislation will provide a more effective prison service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was much innuendo in the remarks by Deputy O'Donnell and others that those managing our prisons have been responsible for mismanagement and overcrowding.  Management is doing an excellent job.  If there is overcrowding in the prisons it is as a result of a lack of Government action in the years 1986-94, when no prisons were built, despite the increase in the crime figures in the period 1989-94.  It was obvious that a commensurate number of extra prison places needed to be provided.  Inevitably, the bubble <Col N="1455" /> burst because there is only so much pressure the system can take.</P>
    <P>The system is overcrowded.  The courts are more efficient and are delivering people to the prisons at a much faster rate than was the case when I took up office because we revolutionised the courts system through the appointment of extra judges and staff and the changes in mechanisms which were introduced.  All those involved in the courts system graciously acknowledge that they have never seen such revolutionary changes to the courts since I took up office.  I thank them for their praise, which has appeared in a number of magazine articles.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot wish away the overcrowding. It will not be completely tackled until the effect of the new prison building programme is felt in the system.  Nevertheless, the Government has also introduced other changes, such as the provision of more probation and welfare service officers.  This will create a better system and bring to an end unsupervised releases from prison.</P>
    <P>Early releases are a feature of our prison system since 1960.  Fianna Fáil was in Government then and introduced legislation to allow for early release, which is termed &ldquo;parole&rdquo; in some countries. It is a proper part of any humane prison system that, at a certain stage in a sentence, consideration can be given to releasing a prisoner to take up work, go into training, or, more prevalently nowadays, undertake drug treatment. However, it is important that such people are supervised.  The system of releasing people in an unsupervised fashion must come to an end although I am the first to admit that there are insufficient probation and welfare officers to do this.  However, it is a far less expensive way to deal with prisoners when they near the end of their sentences than to have them serve the full term with no control over what happens when they are released.  It is sometimes good to see how prisoners will deal with their freedom, especially at the end of a long sentence.  They should be allowed a number of weeks to become re-accustomed to society and to see how they can cope so that the necessary support systems they require can be put in place.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for recognising that this legislation is long overdue.  This Government is providing the legislation, not the promises given by those who were in Government and could have addressed the issue.  I hope the courts will understand the reason the Oireachtas is bringing in this legislation and the reason it is considered desirable to introduce these powers.  They are appropriate to today's Ireland.  The legislation is an effective, anti-crime measure which will tip the balance in favour of law abiding citizens and victims of crime.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1)(a), between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii) require the accused person to enter into a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and to abstain from any form of criminal activity (including the commission of an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 &mdash; 1984) for the duration of the case,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 6(1)(a) states:</P>
      <P>Where an accused person is admitted to bail on his or her entering into a recognisance, the recognisance shall, in addition to the condition requiring his or her appearance before the court at the end of the period of the remand of the accused person, be subject to the following conditions&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first condition is that the accused shall not commit any offence and the second is that the accused shall otherwise be of good behaviour. <Col N="1457" /> The amendment would require the accused person to enter into a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour but also to abstain from any form of criminal activity, including the commission of an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1984, for the duration of the case.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, states that, subject to section 3 (3) and section 4 (3) of that Act, a person shall not have a controlled drug in his possession.  A person who has a controlled drug in his possession in contravention of section 3 (1) shall be guilty of an offence.  The Minister may, by order, declare that section 3(1) shall not apply to a controlled drug specified in the order and, for so long as an order under that subsection is in force, the prohibition contained in subsection (1) shall not apply to a drug which is a controlled drug specified in the order.</P>
    <P>This provision gives statutory effect to the fact that there is no constitutional right to possess and consume illegal drugs.  The amendment would also give statutory effect to that position.  Amendment No. 5 provides for the monitoring of accused persons to ensure compliance with the terms of their bail.  At present, there is little or no incentive or direction by the courts, because of legislative voids, to ensure that drug addicts who are guilty of serious crimes undergo treatment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 suggests that if an individual comes before the court and is granted bail, the court, if it deems it necessary, could make an order, as a condition of the person's bail, that he or she must abstain from the possession of illegal drugs.  The amendment is bolstered by amendment No. 5 under which the person would be required to attend a designated location on specified days for the purpose of providing a urine sample which could be analysed in order to ascertain whether the accused was in breach of the condition specified in amendment No. 2 by consuming a controlled drug other than a drug prescribed by a registered medical practitioner as part of recognised drug treatment course.</P>
    <P>The twin objectives are to prevent the individual consuming illegal drugs, if that is possible, while also ensuring that he or she receives treatment for his or her addiction.  It would be a condition, as set out in amendment No. 6, that the court would inform the accused person of the location of the nearest appropriate treatment centre for drug addiction.  If such a request was made by the individual, an appointment would be made for them.  If a condition of a person's bail was that he or she refrained from using or possessing illegal drugs, pursuant to section 3 of the 1977 Act, there would be a large incentive for the individual to undergo treatment.</P>
    <P>Modern criminal legislation should recognise what is happening on the streets and the reality that the vast majority of crime is committed by habitual drug addicts.  Society has failed to recognise that reality.  Some people believe that 80 per cent of the crime committed in Dublin is drug related.  That is an extremely high percentage but <Col N="1458" /> if one accepts that figure, the law must reflect that problem and suggest remedies.  Experience shows that the prison route alone in relation to offenders who are drug addicts is unsuccessful. Therefore, the system must be changed and in this context, as I have repeatedly said, a drug treatment detention unit is required.</P>
    <P>Our laws do not reflect the drug-related crime problem and the amendment does little more than recognise reality.  It innovatively links the solving of the crime problem, in so far as that can be achieved, to the solving of an individual's drug addiction.  The amendments attempt to protect society from criminality, which is a superior obligation, while at the same time vindicating the addict's right to bodily integrity.  The amendments balance the scales and their objectives can be achieved in the context of an individual being granted bail provided these conditions are accepted.  Nowhere in our criminal law is there a recognition of the necessity to put treatment on a statutory footing.  This has to be done because, in the final analysis, all the criminal sanctions in the world will not lessen the number of crimes committed in society, unless we lessen the number of habitual drug users.  The sooner we face this fact the better.</P>
    <P>These amendments would be a small step along the road to realising the objectives to which I referred.  I am not so naive as to believe they would help in a major way to resolve the problem but I am conscious that they would help along the way and anything that does that should be seriously considered by the Government.  They have not been plucked out of the air, they were included in the Fianna Fáil Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995, the vast majority of which has been included in this Bill.  There is no reason I can think of for their exclusion.  I recommend that they be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the objectives and reasons given by Deputy O'Donoghue in support of his worthy amendments which properly highlight the necessary interface between the criminal justice system and the health services in tackling the problem of drug addiction.  On any day of the week crowds of young people turn up at the Dublin District Courts to face charges and, inevitably, they are granted bail.  This presents the State with an ideal opportunity to make a critical intervention by directing young people with a drug addiction towards drug rehabilitation programmes.</P>
      <P>This is the kind of amendment which causes difficulties in terms of departmental responsibilities. While the Minister for Justice is responsible, in dealing with this category of offender, for the criminal justice aspects, her colleague, the Minister for Health, and the Eastern Health Board, the statutory agency involved, are responsible for providing the necessary health services.  This is a cumbersome arrangement and we have not yet managed to dovetail their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> I suggested in an amendment to the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill that assets seized under the Bill, particularly from those involved in organised crime, should be ploughed back into drug rehabilitation programmes.  That would be a fair and reasonable approach to take but I was informed in reply to a parliamentary question as recently as last week that, because of the way the Department of Finance organises its business, it is not possible to do this, even though it would make perfect sense.  All assets seized have to be placed in the maw of the Department of Finance before being allocated to various Departments, including the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>When a young drug addict turns up at the courts is there a better opportunity for the State and the health authorities to make the vital connection and to grant bail on condition that he or she receives treatment for drug addiction?  It is reckless to grant bail to young drug addicts with no obvious means of support knowing that they must reoffend to feed their habit.  As things stand, the health authorities cannot move in to help them to overcome their addiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept Deputy O'Donoghue's motives and bone fides in tabling these amendments but &mdash; Deputy O'Donnell touched on this point &mdash; a bail hearing is not the appropriate time to decide how people can be helped to overcome a drug habit as there is a danger that their drug addiction could be criminalised.  They are before the judge because the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided that they have a case to answer in respect of a serious offence such as murder, rape or mugging.  The matters to be considered by the courts in deciding whether a person should be refused bail are set out in the Bill. In refusing bail, however, a judge may take the person's drug addiction into consideration.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 seems to be superfluous and would cause confusion.  Section 6(1) (a) states that a recognisance should include the condition that an accused person shall not commit any offence and shall otherwise be of good behaviour. However, the amendment includes a specific reference to the commission of an offence under a specific section of a specific Act, that is, section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1984.  As the Bill refers to the commission of any offence, it is all encompassing.  It would make no sense, therefore, to mention a specific offence.  Why mention drug offences and not murder?  Inclusion of the amendment would not make this a better Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All three amendments stem from Deputy O'Donoghue's approach to dealing with drug problems.  Regardless of the merits of his amendment, this is not the appropriate Bill to deal with this matter.  We are not dealing in the Bill with drug addiction, we are dealing with the right to bail in very specific circumstances of a person alleged to have committed a serious offence.  This matter could more appropriately be dealt with by way of an amendment to the Misuse of Drugs <Col N="1460" /> Act, 1977, or in a Bill dealing with sentencing policy. If we were to allow a court to deal with this matter it would have to bring in health workers, counsellors and a plethora of other people to decide the extent of the addiction and what is causing it.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy O'Donoghue's point but it is not appropriate to deal with this matter in the Bill as we could end up criminalising drug addiction.  The Bill deals with people who are alleged to have committed serious offences, not their addiction.  There may well be a case for providing a wider range of sanctions when sentencing a person with a drug addiction for a particular crime.  In cases where a judge decides that drug addiction is a serious element in the crime committed by a person he should have more sentencing options available to him.  I am looking seriously at this matter and have stated publicly that the time has come to provide under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, a drug treatment facility to which courts can send people.  We were ahead of our time in including this provision in the 1977 Act as the number of people with a serious drug addiction coming before the courts at that time was small.  However, in view of the increase in the number of people with a drug addiction coming before the courts I will push strongly on our return to office after the general election to have this matter dealt with.</P>
    <P>The proposals in Deputy O'Donoghue's amendments are inappropriate and would give rise to substantial technical problems.  As the relatives of drug addicts know, dealing with the problem of addiction is very difficult.  The complexities of drug addiction would not be appropriately addressed in a Bill dealing with bail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it would be extraordinary if a court decided it should impose a condition on a person being granted bail in, say, a murder case that he should not commit an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  However, she then said there was no need for my amendment as section 6 provides that one condition of bail is that the accused person must not commit an offence and that as it is already an offence to possess illegal drugs there is no need to specify this in the Bill.  While these statements are contradictory, I accept the Bill provides that an accused person must not commit an offence while on bail.  Perhaps I should have tabled an amendment similar to my amendment No. 2 which would have proposed the deletion of section (1) (a) (i) and required the accused person to enter into a bond to keep the peace, be of good behaviour and to abstain from any form of criminal activity, including the commission of an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1984, for the duration of the case.  I included the reference to the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1984, in amendment No. 2 for the purpose of emphasis as I accepted that the commission of a criminal offence would obviously be prohibited as a condition of bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> Murder and rape are horrific crimes but the reality is that many hidden crimes are not reported.  Ordinary citizens are plagued by the threat of having their cars stolen or broken into or their houses burgled while they are away for a weekend, while newsagents and the owners of other shops are afraid of nightly attacks by thugs on their premises.  Many of the individuals who commit these offences are addicted to hard drugs. If we recognise that this is the truth then we must also recognise the need to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which is copied from the Fianna Fáil Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995, provides that the court must take into account certain circumstances in exercising its jurisdiction.  These include the nature and degree of the seriousness of the offence with which the accused person is charged and the sentence likely to be imposed on conviction.  The Bill also states that the court can take into account that an accused person is addicted to a controlled drug within the meaning of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>If a judge believes that the nature and degree of the seriousness of the offence are not such that he should refuse bail, and that the offence is a lesser one, then it appears he could not refuse bail on the basis that the individual concerned was addicted to a controlled drug within the meaning of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  This means that a person charged before a court with, say, a minor burglary who is also a drug addict would get bail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probable that such an individual would commit another offence.  In those circumstances it should be the statutory duty of the court to minimise the risk to society from that individual.  The best way of doing this is to put in place a mechanism whereby the individual can be encouraged to undergo treatment. For example, the individual could be required by the court to attend a designated location on specified days for the purposes of providing a urine sample which could be analysed to ascertain whether he had committed an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, which relates to the possession of drugs.  Obviously, if the individual consumed a controlled drug, he or she would have been in possession of it.  That would not require a panel of exports coming into the court or, to use the Minister's phrase, clogging up the system.  The judge would merely ask the individual to go to a designated location so that an analysis could be carried out as to whether the individual was guilty of an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next amendment states that the court would inform the accused person of the location of the nearest appropriate treatment centre for drug addiction and arrange for the Probation and Welfare Service to make an appointment at that centre for the accused person.  That is not imposing any great burden on the individual <Col N="1462" /> before the court or criminalising consumption. Far from it, it is encouraging the individual towards treatment, and we must do that in our criminal legislation.  We must also recognise that the Ireland of today is not the Ireland of 30 years ago, and it never again will be.</P>
    <P>If we are to contain the drugs problem, let alone resolve it, we will have to recognise in criminal legislation the position on the streets. These amendments merely recognise that reality and ensure that an individual before a court who is a drug addict and who is granted bail will take steps to obtain treatment for that addiction.  The individual who is addicted to hard drugs is entitled to that under our Constitution so that the individual's right to bodily integrity can be vindicated. Society is entitled to expect the Oireachtas to protect it from criminality.  Those twin objectives can be achieved if the Minister accepts my amendments Nos. 5 and 6.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 2, I accept that matter is already covered in section 6 (1) (a).  The other two matters are not covered, however, and while I will not press amendment No. 2, I am firmly of the view that amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are not draconian and that they serve a valid and laudable purpose &mdash; protecting society from criminality and vindicating the addict's right to bodily integrity.  They are worthy of support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already outlined the reason I do not think this is an appropriate vehicle to do what Deputy O'Donoghue is trying to do in his amendments.  I am glad he accepts that his first amendment is superfluous and would cause confusion. I accept Deputy O'Donoghue's bona fides in regard to his amendments Nos. 5 and 6, but he is regarding a bail hearing as an opportunity to intervene where someone has a drug problem. Amendment No. 6 requires that the court informs specified persons of the location of the nearest appropriate treatment centre and direct the probation and welfare officer to make an appointment for the accused if the accused so requests. The measure is dependent, therefore, upon the accused making a request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are really talking about a court exercising criminal jurisdiction.  I am aware that, from time to time, judges intervene to help an accused when they are in the process of trying a case, the end result of which might be the imposition of a sentence. In this case, however, we are talking about a bail hearing.  Deputy O'Donoghue outlined a range of criminal activities which are unacceptable in our society, but this Bill is being introduced to ensure such people do not get bail. There are sufficient clauses in the legislation to allow a judge to determine that people such as those referred to by Deputy O'Donoghue, who may have intimidated a shopkeeper with perhaps the use of a syringe, should be refused bail because all the indicators suggest such people will commit a similar crime if released on bail.  Under this legislation, the bulk of the people to whom <Col N="1463" /> the Deputy referred will be those to whom judges will refuse bail.</P>
    <P>In this case we are talking about circumstances in which a judge might be inclined to refuse to grant bail.  The effect of the amendment would be to turn a bail application hearing into some sort of referral centre for drug treatment.  Perhaps that should be reflected more in our laws but it is not appropriate in this legislation, and it will cause confusion if it is included.  It is neither necessary nor appropriate.  These are valid amendments that would be more appropriate to other criminal law on sentencing or in a health Act in regard to treatment for drug addicts.  I urge the Deputy not to press the amendments because they are not appropriate to bail legislation.  In addition, there would be certain problems with the wording.  I ask the Deputy to accept my bona fides in this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1) (b) (iii), line 18, after &ldquo;possession&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or, if he or she is not in possession of a passport or travel document, that he or she refrains from applying for a passport or travel document&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment essentially meets the point put forward in Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment No. 4 but is more consistent with the other conditions set out in section 6 (1) (b) (iii) as drafted. The intention of both amendments is to supplement the existing condition in section 6(1)(b)(iii) in relation to an accused person surrendering any passport or travel document in his or her possession.  While the general power contained in the section to attach such conditions as the court considers appropriate would likely cover the position, for the sake of completeness we are now adding a condition to the effect that, where a person does not have a passport or travel document, he or she will refrain from applying for one while on bail.  The Deputy's amendment also refers to notification to be sent by a court to <Col N="1464" /> the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I have not had the opportunity in the time available to consult the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs about this, but I will discuss with him the additional administrative arrangements that might be made in this regard.  In the circumstances and to ensure that there is no lacuna, I amendment No. 4 in the wording of the official amendment although it would be covered under section 6(1)(b)(iii).</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice has explained precisely the objective of this amendment. It is to ensure that an individual who does not have a passport would not be in a position to apply for one if the court granting bail required that to prevent the person absconding.  My amendment also includes a requirement that the passport be surrendered to a specified member of the Garda Síochána.  I understand the Minister's amendment to mean that it should be handed in to the court, and that is satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I suggest also that notification of the undertakings should be sent by the court to the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure, if an individual did apply for a passport or for the renewal of a passport, that the Department would refuse to process it on the basis that that individual had been granted bail subject to a condition that he or she would not apply for a passport.  I am satisfied with the Minister's amendment and her undertaking to discuss the matter with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who participated in this debate on the bail issue not only today but when we dealt with the referendum legislation and during the previous year when we dealt with the issue of bail.  I am pleased that 32 years after the O'Callaghan judgement we have amended our bail laws by way of a referendum and legislation.  We have done a good day's work for law abiding citizens and the victims of crime who have suffered at the hands of criminals in this State.  This is a fair way to deal with bail.  It is not easy for an Oireachtas to deprive people of their liberty, but there are times when the State must do so.  The legislation is drafted in such a way that I hope it will be <Col N="1467" /> interpreted in an appropriate and humane manner by the judges who implement it.</P>
      <P>Up to now many people received bail because only the fear of absconding or of interfering with witnesses could be used as reasons for refusing it.  I want to send a loud message to those who commit crimes against people and property.  Their crime days will be shortened by the use of this legislation which will prevent them from committing a series of crimes while on bail.  Many criminals have boasted about the number of crimes &mdash; in some cases up to 20 &mdash; they committed while on bail.  I hope those days are over.</P>
      <P>I thank Members from all sides for their co-operation and involvement in the debate on the Bill.  I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I join the Minister in thanking everybody who contributed to passing this legislation, not least the officials in her Department. When this House passed the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, it was felt that by providing for the imposition of a subsequent sentence on an individual who committed an offence while on bail we would help to solve crime.  To a large extent, when the message got across that criminals would receive a consecutive sentence if they committed a crime while on bail, the number of crimes committed by people while on bail decreased significantly. However, the courts later interpreted that to mean a consecutive suspended sentence.  The message then went out that criminals would not serve any greater sentence by committing crimes while on bail and, consequently, the figures more than doubled in a short time.  That is why I have always advocated the need for a bail referendum and legislation on foot of the referendum.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the Minister's commitment to holding a referendum on bail.  It would be churlish and remiss of me not to acknowledge that her commitment was wholehearted although it is unfortunate, but true, that the Labour Party or Democratic Left did not want a bail referendum or this legislation.</P>

      <P>That is why it took two years from the time I introduced a Fianna Fáil Bill on bail to have practically the same Bill placed on the Statute Book.  The Minister's Bill resembles in almost every respect the Bill I introduced on 3 May 1995, but that was voted down by the rainbow coalition Government.  Even though it is two years later, I am pleased the legislation will be on the Statute Book within a short period of time. The lesson we must learn from this is that we have to wait a long time for the Labour Party or Democratic Left to act on crime or bail.</P>

      <P>I welcome the passage of the Bill through the House.  It represents the culmination of a long, considered and tortuous debate <Col N="1468" /> in favour of changing our liberal bail laws.  The O'Callaghan decision was referred to in Kelly's edition of the Constitution as a spectacular liberal bridgehead on the territory of the State's claim to have accused persons remanded in custody pending trial.  Perhaps that liberal approach was appropriate to the level of crime in the late 1950s and 1960s.</P>
      <P>I do not believe we will regret agreeing to this considered change in our bail regime.  However, the arguments against changing the law could not be swept aside and that is what caused the long delay.  It cannot be said that there has not been adequate debate on this matter.  All concerns have been fully considered.  This is a good measure which vindicates the rights of law abiding citizens as well as not overriding the rights of the accused to a fair trial.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The significant contribution that youth organisations make towards improving the lot of young disadvantaged people merits the allocation of specific resources.  Many young people are unable to participate fully in society. The symptoms of disadvantage include being away from home, in trouble with the authorities and non-attendance or poor achievement at school.</P>
      <P>In 1973 it was estimated that 16 per cent of all children under the age of 14 lived in households with less than half the average income and that by 1987 that figure had increased to 26 per cent. In the European Union the percentage of young people unemployed has remained at twice the level of all those unemployed.  We still have a major unemployment problem.  A recent opinion poll identified unemployment as the main cause of concern after crime.  The perceived boom in the economy is of little consolation to the 262,500 people unemployed.  Growth in the economy must be translated into jobs, particularly for those who are long-term unemployed.  There are large numbers of young people among the unemployed. Some 61,700 people between the ages of 18 and 25 are signing on the live register.  Half the long-term unemployed do not have any formal qualifications.  It is obvious that the educationally disadvantaged young person is most at risk of becoming unemployed and being caught in long-term unemployment.  The cycle of poverty and unemployment will continue when the majority of those who are educationally disadvantaged come from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The serious problems that arise from educational disadvantage are obvious when one considers that 25,000 young people leaving school each year could be classified as educationally disadvantaged, <Col N="1469" /> 13,000 of whom could be classified as severely educationally disadvantaged.  They deserve better.  This serious cycle of disadvantage needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Drug misuse and unemployment are serious social problems and affect young people disproportionately. Parents from all areas express to public representatives their concern about children falling into the grip of drugs.  A recently published Fianna Fáil policy document represents our determination to implement a truly integrated drugs and drug-related crime policy rather than the sporadic and unrelated drugs initiatives which have been a feature of recent Government policy. Drugs cause horrific human misery in every segment of our society.</P>
    <P>The lives of those addicted to drugs are out of control and, unfortunately, all too often end in the ultimate tragedy.  The evidence indicates that communities suffering multiple disadvantage, such as very high unemployment and low educational attainments, have also had the highest concentrations of drug addiction and the attendant drug dealing and crime problems.  These communities are located primarily in Dublin, but there are communities in all cities and most urban areas which have suffered disproportionately from the ravages of drugs.  The official services have failed those communities where local parents and community organisations have tried to hold the line against the drugs onslaught.</P>
    <P>Our party will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  Section 4 refers to the procedure to be followed by an education board in relation to the invitation of proposals from voluntary youth work organisations before the board may provide that programme or service.  The board appears to be given absolute discretion in the delivery of the service and I note the board is required to review this decision.  That weakens the safeguard which the section appears to offer voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>On the withdrawal or reduction of financial assistance, the education board appears to be the judge and jury in its own case.  Surely there must be provision for some independent assessment. The whole tendering procedure in relation to the invitation of proposals for the operation of youth services is not clear.  Section 4(8) gives further power to the education board, in that it can decide whether the proposals made by the voluntary organisations are suitable.  The board would have a vested interest in a judgement, in that it could take on the work if it deems unsuitable the proposals submitted by the youth organisations. It would appear that once again the education board is the judge and jury in its own case.  I hope on Committee Stage the Minister will amend the Bill or give some clear indication that will not be the case if education boards are established.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the establishment of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. The establishment of this committee is welcome but the explanatory memorandum on section 11 contains a declaration of intent that &ldquo;the number <Col N="1470" /> of nominees of the prescribed body representing voluntary youth work organisations will be about equal to the combined number of nominees of other Ministers and FÁS&rdquo;.  However, it is obvious an intention will not have any force in law and we will need clarification on this matter.  It appears from section 11(3)(a) that in theory at least only one representative of the voluntary youth organisations need be appointed.  This does not make sense in the context of the composition of the committee.</P>
    <P>Section 15 prescribes the structure and electoral process of voluntary youth councils.  That represents &ldquo;over the top&rdquo; interference in the internal affairs of voluntary youth organisations which prevents them by law from appointing employees to the voluntary youth council.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the establishment of youth work committees.  Will the Minister of State indicate if employees of youth organisations can be members of youth work committees, even though they are excluded from membership of the voluntary youth council?  Sections 17 and 18 are not the major step forward in the area of empowering the volunteers that has been suggested.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for the withdrawal or reduction of a grant.  Is there a need for an independent appeals procedure in this regard?  It is not clear where the Department's funding obligation will end and that of the education boards will begin.</P>
    <P>Section 22 and 23 provide for the prescribing by the Minister of voluntary youth work organisations and this would appear to be a step in the right direction, particularly in regard to the need to establish a general register of youth work organisations.  There is further room for improvement in the provision of safeguards against individuals, who are clearly unsuitable for youth work, establishing their own services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to the debate in this House and am I glad to have this opportunity to respond to a number of the issues raised.  On a positive note, I express my appreciation that Deputy Smith gave a general welcome to the publication of the Youth Work Bill, 1997, and a particular welcome to the primacy of the volunteer in youth work, as enshrined in the Bill.  I agree with Deputy Smith that in the youth service the volunteer youth workers need the support of paid youth workers.</P>
      <P>Some doubt has been raised by the Opposition as to the true extent of the commitment of this Government to youth work and, in particular, as to the adequacy of the funding provided for youth work.  I point to this Government having done something no previous Government did.  It introduced the first ever Government sponsored legislation for the development of youth work.  This is proof positive this Government is totally committed to youth work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of funding, there has been steady <Col N="1471" /> progress.  The total expenditure of the youth affairs section in 1987 was £3,765,000 whereas in 1996 the corresponding figure was £13,908,000.  In 1997 the allocation for the youth affairs section is £13,395,000, but that decrease since 1996 is due entirely to the fact that responsibility for certain child care and substance abuse projects has this year been transferred to the Department of Health.  Those projects, although resourced previously by the youth affairs section, were not youth work initiatives and were always more appropriate to the Department of Health.  When one disregards the funding for those child care and substance abuse projects, the 1997 provision for the youth affairs section still represents an increase over the equivalent 1996 figure.  It is worth noting in this connection that the 1996 provision represented an increase of more than 10 per cent over the corresponding figure for 1995.</P>
    <P>The rise in funding in 1996 allowed me to extend provision under the grant scheme for special projects to assist disadvantaged youth, and that ties in with Deputy Smith's point about drugs in our community.  We are aiming at young people at risk and are making more out-of-school youth work opportunities available to young people who are at risk due to a combination of factors ranging from early school leaving, low income, unemployment, substance abuse and social isolation.  It also permitted me to allocate sufficient funds for the maintenance and development of mainline youth work programmes and services provided by the national and major regional voluntary youth organisations through the youth service grant scheme.  In addition, the extra resources available in 1996 enabled me to undertake development in the network of youth information centres, in terms of extending the network of centres and helping to meet the modern information technology requirements of that network.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith asked whether, under the provisions of the Youth Work Bill, youth organisations would continue to receive direct grants from the Department of Education.  The position in this regard is that, while responsibility for the funding of local and regional youth work programmes and services would in general be devolved from the Department of Education to the education boards, sections 8 and 19 of the Youth Work Bill empower the Department to allocate direct grants to voluntary youth work organisations in respect of the provision of youth work programmes or services in two or more education regions.  Section 8 also permits the Department to secure the provision of supplementary regional youth work programmes and services by allocating direct grants to voluntary youth work organisations.  Accordingly, the direct funding of youth organisations by the Department will continue in respect of national and inter-regional youth work programmes and services.  However, youth work programmes and services particular to a specific education region will normally be <Col N="1472" /> secured by education boards, and not by my Department.</P>
    <P>My colleague across the Chamber used this debate to attack the principle of education boards.  As Deputies will be aware, the Minister for Education in her Second Stage speech on the Education Bill indicated that, where a reasonable case is put forward for amendment of the Bill which will not affect its central principles, she is prepared to consider that case objectively and, if necessary, bring forward proposals for amendment on Committee Stage.  I have noted the comments the Deputy has made regarding the Education Bill.  I have passed these comments to my colleague, the Minister for Education.  These views will be considered together with the views of other interested parties in this context.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that a long consultative process has been undertaken with all concerned in formulating the provisions of the Youth Work Bill.  The collective efforts of all of us who have been involved in this process finally bore fruit in the publication of this Bill on 5 March 1997.  As has been said by many people on many occasions, the enactment of legislation for the development of youth work has been an aspiration for a very long time and at last it is happening.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill will not only give a legislative basis to the provision, co-ordination, monitoring and evaluation of existing youth work services but will also give a statutory framework to the further development of these services.  Moreover, the Bill will, in accordance with European precedents of devolution, delegate responsibility for the planning and funding of local and regional youth work services to education boards and will enable the Department of Education to concentrate on national strategic issues, such as policy development and assessment of performance.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill will not substitute public sector activity for voluntary sector activity in the youth work sphere.  On one level, it ensures youth work services will normally be secured by education boards through grant-aiding voluntary youth work organisations, while, on another, voluntary youth councils composed of volunteer youth leaders will have influence on decision making.  In addition, the Bill provides for a national youth work advisory committee which will include substantial representation from one single national representative body for voluntary youth work organisations.</P>
    <P>Since publication of the Bill, officials of my Department and I have continued a process of dialogue with the National Youth Council of Ireland and other relevant bodies on the provisions of the Bill.  I have listened carefully to the views expressed and, as I indicated on 10 April, where a reasonable case is put forward for amendment of the Bill which does not dilute its central principles, I will give objective consideration to it and to proposing amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> In response to Deputy Smith, provision is made in several sections of the Bill for priority to be accorded to the youth work needs of disadvantaged young people.  Primary attention must be given to them. The Government has concentrated on the preventive element of the crime and drugs problem among young people.  The most effective elements of prevention are the youth services and sport and recreation organisations.  Investment in these bodies not only saves money for the Exchequer in the long term because of the reduced need for other services once the problem has been identified, but it will also eliminate a great deal of the suffering, anguish and heartbreak of families and individuals.  I have put across this core message to obtain more resources for youth services and sport and recreation organisations.</P>
    <P>The opportunities contained in the provisions of this legislation are significant.  I am confident the Youth Work Bill will greatly assist us in meeting future challenges facing everyone involved in youth work.</P>

      <P>My Department has made a submission to the Department of Finance for additional staff in accordance with procedures set down by Government. <Col N="1474" /> Discussions with officials of that Department are continuing.</P>
      <P>As I previously indicated to Deputy Martin in my reply to his question on 5 March 1997, the work of the examinations branch of my Department rises to a peak in the summer months.  The peak period is from the start of the certificate examinations in June to the issue of the junior certificate results in mid-September.  The approach taken to managing this pattern involves a combination of core permanent staffing, temporary employees and overtime working.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, industrial action has been undertaken by members of the Public Service Executive Union in my Department.  The action involves members of the union refusing to carry out work related to vacant posts and to co-operate with any new work or scheme which they deem to require additional resources.  However in mid-March, arising from discussions between the Department and the union and following representations to the union by the National Parents' Council, the union agreed to co-operate with the implementation of assessment and examination arrangements for the leaving certificate applied programme.  The assessment of task-work has proceeded satisfactorily and will be completed on Friday, 18 April.  Arrangements for the remaining examinations for the leaving certificate applied are progressing satisfactorily.  All other arrangements for the leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations are on schedule.</P>
      <P>The present position on the industrial relations front is that, following lengthy discussions, my Department has made an offer to the Public Service Executive Union in an effort fully to resolve the dispute.  A ballot of the members of the union is being held to consider the matter.  It is expected that the result of the ballot will be communicated to the Department early next week.  I hope a satisfactory outcome will be arrived at quickly.</P>

The Minister confirmed she had made a submission to the Department of Finance to seek additional staff.  I inquired how many she had sought and I find it extraordinary that she does not have the figures, because her officials should have anticipated this question.  Have any additional staff been appointed to the examinations branch since the introduction of the leaving certificate applied programme to deal with its operation and administration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute affected the leaving certificate applied programme because the union considered that its members' workloads were intolerable and that staff resources were inadequate.  Extra work is arising from various areas, such as improvements and tighter procedures in the running of the certificate examinations. The dispute arose because the union did not think there were enough staff to take on what they saw as additional work burdens.  The leaving certificate applied programme recommenced following submissions to the union by the National Parents' Council.  In view of the commitment of the Department and the staff to the programme, we were able to proceed with it in the meantime since mid-March.</P>
      <P>I do not have the details because there have been opening bids and posts were sought.  The talks went on from the middle of March until recently.  An offer of posts was made to the union and we will know its response next week.</P>

I take it that no additional staff have been appointed to that programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to Deputies on a number of occasions, the Government decision on the funding of initiatives in the White Paper, Charting Our Education Future, is as set out in my foreword to the White Paper.  This means that the amount of funding which can be made available in any given year will have to be decided by the Government in the context of its financial position and its other public expenditure priorities at that time.</P>
      <P>In making observations on the resource aspects of the White Paper, the Department of Finance did not produce detailed, comprehensive multiannual cost projections which would take account of all the variables on which future costs depend. To attempt to do so would have been a very difficult, if not impossible, task and would be of questionable value.  Government approval of the White Paper was contingent upon adherence to the Maastricht Treaty criteria in accordance with the Government's fiscal policy objectives.  The allocation for education would have to be settled each year.</P>
      <P>As regards the education boards, their establishment will not result in a completely new area of expenditure.  It will rather involve the reallocation of funding and administrative responsibilities within the education system.</P>
      <P>The Education Bill, 1997, specifically provides that the Minister must have the consent of the Government before bringing the education boards into operation.  The establishment of the boards will take place on a phased basis with a gradual transfer of functions to the boards within costed and approved plans prepared by each board and approved by the Minister.  This will facilitate careful appraisal of the incremental costs of the boards in the context of the Education Estimates for the year in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure the smooth transfer of functions to the education boards and to prepare for the new role of the Department, management consultants <Col N="1477" /> have been contracted by my Department to review the present organisational structure of the Department.  As part of their brief, they will also make recommendations regarding the future structure of the Department and the education boards.

      <P>I am concerned that the House is not receiving information to which it is entitled. My question was whether the Minister will publish the cost framework undertaken by the Department of Finance in relation to the costings in the White Paper.  The Minister now terms that cost framework &ldquo;observations&rdquo; by the Department of Finance.  In replies to previous parliamentary questions, it was referred to as the &ldquo;cost framework&rdquo;.  An exercise was undertaken by the Department of Finance which outlined the costs associated with many of the White Paper's proposals, including the establishment of regional education boards.  Will the Minister publish those observations or the cost framework?</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies to the formula agreed by the Department of Finance in relation to funding of proposals for the education boards which is the outcome of work done with the Department of Education.  The White Paper was a Government White Paper and I have quoted it on a number of occasions.  The framework and costings of the proposals are contingent on many variables: for example, the pay costs under negotiation, the numbers employed in the sector, the pay rates and the timescale of the proposals. The White Paper is the Government's commitment to education.</P>

      <P>The Minister is saying that she has no idea what the regional education boards will <Col N="1478" /> cost.  She said so before and she is now hiding behind the notion that the boards she proposes will be phased in so that each time one is created, that board will determine how much is to be spent.  That is not planning.  Were any costings or framework available to the Minister from the Department of Finance to give an idea of what the regional education boards would cost?  Why is it only now that the management consultants are seeing how those boards would operate?  That is a roundabout way of approaching the matter. The Select Committee on Social Affairs has received 16 submissions and 14 of the groups giving evidence said that the regional education boards would be a bureaucratic nightmare and a total waste of resources.  Does the Minister not agree that she should listen to these people in the front line in education?</P>

      <P>Deputies should listen to the 3,000 communities served by our primary and secondary schools.  Parents involved in these schools are enthusiastic to play their roles in making decisions on education rather than relying on the centralised bureaucratic model that has been criticised by national and international organisations which have looked at it.  I am committed to the regional development of education and to ensuring that people in their own communities will participate in decisions about their children's futures using their own tax payments.</P>
      <P>This Government has increased the education budget by 40 per cent.  Schools compete with schools and classrooms with classrooms for disastrously substandard school buildings which was the legacy of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to engage in a Second Stage debate as this is Question Time and we should receive answers to our questions.  I spent a considerable amount of time at the three teacher conferences, rather than just breeze in and out like the Minister, and listened to the teachers.  I discovered there was unanimity among them in opposing the establishment of the regional education boards.  Members of the Select Committee on Social Affairs listened to 16 submissions, the vast majority of which were against their establishment.</P>
      <P>Before replying to this question did the Minister and her officials check with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, to ascertain whether the Minister and Government are obliged to make the information available to Members and the general public on the cost framework?  The Minister admitted a year ago a review had been undertaken by the Department of Finance which was admitted by the Minister for Finance in the course of replying to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Michael McDowell.  That Minister admitted to Deputy McDowell that a cost framework was undertaken by his Department in respect of the costings of the White Paper on Education which he refused to publish at the time on the basis that it was inappropriate.  Following the passage of the Freedom of Information Bill, we are entitled to that basic information, which is not security sensitive. There is a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to prevent us accessing this information.  Has it been stamped by the passage of the Freedom of Information Bill?  Why is the Minister hiding those observations?  What is she afraid of?  Why will she not publish those figures? We want some transparency and the Minister is accountable to this House.</P>

      <P>After almost five years it appears the Minister has perfected the art of not answering questions.  It is undoubtedly the case that the Department of Finance has information the Minister must have received.  The Minister's responses amount to total denial or else one must assume she has no idea what these bureaucratic nightmares of regional education boards will cost.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say we spend some money on administration, some of which will be devolved, so that there will be no extra cost.  Everybody involved in education, every organisation that attended the Select Committee on Social Affairs deliberations &mdash; even those who are behind the Minister on the establishment of such boards &mdash; acknowledged that available resources at primary level were insufficient and would be wasted if expended on such bureaucratic bodies.</P>
      <P>Parents of second level pupils certainly are not behind the establishment of these regional education boards and the Minister is wrong in so implying because they are utterly against them. Parents of primary pupils mistakenly believe that unless they can participate in those regional education boards they will not have an opportunity to voice their opinions.  The Minister is feeding them this line, whereas the opposite is the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The high level group to advise on the technological sector has met on four occasions.</P>
      <P>I understand that the group has considered reports and documents relevant to its terms of reference.  It has also received written submissions from each of the regional technical colleges and has engaged in lengthy discussions with senior representatives of the individual colleges over a period of two days.</P>
      <P>I have asked the group to provide me with a report by the end of April.  I will give careful consideration to the group's recommendations, including any legislative implications they may have.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, under the provisions of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992 a regional technical college may be renamed by ministerial order.  However, amending legislation would be required to enable a regional technical college to confer its own awards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that my tabling of this question has accelerated activity on this front. Does the Minister consider that this group having met on four occasions adequately demonstrates the urgency of this matter?  Will she state whether it will be in a position to report by the end of this month, there being considerable speculation that the Dáil may be dissolved by then and whether <Col N="1483" /> recommendations will be in place prior to the calling of a general election?</P>

      <P>I do not intend to engage in speculation; I prefer to be factual about this matter.</P>
      <P>The high level group met on four occasions and studied submissions from each of the regional technical colleges.  In the course of two full day meetings, the group met senior representatives of all of the colleges.  I have not interfered in any way with its work.  I promised to respond by establishing a high level group, stipulating that I wanted speedy but rigorous recommendations with systems put in place.  I am satisfied the high level group has met people, spoken to all the colleges and studied submissions and documentation.  If necessary I can list the colleges from Letterkenny to Dún Laoghaire.  Approximately an hour to an hour and a half was spent with each college during which it heard a presentation of oral submissions made prior to their coming to the committee. I have not sought a response from the delegations.  Given that the committee is independent it is expected to proceed in accordance with its terms of reference.  I have asked for a report by the end of April and have no reason to expect otherwise.  Far be it from me to be the person to speculate on any timetable.</P>

      <P>Will the high level group be in a position to report by the end of April?  Has the Minister received an indication it will have its work completed by then?  That is the point I was trying to glean from her.  When the Minister was in Cork recently with the Tánaiste I think commitments were given to a delegation from Cork Regional Technical College that it would be upgraded to an institute of technology.  Will the Minister confirm where that promise stands?  The Minister said legislation would be required to give degree awarding powers to any college.  In her press statement, in relation to Waterford Regional Technical College, some months ago the Minister said she was conferring upon Waterford regional technical college the right to award its own degrees.  Given that legislation will be required to do that, when is it expected to come before the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked three questions.  First, on the question of whether I was satisfied I would receive the report by the end of April, I have had no indication otherwise. Second, the Deputy said I had promised that Cork Regional Technical College would become an institute.  I was satisfied with the meeting we had with representatives of the regional technical college in Cork and that whatever evaluation system might be put in place or whatever criteria might be applied Cork Regional Technical College would be able to respond to a rigorous analysis of its activities.  I did not commit myself &mdash; it <Col N="1484" /> would not be my style &mdash; and it is important I am not on the record as confirming any promises given to the automatic upgrading of any college. I have a responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter will be confirmed because the college is very involved in the process and, therefore, we are not responding to a glib promise.  It is committed to a system being put in place which would allow for a rigorous evaluation of the activities of the college and the other colleges in the regional technical college sector and that there will be no delays.  I am satisfied there are no delays.  The level of work and commitment by this college and others indicates there is no delay on its side.  Third, on the question of whether there will be legislation, we have had the recommendation from the special committee about the position of Waterford.  The order to change name is one that can be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On the degree awarding status of a college, that is provided for in Dublin Institute of Technology legislation but not for regional technical colleges.  I said I will give careful consideration to the group's recommendations, including any legislative implications they may have.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the chapter in the White Paper where the future of the third level sector is clearly spelt out.  It is an exciting sector and meets many needs from certificate to diploma to degree, some within the regional technical college sector which have degrees awarded for them.  Given the investment in the college in Letterkenny one can be satisfied the Department of Education and the Government are committed to the continuing development of the sector which, after ten years of growth, is not being stymied or constrained and any facility that is available to colleges is being addressed through the regional technical college sector.  In the case of Waterford, its activities had been examined by an expert group.  On the recommendation of that group &mdash; it did not happen <Col N="1485" /> quickly &mdash; because of the absence of degree awarding powers in the south east, I accepted its recommendation that the name be changed, following which I was put under extraordinary pressure.  I did not believe, because I have seen it happen in other countries which are quite near, that what is perceived to be upgrading should happen without a rigorous appraisal and a process being put in place.  My commitment is measured in the funding provided.  All the colleges, including Letterkenny and the newest in Dún Laoghaire, met the high level group and I have committed myself to its recommendations, including legislation.  This sector has not been constrained in any way by this or the previous Government.</P>

      <P>I have a record of doing it. When an expert group is given terms of reference and asked to make recommendations &mdash; I thank Professor Donnelly for accepting the chair of the group &mdash; for consideration by the Minister, the Department and the Government, I am committed to giving consideration to its recommendations which are awaited.  That is what the group would expect.  I guarantee to give the group the consideration I as Minister owe it for serving education and the development of education in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister, in the context of the background to all this, that the only reason the expert group was established and for the rigorous assessment is simply that the Minister issued a press release in relation to Waterford and took a decision in relation to Waterford in isolation from everybody else.  Following the political outcry a damage limitation exercise had to be engaged in &mdash; hence the establishment of the expert group to bail the Minister out politically. I have no difficulty with the decision in relation to Waterford.  The Minister made a commitment in relation to Waterford that it would have degree awarding powers, as contained in the press statement issued at the time.  She indicated today that this would require legislation.  When will it be introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the overall strategic capital development programme for the third level sector, proposals for upgrading all teaching facilities, including art and design, are being formulated in consultation with college authorities for implementation on a rolling basis and within the framework of available funding <Col N="1487" /> resources.  This programme is designed to ensure that students are provided with appropriate and safe working environments.</P>
      <P>With regard to the upgrading works relating to the specific institutions referred to by the Deputy, I am pleased to avail of the opportunity to advise that considerable progress has been made in this area.  Construction work has recently commenced at a cost of £6 million on the replacement of facilities for the students of the National College of Art and Design at present accommodated at Leinster Lane.  This major new development will facilitate the resiting of all the activities of the college onto one campus at Thomas Street.</P>
      <P>Cluain Mhuire, a property adjacent to the Galway regional technical college, was acquired by the college authorities with the approval of my Department in September 1995.  Planning of upgrading works for the newly acquired property is at an advanced stage and tenders are due to be sought shortly by the college authorities.</P>
      <P>Substantial properties were also acquired in 1994 by Waterford and Limerick regional technical colleges.  In the case of Limerick, phases I and II of the upgrading works have been already completed. The objective is to house all art and design students on the same campus.  Upgrading work has commenced on the Waterford property and further upgrading works are at planning stage. Extensive upgrading works have also been carried out to the Crawford art and design campus of Cork regional technical college and were completed in early 1996.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to Dublin Institute of Technology is that officials of my Department are engaged in ongoing consultations with the institute authorities regarding an overall campus development plan, including a broad range of issues relating to the provision of appropriate replacement facilities for students currently accommodated in rented facilities at Mountjoy Square and Portland Row.  While I recognise that further upgrading, improvement and replacement works are required I am nevertheless satisfied that, despite the many major problems that I inherited in this area when I became Minister, significant progress has been made at this stage towards providing the colleges with a safe working environment for all the students.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.  Is she aware that difficult situations exist in some of the colleges?  Toilet facilities, access to light, studio space, etc., are paramount for the development of art and design in the universities.  Will she provide additional funding for the colleges mentioned to deal specifically with the heating, lighting and toilet facilities and the lack of proper and adequate space for the students?  While recognising that funding has been made available, has she a further programme to address the provision of many of these basic facilities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>In planning the development of this sector there was a need for a very large investment.  I thank the Deputy for recognising that an investment has been made in these colleges and in other parts of the university sector. Much has been done and more remains to be done.  I referred to the consultation with college authorities regarding the implementation of improvements on a rolling basis and within the framework of available funding resources.  It is important that the areas most in need are dealt with first.</P>
      <P>With regard to the levels of investment, £6 million is to be allocated to the National College of Art and Design, £500,000 to the college in Cork and £0.8 million to Limerick with regard to the acquisition of the convent.  Some £6 million of ERD funding remains for the Portland Row and Aungier Street projects, while £1.55 million will be allocated to the refurbishment of the college at Galway.</P>
      <P>Students are doing well at these colleges.  They are making a major impact on the education system and afterwards in the employment areas. However, many of them are housed in unsatisfactory conditions, for example at Leinster Lane, which has come to the attention of this House in the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>Given the rolling programme and the elimination of substandard places, investment has been extraordinary.  Nevertheless, students continue to be housed in unsatisfactory conditions.  The budget for each year and the investment by the EU has allowed us to look forward and talk to the authorities to eliminate the conditions that concern the Deputy and me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could Exchequer funding be provided, given that EU funding has been provided for the upgrading of these facilities?  Is the Minister aware that, for example, the college in Waterford where young people spray with inflammable materials has an asbestos roof sealed with lead paint?  There are also rats and other rodents in the college.  There is no heating and very little light in Crawford College, Cork.  They are serious problems.  Another example is the Portland Row college where the toilet facilities are most unhygenic.  Every college should have these basic facilities.  Will the Minister provide additional funding from the Exchequer specifically to deal with such facilities in colleges to guarantee the health and safety of students?  The Minister has a shopping list but I ask her to ensure that additional funding is provided from the Exchequer to address the serious problems relating to basic facilities for young people.</P>

      <P>I acknowledged the European Union's investment in third level education but I remind Deputies that investment also involves Exchequer funding.  The budget provided by the Department of Finance to my Department matches European funding and <Col N="1489" /> occasionally works on its own in terms of the development of this sector.</P>
      <P>The heavy investment in this sector reflects the conditions under which third level students were expected to operate.  I am concerned about matters, such as those mentioned by the Deputy, which suggest the health of students is badly affected.  Health and safety legislation is in operation, irrespective of the level of investment by the Department.  There is investment by the Department in this area on an ongoing basis. However, I want to be satisfied that increased investment meets the basic needs of students. Although I succeeded in securing an extraordinary increase in the education budget, the Deputies should join me in saying that I need more money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan painted a true picture.  Her comments were based on a report by USI's education officer.  For example, he visited the Portland Row college on 17 January and there was a poster on display which read: &ldquo;Loose plaster removed for safety reasons, ceiling under repair &mdash; management&rdquo;.  Somebody had crossed out the word &ldquo;removed&rdquo; and scribbled in &ldquo;fell down&rdquo;.  That illustrates the conditions in some art colleges.  First year students in Cork do not have a table in their studio and there is no heating or natural light.  The beams in the library are warped and unsafe.  This area is the poor relation in the third level sector.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept, in the context of the allocation of the £2.2 billion education budget, that considerable extra resources should be made available to these colleges?  Will she confirm that her Department is actively planning for the future in view of the fact that the same level of Structural Funds may not be available after 1999?</P>

The Deputies challenged me in the past about the percentage of European funding devoted to the regional technical college sector.  Extra funding must be used to eliminate the position I inherited.  I acknowledge the contribution of the European Union but Exchequer funding has allowed me to systematically upgrade facilities.  I was in Limerick regional technical college last Friday to open another phase of investment.  Given the standard of that development and what is expected of it, the funding from the EU and the Exchequer was well used.  Regarding the Deputy's question about the future, I am busy dealing with the present.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 9, 12, 22, 23, 31, 40, 42, 48, 49 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in primary and second level schools were issued by my Department to schools in 1993.  The policy as outlined in the guidelines was prepared following consideration of this complex and difficult problem by an expert working group and following consultation with the partners in education.  The purpose of the guidelines is to assist schools in devising school-based measures to prevent and deal with bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of it in the school community as a whole.</P>
      <P>I am reviewing the current guidelines on countering bullying behaviour.  This review is a collaborative exercise involving the Department and the partners in education.  I have sought the views of the partners and I understand that they are involved in internal consultations before finalising their input to this review.</P>
      <P>I expect that the considered views of all of the partners will be available shortly.  It is my intention that the review will be finalised during the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a similar question some months ago and I was told the review was under way.  Is the term &ldquo;bullying&rdquo; which developed over the years being considered?  There are victims on both sides because children engaged in bullying obviously have difficulties or behavioural problems which require assistance.  This area must be reconsidered because there is a danger that children will be isolated at an early age by the stereotypical approach of classifying children.  This could have a detrimental effect on such children's chances in the future.</P>
      <P>Will additional resources be made available to schools in the form of extra psychologists?  The waiting list for assessments is very long and children who engage in unacceptable behaviour must wait months before they are assessed in an effort to try to understand their problems.  The review will be useless unless there is a determined attempt to give schools the necessary resources to enable a multi-disciplinary approach, involving psychologists, home-school-liaison services and remedial teachers, to be adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that using a term other than &ldquo;bullying&rdquo; would contribute to the debate.  The days of dismissing complaints about bullying by telling children to stand up for themselves in the school yard are gone.  Such incidents were discussed on radio programmes until relatively recently but as Mr. John Mulcahy, the president of the ASTI, said, the growth of awareness <Col N="1492" /> and the increased prevalence in schools of effective anti-bullying campaigns should be welcomed. Ireland is to the fore in producing written guidelines.  The expert group led the way.  We were privileged to have Dr. Mona O'Moore of Trinity College, an international expert on bullying, participate in the expert group.  The findings of her research were taken into consideration in drawing up the guidelines.</P>
      <P>The position is changing.  There is a realisation that it is not acceptable to bully other children. Research shows that children who bully have difficulties and problems; it is not natural for humans to engage in such behaviour.  While we should be concerned if our child is bullied, we should equally be concerned about the child who bullies and should examine the causes.  I have asked the partners in education to make submissions to me.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives have been taken which are of help in tackling the problem.  Teacher-counsellors have been appointed under a pilot scheme to deal with unruly children who bully and form gangs.  The scheme is being monitored and evaluated by the Education Research Centre. The psychological service is also being developed. Parents can be confident that, when established, the regional education boards will have a statutory obligation to provide these services.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to the home-school-community liaison service.  At the Easter conferences there was discussion of the bullying of adults as well as children.  Satisfactory progress is being made.  Dr. Maeve Martin has completed the research I commissioned on good practice in school discipline.  It has been favourably received.  The partners in education have taken on the function of drawing up codes of practice.  I made Dr. Martin's report available at the Easter conferences.  It is now widely available throughout the system.</P>
      <P>We are awaiting the submission of the ASTI. It has asked for an extension which has been granted.  We will then be in a position to consider proposals.  The term &ldquo;bullying&rdquo;, to which the Deputy referred, may be the subject of one of the recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Trinity research shows that the level of bullying in our schools and generally is much higher than we assumed.  This is disturbing and it has made those involved in the education system re-examine their attitude to the problem. Does the Minister believe that the level of psychological support in our schools for those who have suffered as well as for bullies, who are undoubtedly disturbed in some way, is adequate? This is critical in dealing with the problem.  If many of these children have to wait until the regional education boards are established, they will be well past school leaving age.  There is a requirement to provide immediately a psychological <Col N="1493" /> service which is responsive to the needs of our children.</P>

      <P>The research to which the Deputy referred shows that 34 per cent of the third class students surveyed never told anyone they had been bullied.  This sets down a marker and presents a challenge to those involved in the primary school system.  At second level there was a figure as high as 82 per cent.  While I agree with the Deputy on the important role played by the psychological service, my priority is to ensure it does not go unnoticed that a child is being bullied. There is a need to make parents aware that bullying is not an acceptable form of behaviour in the classroom.  To this end an increasing number of schools are being declared bully free zones.</P>
      <P>The number of career guidance teachers has been increased substantially.  Counselling is an important part of their training.  Students tend to avail of their services in the run-up to examinations. The stay safe programme is being implemented also.  Therefore, the environment is changing as a result of curricular change, the provision of support services and the development of the psychological service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has again presumed that the regional education boards will be a new layer of bureaucracy.  It will be their function to deliver education services, in which the Government will continue to invest, on a regional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratio of psychologists to pupils at primary level is 1:35,000 and 1:18,000 at post-primary level.  The level of resources is inadequate to allow the education system help children with behavioural problems who require intervention at an early age.  Some of the children end up on the streets, while others are expelled or suspended as schools have to have regard to the overall quality of education for all pupils.  The issue of discipline and how we cope with behavioural problems has been ignored during the past four years.  The psychological service, in particular, has been neglected.</P>

      <P>Does the figure of 392,000 relate to appeals?  My question asked the number of students who had their marks revised as a result of clerical checks prior to the issue of results and the number who had their marks revised following appeals.  How many students appealed and how many had their marks revised as a result of that process?</P>

      <P>According to the appeal statistics for 1996, 391,999 grades were awarded, 10,436 grades were appealed and 961 or 0.25 per cent of grades were upgraded.  The number of appeals was low, while the number of grades revised as a result of appeals was even lower.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the necessity to appeal can cause much upset to students.  Price Waterhouse has scrutinised the entire system and I am satisfied that the people can have confidence in it.  We cannot legislate for human error but we have a responsibility to ensure that there are adequate checking procedures so that appeals can be responded to.

      <P>I would appreciate if the Minister sent me the figures on the specific number of candidates who had their marks revised at the different stages outlined in my question.  Is the Minister concerned that approximately 10,000 students appeal their results annually and will she agree that this suggests a lack of confidence in the process? Given the debacle in 1995, consideration <Col N="1497" /> should be given to the setting up of an independent appeals system which would be at one remove from the core examination process.  Is the Minister opposed to the introduction of an independent appeals system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Parents, students and schools can be confident that the system works.  The system was assessed by Price Waterhouse which recommended that we should inform those involved in examinations of how the system works.  Price Waterhouse believed that the system would stand the test of time but acknowledged that doubts about how it worked had led to more appeals than were necessary.  It recommended that we should convey information on how the system works not only to schools but also to students and their parents.  This independent assessment and the practical results of the appeals system leave me and Price Waterhouse in no doubt that we have an excellent system. However, we may have failed in the past to convey this to parents, some of whom have doubts about it.  I will take up Price Waterhouse recommendations to make more information available about a system to which it gave a stamp of approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment, namely, the monitoring and regulating of pre-school day care services in response to the disturbing report in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> which revealed shocking facts about a significant number of Dublin crèches where physical abuse, negligence, lack of hygiene, understaffing and overcrowding have become the norm.  I congratulate <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on its investigation.</P>
      <P>The article told of some appalling stories, including force feeding of infants; children left all day strapped into chairs around a table; bowls, cups, spoons and bottles being shared by a large number of small children; and crèches smelling strongly of vomit or urine as a result of soiled nappies left lying around.  It is an appalling catalogue of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to outline the monitoring or inspection procedures that have come into place since Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, which deals with the supervision of pre-school services, was implemented late last year.  I <Col N="1499" /> congratulate the Minister of State on bringing the Child Care Act fully into operation.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always been behind in the development of child care services, despite research evidence from this country and abroad which indicates that high quality pre-school education can play an important part in offsetting the effects of social disadvantage and in preventing school failure, a point made by the Minister for Education when introducing the Early Start pre-school service.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to praise the many excellent services that have provided high quality care for children over many years.  We have a responsibility, however, to support couples who try to combine work and family life.  There has been an increase in the number of families where both parents work outside the home and who are trying to grapple with the difficulties of caring for their children.</P>
    <P>As the number of women in the workforce rises, the challenge of finding adequate and affordable child care is growing.  The importance of helping people to reconcile employment and family life must be recognised.  Women cannot enjoy genuine equality of opportunity unless they have access to good quality day care services for their children.  This is a support to family life, not the contrary.  The pattern of family life has changed dramatically and we must support it by our policy actions.  A part of supporting the family is supporting quality child care.</P>
    <P>Irish and international research on child care indicates that the three most important hallmarks of quality care are accommodation and equipment, personnel qualifications and the adult: child ratio.  Unfortunately, <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> article shows that some Irish crèches and pre-school services fail on all three counts.  It tells of 13 babies in a room with one worker, many facilities with no natural light and crèches in the Dublin area using students on placement from courses as though they were fully qualified staff.</P>
    <P>We clearly need a strong day care policy for children.  We currently have a system of notification but perhaps a system of registration should now be considered, given this evidence.  I would like the Minister to outline the system of monitoring currently in place for pre-school facilities by the health boards, the people involved in the monitoring.  How highly qualified are they?</P>
    <P>A policy to promote good standards of day care nationally must be developed as a matter of urgency, in other words, a guide to good practice in day care.  Co-ordination and a national policy on pre-school day care is essential to ensure we have quality day care for our children.  Day care is often a lifeline for parents and children and we must ensure it offers our children the very best that pre-school care can offer.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity presented by the Deputy to make a statement on <Col N="1500" /> the regulations governing the pre-school sector. A number of conflicting statements have been made in the media in the past few days in this regard.  I take this opportunity to set out the actual position.</P>
      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School) Regulations came into effect on 31 December 1996.  These regulations are the first of their kind in the State and give effect to section 50 of the Child Care Act, 1991, which obliges the Minister for Health to make regulations for the purpose of securing the health, safety and welfare of children, and promoting the development of pre-school children. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age. They will have an impact across the various sectors involved in pre-school provision, ranging from the voluntary provision for disadvantaged children through to full day care provision in the commercial sector.  The regulations were drawn up in consultation with a working group chaired by my Department.  The group also comprised representatives from the Department of Education, the Social Services Inspectorate in Northern Ireland, the health boards, individual experts, and representatives of the main pre-school providers.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations there is a requirement on a person carrying on a pre-school service to give notice to their health board to this effect.  This is a binding statutory requirement on pre-school providers. Penalties for non-compliance with the regulations are set out in section 57 of the Child Care Act, 1991.  These include fines not exceeding £1,000 and prohibition from carrying on a pre-school service.  Where a person contravenes this prohibition, the option of imprisonment is provided for.</P>
      <P>However, it is envisaged that the regulations will be introduced in a co-operative manner with pre-school providers.  Where a pre-school provider and/or the premises do not meet the requirements of the Child Care Act and associated regulations, details of the deficiencies will be outlined in writing and he or she will be given a specific period of time within which to make specific improvements, provided such a delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children.  A further inspection will be made after that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of specific issues highlighted in an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 13 April, including overcrowding, suitability of premises, sanitation and corporal punishment are covered by the regulations.  I would now like to refer to the specific allegations made in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> regarding conditions in crèches and childminding facilities in the Dublin area.  I share the concern that I am sure all Deputies feel regarding these allegations, and I have had officials of my Department raise the matter with the Eastern Health Board.  I understand that the board contacted <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> to ascertain the specific pre-school facilities referred to in the article with a view to those facilities being investigated forthwith. <Col N="1501" /> I am disappointed that, to date, <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> has not been prepared to give any identifying information to the health board and that, as a result, the board is unable to identify the services concerned and take whatever action may be required.  I find this refusal particularly surprising as, on its front page under a heading, &ldquo;Crèche Scandal&rdquo;, <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> stated &ldquo;The startling results of a special <i>Sunday Tribune</i> survey of a cross-section of Dublin's crèches reveal that in some cases the Garda should be sent in to investigate instances of physical abuse, negligence and shockingly dangerous conditions&rdquo;.  I hope <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> will change its mind.</P>
    <P>While pre-school facilities will be inspected by health boards under the regulations, parents should also take steps to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the pre-school arrangements they make for their child.  I am confident that these new regulations will help to further increase standards in the pre-school sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for permitting me to raise on the Adjournment the issue of the provision of a multi-denominational school in Lucan.  I realise that the Minister and her officials have had very limited notification of this matter. I understand there have been some preliminary discussions but that no written material has yet been submitted to the Department.  I raised the matter on the Adjournment because we appear to be in the terminal stages of this Dáil, and I was anxious that the Minister should be formally put on notice prior to a general election of the requirement for temporary accommodation for such a school beginning this year.</P>
      <P>There has been substantial development in the Lucan district.  Census data of recent years shows that in 1986 the population of the three district electoral divisions comprising the Lucan district was 12,988.  At the 1991 census that figure had increased to 14,431 persons, and in the census recorded last year the population had increased to 20,172 persons.  In addition I would estimate that in the past three years over 3,000 houses have been constructed in the Lucan district.  That is a very substantial amount of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year a group of residents met in response to a local demand to educate children of all beliefs and cultural backgrounds together and, in order to help their children to have that opportunity, to set in motion the planning for a multi-denominational school in the district.  It has been suggested that there may have been an element of social division in this, but from the enrolments that have taken place to date it is clear that persons throughout the Lucan district have expressed an interest in having their children attend this particular school.  The initial meeting was attended by a substantial number of persons.  The objective of the group is to satisfy the Department's requirement and apply for permission to open a primary school using the policies <Col N="1502" /> of Educate Together in September 1997 with facilities for temporary accommodation at the initial stage and progressing in time to a permanent site and building to provide the general Lucan area with a multi-denominational school. Pre-enrolment took place on 5 April this year when parents were invited to enrol their children in the infant classes from 1997 until 2001.  Twenty-three enrolled for 1997, 35 for 1998, 31 for 1999, 38 for 2000 and 32 for 2001.  I will not give the categorisation of the different children.  There is a demand in the district, and I am drawing that to the attention of the Minister.  It is an urgent matter because if the demand continues, there will be a need for temporary accommodation this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for raising this matter. It gives me an opportunity to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>There is no application in my Department for the establishment of a new multi-denominational school in Lucan.  However, my Department would be willing to consider a formal application for recognition for such a school.</P>
      <P>If the establishment of a multi-denominational school in September 1997 is currently under consideration, it is imperative that the proposers of the school should forward an application to the planning section of the Department in Tullamore without delay.  The application should include details of proposed enrolment, accommodation and patronage of the school.  The proposers might wish to consult Educate Together, the umbrella body for multi-denominational schools, before finalising their application.</P>
      <P>The provision of temporary accommodation would be the responsibility of the proposers of the school.  However, if the school were granted provisional recognition, 50 per cent of any reasonable rental cost would be grant-aided by my Department.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would stress the necessity for any application for recognition as a new national school from September next to be submitted as soon as possible to enable the necessary investigations to be put in train by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject that I raise is a very serious one which is in need of urgent attention. I have tried to raise it on a number of occasions since before Easter.  I thank the Chair for accepting it for the second time within a week.</P>
      <P>Scoil Iosagáin, Buncrana, County Donegal is a very special school with a very special ethos.  Its aim is inclusion and the overcoming of marginalisation. It aims not just to achieve things on paper but to achieve them in practice, in line with the concept of cherishing all of our children equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already, alongside the mainstream school with an enrolment of 552 pupils, Scoil Iosagáin has a class for 12 Down's syndrome children with a <Col N="1503" /> moderate handicap.  Plans are at an advanced stage for another class to cater for children with a profound mental handicap which will be the first of its kind attached to a mainstream primary school in Ireland.  The school is providing two types of service at present and is moving on to cater for children with a profound mental handicap. That is another issue.  The issue I am interested in this evening is the class for children with a moderate handicap.</P>
    <P>These children vary in their physical, educational and emotional needs, but one thing recognised by anyone looking on is the need for classroom assistance.  This is acknowledged in that they currently have an assistant, but this assistant is to be taken away from these children and placed in the newly created class for the profoundly handicapped.  How can the Minister, as a former teacher, justify the removal of this classroom assistant?  How can a school that is dedicated to promoting inclusion and developing the children's varied abilities be abandoned in such a fashion?  Where does that fit into the Programme for Government, or even basic human rights? Education is a right, not a privilege.  These children are currently catered for by a teacher whom they highly respect and who is ably assisted by a person they know and trust.  The level of provision is not in question but rather the abandoning of the teacher, parents and students by removing their help.  The rejection of the concept of cherishing all our children equally is similarly in question.</P>
    <P>In June 1995 the Department informed the school that one child care post would be allocated to the school to help meet the needs of the pupils attending the special classes at the school.  That assistant had been in the school for only a month when the school received notice that she would be removed.</P>
    <P>I could talk for hours about how the parents feel about this matter.  Their feelings of anger, frustration and helplessness are totally understandable. They are aware of the resources needed for their children.  They appreciate greatly the advances made in the school to ensure their children are accommodated and cared for as individuals. The proposal to have a second separate class for the profoundly mentally handicapped proves that the school is moving in the right direction.  All those involved are at a loss to understand the reason behind the decision to remove the classroom assistant and not have her replaced.  They find it unacceptable that the saving in terms of finance should warrant such disruption to the children's lives.</P>
    <P>The school issued a letter to the Department outlining some practical issues.  A poignant example is that one child who suffered kidney failure needs to have an external bag changed regularly, a procedure which takes about seven minutes.  With the removal of the assistant, who will look after the rest of the class while the teacher is tending to that child?  Incontinence, <Col N="1504" /> hygiene and puberty are other issues that arise and it is difficult for one teacher to cope with them while caring for the remainder of the class. The children attending this school need special attention in the class and the playground.  There is often a need for them to be in two separate groups, whether for visits to clinics, psychologists, speech therapists or the swimming pool, or even for behavioural reasons, because time is needed for those who display inappropriate behaviour and for the educational development of children on individual learning programmes.</P>
    <P>The loss of this assistant will result in a lack of social skills development and the children will never be in a position to leave the classroom.  I ask the Minister to consider this case and understand the merit of the work involved.  It is important that the school retain its assistant.  We have heard many statements about education and people with disabilities, and this is an opportunity to act on those statements.  To remove the assistant from this school is inhuman, senseless and incredible in these days of economic boom.  I appeal to the Minister to retain the classroom assistant at this school, not only for the moderately handicapped but also for the profoundly handicapped class.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the case made by the authorities at Scoil Iosagáin to retain the current child care assistant post to cater for the needs of the special class for moderately mentally handicapped pupils.  The Deputy will be aware that the school is in the process of establishing a special class to cater for children with a severe or profound mental handicap.  It was in anticipation of the establishment of this special class that my Department allocated a child care assistant post to Scoil Iosagáin in 1995.  The school authorities have been aware since then that the child care post was intended to be used specifically for this special class, when it had been established.  In the interim, the child care assistant was to be employed to support the tremendous work undertaken in the special class for moderately mentally handicapped pupils at the school. I understand the school authorities will be disappointed that the special class for moderately mentally handicapped pupils will no longer have the services of this child care assistant when the new class is established.  I must, however, repeat that the school authorities knew this would happen.</P>
      <P>I understand that plans for the establishment of the special class for severely-profoundly mentally handicapped pupils are at an advanced stage. Some necessary building work associated with this development is expected to be completed shortly.  The necessary furniture for the class has been ordered and the process of selecting pupils for enrolment in the class has already begun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I took office, I allocated a total of 175 child care assistant posts to special schools and special classes.  This brings the total number of child care assistants now in place in the special education area to 252 and provides concrete evidence <Col N="1505" /> of my Department's commitment to the needs of the children in question.  It is my intention to maintain this commitment in future.  At present I am not in a position to allocate additional child care assistant posts to special schools or mainstream primary schools with special classes.  However, I am fully aware of the great work being achieved by the school authorities of Scoil Iosagáin in catering for children with special needs and that the special class for moderately mentally handicapped pupils in Scoil Iosagáin, Buncrana, will be considered when my Department has additional child care assistant posts to allocate.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important matter. Despite raising it in the Dáil on a number of occasions, the teachers, parents and pupils of Knockanean national school are still awaiting a positive response from the Minister.  The conditions at the school are appalling and need immediate attention.  Three new classrooms are needed immediately to replace existing prefabs. The school, which has 140 pupils, is currently a five teacher school, with three solid classrooms and two prefabs.</P>
      <P>Knockanean national school has been in constant contact with the Department since 1993 seeking the replacement of buildings.  It arranged for plans to be drawn up and employed a quantity surveyor to estimate the total cost.  The local community has continually supported the school and local funding was provided for the development of a playing pitch and basketball court.  Much has been done at local level, yet those efforts have not been matched by the Minister's commitment.  The local community has already saved the Government a considerable amount of money in raising funds in 1987 and 1991 to help towards building solid rooms to replace the prefabs.  Such an initiative should be recognised and rewarded by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Department inspectors visited the school in February and June 1996 and concluded that both prefabs need to be replaced with solid rooms.  The school does not have a general purposes room and a proposal by the school in this regard should be taken on board by the Department.</P>
      <P>An INTO survey in County Clare points out that Kilmurray national school and Iniscealtra national school in Mountshannon need immediate funding to upgrade existing buildings, yet no positive action has been taken on these schools. The parents and teachers have become frustrated by the lack of response from the Minister to Knockanean school and they propose to hold a public meeting in Clare tomorrow night, 18 April, to decide the action to be taken.  I ask the Minister to provide proper facilities at Knockanean school, a request I have made at every opportunity in the Dáil.  The Minister visited Clare recently and I hope she will have positive news for Knockanean national school.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Deputy has given me an opportunity to outline to the House the Department's position regarding Knockanean national school, County Clare.  I met representatives from the school during my visit to Clare last week.</P>
      <P>The school has a staffing level of principal and four assistant teachers with an enrolment of 147 pupils.  The accommodation at the school consists of three permanent classrooms and two prefabs which are in a poor condition and need to be replaced urgently.  The Department's planning section advises that the long-term accommodation requirements at the school are five permanent classrooms.  This will involve the provision of an extension to the existing school Funding for this proposal must be considered in the light of existing contractual commitments and other priority projects.  The amount of investment the Department of Education has had to make in County Clare suggests many years of neglect on the school building programme.</P>

      <P>I am astonished at the amount of investment that has had to be made in the Deputy's constituency.  While I am committed to resolving the accommodation problems at Knockanean, I am not in a position to allocate funds to this project.  However, I recognise the difficulties being experienced by the school.  The project will be progressed through the various stages of architectural planning.  When it is ready for tender a decision will be made regarding the timing of the tender-contract process in light of available capital funds.  My Department will be in contact with the school to advise on how the project can be progressed.</P>
      <P>To put the current financial position in context, when I became Minister for Education there was a backlog of 300 urgent major school projects. These projects accumulated as a result of substantial cuts in capital funding for primary schools from 1988 to 1992.</P>

      <P>The current quota of 800 for admissions to the Higher Diploma in Education was set on the basis of a recommendation by the Higher Education Authority. The HEA's advice was based on recommendations of a working group composed of representatives of the universities, the Department of Education and the authority.  The working group took account of the best available data on the demand for second level teachers.</P>
      <P>The working group, under the chairmanship of the Higher Education Authority, has been reconvened, supported by an analyst and statistician, to undertake an in-depth review of future needs for second level teachers.  This review is focusing both on total needs and on needs by subject grouping, where feasible.  The working group is examining all relevant factors such as pupil numbers, pupil-teacher ratios, teacher retirements and career breaks as well as the effect of teacher mobility within the European Union.  The work of the group is at an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>The main objective of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who would otherwise experience difficulty attending school on a regular basis.  My Department strives to provide the best level of service to as many pupils as possible, within the constraints of the resources available.</P>
      <P>The primary school transport scheme is operated on a national basis by Bus Éireann as agent of my Department.  The service in County Donegal is administered under the same guidelines as elsewhere throughout the country, and I am satisfied that the standard of service in County Donegal is on a par with the service provided in other counties.</P>

      <P>The Government White Paper, Charting Our Education Future, has a major objective that there should be no students with serious literacy and numeracy problems in early primary education within the next five years.  Work has begun on the attainment of this objective through a series of measures.  These include a greater emphasis on the early identification of children with learning difficulties, adapting the curriculum to individual needs, home-school links programmes and in-career training programmes for teachers.</P>
      <P>At second level, the objective is that all students on completion of the junior cycle, in accordance with their abilities and aptitudes, will have achieved competence in literacy, numeracy and spoken language skills which will allow them to participate as young adults in society.  A new junior certificate elementary programme has been introduced in 1996 to cater for a small minority of students whose learning needs have not been adequately catered for by the present junior certificate programme.  In addition, there will be increased provision for the education of travellers at second level so that within ten years all traveller children of second level school-going age will complete the junior cycle and 50 per cent will complete the senior cycle.</P>
      <P>In the area of adult literacy, the White Paper states that the policy priority will be to ensure that suitable and effective programmes are in place for all who wish to overcome adult literacy and numeracy problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding for the adult literacy and community education scheme has increased significantly in <Col N="1511" /> recent years.  I intend to continue to increase this provision as resources permit.</P>
    <P>I have commissioned a consultancy survey to establish the extent of the problem of adult illiteracy in this country.  The results of the survey will be available soon.  They will inform future policy on the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The report to which Deputy Sargent refers deals with the feasibility of introducing a range of physical security measures at the Oberstown campus.  It also addresses a number of issues relating to drainage and sewage treatment services on the campus and the capacity of the campus to accommodate additional development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report, which is highly technical, is currently being examined by experts from my Department's building unit.  I expect that this examination will be completed shortly, following which it will be necessary to explore possible <Col N="1512" /> options with the management of the centres involved.  This is to ensure that any steps taken are not only technically feasible but are also practical, having regard to the day-to-day activities of the centres.</P>
    <P>Pending the outcome of this process, I am not in a position to comment on the precise measures which may be adopted or the time-frame for their introduction.</P>
    <P>All young offender centres are designed and staffed to deliver the necessary level of security commensurate with the category of children being catered for.  The most serious male offenders are accommodated at Trinity House School which has very stringent security arrangements.</P>
    <P>However, the reality is that absolute security can never be fully guaranteed.  In recent times, particular concern has arisen in relation to a number of absconds by offenders while on mobility trips from the Oberstown centres.  The board of management of the centres is currently reviewing procedures in this area.</P>
    <P>As an interim measure, in recognition of serious public concern at recent abscond incidents, it has been decided to suspend all short-term leave and mobility trips from the Oberstown centres.  This suspension will remain in force pending a meeting of the board of management of the centres on 7 May 1997 at which the position regarding future leave arrangements and the terms governing such leave will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>Together with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy R. Bruton, I recently announced the Government's action plan of skills to ensure an ongoing supply of suitably qualified young people.  The critical skills currently identified are for graduates in computer science, technicians and students with a proficiency in foreign languages.</P>
      <P>In the computer science area the following measures have been taken: I have allocated 1,800 places to the computer science area under the joint public-private sector £60 million capital initiative.  This represents almost 30 per cent of the total of 6,200 places under the initiative.  The other places under the initiative are for agreed areas of priority manpower needs, for example, in science, engineering, mathematics and business studies.  I have also increased the number of places on one year post-graduate programmes in computer applications open to those with suitable primary degrees.  The output in 1997 from this one year programme, including those under the advanced technical skills programme, will be over 800.  It is planned to increase this output to 1,250 in 1998.  Numbers can be increased further in subsequent years to the extent necessary.</P>
      <P>In the present academic year I have also approved a range of new courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology-RTC sector in computing and associated disciplines, software engineering and multi-media applications development.  The Government has also recently approved the establishment of a steering committee, chaired by the chairman of the Higher Education Authority, to begin a bidding and negotiation process with educational and training institutions.  The aim of the committee is to identify the most cost effective way of providing 1,000 additional software graduates and 750 technicians per annum.</P>
      <P>The steering committee has placed advertisements seeking an indication of interest from eligible institutions and has also had a specification prepared in relation to the types of graduates required.  It will shortly issue this specification to eligible institutions with a request for proposals.</P>
      <P>My Department, together with the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment, is examining opportunities for increased utilisation of the existing training and education infrastructure to generate additional software places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to foreign language training, the action plan includes: the provision of 750 extra places on post-leaving certificate courses; the provision <Col N="1514" /> of 250 extra places in regional technical college courses with language content; and the placement abroad of 1,000 students each year.</P>
    <P>My Department has introduced training courses at post-leaving certificate level which are designed to develop multi-lingual telemarketing skills.  This programme will be expanded substantially in 1997-8, with appropriate investment in equipment and the additional costs of providing a lengthy placement abroad for participants as part of the programme.  A working group has been established to co-ordinate the initiative, and consultancy studies have been commissioned by Forfas, the IDA and my Department to inform the developments in this area.  A major campaign to promote awareness of the training and employment opportunities in this area is being finalised.</P>
    <P>Regional fora, comprising FÁS, third level colleges and industry, are being established to design innovative ways of meeting the needs of local industry, particularly for technicians in the electronics industry.</P>
    <P>Provision has been included in this year's Finance Bill, which is currently before the House, to allow tax relief on gifts of money made to certain third level institutions which are used for the purposes of approved projects, including the provision of facilities designed to increase student numbers in areas of skills needs.</P>
    <P>These particular initiatives are in addition to the ongoing work undertaken by the institutions, the Higher Education Authority and my Department to ensure that our education system equips society with the particular skills and qualities necessary for economic growth and prosperity.</P>

      <P>The funding being provided by my Department for this project is not the usual method of providing grant aid to secondary schools but is the result of an agreement reached with the school some time ago.  The background to the project is that my Department was prepared to provide temporary accommodation at the school under the usual terms but the school authorities wished to have the accommodation provided in a permanent structure.</P>
      <P>Following discussions between officials from my Department and the school authorities agreement was reached that my Department would provide a once off grant which the school authorities could use to provide a permanent structure. The agreement was conditional on the school authority funding the difference in the cost.</P>
      <P>In November, 1996, the Department received written confirmation from the school authorities that the balance of the cost of the project would be met in full by them.</P>

      <P>The school attendance/truancy report was published in April 1994.</P>
      <P>In 1995 I established a truancy task force with the following terms of reference: to examine the submissions received from interested parties in response to the truancy report, and to consider and make recommendations as to future action required to address the problem of truancy at first and second level.</P>
      <P>Following on the recommendations of the truancy task force, work on the preparation of the heads of new school attendance legislation is now well advanced.</P>
      <P>There are already a range of strategies in place aimed at the prevention of early school leaving. These include the Early Start pre-school programme, the allocation of additional resources to schools designated as disadvantaged, the home-school-community liaison scheme, the remedial teacher service, the pilot teacher-counsellor scheme and the Breaking the Cycle initiative.</P>

      <P>The circumstances in which an individual pupil may repeat a year at second level were advised to schools in May 1995 in the form of Circular M2/95 &mdash; Repeat of a Year at Post-Primary Level.  This circular clarified and consolidated the arrangements outlined previously in the light of the extension and restructuring of the senior cycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following are the grounds on which consideration of requests or proposals for individual students repeating a year at second level will be based: prolonged absence from school for a valid reason such as ill-health; serious illness which has a seriously damaging effect on the pupil's academic performance; serious family trauma which has had a seriously damaging effect on the pupil's academic performance; very poor academic record which requires regular remedial treatment; and change of school in certain circumstances. Pupils who have sat the leaving certificate leaving examination may be enrolled as recognised pupils to repeat leaving certificate year 2 and the appropriate leaving certificate examination on payment of the appropriate course and examination fees.  However, these <Col N="1519" /> charges may not apply or may be reduced where the parents hold a current medical card.</P>
    <P>At primary level, my Department's policy regarding repeat classes is set out in Circulars 10/67 and 15/89.  These circulars state, <i>inter alia,</i> that the primary school curriculum is designed as an eight year course.  Accordingly, the normal procedure for the promotion of pupils in primary schools should be that a pupil is promoted to a higher standard at the end of each school year. As a result, pupils should have the opportunity to complete a minimum of three years' post-primary education before reaching the minimum school leaving age.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, recognised that there may be cases where the principal teacher of a primary school feels that a pupil would benefit educationally by being held back for a second year in a class.  With reference to educational principles, it is considered that such cases should be minimal and that no pupil should be held back for longer than one year throughout his-her period in national school.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wide range of special needs, including the remedial area.  I have to establish priorities and seek to allocate available resources to best effect.</P>

      <P>I regret that due to the many competing demands on limited resources I am not in a position to increase the capitation grant payable for 1997.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that since taking office I have made very significant improvements in the level of funding to schools.  The standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from a level of £28 in 1992 to its present level of £45 per pupil, an increase of more than 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>The enhanced capitation grant for primary schools which are designated as disadvantaged has been increased from £17 in 1992 to £30 in 1996.  This represents an increase of 76.5 per cent since 1992.

      <P>The level of capitation rate paid in respect of pupils attending voluntary secondary schools has increased from £150 in 1990 to £177 in 1996.  This represents an increase of 18 per cent since 1990.</P>

      <P>Public libraries are of great benefit to the community. They are useful for school-going children and for students for the purposes of accessing information and for conducting small scale research projects.  They are particularly useful for helping to cultivate and develop an interest in reading.  Public libraries also constitute an important resource for lifelong learning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the public library services is a matter for the Minister for the Environment. My Department co-operates with the Department of the Environment in providing a library <Col N="1521" /> service to all primary schools.  The scheme operates through the payment of a <i>per capita</i> grant to the chief librarian in respect of the total number of pupils enrolled in each local authority area. The local authority librarians select, purchase and deliver books to primary schools.  My Department made total payments of £946,666 to local authorities in the year ending 31 December 1996 under this scheme.  A similar level of funding from my Department is envisaged for the year 1997.  Local authorities supplement and, in some cases, exceed my Department's grant in operating this scheme.</P>
    <P>The local authorities do not provide library services to second level schools, as they do for primary schools.  However, my Department makes grants towards the running costs of second level schools, including costs of school libraries.  School authorities purchase books for their own school libraries out of these grants and also encourage their students to avail of the public library services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have introduced a number of measures to address the problem of children who are difficult or disruptive in the classroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995, I introduced the teacher-counsellor scheme on a pilot basis with the specific aim of addressing this problem.  Under this scheme, a total of 27 teacher-counsellors have been allocated to 31 selected primary schools in the north <Col N="1522" /> inner city and Clondalkin areas of Dublin.  The schools in question cater for some 7,829 pupils.</P>
    <P>The role of the teacher-counsellor is twofold: (1)  to co-ordinate a whole school approach to devising and implementing good practice and strategies which will help to prevent the occurrence of disruptive behaviour, and (2)  to teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit persistent behavioural difficulties in the classroom.</P>
    <P>In 1996, I introduced the Breaking the Cycle initiative under which very significant resources are being targeted at selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as suffering from serious levels of disadvantage.  A total of 33 urban and 123 rural schools have been included in this initiative.</P>
    <P>In the case of the urban schools, a key element of the support package is the allocation of extra teaching posts to allow junior classes in the selected schools to operate at a pupil-teacher ratio of 15:1.  I am satisfied that this substantial improvement in class sizes will be of particular assistance to the schools in question in dealing with the problems to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>The operation of the teacher-counsellor scheme and the Breaking the Cycle initiative will be subject to detailed evaluation.  The outcome of these evaluations will provide a basis for considering the future development of these initiatives.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have also introduced the Early Start pre-school programme and have presided over a significant expansion of the home-school-community liasion service at both primary and second level.  All of these initiatives have a positive impact on pupil behaviour by fostering a greater appreciation among pupils and their parents of the value of education to their overall development.</P>
    <P>I have also expanded the school psychological service with the appointment of an additional ten psychologists to the service in 1995.</P>
    <P>Where cases of more serious disruptive behaviour are involved, the needs of the child may be such as to warrant placement in one of a range of special schools or special classes dedicated to children with emotional disturbance.  At second level, my Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.  Programmes such as youth encounter projects and Youthreach are designed to cater for pupils whose needs can best be dealt with outside of the mainstream school system.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the range of measures which I have outlined provide concrete evidence of my commitment to addressing the problem to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>The Vocational Education (Accounts, Audit and Procedure) Regulations, 1931 issued pursuant to the Vocational Education Act, 1930 set out the requirements in relation to the financial management and reporting by vocational education committees. The regulations require that all payments made excluding petty cash amounts are authorised in advance by the committee.  A vocational education committee may authorise one or more of its officers to make petty cash payments not exceeding £5 in any one case for purposes specified by the committee.</P>
      <P>In his report on the audit of the 1994 accounts of vocational education committees to Dáil Éireann pursuant to section 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, the Comptroller and Auditor General reported that a practice had developed in the sector whereby the petty cash account is used to make ongoing payments to suppliers and employees and is regularly reimbursed from the main account.  The effect of this practice is that individual payments made are not authorised by the committee as required under the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature and extent of vocational education committee finances have changed considerably since the regulations were enacted.  My Department recognises that the use of the petty cash accounts as an imprest account has arisen due to the volume of payments now being processed by vocational education committees and a need by committees to issue payments on a more timely <Col N="1524" /> basis.  A project is currently under way in my Department to update all aspects of financial management and reporting by vocational education committees in consultation with the sector and the Comptroller and Auditor General as appropriate.  Significant progress has been made in revising and updating the statutory reporting formats.  An important element of the project is updating and consolidating the regulations in a comprehensive way to reflect recent legislative changes and modern financial and business management practices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Finance Bill published on 26 March provides for an effective exemption from VAT for commercial child minding. This will be achieved in two ways.</P>
      <P>First, the Bill introduces exemption for persons whose activities are covered by regulations recently established in 1996 under the Child Care Act, 1991 &mdash; this will ensure exemption for pre-school services as defined by the Act i.e. &ldquo;pre-school, play group, day nursery, crèche, day-care or other similar service which caters for pre-school children&rdquo;.  It is envisaged that this provision will have effect from 1 May 1997 &mdash; the start of the next VAT period.</P>
      <P>Second, the Bill clarifies that the exemption for education services applies to &ldquo;children's and young persons' education&rdquo; generally to cover child care facilities which might not be regarded as child care within the meaning of the Child Care Act.  Again, this provision will be effective from 1 May 1997.</P>
      <P>This brings our treatment of child care into line with that in many other member states of the European Union and should still comply with EU VAT law as clarified for the Revenue Commissioners by the European Commission in the recent review exercise.</P>
      <P>The initiative has been welcomed by the National Children's Nurseries Association.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of allowing tax relief on expenditure relating to child care services, this raises complex issues and there are very different views on the likely impact of such a measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Commission for the Status of Women in its report to Government in January 1993 considered the matter but did not recommend that tax relief for child care expenses be given to working parents.  The commission considered that it was preferable that any additional <Col N="1525" /> State assistance for child care facilities should be provided through increased investment in child care support and services rather than by providing tax relief to parents for work-related child care costs &mdash; the NESC report, No. 1991 on women's participation in the Irish labour market reached the same broad conclusion.  The commission noted that tax relief would do nothing to increase the supply or quality of child care and would not improve the training or the supply of qualified child care workers.  Furthermore, it concluded that tax relief would be of little or no use to those with low or no income and that it would be of more benefit to the higher paid than low earners.</P>
    <P>In this context it is tentatively estimated that if, for example, a tax allowance at the standard rate was introduced for the parents of children under five years to cover the cost of registered child care up to a maximum of £3,000 per annum, then the cost to the Exchequer would be over £40 million.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce tax relief for child care expenses at this time.  The State already provides considerable assistance to parents, in particular through expenditure on child benefit, education and health services.  I will, of course, keep the matter under review.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to point out to the Deputy that an expert working group is to be established under Partnership 2000, involving the relevant interests and chaired by the Department of Equality and Law Reform, to devise a national framework for the development of the child care sector.</P>

      <P>My responsibility is confined to the Civil Service and I will set out the provisions applying to civil servants who are injured in the course of their duties as a result of unlawful acts committed by third parties.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances, the injuries are regarded as occupational injuries and the medical care costs incurred by the injured civil servant &mdash; doctors' fees, prescription medicines etc. &mdash; are refunded.</P>
      <P>In addition, the paid sick leave arising from the injury is not counted against total allowable paid sick leave.  This means that an injured civil servant can count on at least six months' sick leave on full pay followed by six months on half pay in such circumstances, regardless of whether he or she had exhausted their normal entitlement to paid sick leave.</P>
      <P>Civil Service Departments have the authority to make <i>ex gratia</i> payments, up to a limit of £1,000 in any case, to civil servants who are physically injured as a result of assaults on them by members of the public with whom they come in contact in their official duties.  If a payment in excess of that limit was considered warranted, the Department could approach the Department of Finance for authority to pay a larger amount.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for support for civil servants to assist them in seeking legal redress in respect of personal injuries caused to them by the unlawful acts of third parties.</P>

      <P>Negotiations on future financing of the EU, including future Structural Funding, will not commence until after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, which is expected to be in June 1997 at the European Council in Amsterdam.  These negotiations are likely to be protracted.</P>
      <P>As intimated in reply to previous questions, the Government is developing a strategy for the forthcoming negotiations for the renewal of the Structural Funds post-1999, which will ensure the optimum outcome for Ireland.</P>
      <P>In developing this strategy, the Government is assessing all aspects of Ireland's position in relation to eligibility for Structural Funds post-1999, including whether classification of Ireland as one region for Structural Funds purposes continues to be the best policy or whether other approaches, including regionalisation, would be more productive.</P>
      <P>The most recent year for which regional GDP data are available is 1991.  These figures were published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in November 1996 and show the Border region with a GDP <i>per capita</i> of 81.6 per cent of the State average.  The CSO is currently compiling regional accounts for 1993 which are due to be published in the near future.  When available, this data will provide more up-to-date information in relation to the status of the Border region which will assist in the process.</P>

      <P>The present urban renewal scheme was introduced on 1 August 1994 for a three year period and it applies to 35 towns and cities around the country.  Deputy McManus, Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, recently announced that the 31 July 1997 deadline for the current urban renewal scheme is to be extended by one year to 31 July 1998.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State appointed a consultancy team to assess the experience gained over the last ten years of urban renewal schemes.  The brief of the consultants was to look at the impact of the scheme in fiscal, social and architectural-urban design terms.  The report was published by the Minister of State on 5 December 1996.  She said that the publication of the study marked the beginning of a period of consultation in relation to future policy in which she invited all those interested in urban renewal to participate.  This consultation process culminated with a conference for all the interested parties last month. Both the study and the outcome of the consultative process will be key factors in the determination of future policy on which the Minister of State expects to put a submission to Government in the first half of 1997.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is the Government's intention that retired nurses and other public servants will benefit from the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement.</P>
      <P>The pay proposals developed to date involve an element of restructuring, as provided for under the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement. This applies to nurses and many other groups such as civil servants, clerical and administrative grades in the health boards and local authorities, teachers, gardaí, etc. who have concluded or are concluding agreements under the restructuring option of the PCW.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the agreements emerging do not provide for uniform increases across groups and in many cases even within grades. This complicates the position regarding adjustments to pensions and this question will now have to be considered in respect of all affected groups across the public service.</P>
      <P>Consideration is being given to the implications of the restructuring deals for existing pensioners and pensions increase policy across the public service. Discussions are ongoing between the Department of Finance and the Public Services Committee of ICTU about this matter.  When this general policy issue has been resolved my Department will be in a position to clarify the adjustments to be made to retired health service staff, including nurses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 98 of 12 March 1997 in relation to the criteria for assessing applications by local authorities for funding the provision of halting sites.  When a local authority has been given an approved budget cost for a scheme and the lowest tender received is within 10 per cent of the budget element of the approved cost, it is not necessary to seek my approval to accept the tender but details must be notified to my Department.  Any other cost over-runs are considered on their merits having regard to the criteria.  Maintenance costs are not included in the approved budget cost.  However, as announced in the national strategy for traveller accomodation, a scheme is being introduced this year to provide financial assistance to local authorities in respect of certain costs associated with the maintenance of traveller accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One proposal for a residential caravan park has been approved in the south Dublin area in the past 12 months at Lower Dodder Road where it is proposed to provide an eight bay site with caretaker facility, meeting-reception room and pre-school facility at an estimated cost of £520,000 or an average cost of £65,000 per bay.  This compares with the most recently approved rural scheme which is under construction by Meath County <Col N="1536" /> Council at Trim; this will provide 14 bays, a community building, including caretaker's office and pre-school facility, at an estimated cost of £851,500 or an average cost of £61,000 per bay.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency report Water Quality in Ireland 1991-1994 indicates that over 95 per cent of the channel length of the river referred to is unpolluted and the remainder affected by slight pollution.  The condition of the river represents a marked improvement on the position reported for the previous survey period (1987-90) when only 61 per cent of the river channel was unpolluted.</P>
      <P>I will shortly announce a comprehensive strategy intended to maintain and enhance the quality of freshwaters.  As part of this strategy, I intend to consider the making of additional designations under Directive 78/659/EEC (Freshwater Fish Directive) taking account of the views of local authorities, the Department of Marine and fisheries interests.  Subject to these views, it is my intention to include the river in question in the next series of designations.</P>

      <P>Direct employment in the construction industry has increased from 71,000 in April 1993 to 86,000 in April 1996 and is expected to reach 90,000 this month.  I understand that there are localised shortages of skilled labour in certain trades &mdash; notably blocklaying and bricklaying.  As an immediate measure, the Construction Industry Federation has advertised in newspapers in the United Kingdom, and with some success, encouraging migrant Irish building workers to return and take up employment here.  As regards the medium term, FÁS has developed a dynamic manpower forecasting model for the construction industry, indicating potential shortages, by the year 2000, of bricklayers, plumbers, gas fitters and other fitters, and electricians.  The success of the CIF initiative in encouraging the return of migrant Irish workers would mitigate the forecasted potential manpower shortages.  Training and education authorities can be expected to use the FÁS forecasts to take pro-active measures to bridge the gap between projected demand and supply of skilled building workers.</P>

      <P>The schemes of student support provided for the extension of means tested maintenance grants in the 1996-97 academic year to students following full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in an EU member state.  The course must be followed in a university or third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.  The following courses are excluded:</P>
      <P> (i)  Postgraduate courses</P>
      <P>(ii)  Courses in Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine (which are subject to a Higher Education Authority quota on places) and teacher training including those leading to the award of Bachelor of Education (also subject to a quota).</P>
      <P>(iii)  Courses in Colleges of Further Education.</P>
      <P>(iv)  Courses in colleges akin to private commercial colleges in Ireland.</P>
      <P>(v)  Courses provided in colleges in Britain which are offered in a private commercial third level college in Ireland and which are validated by that British college. </P>
      <P>Approved courses in pharmacy are eligible for student support.  I have no plans to extend maintenance grants to the other courses referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Under the extension to the scheme, students studying in other EU member states can qualify for a means tested maintenance grant.  No grant is payable in respect of fees and I have no plans to extend the scheme to include grants in respect of fees.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the implementation of the Education Bill, 1997 will involve radically changing the administrative framework for education and a major refocusing of the Department of Education, including the gradual transfer of some functions from the Department to the boards.  The implementation of the Bill will not result in a completely new area of expenditure. Rather, it will involve the reallocation of funding and administrative responsibilities within the education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, as the White Paper makes clear, the proposed changes to the education system will take place on a phased basis, involving a gradual transfer of functions to the boards, within a carefully costed and approved plan, prepared by each board and approved by the Minister.  This will facilitate careful appraisal of the incremental costs of the changes, in the context of the education estimates for the year in question, and <Col N="1544" /> within the overall context of the budgetary parameters approved by Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have attached a particular priority to ensuring that all children with special needs have full access to suitable education services.</P>
    <P>Difficulties do arise from time to time in relation to the suitability of services made available to individual children.  Such difficulties can arise where initial placement arrangements are subsequently found to have been inadequate to a particular child's needs or where the evolving needs of a child require a modified response. However, in all such cases, my Department makes every effort to ensure that any difficulties are resolved as quickly as possible and that suitable alternative arangements are put in place.</P>
    <P>Where children with special education needs are concerned, it is important to recognise that the educational response can take a variety of forms and can require adjustment from time to time.</P>
    <P>In some cases, children are fully capable of attending ordinary schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial, resource or visiting teachers.  Where more serious disabilities are concerned, the required response may involve placement in a special school or special class dedicated to a particular disability.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have deployed significant numbers of additional teacher posts to improve the level of service in all of these areas.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the steps which I have already taken, coupled with the measures set out in the White Paper on Education, will ensure that all children with special needs will have access to suitably resourced education facilities and in their own areas.</P>

      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services.  The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case.</P>
      <P>In some cases, children with mild features of autism are capable of being educated in ordinary schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial, resource or visiting teachers.</P>
      <P>Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools dedicated to children with emotional disturbance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1995-96 school year, I established a pilot programme of special education services for children with autism.  Under this programme, a number of special classes dedicated specifically to the educational needs of children with autism are now in operation.  The programme involves the allocation of extra teachers to specifically address the educational needs of children with autism; the <Col N="1546" /> delivery of specially tailored educational programmes to meet the needs of these children; and the delivery of special in-service support to the teachers concerned.</P>
    <P>These classes are attached to special schools located in Beechpark, Stillorgan, County Dublin and Cratloe national school, Ennis, County Clare. A further special class catering for children with autism was established at St. Brigid's special school, Dundalk, County Louth in the current school year.  Each of these classes cater for a maximum of seven children.</P>
    <P>I am aware of demands for the wider provision of dedicated facilities to meet the educational needs of autistic children.  However, I am anxious that any such development should be soundly based and have regard to the wide spectrum of educational need which can accompany the autistic condition.</P>
    <P>Experience gained through the pilot programme will provide a basis for the future development of education services for the children in question.</P>

      <P>Primary schools draw up their own &ldquo;plans of work&rdquo; for the effective use of computers in the context of the overall curriculum.  Information and communication technology (ICT) activities are integrated as far as possible into classroom teaching and directed towards learning support.  ICT is seen in a cross-curricular context as facilitating the integrated and child-centred focus of the primary school curriculum.  At present, the primary curriculum is being revised.  This revision will take account of the most recent developments in the use of ICT in primary education.</P>
      <P>Computer studies in second-level schools is included as a non-examinable subject within the junior certificate and leaving certificate curriculum and as an examinable module within the leaving certificate applied.  In addition, aspects of information and communication technology are relevant to teaching and learning in a range of subjects.  Schools participating in vocationally oriented senior cycle programmes are provided with grants for computer and communications equipment. The use of ICT is a central component of these programmes.  Also, there is a specific incareer development provision for the enhancement of ICT skills among teachers.</P>

    <P>I had the pleasure in recently announcing the Department of Education's major new Millennium Project, &ldquo;Schools IT 2000&rdquo;, which involves a Government investment of £30 million over the next five years.

      <P>The programmes referred to by the Deputy are aided by the European Structural Funds under the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development.  An indicative amount of aid per annum and a total allocation over the period 1994-99 is designated for each measure included in the Operational Programme.</P>
      <P>Where the target level of expenditure on any measure in the education sector was not reached to warrant the drawdown of the maximum approved aid level for a particular year, the monitoring committee to date, has approved the redistribution of the unspent aid within the same measure over the remaining years of the programme and a revised financial plan for the measure has been agreed by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The current financial plan for the Operational Programme was approved by the monitoring committee in October 1996.  The final claims for aid from the European Social Fund for 1996, which are being compiled in my Department at present, will be measured against the maximum level of aid approved in respect of 1996 under the revised financial plan.</P>
      <P>With regard to the programme in question, the current position is as follows</P>
      <P>Equal Opportunities consists of a range of actions aimed at combatting gender stereotyping and the promotion of equal opportunities. Actions under this measure are grouped under three main headings: curricular interventions, support for parents and, especially, mothers of preschool children wishing to participate in education. Support for voluntary or community women's education groups.</P>
      <P>In approving the revised financial plan for the measure in October 1996 the monitoring committee agreed that £2.05 million of the ESF aid allocation would be allocated over the period 1997 to 1999 to support child care provision for participants on the VTOS and Youthreach programmes, £600,000 would be allocated for grants to voluntary women's groups and the remaining sum would continue to support curriculum interventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> Under the current financial plan for the measure, the drawdown of aid for 1996 will be approximately £20,000 less than anticipated.  The monitoring committee its being asked, at is meeting on 22 April 1996 to approve the re-allocation of this underspend to the promotion of equal opportunities in 1998.</P>
    <P>The primary objectives of the Education Centres which are funded under the Vocational Training Infrastructure measure are: to provide a centre for the dissemination of knowledge and information to all teachers; to promote and facilitate the in-career development of teachers; to promote and encourage research and experimental projects in the field of education.</P>
    <P>Under the vocational training infrastructure measure, approximately £104 million has been allocated from the European Regional Development Fund in respect of second level and third level capital projects.  The total cost of the agreed programme is in the region of £182 million.  A sum of £7.5 million of the European Regional Development Fund aid has been designated for the development and upgrading of education centres.  It is proposed to establish-upgrade 21 education centres, each with its own catchment area.</P>
    <P>I announced a revised schedule for the implementation of the programme of development of the education centres on 18 October, 1996.  My Department is seeking the approval of the monitoring committee to re-allocate aid in the region of £1.6 million from 1996 to 1998 on the basis of the revised implementation schedule.</P>
    <P>The Vocational Preparation and Training programme is provided at two levels: VPT-1, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied programme; VPT-2, more commonly known as post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <P>An underspend of EU aid occured in this measure in 1995 due primarily to a temporary decrease in the number of trainees entering VPT arising from the expansion of the transition year option in second level schools.  This underspend was re-allocated to the measure for 1997.  Preliminary indications are that expenditure in 1996 under this measure was on target.</P>

Sample examination questions and papers, written and aural, sample oral tapes and role plays for the oral examinations were made available during 1996 along with supplementary guidelines.

Following detailed discussions in the autumn of 1996, full details of the format of the final examinations were sent to schools in January 1997 and sample papers for the final examinations were issued in March 1997.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 127 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  The studies noted that the disadvantaged area scheme <Col N="1556" /> already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    <P>In line with the findings of these studies, I recently launched the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative which seeks to target a special package of supports on selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as suffering serious levels of educational disadvantage.  The selected schools were identified by the Education Research Centre on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of criteria devised by the centre.</P>
    <P>The two Sunday's Well schools mentioned by the Deputy already have disadvantaged status for funding purposes.  However, I am not in a position at present to allocate additional concessionary teacher posts to schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Such posts are allocated to schools in disadvantaged areas where resources permit and on the basis of priority of need.</P>
    <P>In the event of such posts becoming available, the needs of the schools in question will be considered.</P>

      <P>Up to now there has been no funding available specifically for the purchase of computers by primary schools.  Therefore, there was no provision whereby an application in respect of St. Patrick's national school could be approved.</P>
      <P>However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Government has decided to invest £30 million in a project to develop the integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in first and second-level education.</P>
      <P>The project, entitled &ldquo;Schools IT 2000&rdquo; will run over five years until the year 2001.  It will involve the development and implementation of an exciting programme to support every Irish school in making the best possible educational use of ICTs. The programme will build on the expertise and creativity which is already in evidence in Irish classrooms.</P>
      <P>The project will target action in three key areas: (i)  teacher training and support; (ii)  classroom resources and infrastructure, and (iii)  policy and research.</P>
      <P>The partners in education will be fully consulted on all aspects of the project, details of which will be communicated to schools in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>At present, I am not in a position to provide grant-aid towards a school hall at Scoil An Spioraid Naoimh, Bishopstown, County Cork.</P>
      <P>While I am anxious to extend the provision of general purpose facilities in primary schools, the pace at which this can be achieved will be dictated by the financial resources available and the priority must remain the provision of essential classroom accommodation and the elimination of existing sub-standard classrooms.  I do not expect the position to change in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>It should be noted that the Department relies on peace commissioners, the Garda and other interested parties to advise on changes of address as well as on other developments affecting peace commissioners.  Specifically, the Garda or relatives usually advise the Department when a peace commissioner dies but this does not happen in every case.  The following list must read in that context.</P>

      <P>The task force on security for the elderly published its report last year which contained a series of recommendations as to how the security needs of the elderly could be most effectively addressed. The Government followed up by making additional resources available to the Minister for Social Welfare to put in place a scheme to support voluntary groups in the installation of security equipment and alarm monitoring devices in the homes of elderly people who are identified as at risk.  The scheme is being administered by the Department of Social Welfare and the person should make contact with Social Welfare Regional Office, Social Welfare Services, Centre Park Road, The Marina, Cork, telephone: (021) 270055 and fax: (021) 317339.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the concern and disquiet felt and voiced by many older gardaí who retired before 1 January 1993, and whose pension is based on salary whereas those gardaí who retired since 1 January 1993, have a pension based on salary and allowances; the proposals, if any, the Government has for correcting this anomaly; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In 1994 a decision was reached to make unsocial hours allowances pensionable.  This was done as part of a restructuring agreement reached under the local bargaining clause of the PESP, and was in return for agreement by Garda associations to contribute to flexibility and change within the Force.  The agreement was subject to an overall <Col N="1565" /> limit on cost of 3 per cent of basic pay.  It did not provide for the extension of pensionability of unsocial hours to Garda pensioners who retired before 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>In relation to this restructuring agreement, restructuring deals have still to be finalised in respect of several other major public service groups and that consideration is currently being given to the implications for existing pensioners of the existing and pending restructuring deals across the public sector, and in relation to pension policy generally.</P>
      <P>Concerning the Garda pension scheme generally, the Deputy will be aware that in February 1996 my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, established the Commission on Public Service Pensions to examine and report on the pension terms of public servants, including members of the Garda Síochána.  The Commission has been asked to report to Government in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment of people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain disabled persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of last January, the numbers availing of the scheme totalled 8,548.</P>
      <P>Last year the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance was increased by £5 to £67.50 representing an increase of 8 per cent on the previous year's rate.  In this year's budget I announced that the weekly rate being increased by a further £3.00 from next June.  Provision is also being made from next June for the payment of an additional amount equivalent to 50 per cent of the existing entitlement, to carers who are looking after more than one person.</P>
      <P>For example, a person who is caring for an elderly and incapacitated couple, and who would currently qualify for the new maximum personal rate allowance of £70.50 per week will, as a result of this measure, receive an additional £35.25 per week, bringing the total weekly income to £105.75.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have also provided for a number of other improvements in the carer's allowance scheme.  In 1995, for instance, the weekly disregard of £100 in respect of the earnings of the carer's spouse was increased to £150 a week and the scheme was further improved with the inclusion of carers who look after the recipents of occupational pensions.  Last year, I introduced new regulations to change the basis of assessment of means of carers for the purpose of determining entitlement to rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  As a result of these changes, carers who are receiving rent or mortgage interest supplements from the health boards can now benefit by as much as £29 per week.  I have also provided for the award of a free travel companion pass to existing pass holders who are being cared for by a recipient of the carer's allowance. The pass allows the carer to travel free when accompanying the person being cared for. The further development of the carer's allowance is currently being examined in the context of a <Col N="1567" /> review of the allowance which is being carried out by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health having regard to general health care provision in the home for elderly and disabled people requiring care.  In this regard, all aspects of the current operation of the carer's allowance are being considered in the light of experience to date.  The findings contained in the recently published reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights entitled &ldquo;A Long-Term Support Framework for Female Carers of Older People and People with Disabilities; 1996 &mdash; 2011&rdquo; and the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities are also being taken into account in this review.</P>
    <P>Both myself and this Government are committed to ensuring the development of supports for those caring for people at home.  We recognise that they provide not only a valuable community service but also a quality of care which is difficult to replicate in an institutional setting.  The Deputy can be assured that carers will continue to be a priority for this Government.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>The underlying purpose of the student summer job scheme is to provide summer work opportunities and income support for the less well-off third level students and post-leaving certificate students who, from 1993, were precluded from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months.</P>
      <P>Priority, therefore, is given to enabling the maximum number of eligible students, who have no other means of support, to take part within the allocation of £10.2 million for the 1997 scheme. Students who are not precluded from unemployment assistance under the 1993 Social Welfare Act are, therefore, not eligible for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme will be operated this year on the same basis as last year's scheme.  Eligible students can earn £600 for 200 hours work which must be done in a minimum of six weeks within a 17 week period during the summer.  They can also take up other employment either during their participation in the scheme or when such participation has finished without affecting their entitlement, <Col N="1568" /> and many students avail of this to maximise their income.</P>
    <P>As a student who is eligible for the student summer job scheme does not have an unemployment assistance entitlement, the question of unemployment assistance costs do not arise in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>A review of the insurability position of share fishermen and women for social insurance was carried out in the Department.  Taking account of the working arrangements which apply to this group of workers, and the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the &ldquo;Agegate&rdquo; case, the legal advice available to the Department confirms that those persons who are employed under contract of service conditions are insurable at the ordinary Class A rate and are eligible for all benefits.</P>
      <P>Persons who are employed under contract for service conditions, such as self-employed persons or partners in the venture are insurable at Class S i.e. the self-employed categories.</P>
      <P>This situation which applies under the present legislation does not require any amending legislation and was explained to representatives of the fishing industry whom I met on 14 January last. Because of its long and complex history, a number of issues with regard to eligibility were examined by a working group in the Department and an explanatory leaflet has been drawn up in accordance with its recommendations.  This explains the terms &ldquo;contract of service&rdquo; and &ldquo;contract for service&rdquo; and gives guidelines about insurability of employment, registration for payment of PRSI and rights for review of claims to benefit which may have been affected by the change in treatment regarding the rate of PRSI payable.  Where PRSI Class S contributions were paid in respect of a person who was working as an employee under a contract of service, the Class S contributions may be amended to Class A contributions and the employer relieved from payment of any arrears of contributions for the employees.</P>
      <P>The leaflet has been issued to the representative bodies of the industry and to fishing co-operatives. It is also being issued to every registered boat owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> The new arrangements have been brought into operation.  Regarding claims for benefit from share fishermen who are employed under contract of service, they should apply to their local social welfare office if they have a claim for unemployment assistance-unemployment benefit, disability benefit or occupational injuries benefit, and their claims will be processed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Any person who wishes to have a decision regarding the insurability of his or her employment should apply to the Scope Section at 101-104 Marlborough Street, Dublin 1.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology took up office, he has ensured that the annual reports on state investment in science and technology have always been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In fact the annual report for 1995 was laid before the Houses in February 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report for 1996 was laid before the Houses, <Col N="1570" /> and published, in November of that year in line with the Minister's aim to improve the timeliness with which these reports are made available.</P>
    <P>These annual reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas pursuant to section 9 of the Science and Technology Act, 1987, as continued by the Industrial Development Act, 1993. The Acts do not impose a requirement for a debate.  However, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Minister has been active in bringing STI into the public arena and has initiated debates on the Tierney report of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council in the Seanad and Dáil.  In addition the Minister has addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs on EU aspects of his Science and Technology portfolio.  As recently as last December the Minister initiated a debate in the Seanad on the Government's new White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is of the strong belief that, as set out in the recent White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation, there is a weak representation of STI issues in public affairs.  In the area of awareness our aim must be to bring about a significant cultural shift in attitudes and to bring about better communication, interaction and mutual understanding between the scientific community, industry, Government, the media and the public.</P>

      <P>Policy matters regarding the Irish National Petroleum Corporation fall within the ambit of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>However, if anyone has evidence of anti-competitive practices in any sector of the economy, it is now open to them to lodge a complaint with the Director of Competition Enforcement.</P>
      <P>The Competition Act, 1991, prohibits anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position.  The Act applies to undertakings, an undertaking being defined as a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unnamed corporate body or person engaged for gain in the production, supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, supplements the 1991 Act and provides for offences and penalties for breaches of the rules of competition as set out in the 1991 Act.  In addition it provides for public enforcement of the rules of competition and I have appointed a <Col N="1571" /> Director of Competition Enforcement to give effect to the public enforcement provisions.</P>
    <P>There are, therefore, two alternative ways for an individual or firm to pursue allegations of breaches of competition rules; take civil action under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, or make a complaint to the Director of Competition Enforcement requesting him to investigate any alleged breach or breaches of competition law.</P>
    <P>In regard to reviews of compliance with competition law, the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, provides that the Competition Authority may now, on its own initiative, carry out a study or analysis of any practice or method of competition. In addition the director of competition enforcement is also empowered to carry out an investigation, on his own initiative, into any contravention of competition law that he suspects has occurred or may occur.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo has not been paid his first REP scheme instalment in view of the fact that this delay is causing financial hardship; and the reason his neighbour has already been paid the second instalment in view of the fact that they both applied at the same time and have similar amounts of leased commonage.</Quest>

      <P>Over a year and a half ago my Department received a significant number of REP applications which included high proportions of leased commonage lands.  Indeed, a number of applications were submitted in respect of lands which were entirely leased commonage. In such circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that, in order to safeguard the financial interests of the EU and of the Irish Exchequer, my Department had to ensure that these applications were genuine and complied with the terms of the relevant regulations.  Consideration of the eligibility of such applications necessarily involves consultations with the Attorney General's Office and the European Commission.  Processing the application of the first named person has been held up pending the outcome of this consultation.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to arrive at a fair and equitable solution in these cases commensurate with the Department's responsibility to ensure the highest standards of accountability for all such expenditure.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of REPS is to compensate farmers for the genuine costs of engaging in environmentally friendly farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> The Deputy can be assured that when the outcome of our consultations is reached the conclusions will be applied equally and fairly in all cases.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he has taken to ensure that the problems and payment delays associated with area aid applications in 1996 will not be repeated in 1997.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the reform of the common agricultural policy in 1992, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is obliged under Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 to establish an integrated administration and control system.  A specific requirement of the system is the development of an alpha-numeric land parcel identification system for all land parcels which are the subject of an area aid application.  The original deadline for implementation of the system in member states was 1 January 1996 but this was extended by the EU to 1 January 1997.  As the Deputy will appreciate, implementation of the LPIS was an extremely large project involving over 130,000 farmers who between them submitted some 500,000 maps comprising some 750,000 land parcels.  Given the size of the project and the short time frame within which to complete it, it was not surprising that some problems arose with its introduction last year.</P>
      <P>However, considerable effort has been devoted to addressing the problems which arose in the 1996 area aid applications.  Amendments identified on the 1996 area aid applications have been taken into account in updating the system for 1997.</P>
      <P>Pre-printed 1997 area aid applications have now been distributed to farmers.  Maps have also issued to the overwhelming majority of applicants. My Department has written to those farmers who, because of outstanding problems, will not receive maps.  These farmers have been asked to identify the townlands in which their land is located and my Department will send them maps on which they can identify their land.</P>
      <P>As a further improvement on last year, the 1997 maps are printed against a photographic background and are centred on individual farms rather than on townland as was the case in 1996.</P>
      <P>While the LPIS, as with any mapping system, will be subject to on-going amendment and improvement, I am satisfied that the additional development of the LPIS over the past year will eliminate the majority of the problems experienced by farmers when it was first introduced.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has proposed an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1765/92 governing the support system for producers of arable crops to allow overshoot penalties to be confined to sub-base areas responsible for the overshoot.  My Department has requested a further change which would provide for individual producers to be penalised on the basis of an increase in their average registered production area over a three year period.</P>
      <P>Other member states have also requested changes to the support system and all are being considered at present by the Council of Agriculture Ministers.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a growers' register will only be relevant if and when the necessary changes to EU legislation are agreed.  My Department is making arrangements to have this register in place at the earliest possible date in anticipation of these changes.</P>

    <P>The higher quantity of exports in 1995 is due to high quantities of intervention beef sold during this period.  As cattle slaughterings for the first quarter of 1997 were running at some 27 per cent above 1996 levels it is likely that exports in this period will exceed 1996 levels even though intervention purchases of 13,500 tonnes were made so far this year.</P>

      <P>The closing date for receipt of applications under the 1996 cattle headage and suckler cow premium schemes was 31 May 1996 but it was subsequently extended to 7 June 1996 without penalty.  Applications lodged after that date but up to 3 July 1996 were accepted subject to the appropriate percentage penalty for late applications.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted a letter to the local office of my Department on 12 October 1996 stating that he was in ill health and that he had not received an application form under the cattle headage and suckler cow premium scheme.</P>
      <P>He was informed that the closing dates had long since passed but he was given the opportunity of appealing the decision if he submitted medical evidence to support his claim of ill health.  Medical evidence was received on 26 March 1997 but it only confirmed that the farmer concerned was hospitalised between 25 March 1996 and 11 May 1996.  As there was ample time after 11 May 1996 to obtain and lodge an application form before the extended closing date of 7 June 1996 or the later closing date of 3 July 1996, it was not possible to consider an application from him in March 1997.  While my Department endeavours to send application forms under these schemes to all likely eligible herdowners, the onus still remains with each farmer to obtain and lodge his or her application form.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for eight animals under the ten month special beef premium scheme on 21 February 1996 and six animals under the ten months special beef premium scheme on 3 December 1996.  The total forage area declared on the person's area aid application was 12.45 hectares thus entitling him to claim up to 24.9 livestock units including notional units derived from any milk quota held before exceeding his stocking density.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned declared a milk quota of 23,499 gallons and confirmed recently that he is not in the milk recording scheme.  This milk quota represents 26.19 livestock units i.e. 23,499 divided by 897 and as such exceeds his stocking density limit of 24.9 livestock units.  Consequently, the number of livestock units on which the person might claim special beef premium is already used up by his milk quota.  This renders the person <Col N="1580" /> named ineligible for payment in respect of special beef premium.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 20 ewes under the 1996 ewe premium scheme and 20 hoggets under the 1996 sheep headage scheme. At an inspection carried out on his flock on 8 March 1996 20 ewes were presented and accepted.  No hoggets were presented and the person named was deemed ineligible under the sheep headage scheme.  At the subsequent compliance inspection carried out on 18 April 1996, no ewes were presented and the person named was deemed intellgible under the ewe premium scheme.</P>
      <P>The person named applied under the 1996 cattle headage scheme on 21 animals.  He was inspected on 20 September 1996 and nine animals were absent.  Consequently the person named incurred a penalty of 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for the October 1996 suckler cow scheme under his own herd number.  This application could not be processed as an application had already been received on 5 June 1996 for the May 1996 suckler cow premium scheme is small-scale milk producers under a different herd number of which the person named became one of the joint registered owners on 5 July 1996.  Only one application is allowed under the suckler cow premium scheme each year.  He and his mother will, however, receive payment under the May 1996 suckler cow premium scheme for small-scale milk producers within two weeks. The delay in making payment in this case is due to inquiries which had to be made following an on-farm inspection.</P>

      <P>It was a condition of the 1996 ewe premium scheme that applicants keep on their holdings for 100 days, from 10 January 1996, to 18 April 1996 the number of sheep on which they applied for premium.  Following a compliance inspection of the sheep on which the person named claimed premium he was deemed to be in breach of that condition and his application for premium was rejected.  He was informed of the decision in writing and as you know he has subsequently appealed this decision, as is his right under the Charter of Rights for Farmers.  The decision to reject the application is currently under review in the appeals unit and the person named will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.  If his appeal is upheld payment of the premium will be made without delay.</P>

      <P>It was a condition of the 1996 ewe premium scheme that applicants keep on their holdings for 100 days, from 10 January 1996, to 18 April 1996 the number of sheep on which they applied for premium.  Under the sheep headage scheme applicants were required to keep the sheep for two months from the day following receipt of application.  Following an inspection of the sheep on which the person named claimed premium-headage he was deemed to be in breach of the above conditions and his application for premium/headage was rejected.  He was informed of this decision in writing.  His case was subsequently reviewed in the local office and the original decision was upheld.  He then appealed his case to the appeals unit who upheld the original decision to reject the application.  The person named has since written to the Ombudsman's office to have his case reviewed.  Payment of ewe premium and sheep headage will depend on the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, which was approved by the Government in <Col N="1584" /> March 1996, sets out the measures which will be undertaken during the years 1996 to 1998 to restructure and reorganise the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of the implementation plan is to create more efficient, well structured and better organised Defence Forces capable of fulfilling the roles which were redefined by the Government in 1993.  In doing that the issues identified in the course of the examination of the organisation such as the high age profile problem, inadequate collective training, excessive numbers in civilian-type jobs and the serious imbalance between pay and non-pay spending are being tackled.  When the revised organisation is in place there will be a three brigade structure of 11,500 all ranks which will be better trained and equipped to carry out its operational tasks.</P>
      <P>The impact of the implementation plan on particular units of the Defence Forces will be addressed gradually as the plan progresses.  Any reforms will be implemented in a planned and sensitive manner and there will be consultations with the representative associations in accordance with the agreed system of representation.</P>
