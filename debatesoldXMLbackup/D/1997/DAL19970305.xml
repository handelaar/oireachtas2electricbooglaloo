      <P>Since the Minister for Finance is taking the Order of Business will he inform the House when he hopes to have the Finance Bill, 1997 passed by both Houses and signed by the President?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly anticipate the co-operation of the Opposition in relation to a matter like that.  Clearly it would be a matter for the Opposition Chief Whip with whom we shall be happy to discuss the matter in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance and I know, the Department of Finance usually preempts all these issues.  No doubt the Minister has in his possession a note of when it is hoped to have the Finance Bill, 1997 passed and signed by the President.  Perhaps he would give the House the benefit of that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be happy to hear that the Department is under democratic control and subject to the wishes of this Assembly.  As the House will be aware, the Finance Bill has to be passed and signed by the President no later than 90 days after the budget, which timetable will be met in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to promised legislation mentioned in the programme for Government, will the Minister for Finance say when and if it is the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill in respect of the financial bonding of third level private colleges?  Can he report to the House on the Tánaiste's statement of yesterday, indicating whether any progress has been made or whether the Government has met the students involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here yesterday but I gather the matter was dealt with extensively then. The legislation to which the Deputy refers is contained in the programme for Government and is being considered at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste indicated that he would seek to do something for the students and college concerned.  I received a letter from you, Sir, this morning in relation to this specific matter. I had tabled a normal parliamentary question. You wrote to me saying that because the Minister says she has no responsibility in the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not challenging anything.  As a Member of this House, how can I raise this issue when a parliamentary question I had tabled is ruled out of order and I am not allowed raise the matter on the Order of Business?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying she has no responsibility in the matter.  It is a crazy position. Five hundred students are on the streets and we cannot raise the matter formally in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Finance inform the House whether the Government is willing to make time available to debate a report from the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on economic and monetary union?  Its chairman, Deputy Jim Mitchell, is most anxious that we have a debate on the subject.  It is most unfortunate that the whole issue should go by without debate.  Will the Minister indicate whether Government time will be made available for such a discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take issue with the Deputy's remark to the effect that the whole issue would go by without debate.  The Deputy will be aware that there was a debate within the relevant committee &mdash; if my memory serves me correctly &mdash; in March 1996.  It is timely that that debate be updated.  There will be a meeting of the Whips this afternoon.  I will request the Government Chief Whip to discuss the matter with the Whips of the Opposition parties in order to decide whether such debate should take place within the <Col N="1536" /> confines of the committee or, if the House so wishes, on the floor of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach about two fundamental items of legislation promised in the Programme for Government and he admitted they will not be introduced in the lifetime of this Dáil.  I refer the Minister for Finance to the programme for Government which promised to establish a parole board to ensure that prisoners will be discharged from prison in an orderly manner and not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Is it the Government's intention to introduce the relevant legislation to provide for this board in the seven or eight weeks of parliamentary time left to this Government or will that commitment be jettisoned also?</P>

I tabled a question to the Taoiseach and every Government Minister yesterday and the Minister for Finance decided to reply on behalf of everybody and gave me a smart alec reply.

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions contained in previous Social Welfare Acts, combined with those contained in this Bill, have brought about a transformation of the social welfare system.  The significant change in the focus and ethos of the Department is now underpinned by a solid body <Col N="1542" /> of legislation.  This change in focus stemmed from a realisation that it was no longer sufficient for the Department to concentrate all its energies on delivering essential income support payments to the elderly, unemployed, people with disabilities, low wage workers and families, although that remains, and rightly, a central part of its work.  It was also necessary for the Department to ensure that the social welfare system is able to support the aspirations of people to improve their conditions and reduce their level of dependency by facilitating them in gaining access to training, education and employment.</P>
      <P>We do not claim the system is now perfect; it is not.  There is still need for further reform but it is a more coherent and flexible system.  It is responsive to the varying needs of society.  This Bill represents a further stage in its transformation.</P>
      <P>The 36 sections of the Bill comprise a comprehensive package of measures which provides for an improvement in the living standards of all who depend on social welfare through increases in weekly rates of payment which are double the projected rate of inflation for the year; continues the pro-work and pro-family policies which have been central to the work of this Government; provides a programme of improvements for old age pensioners and carers; completes the process of ensuring equal treatment of men and women in all social welfare schemes; brings about further significant reform of our social welfare system through the introduction of, for example, new <i>pro rata</i> pensions and a new sickness allowance; strengthens the social insurance system by enhancing the benefits available to all workers who pay social insurance; and reverses the damage caused by the infamous &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts introduced by the previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on a number of specific measures in the Bill which are of particular significance. I am pleased to provide for the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> contributory pensions.  The present conditions require a minimum average requirement of 20 contributions over a working lifetime in order to qualify for the minimum rate of pension.  Under the new arrangements in section 12, reduced rate old age contributory pension will now be payable to persons who have a yearly average of between 10 and 19 contributions over the period from when they first became insured until the end of the contribution year before reaching the age of 66 years.  The details will be contained in regulations to be made under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new arrangements will come into effect in November and will be of benefit mainly to people who have had broken or sporadic contribution records over their working lifetime.  Included in that category are married women who worked for a number of years before they married, then spent a long period outside the paid workforce and who may have returned to paid employment in recent years.  It will help returned emigrants <Col N="1543" /> whose work period abroad cannot be reckoned for pension purposes in Ireland.  It will also benefit self-employed people who started on their own before 1988 when PRSI for the self-employed was introduced.</P>
    <P>In line with the recommendations in the final report of the National Pensions Board, section 12 provides for an increase in the number of paid contributions required for entitlement to old age contributory pension from 156 or three years to 520 or ten years.  This increase is being introduced in two phases with lengthy timescales which recognise the need for a long lead-in time when making fundamental changes to State pension entitlements in order to meet people's expectations and allay fears as much as possible.  The timescales proposed are more generous than those envisaged by the National Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>The second issue I wish to highlight is dealt with in section 13 which amends the conditions governing requalification for unemployment benefit and which is aimed at improving the position of workers in a typical employment.  The categories of workers involved include seasonal and casual workers such as dockers, firefighters, creamery workers, hotel staff and people in the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>By virtue of changes introduced by Deputy McCreevy as part of his notorious &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts, these workers were precluded from requalifying for unemployment benefit until they had a further 13 PRSI contributions paid after they had exhausted their entitlement to unemployment benefit.  In practice, this meant that, until such time as they acquired the necessary 13 PRSI contributions, they had to have recourse to unemployment assistance which is means tested and which took account of whatever earnings they had from their casual employment in the previous tax year.  The method by which those earnings were assessed gave rise to difficulties in areas where the volume of casual work available was declining and many workers found themselves on a reduced rate of unemployment assistance, or no payment at all, on the basis of past earnings which had been spent and/or projected earnings which had not yet materialised.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, a person can requalify for unemployment benefit by having the necessary 13 PRSI contributions paid at any time after the 156th day of unemployment, that is, six months. This means that instead of having to have recourse to unemployment assistance for 13 weeks, a claimant can, in certain circumstances, requalify for a further 15 months of unemployment benefit.  At least 5,000 workers who are currently receiving reduced rate unemployment assistance will gain an average of £11 per week from this change.  There is also an important non-monetary gain: the additional security which derives from knowing their benefit will generally continue at a particular level during bouts of unemployment, hitherto made worse by financial uncertainty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> A third notable feature of the Bill &mdash; to which sections 15 to 18 refer &mdash; involves the introduction of a new social assistance scheme to be known as sickness allowance.  Under the existing arrangements, people who are incapable of work due to illness but who do not satisfy the contribution conditions for disability benefit or the qualifying conditions for receipt of disability allowance must have recourse to the supplementary welfare allowance in order to secure income support.</P>
    <P>During 1995 supplementary welfare allowance was paid to more than 12,000 people who were unable to work due to illness but had no entitlement to either disability allowance or disability benefit.  Supplementary welfare allowance was never intended as a sickness payment and, consequently, provision is being made for the introduction of the new sickness allowance which will complete the cover available under the social welfare system for those who are unable to work due to illness or injury.</P>
    <P>Sickness allowance will be payable at the same rate as unemployment assistance i.e. at the short-term rate of assistance for the first 15 months and at the long-term rate thereafter.  To qualify for the allowance a person must be aged 18 years or over and under age 66, be incapable of work and satisfy a means test.  The provisions as to the assessment of means will be specified in regulations.  It is envisaged that sickness allowance will provide for an estimated 13,500 people per year who are incapable of working due to illness and are currently forced to seek supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>A further important reform of the social welfare system is provided for in sections 19 to 21 which introduce a new scheme to be known as the widower's (non-contributory) pension scheme.  The introduction of this new payment represents the final step in the implementation of equal treatment for men and women throughout the social welfare code.  The new payment is designed to meet the needs of widowers who are not rearing children &mdash; those who are will continue to receive the one-parent family payment &mdash; and will be available to widowers on the same basis as the existing widow's (non-contributory) pension.  This Part of the Bill also extends entitlement to the new widower's pension to divorced men, on the death of their former spouse, provided they have not remarried and continue to satisfy the other conditions of entitlement.  Similar provisions have already been put in place for widows in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 contains an important commitment in relation to continuing the reform and development of the social insurance system over the period of the new programme.  The programme for Government contains a similar commitment. This is important because of the crucial role social insurance plays within the overall social welfare system.  PRSI contributions are paid by approximately 1.35 million workers and <Col N="1545" /> amount to £1.81 billion each year, which is sufficient to pay for almost half of all social welfare expenditure.  Most importantly, the social insurance system reflects inter-generational solidarity as well as solidarity between the different income groups.  Those who are active in the economy support those who are no longer active, while those at work who are best off support those who are unable to work and are least well off.</P>
    <P>The PRSI provisions in the Bill reflect the changes announced in the budget last January. Section 8 provides for a reduction of 1 per cent, from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent, in the standard employee contribution rate.  This section also increases from £22,300 to £23,200 the annual earnings ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable by employees and increases from £26,800 to £27,900 the earnings ceiling up to which contributions are payable by employers.</P>
    <P>The weekly earnings limit for the lower, 8.5 per cent, rate of employer's contribution is being increased from £250 per week to £260 per week. Section 9 increases from £22,300 to £23,200 the income ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable by the self-employed.  All of these changes will come into effect on 6 April next.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently met a delegation from the Small Firms Association to discuss the ways in which the social welfare system supports the needs of small business and whether and how this can be improved further.  It was agreed that the black economy was a major check on bona fide employment growth, it puts honest employers at a disadvantage and defrauds all taxpayers.  The Minister outlined the improvements which have been put in place over the past six months by my Department to tackle black economy fraud.</P>
    <P>The Small Firms Association welcomed the range of supports for employers in recruiting extra staff, particularly from the long-term unemployed, but pointed out that there was a problem in getting the information to employers.  Small employers, in particular, did not have the resources or expertise to avail of schemes which were very complex to implement or which required a big administrative input from the employer.</P>
    <P>The back-to-work allowance scheme and the employers' PRSI exemption scheme were cited as positive examples of schemes that are easy to understand and apply and consequently work well.  In response, the Minister undertook to arrange for the Department, through its regional network, to work with the Small Firms Association in a systematic and focused way to inform small business of the supports available to them through the social welfare system.  In this context, the Small Firms Association will work with the Department in preparing a guide for employers on how they and their employees can avail legitimately of support from the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the provisions of the various <Col N="1546" /> sections.  Sections 1 and 2 contain the usual provisions relating to short title, construction and definitions used throughout the Bill.  The increases in the weekly personal and adult dependant rates of social insurance and social assistance payments announced in the budget are provided for in sections 3 and 4.  All personal rates are being increased by £3 a week, while all adult dependant allowances are being increased by £1.50 a week.  This gives substantial increases of between 4 per cent and 4.8 per cent, which is approximately twice the expected rate of inflation for this year.</P>
    <P>As a result of these substantial increases more recipients than ever are now at, or very close to, the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Some recipients, such as contributory pensioners, are currently at 113 per cent which is well ahead of those target rates while others, such as invalidity pensioners, will now reach 100 per cent for the first time.  Those previously at 95 per cent of the target rate will now move up to 98 per cent while those on supplementary welfare allowance and short-term unemployment assistance will move from 92 per cent to 95 per cent of the target rate.  The significant progress made over the past three years in reaching those minimum target rates is the clearest indication possible of the Government's commitment to achieve the rates recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for increases in child benefit which is the best mechanism we have for supporting families and tackling poverty.  In line with the policy direction established in the past two budgets, child benefit is being increased as part of a planned strategy of reforming income support for children, removing disincentives and working towards putting in place a system of basic income for children.</P>
    <P>The increase of £1 in the lower rate and £5 in the higher rate of child benefit with effect from 1 September next will bring the rates to £30 per month for each of the first two children and to £39 per month for each subsequent child.  A family with three children will now receive £99 a month while a family with six children will receive £216 a month.  During the past three years child benefit has increased by 52 per cent for a three child family and by 54 per cent for a five child family.  In 1991 a four child family received approximately £70 a month, while this year it will receive £138, which is approximately double.</P>
    <P>An increase of £10 at each point in the weekly income thresholds used to determine entitlement to family income supplement is provided for in section 6.  As a result of this threshold increase virtually all current recipients will get an extra £6 in their weekly payments from mid-June next. The new weekly thresholds range from £205 for a one child family to £344 for a family with eight children or more.  This section also provides that from 12 June next the rate of FIS payable will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less any superannuation, PRSI and levies which may be <Col N="1547" /> payable.  This revised calculation method is an important first step towards meeting the commitment in Partnership 2000 to base FIS entitlement on net rather than gross income: it only leaves income tax deductions to be removed from the calculation.</P>
    <P>Last year Social Welfare Act provided for the continued payment of child dependant allowances for up to 13 weeks to people unemployed for a minimum of 12 months who take up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks.  This measure has greatly helped to overcome the disincentives facing unemployed people with families who are trying to get back to work.  Section 7 extends these provisions to other groups, namely, people on community employment immediately before taking up employment and people on the live register or on community employment who take up employment under the Jobs initiatives announced last year.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 are concerned with new rates of PRSI contributions and increases in the earnings ceilings.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 provide for a further enhancement of the social insurance system through the extension of maternity benefit and adoptive benefit to women in insurable self-employment along the same lines as currently available to women in insurable employment. These sections also provide for a consequential amendment to section 18(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 which extends the benefits covered by self-employment contributions to include maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.</P>
    <P>I described earlier the introduction of reduced rate old age contributory pensions, and section 12 gives legislative effect to this measure.  I also referred earlier to the reform of the arrangements for requalifying for unemployment benefit.  The relevant legislative changes are provided for in section 13.</P>
    <P>Section 14 relates to the occupational injuries benefit scheme and provides for two improvements in this area.  First, it removes the more restrictive conditions applying to widowers in the scheme, thus ensuring that widows and widowers are treated equally.  It also abolishes the requirement that the claimant must be living with, or have wholly or mainly maintained by, the decease.  This brings the conditions of entitlement into line with those applying to widow's and widower's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Second, this section extends the scope of the scheme to provide for payment of pensions to widows and widowers to the surviving spouse of a recipient of disablement benefit whose degree of disablement is assed at 50 per cent or more, irrespective of the cause of death.  This provision is designed to overcome a problem which arises with the existing arrangements when the cause of death cannot be attributed directly to the occupational disease or injury.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> I spoke earlier about the introduction of a new social assistance payment, to be known as sickness allowance.  The relevant legislation provisions are contained in sections 15 to 18.  I should mention also that section 17 provides for disability benefit to be renamed sickness benefit and invalidity pension to be renamed disability pension to more accurately reflect the contingencies these payments are designed to meet.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already about the introduction of the new widower's non-contributory pension scheme, the legislative basis for which is contained in sections 19 to 21.</P>
    <P>Section 22 introduces a number of improvements to the disability allowance.  It provides for regulatory powers to extend entitlement to disability allowance to persons who reside in an institution on a part-time basis and otherwise reside at home.  The allowance will be payable to such people at half of the standard rate, subject to means.  This measure is in line with the views contained in the recent report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  Section 22 also provides that where one of a couple is in receipt of disability allowance and the other is in receipt of old age non-contributory pension or invalidity pension, each of the couple may receive the full personal rate of payment.  This section also provides that the cost of medical certificates issued for the purpose of claiming disability allowance and the new sickness allowance scheme will be met by the Department.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for two important improvements to the carer's allowance.  First, provision is being made for the payment of an additional amount, equivalent to 50 per cent of the existing personal rate, to caters providing full-time care and attention to more than one person.  This measure goes some way towards recognising the particular difficulties faced by those caring for more than one person.  It is estimated that up to 2,000 carers will benefit from this improvement. Second, this section provides regulatory powers to relax the conditions requiring full-time care and attention so as to entitle to the allowance carers of incapacitated persons attending rehabilitation training or day care centres on a limited basis. This measure has been sought for a long time.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides that people who cease to be entitled to the one parent family payment or the carer's allowance may qualify for pre-retirement allowance without first having to have been in receipt of unemployment payments for 15 months.</P>
    <P>It has been one of our objectives to bring about a more uniform, consistent and even-handed treatment of capital for means test purposes across all social assistance schemes.  The provisions contained in section 25 mark a further step along that mail by applying new and more generous rules to all means tested pensions and to carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 26 consolidates the provisions relating to amounts disregarded in the assessment of means for social assistance payments.  It also <Col N="1549" /> makes provision for disregarding rental income from the assessment of means for old age non-contributory pension where the income is in respect of a person who lives with and pays rent to the pensioner.  Section 27 simply provides that the measures contained in sections 22 to 26 will be brought into effect by way of commencement order.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that the Minister announced in the budget an important reform of the way the earnings of low paid workers are treated in relation to social welfare.  The measure announced was designed to deal with the poverty and unemployment trap created by the withdrawal of the adult dependant allowance and half of the child dependant allowance once the earnings of the spouse of a claimant exceeds £60 per week.  It involves the introduction of a tapered withdrawal of the adult dependant allowance in the case of recipients of a number of social welfare payments.  The provisions of section 28 are being introduced as a direct consequence of that reform.</P>
    <P>Under existing provisions, where the spouse of a claimant to a social assistance payment is not his or her dependant, the claimant is assessed with the joint means of the couple.  Section 28 amends these provisions so as to provide that on the introduction of the tapered rates of adult dependant allowance, a person in receipt of reduced rate adult dependant allowance will only be assessed with half the joint means of the couple.</P>
    <P>Section 28, together with Schedule F, also replaces the term &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; used for the purposes of paying an increase of benefit or assistance in respect of a spouse or partner with the term &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo;.  This change in terminology is in line with a commitment the Minister gave during the passage of last year's Social Welfare Bill.  It reflects his wish to completely remove the concept of dependency from the social welfare code and is a small but significant step towards that goal.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides for a significant change to the existing provisions governing decisions relating to what are known as &ldquo;liable relatives&rdquo;. Under the existing provisions, where one parent family payment or supplementary welfare allowance is paid to a person, any other person who is liable to maintain the beneficiary, and any child in respect of whom an increase is payable, is liable to contribute such amount as may be determined by the Department, or the health boards in the case of SWA, towards the benefit or assistance payment in question.</P>
    <P>These decisions are made on an administrative basis in that they are not formal decisions made by deciding officers appointed under the social welfare Acts.  As a result, the person concerned currently does not have the right to appeal. Section 29 provides that such decisions will now become a deciding officer function and will thus afford the person concerned the right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> In addition, it provides for regulatory powers to specify the basis on which the contribution a person is required to pay is to be calculated.  Section 29 also provides that a divorced person will remain liable to contribute towards the cost of the benefit or assistance paid to their former spouse and extends the definition of &ldquo;order of the court&rdquo; to include maintenance, lump sum, variation and interim orders in respect of maintenance made by any court.  These provisions will be brought into effect by way of commencement order.</P>
    <P>Section 30 contains a number of provisions relating to unemployment payments.  First, it provides that the provisions under which a person is not paid for the first three days of a claim for unemployment benefit, known as waiting days, will not apply in the case of a claim for benefit made following a claim for disability benefit in the same period of interruption of employment. Second, it provides for regulatory powers which will be used to eliminate the requirement to serve waiting days for unemployment assistance purposes, in certain circumstances.  Third, it enables the Minister for Social Welfare to make regulations specifying the circumstances under which an unemployed person will be regarded as being available for and genuinely seeking employment for the purposes of entitlement to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  Finally, Section 30 provides that people who, prior to their participation in the European voluntary service pilot action programme, were in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance can resume such entitlement on completion of the programme.  This programme, which was recently launched by the Commission of the European Union, is open to young people between the ages of 18 and 25 and is administered on behalf of the Department of Education by Léargas.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 31 state that, where a person who receives a social welfare payment by way of personation is subsequently convicted of the criminal offence of larceny, the amount of the payment to which the offence applies may be recovered from any social welfare payments to which the person is or becomes entitled.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for the collection of PRSI by the Department of Social Welfare from certain categories of self-employed contributors.  The House will be aware that, for purposes of administrative ease, PRSI is normally collected by the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of the Department. These new powers will enable PRSI to be collected from people, such as certain artists, who are exempt from tax liability.</P>
    <P>Section 32 also provides that a person who became insured as a self-employed contributor after reaching age 56, and who was previously insured as an employee, will be entitled to a refund in respect of the old age contributory pension element of their self-employment contribution in cases where they do not qualify for old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> This section also provides for regulatory powers to refund part of the employer's portion of contributions paid in respect of seafarers.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of section 33 is to allow for the amendment of a number of references to regulatory provisions contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  These regulatory provisions relate to employment contributions and the need for the amendments arises from the consolidation in 1996 of regulatory provisions relating to contributions and insurability.</P>
    <P>This section also provides for the deletion of subsection 212(7) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, which provides that a person shall not be required to give any evidence or answer questions tending to incriminate himself. This provision is regarded as unnecessary in that there is a recognised common law right against self-incrimination and it would be more appropriate for a court to decide whether the right may be relied upon in the circumstances of a case.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides for the amendment of the functions of the National Social Service Board which were bestowed on the board when it was originally established under the aegis of the Department of Health in 1984.  In 1995, responsibility for the board transferred to the Department of Social Welfare and, consequently, it is appropriate that its functions should be reviewed in the light of that transfer of responsibility.</P>
    <P>In broad terms, the revised functions reflect more accurately the important role of the National Social Service Board in promoting and supporting independent information, advice and advocacy services throughout the country to ensure that all citizens have access to accurate, comprehensive and clear information on the full range of social services.  Specifically, the revised functions reflect the reality of activities undertaken by the National Social Service Board in recent years, such as its role in providing impartial social policy feedback on issues of concern to social services users and also its role in providing information, training and development services to the independent voluntary social services sector. The opportunity is also being taken in this section to substitute the Minister for Social Welfare for the Minister for Health in the original legislation &mdash; regulations made in 1995 already provided for that &mdash; and also to revoke a number of former functions which are no longer relevant in the context of the transfer of responsibility to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>We are glad to have this opportunity to review the functions of the National Social Service Board and, in that context, to reiterate our support for the continued development of high quality independent information services so that all our citizens can exercise choice in relation to information provision.</P>
    <P>Sections 35 and 36 serve three related purposes. First, they provide for an increase from £188 to £197 in the weekly earnings limit below <Col N="1552" /> which employees are exempt from liability for health contributions and the employment and training levy.  Second, they provide for an increase from £9,750 to £10,250 in the annual income limit below which self-employed people are exempt from these levies.  Finally, they exempt from liability for the levies a distribution from an Irish resident company received by a person who is not an Irish resident.  These changes will come into force from 6 April 1997.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be viewed in the context of a strategy designed to make the social welfare system more equitable, more innovative, more reforming and more responsive to the diverse needs of Irish society today.  It has all of these attributes and it will serve to further enhance the Social Welfare system.  This is a substantial Bill which will have the effect of protecting and enhancing the living standards of people who, for one reason or another, are outside the active labour force; further enhancing the pro work and pro worker focus of the socila welfare system; completing the process of bringing about full equality between men and women under the social welfare system; continuing the pro family policy direction which has been central to the reforms that have been introduced in the past few years; and reversing the damage done by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats dirty dozen social welfare cuts.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a carefully sculpted social and economic document designed to encourage participation in the workforce, assist those who are not in the workforce to meet their payment requirements, and to chart the course in the next 12 months in a way that is positive, progressive and supportive.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister is not with us today.  The Minister of State did not apologise on his behalf, but I understand from a note he sent to me yesterday that he is busy in the Four Courts and cannot be here on this occasion.</P>
      <P>This Social Welfare Bill implements the strategy adopted by the rainbow coalition in its third consecutive budget.  The Minister of State emphasised that this was one of three budgets.  These three budgets together have been a bitter disappointment for widows, old age pensioners, unemployed people and others who depend on social welfare payments.  What it boils down to is that when this Bill is implemented an old age pensioner will have received, over three years, a mere £2.33 increase on average per week in each year. That is nothing to have a song and dance about. A widow will have received £2.20 per week over the same period, and a person on long-term unemployment assistance or on disability allowance will have received even less at £2.17 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This shows how, in times of greatly increased national prosperity, Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left have once again turned their backs on the poor and disadvantaged at a time when the Taoiseach is embarrassed by the wealth <Col N="1553" /> of the country in the context of EU grants we will receive in the future.  The Minister criticised his predecessor who negotiated considerable grants. He should have stayed quiet because he will not deliver anything.  He will not be there, so he probably does not care very much.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Taoiseach is embarrassed by the size of the wealth, the growth and the GDP <i>per capita</i>, created by his predecessors and on which he got a free ride which is just over, all that the widow, the old age pensioner, a person on disability allowance or on unemployment assistance has received is between £2.17 and £2.33 per annum in each of three years.  The Minister for Finance highlighted that when he said that in the three years old age pensioners would receive a £7 increase.  He did not stop to think, however, that that is an average of £2.33 per annum.  They are the harsh realities.  That is where the real poverty, the disadvantage lies.  It was Fine Gael that reduced the old age pension by one shilling, to nine shillings, and it will never live that down.</P>

      <P>Each Social Welfare Bill provides an opportunity to improve existing schemes and introduce new ones.  The major element in the Bill, the one for which the people look to the Government, is the increase in basic payments on which people live from week to week.  That is where the need is greatest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, made it a <Col N="1554" /> baker's dozen by introducing another very severe cut which will have a great effect, but I will come back to that matter.  The people deserve better from their leaders.  In the past three years the Government has been stagnant in the social welfare area.  It simply carried on the work that had already begun &mdash; before I left office I mapped out the disability allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applied with other measures, and if the Minister asks his officials he will find out that is the case.  He should not crow about normal developments.  What really matters is that people get their money, and the Government will find that out in due course.</P>
      <P>The Government did not introduce one new scheme or take innovative action to improve the lives of those who depend on social welfare.  On the other hand, it recently removed half the butter vouchers provided to widows, pensioners, carers and unemployed people on means tested assistance payments.  More than 900,000 people are affected by that move.  The income of those people, the poorest of the poor, the most defenceless, has been ruthlessly cut back, and nobody takes the blame.  The Minister for Social Welfare blames the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who, in turn, blames the European Union.  Everybody blames somebody else.  The reality is that the Government allowed the ball to slip.  It was not concerned about the elderly or widows, the people who depend on social welfare, as can be seen by its actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should talk to the people.  The record of the Government, when measured against the achievements of previous Fianna Fáil Governments, is very poor.  Fianna Fáil showed leadership and flair by introducing children's allowance, free travel, carer's allowance, back to work allowance, second chance education for the long-term unemployed and many other initiatives which had a fantastic impact on the lives of many thousands of people. The whole approach to social welfare is badly in need of updating to cope with our dramatically changing lifestyle in the Ireland of the new millennium. People are living longer, the birth rate is falling and flexi-time, part-time work and job-sharing opportunities are increasing.  Many other changes are taking place which we must anticipate and for which we must be prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people are staying in education longer. Drop-out rates in primary and second level education are remarkably low.  The needs of the family in the new millennium are changing and must be addressed.  The social welfare system must be sufficiently flexible to respond to the demands placed on it by these changes.  If we are to be successful, we must forget a new partnership with <Col N="1555" /> the many community and voluntary organisations working in the area of family and social affairs. Many of those were set up by the Department of Social Welfare over the years.  That is an area in which the Department was involved in innovation and change, in meeting the need.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there has been a significant change in focus and ethos in the Department of Social Welfare, but that change has been made in innumerable innovations over the years.  We must build a new partnership for the future.  The Minister said that he recognises the importance of community and voluntary organisations, but it is not sufficient to find out what happened in the past ten years or so, we must look forward to the new partnership for the future.  The responsibility is to plan ahead, have a vision and develop that vision, but that is not being done here.</P>
    <P>The range of programmes which come under the umbrella of social welfare is vast.  This spread of activities and their importance to the community needs to be recognised in the way in which the system is administered.  A new approach is needed to successfully meet the challenges which face us today.  In an increasingly prosperous society there is a grave danger that the most vulnerable groups will be overlooked. All disadvantaged groups must be supported in ways which improve their circumstances through adequate incomes, educational opportunities and participation in the workplace.</P>
    <P>The interim report of the Commission on the Family highlights a fact which we recognised a long time ago and which needs to be developed further, that if we want to overcome poverty and disadvantage we must develop many kinds of education, some of which have not been introduced yet.  We must work with local communities and groups in tackling the real problems and build on the educational opportunities &mdash; I am very happy the current schemes are operating so well in the Department.  In so doing we must set clear priorities and be flexible enough to alter those priorities as circumstances change.  The priorities should include supporting families and directing resources to pensioners, widows and those who are poorest and most disadvantaged.  If we are to achieve our objectives we must mount a new assault on poverty and disadvantage.  That is what I had hoped to see in this Bill, a new assault, a new approach, further development, looking ahead rather than simply filling in the pieces that are falling into place from work done earlier.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on all of us to balance our improved economic prosperity with being a caring society.  It is remarkable and encouraging that young people today want a caring society.  They want to do well in life, but not at the expense of those who are genuinely disadvantaged.  They want the Government to tackle disadvantage. Fianna Fáil has a proud and excellent record in this regard.  We have the vision, enthusiasm and imagination to implement policies that will ensure the social balance we desire is achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later.  In contrast, the Government's approach which underlies this Social Welfare Bill is shortsighted and irresponsible.  The Minister, Deputy De Rossa, stated he would like the social insurance fund placed on a solid basis.  He also claims to be concerned about pensioners' incomes.  The rhetoric is attractive, but the reality is different.</P>
      <P>In one step today the Government has undermined the solvency and stability of the social insurance fund by substantially reducing its income.  This will mean a deficit of some £114 million this year.  This is a workers' insurance fund to provide for illness, maternity benefit, occupational accidents and pensions.  When we handed over the fund at the end of 1994 it was breaking even for the first time in many years.  As employment and income to the fund increased we reduced contributions.</P>

      <P>I am not misleading the House.  I am stating the facts.  Reducing the fund will weaken the position of workers because every future Minister for Social Welfare will have to go cap in hand to the Minister for Finance to get taxpayers' money to meet the annual deficit before seeking funds to protect workers and increase pensions to meet the needs of pensioners.</P>
      <P>This is a disastrous strategic error by the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, and his Labour and Fine Gael partners in Government.  Rather than attempting to buy pre-election popularity by reducing the PRSI contributions by 1 per cent, the Government had an alternative which would not have damaged the social insurance fund.  It could have removed the 1 per cent levy, or an equivalent part of it, without undermining the fund.  Why did the Minister not insist on reducing the levy?  Why did he reduce the social insurance fund which he wants to place on a solid basis? That will not happen because of this Bill.  The Taoiseach is in Brussels today pleading for funds from 1999 onwards while at home we are reducing a fund that would provide for pensioners, widows and workers from 1999 onwards.</P>

      <P>The Minister had an alternative but did not take it.  He is delivering a sharp and undeserved slap in the face to pensioners because they are excluded from the Government's pre-election sweetener.  Pensioners paid into the social insurance fund all their working lives to provide for retirement, invalidity or widowhood, but in retirement, on relatively low incomes, they are still required to pay the 1 per cent PRSI levy. This cunning Minister is specifically excluding pensioners from the 1 per cent PRSI reduction to the social insurance portion of the PRSI contribution, a mean and calculated step by the Government to exclude pensioners from the benefit of the pre-election hand-out.  The rainbow coalition is telling vulnerable pensioners they must continue to pay the levy because it is the better off who need the relief.  Pensioners know they pay a 1 per cent levy from which they will not benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  Before we left office at the end of 1994 I transferred the disabled person's maintenance allowance, the main support for people with disabilities, from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare. Our plan was to introduce a disability allowance and this has been accomplished.  We wanted to improve the scheme and make it more relevant. We must support and encourage people with disabilities in their quest for paid work.  Accordingly, the earnings allowances should have been raised to match those provided for the one parent family allowance.  If those on disability allowance had benefited under the new working arrangements they could have gained a foothold in the jobs market.  Unemployment among people with disabilities is currently as high as 80 per cent.  That matter must be dealt with urgently.</P>
      <P>There is a strong argument in favour of individual pensions for adult dependants, who are mostly women.  The case for such a development is most obvious when the adult dependant is an old age pensioner.  On a non-contributory pension she will receive the princely sum of £40 per week. I am sure most commentators and the Government would agree that is not acceptable.  What has the Minister done for these people?  Adult dependants received an increase of approximately £1.17 per week in each of the three budgets and associated Social Welfare Bills, about which the Minister of State boasted in his contribution. That would buy about two litres of milk. Why does the Government not see what it is doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>If the Minister of State does his sums he will know what I am saying is correct. That is rainbow reality for some 120,000 adult dependants on unemployment payments and retirement and non-contributory pensions.</P>
      <P>The Government parties should hang their heads in shame at their miserly treatment of the lowest paid in our society.  A miserable increase of £1.17 per week shows how little value this spendthrift Government puts on the well-being of those women, the foundation on which this modern society was built.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil's introduction of social security for the self-employed in 1988 was a major breakthrough. It provided old age and widow's pensions for the first time for many thousands of people &mdash; small business people, skilled contract workers, professionals and farmers.  Great concern was expressed about the collection of the contributions and the solvency of the fund.  Contributions increased from £46 million in 1989 to £93 million in 1996.  To date self-employed people have contributed £587 million to the social insurance fund.  The scheme is working well and funds are available to improve benefits.</P>
      <P>Two priority areas for improvement are as follows: extending the benefits to include occupational injury benefit and invalidity pension. Contract workers on building sites must have cover for occupational injury and fishermen and farmers should also be covered as should other categories of self-employed people; and providing pensions for those who were over 56 years of age when they were brought into the system.  Since they have less than ten years' contributions, they cannot receive old age pensions unless previously insured.  The Government, notwithstanding the success of this cash rich scheme, has failed to take the steps necessary and feasible.  Instead, it raided the scheme, and took cash from it to gain electoral popularity in this election years.  This scandalous and highly irresponsible action is one of the hallmarks of this rainbow coalition.  The addition of maternity benefit to the scheme is welcome but, as the Minister knows, is a relatively inexpensive addition.</P>
      <P>This was a year when the Government could have advanced the date for the payment of increases in social welfare to 6 April in line with the new tax year.  With an unprecedented cash income, this was the year to make a once-off investment to bring forward the increased payments from mid June.  However, the Government decided against this option.  It was Fine Gael and Labour during the coalition Government of the mid 1980's who, when short of cash to balance the budget, put the date of payment of increases back to late autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil brought the date back to July and later this Government brought it back to June. Widows, unemployed people and thousands of pensioners expected that the pay date for increases would be restored this year to April but alas, more disappointment for them.  It may be a good year but not for those who depend on social <Col N="1559" /> welfare.  This is another missed opportunity by the Minister which affects 1.4 million people.</P>
    <P>The increases for widows, those on disability allowance and long-term unemployed people, especially if they have families, are much less than the Government claims.  For instance, a widow on a contributory pension with three children gets an increase of only 2.5 per cent.  Similarly, a person on disability allowance with a dependant spouse and three children gets an increase of 2.9 per cent while a person who is long-term unemployed gets 3.2 per cent.  The larger the family, the smaller the percentage increase.  The Minister likes to talk about personal rates which are the highest rates, but not about the adult dependant or children.  A widow with five children will only get an increase of 1.9 per cent in her widow's pension.</P>
    <P>I tell families not to heed the rhetoric because the rainbow coalition does not care.  It gives me no pleasure to recall the appalling financial irresponsibility of the 1983-7 coalition which brought the country to the verge of bankruptcy.  The dire state of the nation's finances in 1987 was successfully tackled over the period 1987 to 1994 because of the political courage of Fianna Fáil led Governments.  Ultimately, these Fianna Fáil Administrations succeeded in retrieving the State's financial viability because of the willingness of the people in every sector of our society to accept temporary sacrifices to secure the long-term good.</P>
    <P>It took a great deal of hard work to bring about the current prosperity which was built on good strategy, work and a good relationship with the social partners set up under a Fianna Fáil Government.  That partnership is the basis for the present low interest rates, cheap mortgages, low inflation and excellent growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>However, under the rainbow coalition, the partnership is doing little to tackle the main problems facing our society, including social deprivation, long-term unemployment and spiralling crime, particularly the increasing levels of drug abuse.  Those in need &mdash; for example, the long-term unemployed &mdash; have only one opportunity each year to achieve a change in the payments they receive from the State, namely the budget. In contrast, an employed person can perhaps look forward to three routes through which his general well-being may be enhanced, namely Partnership 2000 pay increases, tax and PRSI changes in the recent budget and annual salary increments.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, interesting to note that income distribution under the rainbow coalition <i>via</i> three budgets, two years of the PCW and one year of Partnership 2000 will do little for people who are most in need.  One only need examine some figures to realise how this Government has failed to fulfil its social obligations.  According to CORI, a single person will be £338 a year better off if long-term unemployed while a person earning £20,000 will be £1,763 better off and a person earning £40,000 will be £2,532 better off.  That makes <Col N="1560" /> stark reading.  So much for the rainbow coalition's idea of social partnership.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the famous dirty dozen, the bulk of which were long gone before he came into office.  If one reads the booklet on how to qualify for the old age contributory pensions one will see that a person needs to be over 66 years of age and satisfy PSRI contributions, that is, 156 PRSI paid contributions.  The Minister said that in future a person will need 520 or ten years paid contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of the Department of Social Welfare is to look after the less well off &mdash; the unemployed, the unemployable, the poor and pensioners.  Although the economy is doing well the greatest blackspot is unemployment.  I will not criticise the increases because it is the Minister's function to provide increases in the budget, in line with inflation, to old age pensioners and the unemployed.  However, the increases were small.  As my party has been preaching for many years, there is a remedy which I will outline.</P>
      <P>An expanding economy should mean less pressure on the welfare budget.  When the economy is expanding, employment should be expanding and when the numbers at work are rising the numbers out of work should be decreasing, even allowing for an increase in the labour force. When one considers that unemployment payments account for more than one quarter of the welfare budget, the message is clear.  Economic growth and falling unemployment should yield huge savings to the Exchequer.  It is estimated that for every 1,000 people who leave the live register the Exchequer saves £3.5 million per year, before taking into account the extra taxation that will be collected when people start to work.  That does not seem to be the case in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total spending on social welfare has risen by almost 40 per cent or £1.2 billion during the past five years.  This should have been sufficient to fund generous increases in the rates of benefit <Col N="1561" /> payable to most welfare recipients.  For the most part, that has not been the case.  Mass unemployment lays claim to £1 billion in the social welfare budget each year.  If a fraction of this was available for distribution to other welfare recipients, we could bring about a real improvement in their standard of living.  Ireland is probably unique in combining rapid economic growth with mass unemployment.  This appears to defy all the laws of economic logic.</P>
    <P>When the rainbow coalition came to power two and a half years ago there were 272,000 registered as unemployed.  Following the most rapid economic expansion ever, the figures are almost unchanged today.  It seems we have succeeded in translating economic growth into higher employment. The numbers at work are on the increase but why is it that we are unable to translate economic growth into lower unemployment?</P>
    <P>Tax is the key issue.  A typical worker is taxed four times on his or her income.  He or she pays income tax, PRSI, training and health levies.  This places a heavy burden on the average worker and means that those on modest wages pay high rates of tax.  A single man on £200 per week pays approximately £43 per week in tax and PRSI.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem in relation to the higher rate of tax.  In other countries workers are taxed at the higher rate only if they fall into the higher income bracket.  That is not the case here. A worker is hit at the higher rate of 48 per cent when his or her earnings go above £262 per week, which is well under the average industrial wage. It is hardly a fortune.  He or she is also caught for PRSI, training and health levies.  This means that if he or she receives a pay rise of £10 per week or £10 in overtime, the Government will take £5.50.  It cannot be right that the Government should receive more than the man or woman concerned.</P>
    <P>The system of taxation is a disincentive to work.  Throughout the country one hears the same refrain from unemployed persons: &ldquo;Why should I go out to work when I am just as well off on the dole?&rdquo;  Nobody is saying that benefits should be reduced but everybody recognises that taxes should be.  We need to focus on employees' and employers' PRSI as well as income tax.  In simple terms, we must make it worthwhile for the unemployed to take up employment and for firms to create it.  Unless we are prepared to tackle this issue in a radical way, we will never be able to deal seriously with the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>We must look at the system of public administration. Many years ago we had a network of labour exchanges, as they were then known, but we have reached the stage where no labour is exchanged in these centres.  We have two arms of State doing different jobs.  The Department of Social Welfare is concerned with registering individuals as unemployed and paying them benefits as efficiently as possible, while the unemployment services division of FÁS is concerned with helping them to find work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> The upshot of this is that the basic regulations are no longer being properly enforced.  To qualify for the dole a person must be available for and actively seeking work but the Department of Social Welfare has made little or no effort to ensure this is the case.  We should not be too shocked at the findings of the CSO report published last year which showed there was massive abuse of the system.  In the 12 weeks after the report was published approximately 25,000 people stopped signing on.  There is still a huge gap, however, between unemployment as measured by the live register and that measured by the labour force survey.  The difference between the two figures is approximately 80,000.</P>
    <P>The system is not fair to the taxpayer or the unemployed.  The Government has a duty to the taxpayer to ensure money is properly spent and to the unemployed to ensure their needs are properly met, but that is not happening.  We need a single agency, a national employment service, to meet the needs of the unemployed, from benefit payments to assistance, in searching for jobs.  This agency should provide a professional service and treat the unemployed as its clients.  Its success should be measured by the number of people it places in paid employment.  I understand the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is working on this idea as part of the White Paper.  Will we see this document before the forthcoming general election?</P>
    <P>The White Paper should also deal with issues such as training and education.  It is clear that we have considerable problems to contend with in this area.  Even though there are almost 300,000 people out of work, there is increasing evidence that firms are unable to fill vacancies when they arise because of the low wages on offer but it is hardly the full answer.  This week ISME, the small and medium enterprises body, published a report on the way the jobs market is operating.  It points out that there are skills shortages and companies are finding it difficult to fill vacancies in high-tech areas such as the computer industry.  It seems strange that this is the case.  After all, the IDA is trying to attract high-tech industries while FÁS is spending £150 million per year in training individuals to take up jobs which are becoming available in industry.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;misfits&rdquo; is used in the report to describe certain sections of the unemployed.  I disagree strongly with this.  The unemployed are no different from the rest of us.  The vast majority are willing to work and we must do everything we can to help them find suitable job opportunities. The use of emotive language is not helpful at this time.</P>
    <P>The issue of unemployment and training must be addressed by the Government.  It makes no sense to have hundreds of thousands of people drawing the dole while companies cannot find people to work for them.  The strategy on unemployment and training seems to have gone seriously wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" /> The system is costing the taxpayer a fortune. We are paying out £20 million per week in dole payments.  The unemployed are excluded from the rest of society, a marginalised group which cannot share in the fruits of economic growth.  It is better for people to be at work than on the dole as it gives them the opportunity to play a normal role in society.</P>
    <P>We have shown that we are capable of achieving much in the economic field.  We have shown that we are capable of creating jobs but we have yet to show that we are able to deal with the problem of unemployment.  There must be a shift from the welfare system to employment.  That should be the Government's number one priority and I have no doubt it will be in the case of the incoming Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation as it is one of the major Bills in the financial and social area which this House must deal with each year.  The main Opposition spokesperson's speech was a terribly long moan and groan.  The important point is that this Government has substantially reformed the social welfare code in the past three years.  The Minister for Social Welfare did not throw money at every unproductive area in the social welfare system as those who criticised him said he would when he came into office.  He reformed the system by targetting the anomalies.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on Social Welfare was published some years ago and it outlined what should be the minimum payments.  Deputy Woods was the Minister for Social Welfare the year it was published.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The progress in realising the targets set down by the commission during his term in office was minimal.  The Minister stated that contributing pensioners are now on 113 per cent of the target contribution, other categories have reached 100 per cent while the worst cases have reached 95 per cent.  I contrast that with the abysmal failure of Deputy Woods and his colleague Deputy McCreevy as Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fundamental method of examining the performances of respective Governments and respective Ministers for Social Welfare in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods continued in a rather incoherent way about the Taoiseach being in Brussels negotiating for Objective One status in structural funds.  This has nothing to do with social welfare. Whatever the Taoiseach achieves, he will have accurate figures and will not be wrong by at least £2 billion as the previous Taoiseach was.  We all remember Deputy Reynolds's famous statement <Col N="1564" /> after the Edinburgh summit when he said there was more than £8 billion in the bag.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government enjoys spending the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>He had to shake hands afterwards on a final deal which gave the country £5.9 billion.  That is how wrong he was.  This is irrelevant to the debate but I say it in response to Deputy Woods.</P>
      <P>There are a number of provisions in the Bill which I welcome and they relate to matters on which I have spoken during debates on Social Welfare Bills since 1989.  I especially welcome the reduction of the minimum contributions to qualify for contributory old age pension from an average of 20 weeks during one's working life to an average of ten, halving the previous requirement. Many have examined this issue over the years, including the Commission on Social Welfare and the Ombudsman, and all have said it was unjust. I am delighted the Minister and the Government have introduced this badly needed reform.  It is especially gratifying to see that persons with an average of between ten and 14 weeks' contributions will now qualify for half the maximum contributory pension.  Persons with average contributions of between 15 and 19 will now qualify for 75 per cent of the maximum.  Many people whose working lives have been interrupted may have had almost full contributions for ten years. Those who worked prior to 1953 lost the value of their contributions prior to that date by a legislative action of this House.  Many people worked for ten years, ceased work to go into business or raise a family and found on retiring that they did not have the average of 20 weeks' contributions to qualify for a contributory pension.  They naturally had a great sense of injustice on finding that, after the contributions they made during their working life and the contributions they made to society in business or raising a family, they did not qualify for a contributory pension.  Every compliment must be paid to the Minister and the Government for bringing about this badly needed reform which I welcome.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the introduction of a new sickness allowance for people on unemployment assistance.  If a person on unemployment assistance became ill and was not able to declare availability for work on a weekly basis he was given supplementary welfare allowance which was much harsher in its qualifying conditions.  Many people also had small means and found during their illnesses that it was taken into account thus reducing the amount they received under the supplementary welfare allowance.  Many people receiving reduced rates of unemployment assistance who became ill and badly needed that money, small as it might be, to sustain them found that they qualified for nothing under the supplementary welfare system.  Every compliment must be paid to the Minister and the Government for introducing this badly needed reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> I welcome the ending of the notorious &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;.  The Minister received a deputation led by me from the National Union of Firefighters which, along with people in my constituency working for Bord na Móna, were examples of those adversely affected by these measures in the Social Welfare Bill, 1993.  I am delighted the injustice which existed for three or four years has been removed and I pay every compliment to the Minister for removing it.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the introduction of a widower's pension, thus removing the discrimination which existed between widows and widowers in the area of pensions.  There was a pension for widowers who qualified if they had a family but it was a maintenance for their children, not for them.  I raised this on previous Social Welfare Bills on Second and Committee Stages and I am delighted the issue has been addressed so generously by the Minister.  Widowers are now treated the same as widows in that they can claim maintenance by the medium of a widower's pension as a result of the loss of a spouse.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of a 50 per cent supplement to someone caring for a second elderly person.  Many adult children found themselves caring for their elderly parents but were only paid in respect of caring for one person.  In some cases, there might have been three elderly people and I have known of cases with more than that where elderly people had to be cared for by an adult, usually a family member living with them.  It is welcome that there is now a supplement of 50 per cent to care for a second person who qualifies under the carers' allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>I propose a further reform of the carer's allowance scheme.  I raised this matter before.  Many carers, for one reason or another, cannot live with the person for whom they care.  They can live beside them or in close proximity to them but not under the same roof.  Nevertheless, they provide the same level of care as carers who live with those for whom they care.  A provision to extend the scheme to carers who do not live with the person they care for should be included in the Bill and a prescribed distance, necessarily one of close proximity, should be set in terms of where the carer and the cared for person lives.  Many members of families provide care for parents, an aunt or uncle and often full-time care for an elderly neighbour, but they do not live under the same roof as the person they care for.  While this reform would have a financial implication, the scheme should be extended to cover such carers. Those who are cared for often have to be moved at a later date to one of our welfare hospitals, homes or care for the aged homes.  That type of care as opposed to that provided by a carer involves a much greater cost for the taxpayer.  I ask the Minister to consider this proposal in the context of further reforms to the carer's allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>Another reform relating to old age contributory pensioners should be made.  A relatively small number of people, a few hundred or more, <Col N="1566" /> on reaching retirement age do not apply for contributory pension.  They may have good reasons for not doing so.  Some people who enjoy good health continue to work after reaching the age of 65 or 66 and consider they are not entitled to claim their contributory pension because they are working, but they are entitled to do so.  They learn later that they could have drawn their pension for two or three years.  Under the old rule, the Minister could decide at his discretion to give those contributory pensioners benefits backdated for six months.  It has now been changed to 12 months and that is welcome.  However, those contributory pensioners should be entitled to claim their pension benefits from the date they reached retirement age.  The Minister should exercise the ultimate discretion.  They paid their contributions and were entitled to claim them on reaching retirement age.  The social welfare code should recognise that.  If contributory pensioners claim their pensions two or more years after retirement age, their pension benefits should be backdated to when they reached retirement age provided they can give a good reason for their delay in claiming their pension, which is often an error or oversight on their part.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare should notify, in writing, persons who qualify for old age contributory pension on the basis of their contributions record and do not claim their entitlements because they may be engaged in economic activity for which they receive remuneration and may wish to continue doing so for another year or two.  Such information should be given to that category of pensioner.  The Minister and Minister of State should give this matter careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of capital allowances or an allowance for capital write-down for means testing, which I have sought for many years.  For example, farmers who applied for small farmer's assistance whose income was determined following the deduction of expenses from the gross income earned from sales, subsidies and so on, were, like old age pensioners, not allowed to make a write-down for capital allowances as one could under the tax code.  I am delighted capital allowances will be included for means testing.  I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on introducing this change.</P>
    <P>In my contributions on previous Social Welfare Bills I have criticised medical referees employed by the Department of Social Welfare.  They treat unfairly the people they examine periodically who are in receipt of disability, invalidity or other benefits.  That has been proven because most of their decisions are appealed.  They are dealt with by appeals officers usually at oral hearings.  The vast majority of decisions made by medical referees are overturned by the appeals officers.  The instructions given to medical referees may not have been updated for many years.  This area needs to be addressed.  I knew a man who was taken off disability benefit on the basis that he was able to work and one week later he died of <Col N="1567" /> a heart attack.  The instructions circulated to medical referees need to be updated.</P>
    <P>I compliment the social welfare appeals office and the appeals officers on their work.  That office is almost independent of the Department of Social Welfare.  I have some experience of dealing with the staff in that office as I often attend oral hearings with constituents.  I have found them, especially since the introduction of the new regulations which made that office more independent, to be fair and impartial in their decisions.  They do excellent work.  They do not get credit for it and often unfavourable comments are made about them, but they are highly professional, well informed and in recent years have become more informed of the realities facing the people who come before them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes to the occupational injuries benefit scheme.  The acting chairman and I represent the same constituency which had a mining industry.  Many miners in our constituency suffered from miner's lung and subsequently died.  Their widows found they were not entitled to claim benefit under the occupational injuries benefit scheme because the primary cause of death of their husbands was not lung disease but perhaps flu &mdash; that was often recorded on their death certificates.  This reform addresses that problem and I welcome it.  I am sure the Acting Chairman, who may have had as many representations on this issue as I, will also welcome it.</P>
    <P>Social welfare is not only about increases in benefit.  Increases in line with the cost of living must be given.  However, I remind Deputy Woods that the across the board increases in social welfare in this year's budget are twice the rate of inflation. When Deputy Woods and his successor, Deputy McCreevy, were Ministers for Social Welfare, I always criticised them for giving increases that did not even meet the rate of inflation.  I set Deputy Woods's record as Minister in compensating people for cost of living increases against what the current Minister and the Government has done. We have not only compensated people but have given them an increase at twice the rate of the cost of living index in the past year.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk about this Bill.  We welcome certain provisions relating to equality between widows and widowers.  However, I do not thank the Minister for that because under all current legislation, males and females have to be treated alike.  It was a remaining anachronism.  Before the <Col N="1568" /> provision was announced, I tabled a parliamentary question on the matter.  I am delighted the anomaly has been corrected.</P>
      <P>In reality, nothing fundamental has been done as regards social welfare reform in the past few years.  Some of us thought this Minister would have been a reforming Minister having known what it is like to depend on social welfare.  All he has done is tinker with the system here and there.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Connor that there is a need to look at the carer's allowance.  It should be a money saver.  If generous provisions are made for carers in the home we will not have the huge cost of institutional care, which can never replace home care as long as a person can be cared for at home.  This Minister has not seen fit to change the rule of having to live in the same house.  He has a problem with and is anathema to rural Ireland.  Anything which is common in rural Ireland and does not relate to his constituency is forgotten about or denied.</P>
      <P>Every rural Deputy knows of the common situation in rural Ireland where over the years, sons and daughters of farmers have built houses immediately adjacent to the family homestead. The houses may only be 50 yards apart and the two households interact daily.  As the members of one household get older, the young family in the adjacent house give them more care.  At all times, they preserve the independence that most old people like to retain as long as is possible.  It is a sensible arrangement.  Under current regulations, which the Minister is unwilling to change, unless either the young people move out of the new house or the old people move out of the house where they have lived their lives, they cannot get carer's allowance.  That is bureaucracy gone mad. It is about time that regulation which does not pay any heed to normal social relationships, traditions and values was changed.</P>
      <P>I want to highlight means tests.  Time and again we table questions on means testing to the Minister for Social Welfare.  We ask him about means testing and the self-employed, for example, people who may have three or four cows, which is common in my constituency.  The Minister is under the great illusion that if someone owns two cows, he is a millionaire.  I assure him that a farmer in my part of the country who, after a rigorous means test, has a net assessable income of £6 or £10 and a little social welfare, is not a millionaire.  I invite the Minister to come to my constituency and visit the islands, Connemara, Leitir Mór or Tír an Fhia to see for himself what the people there are trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael talk about enterprise and people helping themselves and sit idly by while a pound for pound means test is imposed on small farmers, currach fishermen and those who keep a few guests for three or four months in the summer. This means that unless someone can get a PAYE job, all the self-employed income is assessed at a 100 per cent rate.  The net effect of that is that the person who has done a year's backbreaking <Col N="1569" /> work, finds out he is no better off than if he sat at home for the year and did nothing.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister have any idea of the hard work involved in shellfish farming or fishing from small boats and the hazards involved?  I do not know how he can continue to assess them by a pound for pound means test.  I compliment Deputy Woods, who, during his time as Minister, recognised this problem and was dealing with it step by step.  He dealt with it in the case of the Mná Tí Ghaeltachta in one of the most innovative and progressive moves.  He dealt with it in relation to the seaweed harvesters, to whom he gave an exemption.  I have no doubt that if he had continued as Minister, this situation would have been dealt with in a reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come up with the most ingenious arrangement which makes a mockery of everything.  We have received the old, fallacious, anti-development and anti-enterprise excuse that to do something about the problem would cost money.  However, this year the Minister introduced an exemption of £6,000 per annum or £115 per week in the case of a lone parent family, which was a progressive move.  It is good because it gives lone parent families a chance to earn some money and move up from the bottom rung of the ladder.  However, surely we are constitutionally obliged to treat people equally, particularly families.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to dodge parliamentary questions I have tabled on this issue.  For example, can he explain how a household of a husband, wife and child with a self-employed net assessable income, after a means test, of £115.38 when the new rates come into force next June, is entitled to net unemployment assistance of £3.82 per week?  Next door, a family with one parent and one child, with a net assessable income of £115.38 per week, under the new rates, is entitled to assistance of £82.70.  I do not begrudge them one penny of it.  Will somebody on the Government side explain how two families living side by side, with the same net assessable income, can apply to the same Department, yet one winds up with £78.88 a week less even though there is one less member in the household?  Will somebody explain the rationale of having three people living on £78.88 a week less than two people?  It is a question that begs an honest answer.  The Minister of State looks surprised but that is the way it is.  After twice tabling parliamentary questions I elicited the correct information in replies from the Minister for Social Welfare.  The Minister of State had better explain it to the people in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Someone rang me about a means test which had been carried out by social welfare officers.  They asked me why they were being means tested because they were a married couple with one child. I told them the best thing they could do was for one spouse to get rid of the other because under our current social welfare system they would do a lot better apart than if they stayed together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> As rents increase and property becomes dearer, more and more people on unemployment assistance, particularly in cities, are dependent on rent allowances.  As we have operated the rent allowance system there is a pound for pound claw back.  In simple terms that means people are caught in a poverty trap because if they get part-time employment and earn above the basic social welfare allowance, they find there is no net gain. Somebody in receipt of £50 a week rent allowance has to get a net increase, after social welfare deductions, greater than the rent allowance before they have any profit from employment. This is the Government of enterprise and progress. My proposal is that rent allowances should not be paid by health boards but incorporated into the social welfare system in such a way that we would have a comprehensive system.  We would abolish, once and for all, the pound for pound clawback.</P>
    <P>The assessment of board and lodgings against parents' income is another issue that is costing the State a huge amount of money.  It could be abolished without any net cost and would introduce equity into the system.  We all know the reality of that chestnut.  Any unemployed young person who wants to have independent means and is living with parents who happen to work is forced by the system to leave the family home and live in rented accommodation.  They end up getting full social welfare payments while the State has to pay their rent allowance.  Is this a good use of national resources?  If this is considered to be efficient I would like to know how it can be explained.  It is adding to our housing problems.  Everybody knows this is happening.  It is putting pressure on the rented housing sector, pushing up rents and costing us in rent allowances. Everybody knows that no one will sit at home and get £5 a week if they can leave home and receive £67.50 a week plus a rental allowance, but this Government is not doing anything about it.  It is incredible.</P>
    <P>The greatest reform of all is the increase in the dependent spouse's disregard from £60 to £90 on a sliding scale.  Even though I read it several times I could not believe it.  It cannot be true.  I do not know who worked this out.  Maybe I just do not understand but, as I see it, if your spouse has an income of up to £60 and you are in receipt of a means-tested social welfare payment, such as unemployment assistance, you are still entitled to the dependent spouse's allowance which is £38.50 at present and will rise in June to £40.  When you go over £60 you lose the whole £38.50 and £6.60 for each dependent child.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he will taper it off on a sliding scale between £60 and £90.  The difference between £60 and £90 is £30.  It still means that a person will lose a minimum of £40 plus £6.60 for every dependent child, while the maximum gain is £30.  If you reach the magic figure of £90 you will lose a minimum of £10 for getting an extra £30 income, plus £6.60 for every dependent child. If you manage to get £70 you will have lost an <Col N="1571" /> equivalent proportion, one third, of that amount, yet we talk about reform and providing an incentive to work.  If it had been tapered off at £120 at least you would have received 10 pence for every £1 you earn, which is something, but to call it a major reform when for every pound you earn you are still losing money has to be one of the greatest non-giveaways of all time.</P>
    <P>This Government has been very unfair to the children of the most disadvantaged in society &mdash; those dependent on social welfare.  We have all benefited equally from the increases in child benefit.  However, it must be noted that since Deputy De Rossa became Minister for Social Welfare not a ha'penny increase has been added to the child dependent allowance paid to social welfare recipients.  A millionaire gets the same child dependent allowance increase as a pauper. That is not social equity.  When we talk about big increases in child benefit we must not forget that there has been no increase in the child dependent allowance.</P>
    <P>We should also remember that it is easy to increase child benefit because the demographic dividend &mdash; or to simple people like myself, the reduction in the number of children in the country &mdash; has meant that there is no net cost in giving more money because there are fewer children to give it to.  One reform that could have been introduced would have been to extend child benefit to students in full-time education up to 21 years of age.  This has not been done, yet it needs to be because that is the age at which parents find their children most expensive.  This Government cannot understand that, however.</P>
    <P>The reforms are more a mirage than a reality. All the old problems that have existed in the system for a long time still remain.  We will have to wait until Fianna Fáil returns to office to see major reform in the social welfare code.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his excellent stewardship since taking over this portfolio. I have full confidence in him; he is doing an excellent job, having inherited an incredible mess in his Department.  The Department is in need of reform which could be effected over a number of years.  For that reason alone it is important that this Government continues in office for a further five years to complete its programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Durkan, who is also doing a marvellous job.  Most of my representations are made through his office.  Invariably I receive immediate, well researched, detailed replies which I very much appreciate.  The social welfare payments system is complex and recipients need to have the appropriate facts spelled out for <Col N="1572" /> them.  There is need to streamline all facets of that Department, so that all relevant factors are taken into account in assessing people's needs.  I am happy that the necessary reforms, which will take some time to introduce, will be implemented.</P>
    <P>I welcome the substantial increases in social welfare payments granted in the last three budgets, particularly the most recent one which, with low inflation, will be all the more beneficial. While they are not sufficient, at least it is being acknowledged that those on social welfare are entitled to the standard of income expected within our booming economy.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is a most important aspect of social welfare.  Its recipients care for the elderly, those who handed on this State to us and who must receive proper attention.  Tragically, institutionalisation had been the norm over the past 20 years.  The trauma created for old people sent to the local county home was not fully realised.  Old people feared being put into the local county home.  Although I acknowledge the tremendous work done by the staff in those homes and institutions who looked after the elderly we must remember that elderly people have similar feelings to younger people, want to remain in the home they have built, and to be cared for and die in dignity there.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance goes a long way to meeting that requirement.  It involves a saving for the State, but those who undertake this work are entitled to recognition by the State.  Their services are much less costly than institutions and their attendant expenses.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with all of Deputy Ó Cuív's remarks but he touched on the matter of carers and the position in rural areas where many young families build homes adjacent to one or other set of parents, and live as a family unit but independent of each other.  Any younger couple in such circumstances will care, but it is grossly unfair that because they are not doing so under the one roof, they will not be entitled to a carer's allowance. That anomaly could be overcome by one or other of the young couple moving in with the elderly relatives.  Believe it or not, even if that young couple were to extend the roof of their house, making a corridor between the two houses, they would be eligible for a carer's allowance. Young people caring for the elderly should be recognised and be eligible for the appropriate allowance, an aspect that should be seriously examined.</P>
    <P>Means-testing is another problem, particularly in the case of small farmers, who have worked hard throughout their lives ending up with some little savings of between, say, £3,000 and £5,000, which sum could very easily be spent on a month's holiday in the south.  Rarely will such farmers take such a holiday, preferring to retain their savings for a decent burial.  It is grossly unfair that such savings, not easily acquired, are means-tested.  Even if such an elderly couple own a couple of cows, looking after them is therapeutic. <Col N="1573" /> Why are they means-tested?  People experience enormous difficulty making a living from 60 acres, yet an old couple with 20 or 30 acres, two or three cows and a few calves are means-tested.  It is time that practice ceased, particularly since looking after the few cows involves occupational therapy for old people.  In means-testing, rather than the Department going into the nitty gritty, it should examine people's overall circumstances, remembering that their homes are dwelling places involving no great expenditure, probably containing a radio and television, their only means of communication and entertainment.</P>
    <P>Another matter brought to my attention I should like examined by the Minister's officials is the case of those people who formerly paid voluntary PRSI contributions.  I have had representations in respect of two such people who will reach the appropriate age in November next but who will be nine months short of fulfilling the requisite ten years' contribution criterion.  I have made inquiries but I am uncertain whether they will qualify for the contributory old age pension. Having begun to contribute in 1958, now being nine months short of the relevant contributions, surely they could buy the relevant number to become eligible.  Since such contributions would have represented quite a dent in their income over the relevant period, there should be greater flexibility in assessing them.</P>
    <P>I might revert now to the family income supplement and FÁS.  Although I may not have homed in sufficiently on this, I must admit that the schemes being operated by FÁS are excellent and remove many people from the live register allowing them engage in constructive work for which there is considerable demand.  The relevant rate of pay is approximately £173 less £5 for some social contribution, leaving a take-home pay of £168, in the case of a husband, wife and four children. Yet I note that the minimum income which would render them eligible for the family income supplement is approximately £250, £205 in the case of a husband, wife and one child and up to £344 in the case of a husband, wife and eight children. In the case of the family income supplement, a husband, wife and four children would be entitled to something in the region of £250 to £270 whereas, as participants in a FÁS scheme, their take-home pay amounts to £168 only.  I have spoken to one couple, three of whose children attend secondary school, who have told me they have no social life and simply cannot make ends meet.  They thought they were eligible for the family income supplement.  If the husband was engaged in some type of private employment &mdash; that level of wage being available in many small industries &mdash; he could take on other odd jobs to supplement his income.  But participation in FÁS schemes precludes him from so doing.</P>
    <P>When the family income supplement falls under the heading of social welfare such a family is not deemed to be eligible.  If the qualifying limit in the case of the family income supplement is <Col N="1574" /> £250, surely another arm of social welfare, FÁS, should pay what is considered to be a minimum wage.  Obviously there is a conflict which should be examined.  We cannot have one arm of the Department of Social Welfare paying £250 under FIS and a lesser amount under FÁS.  This will not encourage people to take up these meaningful and worthwhile jobs.  I am aware of a number of young people who have gone into the building industry, having acquired skills with FÁS.</P>
    <P>The Ministers are doing excellent work and people's incomes have increased.  There are anomalies but I have every confidence the Minister can deal with them.  However, it will take another five years because in the previous ten very little happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>To those in the Department of Social Welfare, those on the ground, in employment exchanges and those who assess clients I say well done.  I do not have much time for the Civil Service in general.  I wrote to a particular Department in November and I had to write to the Minister later as I had not received a reply by 1 February.  That is not the way the Civil Service should work, it should be efficient and on the ball.  The best and most efficient Department is the Department of Social Welfare.  I do not say it is always right but it is the most efficient and can respond to the public.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Government to take every other Department on a tour of the Department of Social Welfare to show how the Department works, how to deal with queries, problems and public representatives. I pay tribute to the officials in the Department of Social Welfare and those I mentioned earlier for work well done.</P>
      <P>I was pleased with the budget as were most people who are in receipt of social welfare.  For the first time in many years an increase was paid which was above the rate of inflation.  It says much for the Department that 19,000 people who collected social welfare under false pretences have come off the live register.  Those who draw social welfare under false pretences are taking money from those who need it.  If more money can be saved, more money can be spent on those in genuine need.</P>
      <P>Without wishing to get into a political argument I remind the Progressive Democrats that in the west and many other parts of the State people depend on social welfare.  Irrespective of what Government is in office after the next election or what Government will be in place for the next 20 years we will not have full employment.  There will always be a need for the Department of Social Welfare and there will always be people in need of an income from the State.  There is nothing wrong with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming to office the Government has tackled some of the difficulties which had not been dealt with for many years.  In respect of child benefit, the Government has granted major increases over the last three budgets for which it <Col N="1575" /> must be complimented.  There is a strongly held view that, for many years, Governments did not look after the family.  For a husband and wife who have three or four schoolgoing children there is no such thing as free education.  Every day my children have to get a few pounds because the schools are always asking for help or assistance. We are always contributing towards the upkeep of the school, for extra teachers and so on in addition to what is being provided by the State. It is extremely difficult for the family and I am pleased the Government has recognised the problem. The best way to help a family is to provide assistance in the form of child benefit to the mother.  It is right and proper that it is paid to mothers, and it must continue, because for too long men collected child benefit and spent it on drink.  The people accept the increase has been generous.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is one area about which I am not satisfied with the performance of this or any Government.  The allowance is paid to those who look after elderly people in the home.  I do not understand the reason civil servants and the Minister will not deal with this issue and give carers a proper income.  That the allowance is means tested is wrong.  Any person who is caring for an elderly person and keeping them out of a State institution saves the taxpayer and the Government a huge sum of money.  I cannot understand the reason it will not give carers £50, after which they can be means tested.  The Government has examined the carer's allowance and is considering that a threshold of about £150 be written off.  This is wrong and I ask the Minister's officials to examine the matter before the next budget.  It is cheaper for the Government to give money to carers to look after the elderly at home than it is to put them into a nursing home, a hospital or in State care.  I do not understand the reason the Department of Social Welfare has to means test the first £50.</P>
    <P>Many people come to my clinics who are genuinely looking after elderly people and doing a good job.  Because their husband has a good job they do not qualify for the carer's allowance.  That is wrong and the Government will have to examine the matter for the October budget.  While I do not know who will present that budget I am confident the Government will be in office.  I ask the Minister's officials &mdash; they will not be going before the people &mdash; to examine the carer's allowance regardless of who is in Government.  Any person or Deputy who knows their neighbours and friends will realise an injustice is being done. We talk about the family and the elderly.  It was a tradition here that, regardless of who inherited the homeplace, some member of the family looked after the elderly.  Italy had a similar tradition and looked after its elderly.  For too long we have depended on the State to look after the elderly.  I never want to see the day when the elderly must be put into State homes.  There is nothing wrong in giving families a generous contribution <Col N="1576" /> towards caring for an elderly member of the family at home.</P>
    <P>A problem can arise when there is a dispute about the amount of money people should get from the Department of Social Welfare.  Such a dispute must be referred to the appeals system. The system should be examined because in certain cases it takes too long for appeals to be heard.  Can something be done to speed up the process?  The delays are wrong.  People should also not lose their income until the appeals system is exhausted.  Usually people's benefits are withdrawn and they must go to the community welfare officer for payments until their appeal is heard.  They should not lose their income until after the appeal has been heard and, if moneys are owed to the State, arrangements can be put in place for repayment.  That would lead to a more speedy appeals system.</P>
    <P>It is great to see people of the calibre of the Minister and the Minister of State having responsibility for the Department of Social Welfare. They understand the operations of that complex Department and they have done an excellent job.  I hope they will look at the issues I have mentioned.  A welcome development is the provision of benefits for people who adopt children. It is only right that adoptive parents who have paid their contributions should be given the same benefits as other parents.  I compliment the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Department for their work.</P>

      <P>People who are dependent on social welfare are the people who are most in need.  We cannot walk away from that fact.  Deputy Ring referred to the carer's allowance.  I support the suggestion that the carer's allowance should have a minimum element that is not means tested while additional payment should be means tested. The saving to the State as a result of somebody being kept out of an institution is approximately £450 per week, a considerable amount of money. The health board cost of maintaining a patient in a geriatric hospital is approximately £450.  Private nursing homes cost between £200 and £300 per week and patients are usually given a subvention. A proper carer's allowance would generate major savings for the State.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for subtle changes.  Section 12 provides for changes in the number of PRSI contributions to qualify for certain benefits. There is a need to warn people that they should ensure their contributions are paid and recorded. People should also be notified on an annual basis as to whether their contributions have been lodged with the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Major discrepancies have been discovered with regard to contributions paid during the 1950s and 1960s.  The records in the Department for those decades do not appear to be thorough.  Every Deputy has had problems trying to trace contributions for constituents who are approaching pension age.  That issue should be examined with a view to establishing a system to resolve the problems encountered by such people.  The fact that self-employed people are now making PRSI contributions is important.  They should be made aware of the fact that if their contributions are not up to date they will be in difficulties when they require retirement and old age pensions.</P>
      <P>There is also a need to examine the unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance schemes.  In some cases people have a great desire to go to work but there is no incentive for them to take up lower paid jobs.  While the FIS and other schemes are helpful, in some cases factors such as the cost of travelling to work make it unattractive for unemployed people to take up those jobs.  The Department should examine the possibility of giving these people an extra benefit if they take up work in their local communities for a number of hours per week.  Similar schemes exist but they are not being publicised to the maximum extent to give people the opportunity to go back to work.  Most of the unemployed want to go back to work and those who say the unemployed are unemployable are being most discourteous to people who are genuinely seeking work and are unable to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are major unemployment problems in both rural areas and cities.  Sometimes one's <Col N="1578" /> address will decide whether one will get a job. It is wrong that the area in which one lives can determine whether one can get a job.  That attitude imposes a social stigma and it must be got rid of before it causes long-term damage to communities.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides only nominal increases for some social welfare recipients.  Previous increases in child benefit were considerable but the increases this year are low.  Short term unemployment payments have been increased by £3 for a single person but by less than £5 for a married couple.  That is worrying.  One must worry about the standard of living such recipients will have. We do not want people caught in the poverty trap to be sent into the black economy.  Our unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance schemes must be sufficient to maintain people. The increases provided for in the legislation are not sufficient to meet recent increases in some local authority rents.  I worry when I am confronted with tenants of local authority houses seeking an explanation as to why their social welfare increases are insufficient to meet increases in their rents.  That is a serious problem.</P>

      <P>Look at the percentage of social welfare benefits taken by a local authority and look at the effect on recipients and on their standard of living.  This problem must be addressed urgently.</P>
      <P>The free telephone rental scheme is also running into problems.  People in receipt of pensions from outside the State do not qualify for the full allowance.  A disabled single person in receipt of an American pension of £80 per week has been told he is not entitled to free telephone rental because he is under 66 years.  Qualification for this allowance should be decided on a case by case basis, not on a global basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the eligibility criteria for companion passes.  Some people in rural areas who are not able to travel on their own have been refused companion passes on very thin grounds, to put it mildly.  An appeal system to consider such cases should be put in place and the necessary medical certification from specialists should be accepted.  I know a person who has cataracts in his eyes and who has to make regular visits to a doctor in Dublin but who has been refused a companion pass on the basis that he is not in receipt of a blind pension.  A person with impaired vision or a very serious heart condition <Col N="1579" /> who has to travel for medical reasons should be entitled to a companion pass.  The increases proposed in the Bill are not sufficient to meet the needs of people on social welfare.</P>

      <P>This Bill tinkers around with the social welfare code but does not address the basic deficiencies in it.  The entire social welfare code needs to be overhauled and the Government will not be able to do this if it continues to address it from different angles.</P>
      <P>The last person who made a decent attempt to overhaul the system was Deputy McCreevy.  It is only fair to assess the requirements at that time when there was a different economic climate.  The attack on the then Minister which followed that overhaul underlined the paucity of talent among those who mounted it.  That attack was shortsighted, dishonest and showed a lack of analysis and inability to face up to the issues.  The improvement in the economy since then has to some extent taken the focus off the need to address these issues.  Nevertheless, they still need to be addressed in a fundamental manner.  I did not agree with some of the measures taken at that time but it was an honest attempt to address the weaknesses in the social welfare code.  If we do not address these issues now we may not be in a position to do so in the future.  The Government could have availed of the opportunity in the Bill to deal with these issues.</P>
      <P>The increases in the basic social welfare rates are paltry and, in a three year context, disgraceful. Those in Government circles who recognise reality will agree with me.  Deputy Ring and others referred to the carer's allowance, which has been increased by 50 per cent in cases where there is a second incapacitated person.  This increase has more to do with public relations than giving recognition to the work carried out by carers who save the State millions of pounds but who have been badly treated over a long period. However, the attempts to rectify this in the Bill are very weak.  This is tied into other issues relating to health boards, health provision, respite places and the provision of care by the health boards.  However, it must be recognised that carers provide a very important service but are not being properly looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to a family in my constituency who are trying to build a house which meets the needs of their wheelchair-bound ten and 12 year old children.  I have made representations to all Ministers who have a responsibility in this area and who refer to their concern for the downtrodden and those in need.  The father of these children is unable to work as a result of an accident. If the family qualifies for the £3,000 new house grant it will not qualify for the £8,000 grant for <Col N="1580" /> the building of an extension to an existing house to cater for incapacitated family members.  If the State was genuinely committed to helping such people it would find a way of giving this family both grants.  Having raised the matter at every level, the caring face presented by the Government is not reflected in its actions when it is put to the test.</P>
    <P>Section 25 amends the provisions dealing with property.  In the past the provisions in this area created problems.  Many elderly people who worked hard over the years managed to put aside some money, most of which was assessed for means purposes under the social welfare system at 10 per cent.  While I welcome the decision to reduce the rate to 7.5 per cent in some cases, the Minister has only made a half hearted attempt to address the problem.  He should give further consideration to this point.</P>
    <P>This problem could be dealt with through the introduction of schemes in which these people could invest their hard earned income and be exempt from the provisions of the social welfare code.  Given that it would apply for such a short-term in most cases, there is an excellent case for doing this purely from a mathematical point of view.  If the money was invested in credit union and post office schemes it could be used to benefit the community or the nation as a whole.  I exclude the commercial banks from this proposal as I am no great admirer of their <i>modus operandi</i> or systems generally.  The Minister has recognised this problem but he has not gone far enough in addressing it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 and No. 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the process of reform of the State's legal offices, Deloitte &amp; Touche were appointed in May 1996 to carry out a review of the organisation <Col N="1581" /> and management of the Chief State Solicitor's office.  The detailed study, which was the first ever undertaken in respect of the Office in the history of the State, involved extensive investigation and consultation.  The report of the study was presented to the Chief State Solicitor in November 1996.</P>
    <P>The report was immediately submitted to and considered by Government.  At its meeting on 3 December 1996 the Government accepted, in principle, the contents of the report; the recruitment of the number of staff, approximately 20, recommended by the consultants; and that the Chief State Solicitor's office should discuss the implementation of the remaining recommendations with the Department of Finance as a matter of urgency.  The Government also agreed to the immediate recruitment of additional staff for the office to undertake duties related to the Criminal Assets Bureau, and to the provision of additional staff for Army hearing loss cases.</P>
    <P>Following Question Time on 25 February, I arranged to have the report placed in the Oireachtas Library.  Copies have since been supplied to each Member of both Houses.  Deputies who have had an opportunity to read the report will have observed that section 6, containing the consultants' recommendations, runs to 41 pages. The detailed recommendations have been considered by the Chief State Solicitor and urgent action is being taken to implement them as quickly as possible.  In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual detailed recommendations.  I am pleased, however, to report that immediate action has been taken by the Government on foot of the report.</P>
    <P>Additional financial resources have been provided by the Government in this year's Estimates to enable the Chief State Solicitor's office recruit some additional staff, implement a major computerisation programme, improve staff training and development and enhance infrastructural facilities.</P>
    <P>The detailed subhead increases will show, for example, an increase of 26 per cent on salaries, wages and allowances, 204 per cent on incidental expenses, including staff training and development, and 103 per cent on office machinery and other office supplies which include information technology equipment.</P>
    <P>Immediate action has been taken to increase staffing numbers.  Almost all authorised posts have been filled in recent weeks.  In some cases, this has been done through the use of short-term contracts where delays in making permanent appointments were envisaged.  Work on an ambitious extension and refurbishment programme for the premises of the Chief State Solicitor's office, at a cost of £4 million, is expected to commence in May.</P>
    <P>The Statement of Strategy for the Offices of the Attorney General and Chief State Solicitor under the Strategic Management Initiative will take account of the consultants' report and will <Col N="1582" /> be published shortly.  The annual report of the Office of the Attorney General will include a report on the Office of the Chief State Solicitor as well as on his own office, and this is expected to be published in June.  I will arrange to have copies placed in the Oireachtas Library as soon as is practicable in both cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that lawyers working in the Chief State Solicitor's office are entirely dissatisfied with the progress which has been made on the recommendations contained in the report?  Since they have threatened strike action, it is imperative that the Government moves to implement the essential recommendations of the report, particularly in regard to personnel, as the lawyers concerned have expressed the view that there has been a failure to negotiate meaningfully on the contents of the report.  Should they commence industrial action it is clear that, at best, cases will be slowed down and, at worst, lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined in my reply a range of steps that are being taken to improve the situation in the Chief State Solicitor's office, including a substantial increase in the provision for staff and the recruitment of a significant number of staff in the office.  Steps are being taken also to improve the information technology available for use by staff in the office &mdash; there has been a 100 per cent increase in the financial provision in that area.  Furthermore, the physical conditions for staff of the office are being improved with the £4 million refurbishment programme being undertaken.</P>
      <P>Since the report came to hand last November, rapid action has been taken in regard to its implementation. There are outstanding matters in the report upon which decisions have yet to be taken. I understand there would not be any difficulty in discussing the situation fully with the staff concerned and explaining to them exactly what is being done on all of the recommendations.  It is important that the staff understand and be supportive of the steps being taken and that their views be heard on the report and on further steps that ought to be taken on the matter.  It is fair to say, however, that the Chief State Solicitor's office, which has been neglected over many years as to its many needs, is now being given a very high priority and that, on foot of this report, we are seeing an unprecedented level of action to remedy long existing deficiencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach's latter remarks are correct, it is extraordinary that law-years in the office should threaten strike action. Perhaps the Taoiseach could reconcile that with what he said.  Does the Taoiseach accept that there is duplication and delay because of the nature of the relationship between the office of the Chief State Solicitor, the office of the Attorney General and the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  Would he agree that there should <Col N="1583" /> be a study of all three offices to ascertain the merits of any structural changes and changes in relationships between those offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably unaware of it, but such a study has been under way for some time.  A group chaired by the Attorney General is examining how we can better co-ordinate the activities of all the legal offices of the State.  That body has met five times so far and is working very actively on better co-ordination between the various legal offices and on making their functions complementary to one another.  It is only when one studies the detail of the report and the wide range of steps that have been taken to deal with long-standing deficiencies, which I have only partly touched upon here, that one can come to a judgment in the matter, and any such judgment would suggest that very decisive action is now being taken to deal with deficiencies that have existed for many years without such action being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>For a long time I have expressed concern about the lack of accountability for the administration or, as it turns out, maladministration in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in particular.  Forty-one pages of recommendations are included in this report. Would the Taoiseach agree that, while the report is long on recommendations, it is not a very effective mechanism for accountability?  Has there been any assessment in any report of the losses which have been incurred by the State because of maladministration in the office of the Chief State Solicitor?  The Taoiseach says that this is the first major report on the office, but the report itself points to six earlier unpublished reports which looked into the administration of the office of the Chief State Solicitor in 1995 and 1996.  Will those reports be published, and why were they not published before?  Did the Taoiseach have an intention to publish this report before it was leaked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable room for improvement in the administration of the office of the Chief State Solicitor.  Action is being taken on these matters.  The purpose of the commissioning of the report was to identify areas where improvement in administration and other functions of the office could be improved.  For the Deputy to suggest maladministration, which is a very specific charge to make, is quite unjustified. I reject it in the case of the office of the Chief State Solicitor and also in the case of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Such a charge is not justified, and I am surprised that the Deputy made it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This report made very specific recommendations for change on the basis of a finding by the consultants that there were major areas of deficiency and delays being experienced in the operation of the office of the Chief State <Col N="1584" /> Solicitor.  They pointed to contingent factors such as that cases could be dismissed for not having been filed on time or that criminal charges could be dropped because the book of evidence was not prepared in time.  They pointed to significant cost to the State in personal injury matters by litigating up to the end and not settling earlier.  All of these things indicate maladministration.  I do not know why the Taoiseach is shaking his head.  Has the Taoiseach been made aware of any specific case where, because of a fault in the administration of the office of the Chief State Solicitor or of the office the Director of Public Prosecutions, a case has been dismissed, injustice has been done or a criminal has been allowed to walk free?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the term &ldquo;maladministration&rdquo; has a very specific meaning and does not simply indicate that there is room for improvement or substantial room for improvement.  It is a very specific charge that the Deputy is making and I reject it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that there is room for improvement in this office and that improvement is now taking place.  This Government is committing financial resources on a scale before never committed by any previous Government to improving the situation in the office of the Chief State Solicitor.  The services of this office were neglected under all previous Governments, including the one in which the Deputy's party was involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has given a very upbeat reply, but the IMPACT trade union has been campaigning for three years for the reform of this office and for extra staff.  Given that the office of the Attorney General was reformed following the Brendan Smyth case, would the Taoiseach not accept that it is unacceptable that it has taken so long and that it is a poor reflection on the Government that action is now being taken following a threat of industrial action?  That is the real situation, no matter what gloss the Taoiseach puts on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kitt is entirely wrong in what he has just said.  The action is being taken on foot of a consultant's report and on foot of a Government decision of last December on receipt of that report.  The action which is now being taken is in no way related to threats of industrial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the unhappiness of the technical staff in the office of the Chief State Solicitor who believe that the organisation and management review contains no recommendations for the improvement of their conditions in terms of staff and career opportunities? The technical staff, the law clerks, have <Col N="1585" /> always been a vital cog in the machinery of the office of the Chief State Solicitor.  It appears no recommendations have been made to improve their conditions.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the unhappiness of the technical staff about the implementation of the organisation and management review to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to make the point that the organisation and management review was carried out by independent consultants and any recommendations they made were made on their own responsibility having assessed the matter independently.  The Government is not responsible for what the independent consultants did or did not include in their report.  That is not to say that the views of the staff will not be taken into account.  If there are matters that are supplementary or additional to what is contained in the organisation and management report, these can be considered, and staff views on these matters can and will be taken into account.  There is no suggestion that this report is the last word on this topic or that the decision by the consultants to include one topic or exclude another in any way predetermines further consideration of the matter.  It does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the existing grading structure of staff will have to be tackled because of the fact that the office is failing to hold on to experienced staff who are extremely necessary in an office which deals with such complex matters as the office of the Chief State Solicitor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that can be considered in the context of the discussions that are ongoing on the further implementation of the report and of improvements generally in the office.  It would be appropriate for matters concerning details such as the appropriate grading of particular members of staff to be dealt with, not at the level of the Taoiseach's office but through negotiation and discussion within the office of the Chief State Solicitor itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What has happened to the proposal which was put forward by the Director of Public Prosecutions that the Government should consider a unified prosecution service to eliminate, to quote the Taoiseach's own words, the absurd duplications and delays which are caused by maintaining the <i>status quo</i> in relation to the Chief State Solicitor being a solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is one that is being considered by the high level group on the law offices of the State to which I have already referred in answer to a question by Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach took issue with Deputy O'Donnell's phrase &ldquo;maladministration&rdquo; as if it conveyed some notion of bad <Col N="1586" /> faith.  Will he agree maladministration is equivalent to bad administration?  In any State solicitor's office, whoever is at fault &mdash; we are not talking about ascribing political fault &mdash; if a letter cannot be replied to within ten days, it is bad administration.  Deputy O'Donnell's phrase &ldquo;maladministration&rdquo; is, therefore, fair.  My experience of the Chief State Solicitor's office, which is considerable, leads me to the view that clerks are being asked to do complex tasks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach if he agrees that clerks are being asked to do tasks that are very complex and that they, unlike solicitors who are free to leave and are leaving in numbers, are prisoners of the system because they cannot use their skills elsewhere?  I think Deputy Lenihan will agree the real heroes of the Chief State Solicitor's office are the clerks who do work which nobody else would do for the same money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committing financial resources on an unprecedented scale to deal with the problems that have existed for years in the Chief State Solicitor's office.  I have indicated an increase of more than 25 per cent in the allocation of staff, 200 per cent in allocations for training and other incidental improvements and 100 per cent in the allocation for information technology as well as £4 million for a new building. That indicates that the Government is committing resources to this subject.</P>
      <P>The specific individual arrangements in the office as between one grade of staff and another and the responsibility one grade of staff is asked to take on board in comparison to the responsibility another grade is asked to take on board is not a matter on which the Government should decide; it should be decided through discussion within the office in the best interests of the office. In rejecting the charge of maladministration, I do not believe the improvements in the Chief State Solicitor's office will come without the full support of the staff, who have worked very well under very restricted conditions in the past.  To level such a charge at them is not fair.</P>

      <P>Definitive statistics on the level of unemployment are based on the labour force survey.  Unfortunately, labour force survey results are not available for towns or catchment areas of social welfare offices.  The monthly live register figures include data on claimants of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and other registrants classified by the local office of registration.  The live register is, howver, not an accurate indicator of the level of unemployment.  I propose to circulate in the Official Report a table setting out the number on the live register at each social welfare local office in County Kerry at end January 1996 and 1997.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give details of the role of co-ordinator to the local drug task forces; whether the primary responsibility of this position is to work with and co-ordinate the activities of the task force or, as appears to be the case, to assist the area operations manager of the health board in implementing the board's service plan.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ministerial task force report on measures to reduce the demand for drugs recommended that each local drugs task force should draw up a profile of all existing services and resources available in the area to combat the drugs problem and agree a development strategy to build on these.  I am pleased to avail of this opportunity to tell the House that all 12 task forces in Dublin are now in place and operational.</P>
      <P>The primary role of the co-ordinator is, as the Deputy suggests, to work with and co-ordinate the activities of the local drugs task force in carrying out its mandate. The Deputy will recall the ministerial task force report recommended that in respect of each local drugs task force a chairperson will be proposed by the local partnership board and a co-ordinator provided by the relevant health board. The persons acting as co-ordinators are, therefore, employees of the health board and as such the board is bound by certain requirements under the relevant employment legislation when drawing up job descriptions.  It is made clear to each co-ordinator that the most important element of his or her work in the coming months will be to assist the local drugs task forces in preparing and implementing their service development plans.</P>
      <P>I understand discussions are in progress between members of the National Drugs Strategy Team and officials of the Eastern Health Board with a view to ensuring that any issues which might arise in regard to the role and work of the co-ordinator are speedily resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy the Minister is clarifying this point.  Does he believe there is a contradiction between the proposal of the ministerial task force, that a co-ordinator be provided to the task force, and the job description of co-ordinators, which specifically states that the role of successful applicants will be to assist the area operations manager of the health board in implementing its service plan and, as an afterthought it states, that it will also be part of their job to liaise closely with the local task force.  We <Col N="1589" /> all want the task forces to be a success and I welcome the fact that they are up and running, but they require the full time services of the co-ordinator. Will the Minister agree that while the health board employs the co-ordinator, for the first couple of years at least the co-ordinator should be seconded full time to the local task force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There may seem to be a conflict in this area &mdash; I have only today seen the job description prepared by the Eastern Health Board &mdash; but in reality that is not the case.  When the recommendation to which Deputy Gregory referred was made by the ministerial group, I envisaged a person being made available on a part-time basis to perform the key role of co-ordinating the various services, which has not been done up to now.  The Eastern Health Board has advertised for an entirely new range of personnel under the title of co-ordinator.  Those people will be permanent staff of the Eastern Health Board. The board advised me that the job description referred to by Deputy Gregory is no more than an admission that the people involved will be long-term employees of the board.  It is clear that the primary role of the co-ordinator in the months ahead &mdash; we do not know how long this position will continue, whether it will be a year, two years or five years, or perhaps the problem will never be combated &mdash; will be to service the task force and report to the chairman of the local task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the matter.  However, does he accept the co-ordinator will be employed under the terms of the job description, which does not state the primary role is to work with the task force? It states that the co-ordinator may only attend meetings with community and voluntary groups that have been approved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the job description specifically states that the co-ordinator may only attend meetings with voluntary and community groups that have been approved by the area operations manager of the health board?  Surely the co-ordinator should be responsible to the task force, not to the area operations manager of the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will note that the job description also states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...to assist with the setting up of the task forces on drug misuse, to facilitate and co-ordinate <Col N="1590" /> meetings in relation to task force work, to liaise with local agencies and community groups to ascertain the extent and nature of the drug problem in the task force area, to facilitate the preparation of the development plan, building on existing or planned services in the area, to gather and disseminate information on existing services in the task force area.</P>
    <P>It also states that the local area co-ordinator will be answerable to the chairperson of the local drugs task force in the co-ordination of the task force's work.  This is a step further than what was envisaged by the ministerial group which published the task force report.  Effectively, a person will be appointed in a full time capacity by the key agency involved until the task force is up and running.  While the Garda, the probation service and the housing authority are important in this regard, the key agency is the health board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that the person involved will work on a full-time basis for the task force and not be directed on a day to day basis by the health board?  If the co-ordinator is directed by the health board he or she may not be able to work with the community. The health board may direct the co-ordinator to do other types of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The day to day direction of the co-ordinator is crucial and is probably the reason Deputy Gregory tabled this question.  For whatever reason, people in the areas most afflicted with the drugs problem are suspicious of a number of agencies, but I will not go into the background of that.  This structure was designed to allow local communities participate in a solution to the drugs problem and the alienation that exists should be replaced by co-operation and partnership.  I accept that some people would be concerned if the co-ordinator was directed by the health board.</P>
      <P>Within one year of taking office the Minister for Health appointed a programme manager to drive the fight against drugs in the Eastern Health Board area.  Therefore, it is neither possible nor desirable to separate the work of local drug task forces from that of the health board.  A local task force could not take responsibility for policing matters.  The gardaí should heed what the task force says, but they have their job to do.  For the first time ever, a programme manager is employed at a senior level in the Eastern Health Board whose only, but major, task is to drive the fight against the drugs scourge in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern knows as much as I do about labour legislation.  I am sure he will accept that, as the employer of the people involved, the Eastern Health Board is required to set a job description for them.  I am satisfied it will not cut across the work of the task force.  A national drugs strategy team has been set up on practically a full-time basis and we are seeking offices for it outside Government Buildings or a Department of State. If problems arise it will try to resolve them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 224 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the overall mid-term review of the Community Support Framework and in common with other operational programmes, the mid-term review of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999 has commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review process of the Tourism Operational Programme began last year with the drawing up of detailed terms of reference for a mid-term evaluation, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the European Commission, and the appointment by the National Monitoring Committee of a mid-term evaluator.  The mid-term evaluator's report was finalised recently and, as part of the next phase in the review process, was considered at a specially convened meeting of the National Monitoring Committee of the Tourism Operational Programme on Friday last, 28 February 1997, which was chaired by my Department.  This meeting allowed the various interests represented on the National Monitoring Committee to discuss the report in detail with the evaluator and to put forward initial views.  These initial views will feed into the overall CSF mid-term review process and will allow the Government and the European Commission to review the general thrust and direction of CSF programmes, to decide on any strategic changes required and to determine any inter-programme <Col N="1592" /> reallocations which might be required in the first instance, prior to considering changes within individual programmes.  The CSF review is due to be completed later this year.  Any changes arising from this review process which result in amendments to the Operational Programme for Tourism will be published.</P>
    <P>Although I did not personally meet the external evaluator, who is the independent consultant commissioned by the National Monitoring Committee to produce an independent assessment of progress under the operational programme from 1994 to date, he did include my Department in his round of consultations.  The Department laid particular stress on the extensive benefits which derive to the economy from tourism and from investment in the sector.</P>
    <P>As to the specific subject of increased skills in tourism deriving from the operational programme framework, the training policies and strategies under the programme are designed primarily in anticipation of market-led changes in demand for overall tourism products.  CERT's general remit is to provide training for new entrants and the existing workforce to ensure a higher quality of tourism product.  CERT also provides training for the unemployed to equip them with technical, interpersonal and other skills necessary to take up employment opportunities in tourism.</P>
    <P>Targets for these three training categories both in terms of expenditure and numbers trained are included in sub-programme four of the operational programme and are part and parcel of the overall review process involving the external evaluator and the National Monitoring Committee and ultimately to be incorporated later this year in the wider CSF review process.  The desirability of reallocating resources within the total CSF both across programmes and within programmes will be considered as part of that exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the nature of tourism has changed dramatically particularly in recent years since the initiation of the operational programme?  He indicated that much consultation has taken place but given the burgeoning tourism industry, there should be a wider consultative process.  The Minister might consult niche areas which have yet to be consulted, and which appear to be adrift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Andrews that the nature of tourism has changed in recent years.  It is now seen as a major industry, one of the fastest growing in the world.  The niche areas to which the Deputy referred are well represented on the National Tourism Council, which I chair and is attended by staff from my Department. In that context, the views of the niche areas are clearly stated in so far as the consultations between the mid-term evaluator and the Department are concerned.  The national monitoring committee which will look at the report of the mid-term evaluator represents many of these <Col N="1593" /> areas and will take these points into account.  The discussion will be widened in the context of whatever talks take place between CSF and the Commission which will be followed eventually by a Government response to the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Having perused the ITIC review of 1996, would the Minister agree it said more consultation is necessary?  The ITIC and others have made the point that the status of research has changed dramatically.  Regional imbalances, which have been noted, need to be researched, as does the seasonal fluctuation in incoming tourists. It is for that reason the status of research has changed dramatically having regard to the influx of tourists and the domestic tourism market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I publicly welcomed the report published by ITIC, which is now working on the reasons for the figures and facts in its report.  As Deputy Andrews will be aware, one of the main priorities of my Department is to see that each region gets its fair share of the economic boom occurring in the tourism industry.  In that sense, the operational programme and the various incentives have been designed to reflect this following the budget.  The report was discussed at the most recent meeting of the National Tourism Council, and I await the further report from ITIC with interest so that we may read its evaluation of the reasons behind perceived regional imbalances. These perceptions are heightened beyond reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the percentage of funding under the subheadings of the operational programme expended or committed to various schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall spend at the end of 1996 was approximately one third of the total programme target.  I would not raise concerns about this because approvals and commitments in the bulk of the programme mean that the spend should be on target by the end of 1999.  There are reasons for the delay in expending funds.  For example, under subprogramme 1, the cost benefit analysis, the special Commission approval for Collins Barracks, the requirement for greater local consultation there, and planning permission for the major cultural heritage projects must take place.  Under subprogramme 2, there has been similar slowness in gaining Commission approval for the national conference centre project together with a lack of large regional projects. These factors have slowed down the actual spend but by the end of 1999, it appears targets will be met.  The mid-term evaluator's report said the Operational Programme for Tourism may be judged as being highly effective in terms of comfortably exceeding two of the three major targets &mdash; revenue and expansion and employment &mdash; and making progress in relation to the third &mdash; seasonality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>Will the Minister name the independent evaluator or would that cause embarrassment? Is he concerned at the slowness in drawing down moneys under the operational programme? He mentioned three projects of considerable merit.  I appreciate the Minister's frankness in his response because that is what Question Time is about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no secrets.  The mid-term evaluator is Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick, who was nominated by the monitoring committee.  I am somewhat concerned by the draw down in some cases. The independent product management board withdrew some funds allocated to projects because the conditions laid down were not met. It is important that those who make proposals for large or small projects clearly understand that if the conditions laid down are not complied with, the funds will not stand indefinitely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 222 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-9 makes provision for European Regional Development Fund support for a large dedicated conference centre capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates to be built in Dublin.  The tourism potential of a national conference centre has long been recognised and the first Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-93 contained provision for such a development. No progress was made, however, at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September-October 1995, Bord Fáilte organised an open tendering competition seeking interested parties to submit proposals for grant assistance towards the development of such a centre and 13 consortia submitted full proposals. These were rigorously assessed by a Bord Fáilteled assessment team and considered by the independent Product Development Management <Col N="1595" /> Board set up under the operational programme to consider such projects.  None of the applicants met the criteria which had been set and the tendering competition, accordingly, self-terminated.</P>
    <P>Following the failure of the open tendering competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal, an alternative strategy was pursued whereby Bord Fáilte, under the aegis of the Product Development Management Board, examined an outline proposal from the Royal Dublin Society, RDS, which, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for a higher rate of capital assistance normally reserved under the operational programme for public and similar bodies.</P>
    <P>Upon completion of its examination of the RDS proposal, Bord Fáilte, on the recommendation of the Product Development Management Board, commissioned an independent cost-benefit analysis which is required under the operational programme in the case of all large projects. This was undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm which was selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure. The results were favourable to the RDS proposal.</P>
    <P>The Government, having taken into account a number of factors, including the recommendations of the Product Development Management Board and Bord Fáilte and the results of the costbenefit analysis, agreed on 5 November to make a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval of the proposed development by the RDS.  The Government is recommending approval of 75 per cent capital grant aid subject to the existing financial provision for such a project in the current operational programme.  The proposal has been submitted to the European Commission for approval as required under the operational programme for projects of this scale and the Commission's response is awaited.</P>
    <P>A specific timetable for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project cannot be determined until the proposal has been formally approved by the European Commission and matters such as planning permission are in place.  There is, however, no reason to believe the project cannot be developed under the operational programme in accordance with the permissible timeframe.</P>
    <P>The potential benefits of the proposed national conference centre are considerable.  Europe caters for more than 350 major conventions each year and it is estimated that a minimum of a further 15 such conferences, representing an extra 30,000 delegates, can be secured by developing the proposed centre.  When account is taken that international conference delegates to Ireland typically spend slightly in excess of £1,000 per head, the proposed centre would have the capacity to generate additional tourism revenue of approximately £30 million and support more <Col N="1596" /> than 1,500 extra jobs in tourism.  It would also help to improve the seasonality of tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be a requirement to seek planning permission for the proposed national conference centre at the RDS before the go ahead is given?  Will the Minister agree it is seen in the operational programme as a flagship project?  Is he aware that an objection has been lodged with the European Commission by one of the unsuccessful tenderers?  Has he received any documentation on public procurement procedures and, if so, will he furnish me with a copy or place it in the Library of the House?  Will he agree that should the Commission decide to investigate the matter the net effect would be to stall or obstruct the project and in those circumstances the position is fraught with danger?  If the application to the European Commission is successful can he say with certainty that the RDS will obtain 75 per cent grant aid which he states it is eligible to apply for because of its status as a voluntary body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">

      <P>This is seen in the Operational Programme for Tourism as a major flagship project which would have the capacity to generate substantial income from successful conventions and to support a significant number of permanent jobs in tourism.  The viability of the project depends on the availability of 75 per cent grant assistance from the European Commission.  The Royal Dublin Society, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for capital assistance at this rate.</P>
      <P>It will not be necessary to seek planning permission in advance and it has not been applied for as a response to the Government's proposal is awaited from the Commission.</P>
      <P>I am aware from newspaper reports and correspondence to the Department that a complaint has been lodged with the Commission.  The relevant papers were forwarded to it last November. I have not received any formal complaint, although I understand Commissioner Monti who has responsibility for the internal market is to write to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs in respect of the public procurement procedures. I await this letter with interest.  I have no doubt, however, that Bord Fáilte, as the responsible body in this case, complied with the procedures laid down.</P>

He will agree that we are no nearer to it now.  Do the objections relate specifically to the public procurement procedures and are they third party objections?  Has the European Commission raised any questions in regard to the eligibility of the project to receive operational programme funds?</P>

The relevant documentation has been lodged.  I have not received a formal complaint, although I understand Commissioner Monti is to write to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs shortly in respect of the public procurement procedures.</P>
      <P>I am aware from newspaper reports and correspondence to the Department that a complaint has been lodged in respect of the procedures adopted by Bord Fáilte for the original tendering competition as part of which consortia were invited to submit proposals.

      <P>It is not a submission or complaint but an objection.  That is how serious it is. We have warned the Minister about the fraught nature of this proposal for the RDS as a conference centre.  I have said and will continue to say with the greatest of respect to Bord Fáilte that it is in error on this matter.</P>
      <P>God save this country from consultants and consultancies.  People seem incapable of making decisions themselves and deal with problems by sending them to some wretched consultancy outside the jurisdiction.  If we are to give consultancies, could we give them to our own people?</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Minister uses expressions such as the RDS being potentially eligible for 75 per cent European funding.  There is no certainty in that.  Can the Minister be sure that it is certain to receive 75 per cent funding?  Does he agree that complaints have been expressed in the public domain, especially by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, about the slowness in processing the application for this conference centre?  Would the Minister send some of his civil servants to Europe to find out what exactly is the status of this objection? If it is objected to, this proposal will again be delayed and we will be outside the 1999 operational programme limit.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Andrews's views on consultants and many could be bypassed. <Col N="1598" /> However, in matters as important and as serious as this, one must follow the procedure to the letter of the law.</P>
      <P>I am in no position to state that this project will receive 75 per cent grant assistance.  Under the rules and regulations of the operational programme, proposals of this nature supported by bodies such as the Royal Dublin Society are potentially eligible for 75 per cent funding but I do not make that decision and neither does the independent management board.  This is a matter for the European Commissioner and I do not speak for her.  The same applies to the independent product management board.</P>
      <P>It was a recommendation of the A. D. Little group that European moneys should not be made directly available to the Minister or Bord Fáilte for dissemination but an independent board should make decisions upon it.  The same applies in the case of the Commission.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Andrews will be aware, the reason there is such slowness is because of this correspondence. It is necessary that people be able to follow through on their legal rights.  These complaints or objections, on which I am not clear as I have not been formally presented with them, have been circulating within the legal section of the European Commission for some time.  I am anxious and have communicated to the Commission and its representative here that we should be presented with this complaint quickly so it can be dealt with.  I share Deputy Andrews's view that it would be preferable to proceed with this matter as quickly as possible but one can only do so in full compliance with the procedures laid down.</P>

      <P>The Minister will accept that it is of enormous importance for the development of tourism to have a national conference centre, albeit located in Dublin, which is probably the best location because the centre will be national and because of its size.  Does the Minister accept that anyone witnessing the slow pace of this project could not but be alarmed that we may lose out and funding may not be available?  Those who are responsible, the Minister, his officials, Bord Fáilte and the European Commission, seem dilatory in the manner in which they are handling this major project.  It is of no concern to those in Brussels whether money goes to this project or to some other in Spain or Italy.  It is of great concern to us that money is allocated and used for this project and that, at the end of the operational programme in 1999, we have <i>in situ</i> the facility which has been long promised under the operational programme.  There is a danger of losing this facility and the necessary funding.  Surely the Minister should be more active in pursuing this. He has the full support of the Opposition parties. He should be on the next plane to Brussels to find out what is the delay, clear it and proceed with the project.  He should show some action.</P>

When this matter was brought to my attention in the beginning, we separated the issue of the conference centre from the casino which had become linked with it.  The Government concluded its arrangements in respect of making a final proposal for the centre last November and a response is awaited from the European Commission.  If the Government had the final say in this, it would be under way but one must await the response of the European Commissioner because she will decide whether to accept or reject this proposal.

We appeal to him to pursue this project and get it approved.  He should contact the individuals responsible, find out what is the problem and get to the core of the matter.  Too many of these major European projects are delayed in Brussels because of the disinterest, lack of concern or lack of action by Ministers and officials.

      <P>In April 1996 Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, which are joint owners of the Gulliver system, announced their intention to seek potential private sector partnerships to assist in the development of the system in the longer term future.  As I indicated to the House on 30 January last, the work of the steering group established to oversee the securing of new partnership arrangements for Gulliver had progressed and discussions with one private sector company were ongoing.  These discussions have since concluded and a proposal for a commercial partnership arrangement is now under consideration with a view to a final decision being made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Has there been an attempt to make the Gulliver system more responsive to the needs of the industry?  I am sure the Minister will be aware that many people involved in providing bed and breakfast and other accommodation have reservations about it and expressed dissatisfaction and disaffection about how it operates. The Minister is aware the cost of pre-booking and the voucher system created considerable difficulties. Has an attempt been made to address those concerns in the context of the commercial partnership?</P>

      <P>Deputy Killeen is aware that the Gulliver system comprises an expansive tourism database which will cater for a wide range of services including accommodation, places to visit, entertainment, activities, events and other similar information.  The membership of Gulliver was optional for most categories of accommodation registered with BFE until 1994.  The proportion of Bord Fáilte registered service providers in the Irish homes category which includes bed and breakfast accommodation who were members of Gulliver fell from 24 per cent in 1992 to 21 per cent in 1993.  However, following discussions between BFE and the organisations representing the service providers, it was agreed to provide Gulliver membership automatically to registered service providers in the Irish homes category and an increase in the registration fee was agreed to include Gulliver membership.  As a result, participation in Gulliver increased from 21 per cent in 1993 to 100 per cent in 1994.  The Northern Ireland Tourist Board is a joint owner of the system and membership of it is voluntary in Northern Ireland.  Following finalisation of some matters I hope the system will operate as it was originally intended to.  It will be broad and capable of dealing with all that will be required of it.</P>

      <P>There are a number of concerns in this area including that of funding post 1999.  That will be dealt with in subsequent questions, but it is pertinent to this one.  There is a concern in the trade that the cost of the Tourism Brand Ireland initiative will be substantial.  It will have to be met from some source.  Assuming there will be reduced EU funds after 1999, State resources will have to be invested to a much greater extent than heretofore in this area and the industry will also be expected to contribute.  Will the Minister indicate how the industry will contribute?  Is it envisaged a levy will be imposed on operators?  How is will the cost of Tourism Brand Ireland be met over the next ten years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State gave a fairly comprehensive reply to this on 26 November. He said as he indicated in reply to previous questions on this subject Bord Fáilte estimated that up to £60 million per year is spent on a broad definition of tourism marketing funded by the Exchequer, the EU and industry sources. I had a discussion on this matter at the National Tourism Council in the past two weeks.  Frank contributions were made by officials of Bord Fáilte and people in the industry.  We do not know the levels of funding that will be available post 1999.  That was the subject of some discussion yesterday in Brussels where the Taoiseach indicated Ireland's position.</P>
      <P>There has been a major growth in the number of hotels in the Dublin area.  I would like those hotels, which are commercial ventures, to understand they must put their shoulders to the marketing wheel to sell the facilities abroad.  In that sense I hope Government, EU and industry initiatives will ensure the Tourism Brand Ireland concept will continue into the next century.  The stock of material available to Bord Fáilte will last for the next three to five years and it will be well worthwhile.</P>
      <P>We do not know what will happen post 1999, but we should begin to discuss that now to ensure the tourism industry understands the importance of its place and that we in Government recognise the part the industry is playing and, I hope, will continue to play in an expanded sense in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware I strongly support the sense of innovation that underpins the Tourism Brand Ireland initiative, but there is a concern that a large proportion of the £60 million per annum he mentioned may be absorbed in promoting the Ireland concept, that less money will be available for direct selling and the take for people involved in tourism could be greatly diminished or the direct demands on the industry for marketing will become so large that they <Col N="1603" /> could not be sustained.  The Minister referred to that in his previous answer.  Can he give an assurance that difficulty has been foreseen and an attempt is being made to put in place a long-term plan to address it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is yes.  The objective is to reorientate an increasing element of that spend behind the Tourism Brand Ireland initiative.  I also chair the foreign earnings committee which deals with the heads of semi-State bodies and various embassies around the world. We are anxious that the branding of Ireland will be done in as co-ordinated a fashion as possible because those people involved in business, tourism and diplomatic circles can influence the way our country is perceived abroad and the business and trade we can do with other countries internationally. We know where we want to go, but to get there we need the co-operation and commitment of everyone concerned and I hope we can get that.</P>

It is a first class product and I know the Deputy attended the national launch. It has been well received by the industry, both at home and abroad.  I hope that as people understand its implications and importance those involved in the industry will reorientate more of the marketing fund for Ireland into a more focused and concentrated expansion of Tourism Brand Ireland.  It is a great concept and as people understand and get to know it, they will back it financially.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that matters relating to the strategic management and deployment of Tourism Brand Ireland are the responsibility of Bord Fáilte.  The board's chief executive, along with the chief executives of the other State promotional agencies, is a member of the Foreign Earnings Committee, which I chair, and which also includes senior officials from relevant Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The Committee is responsible for ensuring the effective co-ordination of Ireland's overseas promotional activities.  Its remit, therefore, includes examining opportunities for the consolidation, wherever possible, of our overseas diplomatic, commercial and consular offices in Ireland Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ireland House concept is about bringing together, where appropriate, Embassies, consulates and agencies in one building to provide a single point of contact for anyone who wants to do <Col N="1605" /> business with or seek information on Ireland. Representation has already been consolidated in Ireland Houses in New York, Tokyo, Prague, Budapest and Kuala Lumpur.  The Foreign Earnings Committee has also recently agreed to the development of an Ireland House in Madrid.</P>
    <P>The Committee will continue to review possibilities for the extension of the Ireland House concept to other locations where it can be justified in terms of cost-effectiveness and the enhancement of the representation of Ireland's interests.</P>

      <P>As a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, I pay tribute to our Ambassadors who have successfully operated a trade mission in addition to a diplomatic one.  There is a new breed of Ambassadors who represent this country in a very patriotic manner.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there needs to be an expansion of the principle of Ireland House? Does he agree we have been slow in developing this proposal?  It helps Ireland that all the agencies serving the nation are under the one roof. The sooner we incorporate this concept in our Embassies or wherever Irish land is located in foreign fields, the better.  This can only be done where it is realistic, as the Minister pointed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews will be aware of the costs involved in his proposal.  There is a Government decision on this matter, going back to 1989, that where semi-State bodies are set up in countries or cities where we have consular offices or Embassies, they should amalgamate and co-ordinate their activities as far as possible.</P>
      <P>For instance, the Ireland House concept was opened in New York in 1993 and is the most developed form of it.  The accommodation there comprises the consulate, ABT, the IDA, BFE, SFADCo., Aer Lingus and CIE Tours.  The Ireland House in Tokyo, opened in 1995, accommodates the Embassy, the IDA, ABT, ABB, BFE and Aer Lingus.  The new Embassies in Budapest, Prague and Kuala Lumpur have a trade board representative as a deputy head of mission, making them, in effect, Ireland Houses.</P>
      <P>There are also a number of commercial Ireland Houses in London, Paris, Dusseldorf, Milan and Hong Kong, which involve State agencies only and in some instances only some of the agencies participate.  There are also a number of agencies sharing Embassy accommodation, for instance, ABT in Beijing, ABT and the IDA in Seoul, ABT in Moscow and Riyadh and ABT and Bord Fáilte in Helsinki.  The committee is concerned about the matter.  It is a good concept which I and the Government fully support.  In so far as is practicable, we will continue our efforts in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the progress made in this area.  How does the Foreign Earnings Committee relate to some of the Ireland Houses, <Col N="1606" /> particularly where they are part of the Embassy and where Embassy staff appear to be charged directly with some of the responsibilities?  I can understand where ABT or the other agencies have specific staff and there would not be any difficulty.  In areas where there are not specific staff, how does the promotion of Ireland operate, apart from the Ireland House concept?  Is it operational at all?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister envisage any benefits to Irish trade from the hopefully successful creation of the Tourism Brand Ireland?  I think there will be, but it would be good if the Government had a policy in pursuing it.</P>
      <P>Have any State agencies recently opened offices, for example, in New York, outside the Ireland House milieu?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is why I referred to the Government decision in 1989, which applies in this case.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Earnings Committee deals with embassies, consular offices and semi-State bodies. We co-ordinate activities where possible. However, for instance, Brazil is served from the Embassy in Lisbon.  Given the distance, the size of country involved and the cost of accommodation, it is not always possible to have concentrated promotion of Ireland through trade, industry and tourism in all the locations we would like.</P>
      <P>Obviously, industry does its own thing in so far as marketing and presentation of its business is concerned.  Where possible, this operates effectively through the honorary consular offices or embassies. We all share the same view that we should get the best results for Ireland internationally, based on whatever moneys are available.  It is in that context that we receive good reports from the different Ambassadors around the world at the FEC meetings.  I intend that we would have a report from a number of Ambassadors at the FEC meetings so they can bring people from the semi-State bodies fully up to date, who in turn can inform the industry of what is happening and what facilities are open to them.</P>
      <P>I expect there will be some benefit for Ireland in bridging tourism and business.  For instance, 400 American firms employ 60,000 people here. US business people come over here every week and do business on a daily basis.  In that context, there is no reason they should not also be in a position to help promote what Ireland has to offer in terms of tourism.</P>
      <P>I recently relaunched our honorary ambassador status whereby people in business in the United States can influence their own firms and industries to hold conventions and general meetings here.  They can act as honorary ambassadors for Ireland.  That is a bridge between business and tourism which I hope will be sustained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Tourism and Trade, through its tourism division, has responsibility for the formulation of national policy on tourism and for monitoring its implementation. The execution of this policy is a matter for the main tourism agencies, Bord Fáilte, CERT and SFADCo.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte is responsible for promoting and developing tourism traffic in and to the State in accordance with the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1931-95. Since 1995 Bord Fáilte has been restructured to secure a new focus on aggressively marketing the Irish tourism product worldwide.</P>
      <P>CERT, the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training for the Hotel, Catering and Tourism Industry, was established in 1963 with the objective of ensuring the highest management and operational standards through the provision of a trained workforce and advisory service to industry managers.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development is responsible for tourism development in the mid-west region, including development of new tourism products and provision of tourist information services.</P>
      <P>In their execution of tourism policy the agencies retain day-to-day responsibility for their expenditure and for the operation of the schemes and services provided by them to the tourism industry.  The agencies report directly to the Department which monitors their respective performance against policy objectives including overall expenditure of grants-in-aid from the Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>The main issues in respect of which the Department is currently developing and monitoring policy are set out in the Department's Strategic Management Statement, 1997-99 recently published as part of the &ldquo;Delivering Better Government&rdquo; initiative.  A copy of the statement is available in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The process of monitoring implementation of policy is carried out by the Department through regular liaison meetings with the agencies and through ongoing contact by my officials at all levels with both the agencies and the sector.  This contact is supplemented and expanded in the course of exchanges arising through participation by the Department and the agencies in other consultative and advisory fora such as the National Tourism Council and the National Monitoring Committee for the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99.</P>
      <P>Overall, I am of the view that the processes which I have outlined adequately serve to position my Department so that it can monitor effectively the implementation of tourism policy.  I am also satisfied they are sufficiently flexible and pragmatic to accommodate all incremental changes in policy that are required from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister draws a distinction between the creation of national policy and its implementation and its execution by the agencies. In assessing performance against the policy it appears the Minister and his Department are too far removed from what is happening on the ground.  There are many examples of that.  One would be the regional disparities which the Minister claims are effectively the responsibility of Bord Fáilte in terms of executing policy.  I believe, however, that implementing policy is inherently the direct responsibility of the Department.  That is one area where the problems of tourism are not being adequately addressed in this House because it is referred to as a Bord Fáilte matter.</P>
      <P>Another example concerns the inspection procedures which have been handed out to the private sector and are creating quite a lot of difficulty, as the Minister is aware.  The line which is being drawn between Bord Fáilte and the Department as regards the execution of the policy and its implementation is most unhelpful, and the problems are being allowed to grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that national policy is laid down by the Minister and the Department.  He is also aware that money is then voted by the Exchequer and transmitted through the Department to the agencies, SFADCo, Bord Fáilte and CERT.  Without these agencies the policy would have to be implemented by the Department, which could give rise to other problems.</P>
      <P>The contacts between these agencies and the Department are sufficiently common and pragmatic to deal with all of this, in addition to which, I have meetings from time to time with the chairmen and members of the boards.  We also have the Tourism Council, which acts in an advisory capacity to me as Minister, and the national monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any difficulties in respect of the inspection process the Deputy mentioned.  If the Deputy wants to have specific matters raised I will be happy to deal with them.  The inspection processes were tendered out to companies on a competitive basis and they implement Bord Fáilte's standards.  I make no apology for saying that our standards, irrespective of whether they are in a bed and breakfast or a five star hotel, should be of the highest standard and quality available.  This is the imprint which must go on all our facilities and products in order to continuously change this industry so that people will want to return here.  That is so important for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree with the last part of what the Minister said.  Nevertheless, some people say the transfer of functions from Bord Fáilte to some of the private operators has not been as smooth as it might have been, and there are practical difficulties.  Some people suggest the very standards which we seek to preserve and improve are not being adequately addressed by some private operators.  I will contact the Minister <Col N="1609" /> privately about it.  As this is a policy area, I would prefer to have his Department follow it up immediately rather than have Bord Fáilte do it.</P>

The Deputy is aware the board as it operated was unable to deal with all these issues. That is why certain measures were tendered out to various companies even though the Bord Fáilte standards still apply.  Essentially, the board's remit is to be an international marketing agency for Ireland.  It does that in superb fashion and will continue to do so in future.</P>

      <P>The concept of the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor is an initiative being led by the IBEC-CBI Northern Ireland Business Council.  The aim is to enhance the natural tendency of interaction between adjoining large cities to produce growth.  The economic corridor is seen as a way of accelerating the development of North-South business thereby adding to the prosperity of the entire island.  The corridor concept aims to tackle a range of issues, including the need for improved road and rail infrastructure and the level of contact between firms.</P>
      <P>The agencies operating under the aegis of my Department, An Bord Tráchtála and Bord Fáilte, are promoting a number of programmes and initiatives designed to encourage cross-Border trade and tourism on the island as a whole which will further help the development of business on the corridor.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that a large potential market is available to this country in Northern Ireland?  We are getting a very small slice, about 7 per cent, of the North's imports and exports.  Is there any proposal to establish a suppliers' charter for companies interested in selling goods into Northern Ireland?  If the Northern Ireland authorities could participate, it would be a North-South charter, particularly in relation to public procurement contracts.  About £7 billion worth of public contracts are awarded annually. Irish suppliers should be helped to get a bigger share of the market in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy talks a lot of common sense.  We have done a great deal of work on this.  The advantages lie with Northern Ireland exporters because the market in the Republic is larger than that of Northern Ireland.  However, trade both ways is a good springboard for doing business in Great Britain and in continental Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> A great deal of information is available for those who wish to sell in Northern Ireland, trade there or get involved in joint ventures.  I can arrange for this information to be supplied to Deputy Molloy by An Bord Trachtála.  In addition, we have also published, through ABT, a number of excellent books and brochures indicating the various sectors in which business can be conducted, giving names and contact references for those who might still be interested.  This clearly indicates the volume of potential business. We have actively encouraged these developments in co-operation with Baroness Denton, the economics Minister.  Both State agencies are very anxious to co-operate in this regard.  I agree there is a lot of potential which has expanded in recent years and which I hope will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be familiar with the suppliers' charter established by the Government procurement agencies in Northern Ireland and will have received a request from IBEC to actively promote the establishment of a North/South suppliers' charter to which my supplementary question related, although it was not mentioned by the Minister in replying.</P>

However, I can assure him that information is available in respect of the sectors in which various industries are interested in conducting business North and South, indicating the relevant contacts and personnel in order to exploit the undoubted market potential.  While it may be questionable whether that could be described as a suppliers' charter, that information is available, some of which I will have transmitted to the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Though not on any fixed inflexible basis, I meet the board of Bord Fáilte, who have statutory responsibility for execution of tourism policy, from time to time, to discuss Government policy, <Col N="1611" /> its implementation and possible directions for future policy.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are regular and frequent meetings between my Department and Bord Fáilte at senior official level to discuss ongoing tourism policy matters as well as day to day contact at all levels over a wide range of issues.</P>
    <P>Both the chairman and director general of Bord Fáilte are also members of the Tourism Council and participate fully in the council's deliberations.  The council meets at least three times a year and acts as the national forum for consultation with the industry as well as in an advisory capacity to me on tourism policy.</P>

      <P>In view of the radical changes that have taken place in tourism in recent years I am somewhat surprised to learn there is not a fixed schedule of meetings between the Minister, his advisers and Department on the one hand and Bord Fáilte on the other.</P>
      <P>The other part of my question has to do with whether the role or remit of Bord Fáilte has changed to the extent that the relevant legislation warrants further amendment.  The Minister referred to the Tourism Council, in addition to which there are the National Monitoring Committee and a number of bodies whose roles have become much wider than heretofore.  Does he agree that, in some respects, the role of Bord Fáilte has changed from being the body in charge of promoting and marketing Ireland as a tourist venue to one quite different from that originally envisaged?  Would the Minister comment on how best he and his Department can keep tabs on developments and, in particular, relate to Bord Fáilte?</P>

      <P>Meetings take place between senior officials of my Department and Bord Fáilte every six to eight weeks, the next meeting being due to take place on 10 March.  The National Tourism Council is a voluntary body comprising representatives nominated by the tourism industry and its various sectors and others nominated by the Minister.  It is merely an advisory body.  It is by no means a statutory committee and no remuneration is involved.  The National Monitoring Committee chaired by my Department is just that, and deals with matters appertaining to operational programmes.  Its first meeting on Friday last was called specifically to deal with the mid-term evaluator's report.  These are distinct committees or councils which act in an advisory capacity in respect of which there is no need for any legislative amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the adjournment of this debate I referred to the need to ensure that low paid workers have their income supplemented. The family income supplement is the appropriate vehicle by which this is achieved.  That supplement has not been addressed adequately in this debate and warrants further examination by the Minister.</P>
      <P>One question we must face up to is how national prosperity should benefit those most in need.  An example of its failure to do so is to be found in the position relating to butter vouchers when widows, pensioners, carers and the unemployed had a much appreciated benefit very much reduced.  This appears miserly in the context of the national finances.</P>
      <P>This Bill fails to bring forward new proposals such as the initiatives of my colleague, Deputy Woods, in respect of the back to work allowance, second chance education and so on.  There is need for a number of such initiatives to address anomalies in the system and create a new type of social welfare system more responsive to the needs of the late 1990s.  I am disappointed the Bill neither addresses these matters nor introduces initiatives in this area.  I am deeply concerned at the undermining of the social insurance fund which has a deficit of £114 million.  Clearly it cannot continue.  There is no way in which the system can survive the failure to put sufficient revenue in place.</P>
      <P>Pensioners still have to pay the 1 per cent PRSI levy which is niggardly and unfair.  Questions are being asked about the value of contributory State pensions.  This must be addressed in the overall context of the social welfare system and pensions generally.  Difficulties still surround the disabled person's maintenance allowance and its transfer to the social welfare system.  It is not working well and is a difficult area to address when individual problems arise.  The issue of individual pensions for adult dependants will have to be addressed in the near future in the interests of equity and fair play.</P>
      <P>Each year a problem arises in respect of those who have fewer than ten years contributions at the age of 66 and an attempt will have to be made to address that matter.  It occurs because people were over the age of 56 when the scheme commenced. There seems to be an attempt to give them a reduced pension but I am not satisfied that it sufficiently addresses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Government may have correctly identified the problem but, in seeking to address it, justice has not been done to those in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I have noticed in my time here that the annual debate on the Social Welfare Bill changes little from year to year.  The content of the Bill is different but the response of both Government and Opposition speakers differs little each year.  Put simply, the Government sets out to defend the changes it has introduced while the Opposition focuses its comments on measures the Government has not addressed. The possible exception to this process was the Social Welfare Bill introduced by Deputy McCreevy in 1992 which must have had even his backbenchers reeling in horror.  For my part I do not intend to deviate from the norm.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill for two reasons.  The first is it contains a series of welcome measures.  Foremost among these is the initiation of the <i>pro rata</i> pension.  This provision will further legitimise the social insurance system by ensuring those who contribute to the system, even on an intermittent basis, actually benefit.  There are other individual measures of note and I hope to have time to refer to them later.  The second reason the Bill is significant is it makes further progress towards rationalising what was a complex and unwieldy social welfare system, a hallmark of the approach of the Minister and the Government to social welfare. As Members we often underestimate the extent of the problem for those who do not interact with the system regularly.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's intention to establish a new social assistance payment to be known as sickness allowance for people who become ill for short periods without the necessary benefit requirements.  This payment fills a gap in the social welfare system.  In the past, people were told no payment was appropriate and that responsibility for a solution, that is supplementary welfare, did not lie with the Department of Social Welfare but with the Department of Health through the relevant health board.  I am grateful that both these problems have been addressed by the Government.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extent to which the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, has been able to proceed towards meeting the appropriate limits for social welfare payments, as outlined by the Commission on Social Welfare and recently confirmed as a target to be attained in the social element of Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already we have witnessed the impact which the rates of old age pension have had.  In some cases these are running at 108 per cent of the amount recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The result has been considerable net immigration by older British citizens, Irish people and people of non-Irish origin.  They benefit under our pension and supporting free <Col N="1615" /> schemes.  The figures are not provided by the Department of Social Welfare but by the Department of Social Security in the UK.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the further improvements in child benefit.  This is an area in which there has been considerable improvement not only since the Government came to office when for some families the rates increased by 50 per cent but since my party came to office in 1993.  Deputy Harney and her colleagues consistently reiterate that the choice facing the electorate is whether her party or mine will form part of the next Government.  She is being presumptuous but if she is right the public need to examine closely both parties' record in the area of child benefit.</P>
    <P>Earlier speakers correctly identified the key role played by child benefit and the extent to which it is relied upon by mothers.  On child benefit at least, the political record is clear.  The Progressive Democrats Party cannot be trusted. Despite the whining of the Progressive Democrats, the policy of concentrating resources for child income support on child benefit which has been a feature of the last two budgets, is continued by this Government.  This approach is in line with the recommendations of the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare and the interim report of the Commission on the Family and is consistent with the commitment in the Programme for Government and the thinking in many earlier reports.  The approach involves increasing child benefit as part of a planned strategy of reforming child income support and removing disincentives.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt child benefit is the best mechanism for supporting families and tackling poverty.  It is given to all families with children, especially large families who are at greatest risk of poverty.  It is paid mostly to women who spend it mainly on buying food, clothes, shoes and so on for the children and the household.  That the payment is universal and non-taxable and not affected by taking up employment means it has no negative employment effects in terms of unemployment or poverty traps.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an increase of £1 per child per month for each of the first two children and £5 per child for the third and subsequent children. The new monthly rates will be £30 each for the first two children and £39 for each child thereafter. This will target greater resources at larger families.  A family of three children will receive £99 per month and a six child family £216 per month from September.  Since the Government came to office a three child family has received a 52 per cent increase in child benefit while a five child family has received a 54 per cent increase. This record stands in stark contrast to that of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  In their last budgets they increased the two child benefit by a grand total of 72 pence and £1.50.  In 1991, a four child family received approximately £70 per month.  This year the same family will <Col N="1616" /> receive nearly double that amount, £138 per month.</P>
    <P>The issue of the family has long been associated with fringe right wing groups who pronounce themselves the only people capable of representing the interests of the family.  Judging by last weekend's comments, these groups continue to wreak havoc in Fianna Fáil.  The truth is, however, that families have fared better under left wing parties than under conservative parties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the £10 increase in the threshold for payment of family income supplement and the fact that from June, in accordance with the provisions of Partnership 2000, family income supplement will be payable on income net of PRSI or any other relevant superannuation payments. Even more important is the effort this Government has put into increasing the take up of family income supplement which plays a valuable role in removing poverty traps for lower paid working families.  It is of little use if it is not taken up by the families who are entitled to it.  The Government has gone to considerable lengths to increase the take up of the supplement and I am pleased the recent tax allowance certificates issued to taxpayers contained details about it.  The Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance deserve congratulations for this development.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to the changes announced in the social welfare code in the budget.  The budget had two aims: to continue the Government's commitment to reducing the burden of taxation on ordinary taxpayers while promoting social solidarity and mobility.  I welcome the reduction in the key social insurance rate from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent.  It is a particularly effective way to reduce taxation for those who need it most.  The social welfare increases will, in some cases, be almost twice the rate of inflation. Despite concerns expressed about the inflation rate, it continues to stubbornly conform to many commentators' expectations.</P>
    <P>I approve of the Minister's decision to relax the means test applying to the savings of old age pensioners. Members who represent remote rural areas are aware of the need for progress in this regard.  Two developments are required.  The first is the relaxation of the means test rules which the Minister has embarked upon.  Second, and of equal importance, we must inform older people whose savings do not amount to much that the rules hardly apply to them.  The Minister is also moving in the right direction with regard to the carer's allowance by removing effective penalties on carers which exist within the system.  The system will no longer discriminate against incapacitated people who are prevented from pursuing rehabilitation by a over-stringent means test.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill.  The key benchmark by which a social welfare Bill should be gauged is whether it makes the system more user friendly for its clients and whether its measures advance the fate of those to whom they apply.  The Bill succeeds in both areas.  That is not to say there are not issues which need to be addressed further. <Col N="1617" /> The Minister of State admitted there were and this will remain the case not only after this Bill but after next year's Bill.  I look forward to this Government introducing next year's Bill so further substantial progress can be made in the social welfare area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with much that the previous speaker said, particularly his anticipation of the 1998 Bill being introduced by the same Government.</P>
      <P>There was a time when social welfare was seen as a scheme of last resort.  It was designed for the poorest of the poor and the source of small amounts of money for people who had nothing. However, social welfare has changed dramatically in the past 20 years.  It is a now a Department which not only looks after the needs of the poorest in society but also plays a proactive role across a number of areas in society.  It plays a genuinely pro-economic and pro-development role.  Progress in the past three years in streamlining the system, introducing new schemes where necessary and improving rates has resulted in a better social welfare system and in more people, particularly those most in need, obtaining a greater share of the resources being created.</P>
      <P>Everybody is pleased the country is progressing economically.  However, it is important that when the economy is booming, or exploding as we are told, we try to maximise the resources available to those most in need.  This Bill continues our progress in that regard and I welcome its provisions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to introduce an averaging system for contributory pensions and to extend pension cover to people with a minimum annual average of ten contributions.  This is a progressive and important change because the previous minimum average was 20 contributions. The Minister of State said over 6,000 people will benefit immediately, while an additional 2,000 people will benefit annually.</P>
      <P>However, I seek clarification from the Minister of State on behalf of self-employed people who have been paying PRSI but have not managed to accumulate ten years of contributions.  Members will be aware from constituency clinics of people who paid PRSI contributions for nine years and 11 months, even for nine years, 11 months and two weeks, but who did not qualify because they did not have ten years of contributions.  Could the Minister examine the possibility of introducing a <i>pro rata</i> pension for such people?  The only benefit to which these people are entitled at present is a refund of a share of their PRSI contributions. If ten years is the cut off point, we should endeavour to introduce some assistance or reduced payment for people who have between nine and ten years of contributions.  I hope progress can be made on this matter, which I brought to the Minister's attention on previous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the decision to change the period for which backdated social welfare payments can be made.  The previous maximum limit was <Col N="1618" /> six months and this has been extended to 12 months.  It is one of the strengths of our political system, although I am the first to criticise its clientelism, that Members are aware of cases where people did not claim their entitlements on time.  I therefore welcome the extension of the maximum limit.  However, does the Minister have any proposals to cater for people who should be allowed to claim backdated payments for periods of up to three or four years?  Media reports suggested the Department intended to pay all arrears due since the original eligible date and that the proposal would cost up to £6 million.  Some of the cases date from before the establishment of the office of the Ombudsman.  I do not know if a decision has been made but we should try to be generous to people in that position.</P>
    <P>We should adopt a generous approach to the few dozen people who, through no fault of their own, submitted their application forms too late. In some cases people were unaware that they were eligible for inclusion in schemes.  They should be paid the arrears owed to them by the State for the past four or five years.  If a taxpayer was remiss in making his tax returns the Revenue Commissioners would not be slow in seeking the money due to them and if he did not pay his PRSI contributions the Department of Social Welfare would not be remiss in seeking payment.  These clients of the Department of Social Welfare are legally entitled to this money and they should be paid.  I ask the Minister to check the figures and to make provision for this once-off payment to these people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvement in the carer's allowance scheme.  While it is a modest improvement in the sense that it relates to a regulation, it will be of assistance to those carers looking after two elderly or ill relatives.  I welcome the increase in the allowance and the extension of the eligibility criteria.  However, one must look at the issue from a cold economic statistics point of view and take into account the savings made by the State in not having to care for elderly or sick people in hospital at a cost of between £200-£300 per person per week.  I welcome the improvements in the scheme since its introduction but I question if these are a sufficient response.  In the future many more elderly people will require full-time care and attention.  We can respond to this demand by building more nursing homes and providing more beds for elderly people but a better response would be to put in place an adequate carer's allowance scheme which will ensure the maximum number of people are looked after in their own homes.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, and the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, on their proactive approach to the social welfare system and on ensuring it works better for recipients. I look forward to the introduction of next year's Social Welfare Bill by the same successful team.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I wish to focus on a few specific areas rather than drift over the entire Bill.</P>
      <P>The two areas within the social welfare code which need to be addressed are the family income supplement and payments to widows and widowers. It may not be attractive for many people to take up low paid employment depending on family circumstances, eligibility for secondary benefits etc.  The family income supplement is a worthwhile initiative and should be used to a much greater extent in encouraging people to take up work.  Clearly this would involve the allocation of more funding.  If people can derive the same income from social welfare as they do from low paid employment then this has obvious implications for the economy.  A case can be made for increasing the family income supplement to make it more attractive for people to take up work.</P>
      <P>We all lament the seemingly intractable problem of long-term unemployment.  Area Development Management Limited has responsibilities in this area, while the Combat Poverty Agency has philosophical responsibilities.  However, the reality is that we have not made any tangible impact on the number of long-term unemployed who mainly, but not exclusively, reside in large urban centres.  The economy is doing well as a result of prudent management by Governments in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.  In many respects the economy could operate on autopilot as a result of the sound foundations laid during that time, yet the huge number of long-term unemployed people is still a social phenomenon. Despite the introduction of apparently worthwhile initiatives we have not made any impact on this problem, which must be addressed urgently. If the family income supplement was regarded as being in the income buffer zone a far greater and more influential role could be carved out for it.</P>
      <P>I am aware from the work in my clinic that the widow's pension is not adequate to enable a widow to look after a young school-going family, meet mortgage payments and deal with a range of domestic responsibilities.  This issue should be reconsidered urgently.  Widows who have no immediate family and live on their own have to depend on the personal rate of pension.  This is not adequate and I am very surprised the Minister did not address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 1 October last people in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance from health boards were transferred to the disability allowance scheme.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment because of the number of complaints I received from recipients who have to go to the post office to collect their disability allowance. A mildly mentally handicapped person who has to trudge to the local post office to collect his weekly payment could easily be robbed on his way home.  This is a very real risk for recipients. The Minister said he would review the arrangement. I do not know if the Department has had <Col N="1620" /> an opportunity to review the scheme and, if not, it should do so as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The social insurance scheme for the self-employed is a worthwhile initiative introduced by my colleague, Deputy Woods, when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  A previous speaker referred to the possibility of introducing a <i>pro rata</i> payment arrangement for people who did not complete the minimum payment of ten years' contributions.  The introduction of such a payment arrangement in other areas is welcome and would be beneficial if it were extended to the self-employed scheme.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance, again introduced by Deputy Woods when he was Minister, is a very worthwhile initiative.  We are all familiar with the considerable costs involved for families when elderly parents require private nursing home care or need to be institutionalised because of old age or infirmity.  The introduction of the carer's allowance was an innovative measure but, while there has been a gradual extension of the scheme, there is room for a further extension.  We should set the objective of caring for the elderly in a home setting for as long as possible.  The carer's allowance has afforded that opportunity in many circumstances and, with a further extension of the scheme, it may be possible to care for even more people in such a setting.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has failed to identify the serious difficulties faced by the long-term unemployed.  It may sound contradictory that a payment under the social welfare code could contribute to getting people back to work, but if more resources were allocated to family income supplement, it might be possible to get more people back to work.  I urge the Minister to consider that possibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Social Welfare Bill and welcome a number of the initiatives contained therein.  The rates of increase proposed in the Bill, varying from 4 per cent to 7 per cent, are welcome.  We can have many philosophical debates about the social welfare system and its impact on the economy and the labour force, having regard also to the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare, but the bottom line for the people dependent on social welfare payments is the additional money they will have in their pockets. Rates of increase close to three times the level of inflation are particularly welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hallmark of the Minister's stewardship has been the focusing of resources on eliminating poverty traps, particularly for families.  In that respect the increases in child benefit are welcome. Members of this House are familiar with the dilemma faced by many families in our constituencies in terms of taking up job opportunities or remaining on social welfare.  The significant increases in child benefit, coupled with the improvements in family income supplement, go a long way towards making participation in the <Col N="1621" /> working economy more attractive, thereby opening the door to social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Over the years people who found themselves, through no fault of their own, entirely dependent on social welfare for their incomes were largely excluded from participation in society, but by virtue of a range of initiatives, including the back to work allowance scheme, family income supplement and the significant increases in child benefit, their quality of life has been significantly enhanced.</P>
    <P>Opposition speakers referred to paltry increases proposed in the Bill.  None of us, on becoming old age pensioners, would like to be dependent on £78 per week.  There will never be enough resources.  We have never had a Social Welfare Bill that was not criticised by the Opposition because of its meagre increases and championed on this side of the House by front and backbenchers.  Such an adversarial system ensures the social welfare agenda is not forgotten in this House and that the Minister for Social Welfare responds to our concerns in that regard on an annual basis.  All things being equal, the Bill makes progress in an area where considerable ground remains to be made.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the numbers of people signing on represents significant progress which is due to a number of initiatives, including our buoyant economy.  There are now 30,000 fewer people signing on, with an additional 100,000 at work compared to the figure three years ago.  That progress is due also to the deliberate steps taken by the Department of Social Welfare in the closing months of 1996, and which continue to be taken, to eliminate fraud in the social welfare system. Prior to that we had an annual debate on whether the live register or the labour force survey gave a truer indication of the levels of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The measures taken following the study by the Central Statistics Office at the end of last year clearly indicate that there was a significant level of abuse.  Many of us in this House have met people in our constituency clinics who, when confronted by a social welfare officer, knew that the game was up in terms of claiming unemployment benefit.  That effort must continue.  Not a week goes by that somebody does not come to one's clinic who has received a letter from the Department of Social Welfare asking them to outline what efforts they have made to obtain work, whether they wish to avail of the services of the social welfare jobs facilitator, and whether they are registered with FÁS. This constant contact &mdash; I would not call it harassment &mdash; by the Department of Social Welfare in an effort to help people to find their way off the social welfare register in a structured manner is positive, and it has had the desired effect of bringing abuses of the social welfare system to light, with the result that many people have voluntarily signed off.</P>
    <P>Although a significant number of jobs have been created, unemployment remains stubbornly high.  One reason is the significant increase in participation <Col N="1622" /> of women in the workforce which is a relatively new phenomenon here, although we are still at the bottom of the European league table in that regard.  We have to face the reality that that will continue to increase.  Returned emigrants are also taking up many job opportunities that arise.  There is also a problem with the hard core of persons who have a low level of education and poor skills and who remain unattractive to employers.  A debate is raging currently between the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed and a representative of the business community on foot of a recently published report in which such people were unfairly and unjustly referred to as social misfits.  For ISME, the representative group concerned, this was an attempt to get a headline which went one step too far.  It was regrettable, but if it serves to focus attention on the problem of long-term unemployment, it is welcome.</P>
    <P>We have to question the effectiveness of the role played by the State training agency, FÁS, in trying to construct a meaningful route back into employment for in excess of 100,000 people who have been unemployed for over three years.  It raises the question whether FÁS should have its role clearly defined and whether two distinct agencies should be established, one to deal with employers' need of ongoing training and retraining for their employees and another to deal specifically with long-term unemployed people and construct meaningful courses for them.  Community employment schemes involve people in working for local authorities and voluntary organisations, but there is little meaningful training built into those schemes, and there is continuous recycling of the same people on the schemes. There is a need for innovation in the types of schemes being constructed by FÁS for the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that this criticism can be made at a time when we are facing a serious skills and graduate shortage, with the Government actively considering inviting tenders from colleges outside the State to meet demands in the telecommunications, electronics and language skills areas.  Much as we need to capitalise on the desire of employers to come here by providing the types of graduates they need, we must not lose sight of that core of long-term unemployed people, and this is one of the areas in which the Department of Social Welfare has been most disappointing over the past few years.  I hope we can redouble our efforts to make meaningful progress in that area.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the improvements in the budget for pensioners.  The previous speaker referred to the very significant concessions in the budget introducing <i>pro rata</i> pensions for self-employed people who made PRSI contributions. I would like an assurance from the Minister that the Department will adopt a proactive approach to this concession because a significant number of people have reached retirement age over the past four, five or six years since the introduction of <Col N="1623" /> PRSI for the self-employed in 1988.  They have been told that because they have not paid sufficient contributions they are not entitled to anything in return, but there is now a possibility of an entitlement to a <i>pro rata</i> pension based on an amalgamation of contributions made earlier in their working life and their PRSI contributions. Some of these people have been through the system and refused pensions while others, by virtue of their own investigations, came to the conclusion that they did not have an entitlement under the regime that existed up to now.  It would be appropriate for the Department to take a proactive stance by informing every applicant who has an entitlement that such is the case.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the commitment to refunding the pension element of their contributions to persons who made contributions over a ten year period and who have reached retirement without making sufficient contributions to qualify for a pension.  That is particularly welcome because it must have been galling in the extreme to find that one was entitled to nothing from a scheme into which one had paid and to find also that a commitment made by Deputy Woods when he was Minister for Social Welfare that the pension element would be refunded was not honoured until now.</P>
    <P>The commitment to reviewing the means test for social welfare pensions and other payments signals good intentions, but I am not sure it will work.  There is no Member of the House who is not aware of the &ldquo;broad brush&rdquo; approach of the Department of Social Welfare to assessing income from capital under the existing arrangements. A rough rule of thumb would be 10 per cent income from money on deposit, but no financial institution is paying that kind of interest on money on deposit.  It is only a matter of time before that &ldquo;broad brush&rdquo; is challenged in the courts, and any court in the land would find in favour of the plaintiff if such a case were taken because it is clearly the case that there is no such return for money on deposit.  The Minister's speech reads well in terms of intention but I am not sure that the small print of the Bill meets the objectives set out.  It is stated in section 25 of the Bill that the first £2,000 of the capital value of property shall be excluded.  It proposes that the yearly value of the next £20,000 of the capital value of the property shall be assessed at 7.5 per cent, a figure that bears no resemblance to the yield from capital on deposit.  It also proposes that the yearly value of so much of the capital value of the property as exceeds £22,000 shall be assessed at 15 per cent.  It seems these figures were pulled out of the sky.  Money on deposit does not make that much dividend.</P>
    <P>We should adopt a transparent approach in terms of assessment, taking the yield for money on deposit as that earned in the previous 12-month period.  That would be the fairest system. To say that money on deposit will earn 7.5 or 15 per cent when at present it is earning 3.5 or 4 <Col N="1624" /> per cent is unacceptable and does not meet the objective outlined in the Minister's contribution. That would further aggravate the position in terms of assessment, with which people are already extremely annoyed.  It is, therefore, a case of going back to the drawing board.</P>
    <P>There is much debate about pension entitlements and early retirement.  A concession was made in regard to early retirement for teachers and the matter arose again recently with the nurses' dispute.  There is need to consider pension provisions in the public and private sectors.  PRSI contributions at various classes meet less than 50 per cent of the entire social welfare budget in any given year.  While we clap ourselves on the back for reducing PRSI and income tax rates, a close look at the demographic structure in the future indicates that a significantly greater number of people will be dependent on the Exchequer.  At the other end of the scale, a significant number of people will enter the workforce and we should consider mandatory or voluntary provision for increased payments of PRSI to enable persons to assess their pension provisions under the PRSI system and take early retirement at little cost to the State.  That is socially desirable in that it would help solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>We must consider tax concessions for people who make arrangements through private pension plans.  I have one criticism of the Department of Social Welfare in this regard.  Where a person who makes provision for a private pension plan covering a ten or 15-year period reaches retirement age in the meantime and applies for noncontributory pension, that person is assessed on the capital value of the pension plan, its value at maturity rather than its immediate value.  It is most unfair to people who try to provide in a responsible manner for their retirement to base their assessment on a pension that will not mature for a few years.  I am aware of an interesting case which is on appeal to the Department.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the introduction of the sickness allowance which recognises the plight of self-employed people who may have paid PRSI contributions which apply only for pension purposes. I share the views expressed by the previous speaker about widows.  I regret I do not have more time to elaborate on those points.  I broadly welcome the Bill and am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the opportunity to say a few brief words on the Social Welfare Bill, 1997.  We all expected the Minister for Finance to announce in his budget speech major developments for the less well off and the poor in society.  We had listened to much hype for weeks and read in the media that this would be one of the best budgets ever because the Minister had more money than any Minister for Finance in the history of the State to allocate to the people.  In reality, however, very little was provided for those on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then expected that with the introduction of <Col N="1625" /> the Social Welfare Bill changes would be made to reflect the substantial funds available to the Government, that some of the miserly allocations announced in the budget would be increased.  At a time when much money is being thrown around by the Government one would expect that this partnership, which includes the Labour Party and Democratic Left who portray themselves as the social conscience of the less well off in society, would make major improvements in social welfare payments to the long-term unemployed, old age pensioners, widows and other social welfare recipients.  When the Government was on the Opposition benches they told us what they would do if they were in Government and said that Fianna Fáil, even when it gave increases of 25 per cent, did not allocate enough to people on social welfare.  However, the last three years of this Government have proven beyond doubt that its concern for the less well off was only on the surface because during that time social welfare increases have been much less than those of the previous three years when Fianna Fáil was in Government.  The Labour Party and Democratic Left in particular let down the people whom they purport to represent.</P>
    <P>Like myself, the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare has tried to find a solution to the problems experienced by firemen. I listened to local radio on my way to Dublin today and heard Labour Party Deputy Pat Gallagher claim that he secured major improvement for firemen.  Will the Minister clarify whether section 13, which provides for improvements in the conditions relating to requalification for unemployment benefit, covers firemen?  If so, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>For some time I have made representations to the Minister and Minister of State about firemen. Unlike full-time firemen in Dublin who earn fat salaries, part-time firemen throughout the country provide a tremendous service to the State at very little cost.  As a result of changes in social welfare some time ago those people found it very difficult to requalify for unemployment benefit and lost substantial amounts of money.  The Minister of State has taken a very keen interest in this matter on behalf of firemen throughout the country and particularly in his constituency, and I compliment him on that.  The change in this area is welcome.  Firemen who provide a valuable part time service should, like others who provide similar services, receive special recognition from the State and I thank the Minister of State for ensuring that was done.  Will he examine the social welfare appeals system, which has not worked effectively in recent years?  In Wexford appeals can take up to six months to be heard.  People are told their appeals will not be referred to Enniscorthy or Wexford town until a sufficient number has been lodged.  Are there sufficient staff operating the system?  This is a major concern for those who have submitted social welfare appeals.</P>
    <P>The disabled person's maintenance allowance has been renamed the disability allowance.  There <Col N="1626" /> are also long delays in this area.  I am not inclined to table parliamentary questions on social welfare matters.  I prefer to deal directly with social welfare officers.  However, because of the long delays in making decisions on applications for disability allowance I have had to table parliamentary questions on this matter in recent months.  While the disability allowance system is fairer than the disabled person's maintenance allowance &mdash; when decisions were made at the whim of local community welfare officers &mdash; the long delay in making decisions is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The needs of families are changing and we must respond adequately to the needs of those on social welfare.  The budget did not provide adequate assistance for those on long-term social welfare benefit.  There are still large numbers of people unemployed.  In some housing estates in Wexford not only have fathers never worked but their sons and daughters are finding it difficult to get jobs.  It is a reflection on all Governments in the recent past that we have not generated a sufficient number of jobs in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in emphasis by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who announced this week that he will seriously consider providing additional grant aid to encourage companies to set up in provincial towns.  While Deputy Woods may not agree, there has been an over-supply of jobs in the Dublin area but companies are not inclined to put down their roots in rural Ireland.  I hope the grant aid the Minister proposes to provide for provincial areas will encourage companies, particularly major computer companies that create thousands of jobs, to locate there.  Virtually every town has benefited from EU funding and put in place major sewerage and water schemes.  Local authorities have been to the forefront in providing the necessary infrastructure in rural areas, but foreign companies are not interested in locating there.  I hope the recent discrimination in favour of provincial towns will change that.</P>
    <P>The biggest scourge in this country is the level of unemployment.  We must all endeavour to generate jobs and to provide a decent standard of living for families.  There is nothing more depressing for a family than to have a number of its members unemployed.  Most parents want their sons and daughters in a work environment rather than claiming unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance was introduced by Fianna Fáil, but it is much too restrictive.  I fail to understand why there is not more flexibility in the scheme.  In the past few weeks I dealt with three cases where the allowance was refused because the carers were slightly over the limit when means tested.  One of the people being cared for has since gone into hospital which will cost the State approximately £500 per week.  The carer's allowance should be operated on a tiered payment basis.  While the system has improved in the past few years, there should be more co-ordination between the Departments of Social Welfare <Col N="1627" /> and Health.  In many cases when the allowance is refused the person being cared for has to go into a hospital or home.  If the system were less bureaucratic it could save the State millions of pounds in hospital costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a big deal of the social welfare increases he introduced this year.  A widow on contributory pension with three children got an increase of only 2.5 per cent.  While that may be in line with inflation, it is not enough.  In the late 1980s and the early 1990s everyone, including those on social welfare, was asked to tighten their belts.  Surely when the Government has a great deal of money at its disposal we should give substantial increases to people on social welfare.  We must care for those who are living on the poverty line and finding it difficult to survive.</P>
    <P>Some Ministers have tried to improve the lot of widows, but in general the benefit they receive is far too low.  I raise this matter every year during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  Widows should be given a once off decent increase.  When the breadwinner in a family dies many widows, who may have been used to a reasonable standard of living, are unable to cope on the amount they receive in social welfare benefit.  In some cases they lose benefits to which they would have been entitled if their husbands were on social welfare, although changes have been made in that area.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look at the payment system to widows and to increase payments substantially given that many are left to look after two, three or four children and, in many cases, find they are unable to cope.  If I meet a widow when I go out to canvass she will usually say politicians have no interest in her plight.  That is not the case &mdash; all politicians are concerned about the plight of widows but do nothing to increase the weekly allowance they receive.  There is a need to look at their situation.</P>
    <P>The free fuel allowance has not been increased for a number of years.  The Minister appointed a commission to consider this matter and I hope he will make an announcement before October. Perhaps there will be a change of Government and Deputy Woods will make the announcement. Whoever is in office at the time should look at the free fuel allowance.  This allowance has not been increased for years but the price of a bag of coal has increased substantially.  One could not buy a bag of coal for £5 and, in some areas, one would only get half a bag for that price.  The Minister told me in reply to a parliamentary question that a commission was considering this matter in the context of an overhaul but it is taking some time.  I expected the Minister to announce an increase last October to help people this winter. I ask the Minister to bring to his Department's attention the need to increase the free fuel allowance to all applicants.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister would have used this Social Welfare Bill to improve existing schemes, introduce new ones and make extra payments but <Col N="1628" /> he did not introduce any imaginative measures or anything which will benefit the long-term unemployed or old age pensioners.  He has increased various benefits, including the family income supplement and the child benefit, depending on the number of children in a family.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the entire social welfare system to see if a new and more radical approach may be taken to look after the less well off in our society.  We must consider crime, vandalism and attacks on the old and also the extension of the free telephone allowance and telephone watch, a system which the social services operate throughout the country, including Enniscorthy.  However, it is difficult for old age pensioners living alone and on the income they receive to find £40 to £60 to pay for this back up service.  Because of the unfortunate changes in society and the escalation in crime and attacks on the elderly, there is a need to make this service available free to old age pensioners who cannot afford to pay for it.  The Minister should consider how we can improve the quality of life for those living in isolated areas because it is a major concern for old people. After five or six o'clock in the evening, an old person will not open the door.  I ask the Minister to consider making the telephone watch system available free to old age pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Social Welfare Bill, 1997, and its excellent introduction to the House by the Minister of State, who made a forthright speech.  He reviewed the outstanding progress made by the Government in developing the social welfare system and the safety net for the poorest one third of the population.  The budget contained important developments and innovations, many of which came from discussions between the social partners which resulted in agreement on Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>I welcome the further reforms contained in the Bill.  One of the greatest fears people have is that the social insurance system will be privatised and dismantled by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  Deputy Woods has been out of step with his party in urging people to think twice about dismantling the social insurance system. We welcome the 1 per cent cut in PRSI but others on the Opposition benches, in particular Deputy Michael McDowell, have the clear aim of scrapping the social insurance system.  I have heard a rumour &mdash; Deputy Woods will be interested in this &mdash; that the person who will stand in Dublin North-East for the Progressive Democrats has an interest in social welfare, which is astonishing because that party's main remit is to dismantle the social insurance system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope if Deputy Woods is faced with the calamity of a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government he will rebel, lose the whip and refuse <Col N="1629" /> office rather than be involved in dismantling the social insurance system.  I heard the Deputy in my constituency pay tribute to workers and their employers who contribute a large proportion of the £4.5 billion to maintain the system.  The present system attempts to provide for people when they are ill, old or unemployed.  It is a system of basic human decency, yet these theorists who sit on the Opposition benches want to smash it.  This Government will not allow them to do so and is determined to protect the social insurance system.  I hope Deputy Woods will be prepared to support that call from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>It is heartening that the Bill contains many measures designed to protect the children of the poorest segment of the population.  I salute the Government for increasing child benefit rates to £30 and £39 per month.  This means that a family with three children will receive £99 per month. I am delighted that our partners in Government agreed to our demands that child benefit should continue to be increased to ensure there is adequate income support for children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases in the weekly income thresholds used to determine entitlement to family income supplement.  One of the problems is that there has been a low take-up.  I pay tribute to the officials of the Department in the centres in my constituency, including Kilbarrack, for going to great lengths to ensure all eligible families are aware of their entitlements.  It is heartening that those who take up employment under the jobs initiatives, which are playing a valuable and important role in facilitating the return of the long-term unemployed to the workplace, will be eligible to receive family income supplement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided for the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pensions to assist individuals who do not have the requisite number of contributions to qualify for a contributory pension.  He has gone a long way towards removing one of the most irritating anomalies in the system.</P>
    <P>Throughout his long working life as a politician and local representative, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will have come across many poignant cases where unemployment assistance recipients found themselves in dire circumstances when they became ill and had no option but to go cap in hand to the local health clinic to seek supplementary welfare allowance.  This is not satisfactory.  I am aware of families in my constituency who had no source of income on which to survive for weeks on end.  I salute the Minister for providing for the introduction of the new sickness allowance. Approximately 12,000 to 13,000 families will be affected.  This is one of the best measures in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be saluted also for pursuing the EU equal treatment directive to its logical conclusion.  Over £300 million has been paid out in meeting our lawful obligations to the 70,000 to 80,000 citizens with outstanding claims.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to my constituency colleague for providing for the introduction of survivor's pension. There is at long last a level playing pitch. <Col N="1630" /> This should ensure nobody will be discriminated against on gender grounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken the opportunity to reverse to some of the vicious Thatcherite cutbacks &mdash; the infamous dirty dozen &mdash; made by Deputy Charles McCreevy during his short reign as Minister in 1990-1 when he attempted to limit the rights of workers, particularly those with paid contributions.  In an appalling act of vandalism, maternity benefit was slashed by 21 per cent, from £76 to £60.  This is an indication of what may happen if Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats come together to form a far right wing coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general increase of 5 per cent in social welfare payments, some of which are still too low.  The Government has attempted to raise them to the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  There is an obligation on us to ensure the most deprived sections of the population are protected.  Those politicians who wish to dismantle the social insurance system for spurious, selfish and monetary or fiscal reasons must be resisted at every turn and must not get their hands on the levers of power, either on their own or with somebody else.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, for bringing forward this excellent Bill.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, on contributing to the process.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on a number of matters of concern to me.  An attack has been made on the long-term unemployed.  This is based on false information and a lack of understanding.  It has been suggested that those who fall into this category do not want to work.  In many instances, because the wages on offer are so low they would be better off remaining on the dole.  Ridiculous pay rates are on offer for some of the jobs being advertised throughout the city and the rest of the country.  It is an insult to offer such rates for 40 hours work.  Households would have no option but to seek supplementary welfare allowance because of their inability to survive.</P>
      <P>Small businesses which employ young people at low pay rates are being subsidised by the State, yet they complain when long-term unemployed persons refuse to take up offers of employment. Because pay rates are so low some have no option but to avoid paying tax, if at all possible. This matter was addressed in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many unemployed persons cannot afford to buy television licences.  Some have ended up in Mountjoy Prison for the non-payment of fines as a consequence.  Many unemployed people cannot afford television licences and some are sent to Mountjoy Prison for non-payment of fines imposed as a result of not having them.  Long-term unemployed people do not have money management skills because they have limited resources.  They cannot pay the licence because it is demanded in a lump sum, although stamps towards it can be purchased weekly.  Rather than <Col N="1631" /> fining them in court and sending them to prison only to be released an hour later, giving free television licences to them should be considered. They have no hope of finding a job in the short-term and they need that type of support.</P>
    <P>Some people who decide to live together without marrying are not recognised by the tax scheme as couples.  A support should be given to children of such a relationship where one person is employed and the woman minds the children. She has no tax free allowance in that situation and the children are not recognised except through child benefit.  The Minister might consider some type of payment paid through the child benefit scheme for people who form a relationship, live together, support a number of children and get no tax free allowance for the woman who does not work.  Extra money paid through the child benefit scheme would help and I ask for that to be examined.  As the tax system does not address the situation, perhaps the Minister for Social Welfare might consider it through child benefits.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement is an excellent scheme which is becoming an important aid to people in low paid employment.  However, the supplement allows employers to hire people at ridiculously low rates of pay.  It could be argued that subsidies often enable wage rates to be kept low.  For example, if we top up the family income supplement, employers will renege on their responsibility to pay adequate wages.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by warning many of our constituents dependent on the system now in place of the danger of the Progressive Democrats.  I warn Fianna Fáil, especially its members who have agreed to the maintenance through the social welfare system of people unable to care for themselves, of the attacks and comments of some Progressive Democrats members which suggest we withdraw payments from people not prepared to work.  That is extremely dangerous.</P>
    <P>In the past, social welfare was a transitional arrangement to enable people to go from one job to another.  There is now a new situation where social welfare is the only means of support from the day a person is born to the day they die.  A person may spend their entire life on social welfare. It is a means for survival whereas, in the past, it was an aid from one job to another or during temporary unemployment.  Any attempt to dismantle the system is an attack on people who have no future or means of support.  Imagine the horrendous situation if payments were withdrawn from people accused of not wanting to work. Withdrawing payments is no means of solving that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the last speaker's contribution.  It was not coherent but I heard him suggest that some people in Fianna Fáil were hostile to the long-term unemployed or those who could not get a job.  This is the usual cheap shot at Fianna Fáil from a party which has <Col N="1632" /> delivered little for the unemployed in the past three budgets.  I recall it was Fianna Fáil which introduced social welfare and that it was my esteemed colleague, Charlie Haughey, who established it properly.</P>

      <P>The weakest people, widows, old age pensioners and the long-term unemployed, have fared badly in the past three budgets.  They received an approximate cumulative increase of £2.20 per week, which is small.  The great left wing of this Government comprising Democratic Left and the Labour Party, which occasionally claims to be left, has delivered little.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the left wing, which appears to be in control on most issues and occasions, has failed miserably on this occasion.</P>
      <P>This country is enjoying the best economic climate for some time.  This was earned the hard way.  Difficult decisions had to be taken.  It is recognised by most people that Fianna Fáil in 1987 had to take difficult and hard decisions. When the weaker sections of the community saw that the country was doing well, they expected to do better.  They were disappointed.  At a time when the economy is going well &mdash; I would not say it is a boom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the problem.  The Government is already spending money it does not have.  It thinks the boom will last forever.  We created it, the Government will spend it and we will pick up the tab.  Taxpayers would not have begrudged the weaker sections in our community that little bit extra.  That is an opinion shared by most people.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the budget, I received a letter from an 84-year-old-man.  He asked me, having listened to various political broadcasts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not and he even had the stupidity at one stage to support the Labour Party.  I do not know whether he has seen the <Col N="1633" /> light but one could judge from the letter who he will vote for in the next election.</P>
      <P>He asked how much extra money he got in the recent budget in personal allowance, free fuel, free electricity, free television licence, free telephone rental and living alone allowance.  It was difficult to respond because the only change was a slight increase in his personal allowance.  The other five areas mentioned were unchanged.  It is a sad reflection on a Government which had access to a fine set of books and a little surplus money when an 84 year-old man must write such a letter.</P>
      <P>I recently welcomed the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, to beautiful new offices in Wexford. They are state of the art and custom built.  The staff are customer friendly and those who call to the office are afforded privacy.  I compliment the Department of Social Welfare on the provision of those offices.  They were built during the term of this Government, but we committed the moneys for the building when we were in Government.  I noted a Freudian slip by the Minister of State.  He forgot to mention people other than Government Ministers were involved in work to ensure the provision of those offices.  Senator D'Arcy was also disappointed about that.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be parochial, but I wish to refer to the social welfare office in New Ross.  The person in that office is providing the best service possible within the limits of the scarce resources provided.  The Minister of State should note that the social welfare facility in New Ross has two offices and a long counter at which people must bare their souls.  On a wet day the queue is long. People must reveal all without privacy and the community may know their business the next day. That is unacceptable.  Privacy must be respected. It must be provided in New Ross.  The girl in the New Ross office, Marianne, is doing an excellent job, but sufficient resources must be provided to ensure she is able to provide a service in a manner that will guarantee people the respect they deserve.  Most people who are unemployed, through no fault of their own, are forced to conduct their business without privacy.  The least they are entitled to is to say their piece in privacy.  I know the Minister of State appreciates the need for privacy in such offices.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State consider granting free travel to retired people aged between 60 and 66, people in receipt of disability allowance and widows?  Those people should be entitled to the benefits to which people over the age of 66 are entitled.  People aged 60 and over cannot get a job.  Will the Minister of State consider providing that people aged between 60 and 66 will be eligible for the benefits to which people over the age of 66 are entitled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most previous speakers referred to the issue of butter vouchers.  It is hard to understand what the Government is trying to achieve in this regard.  I do not know if the decision to reduce the allocation of butter vouchers is because of stupidity <Col N="1634" /> or meanness.  The Minister of State may sigh.  I know he is telling constituents who raise this matter at his clinic on Saturdays that although there is a boom we cannot go overboard because he believes in saving for the rainy day.  The Government has halved the number of vouchers issued. It is hard to understand the reasoning behind that in this election year.  I am surprised the Government let that matter slip because it will pay for it. The butter voucher scheme should not be about elections, they should be issued as a matter of common decency and they should not have been reduced at a time when we could afford them, if moneys were spent in the right direction and not frittered away elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Means tests are carried out by various Departments and a person could be means tested on three or more occasions.  People are means tested to determine their eligibility for a medical card, unemployment assistance, disabled person's maintenance allowance and higher education grants.  Staffs in various Departments are responsible for carrying out means tests.  There is a duplication or quadruplication of work and it should not be necessary.  If we got our act together, one staff could be responsible for carrying out means tests in the four instances to which I referred.  Will the Minister of State consider that and give his view on it?</P>
    <P>There is usually some delay in carrying out means tests because of a lack of staff.  A person who becomes unemployed and is in urgent need of income must undergo a means test and it should be carried out immediately.  Will the Minister of State consider increasing the staff in this area?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to means testing of the self-employed whom Department officials often regard as having plenty of money.  A self-employed man who is are out of work must undergo a means test to secure benefit to put bread on the table for his family, despite having made a genuine effort to secure work.  His application for unemployment assistance is means tested on his earnings for the previous year.  If he had realised he would be out of work, he might have saved some money.  However, he is penalised because he is means tested on his earnings for the previous year.  The means test should apply to earnings for the current year.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear that.  The Minister of State is smarter than I thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to an unemployed young man who is living at home.  He must undergo a means test, but he will not qualify for full benefit if his parents have an income.  That young person must move out of his home to a caravan in the nearest village or a flat in the nearest town to claim full unemployment assistance and rent allowance, but if he qualified for full unemployment assistance in the first instance he would not have to move out of home and there would be a saving in <Col N="1635" /> respect of rent allowance.  This system has disastrous consequences as it causes families to split up.  Vulnerable young people who are 18 years of age are forced to move out of home to qualify for unemployment assistance.  That system is socially wrong and it should be immediately changed. That will not be easy.  Some people will not be totally honest with social welfare officials, who by and large do good work and are very familiar with their jobs.  We must address that problem.</P>
    <P>The Government is permitting a tax on the earnings of home helps.  I note the Minister of State is surprised because he was not aware of that.  However, I am aware of it because constituents have told me about it.  A widow or a person who has some free time and becomes friendly with a person who is sick may become a home help and earn about £20 a week.  In many instances it is a thankless job.  However, it is a wonderful service.  Many people who would otherwise have to go to hospital can be kept at home.  The Government is trying to steal through tax some of the money earned by home helps.  Its scrooge attitude adopted in that and many other respects is hard to take.  I suggest that in order to keep the excellent home help service working, the Minister should remove the horrible anomaly introduced earlier this year.  A home help is normally loyal, generous and a good carer.  I know the Minister recognises that.</P>

      <P>I want to comment on the free fuel allowance. I am not sure what price a bag of coal is in Kildare, but in Wexford it ranges between £7.20 and £8.  The free fuel allowance was introduced 11 years ago at £5, which at the time paid for a bag of coal.  This has not increased since, despite economic improvements.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to understand why the Minister does not increase the allowance to cover the price of a bag of coal.  This would be a sensible arrangement.  There has been no movement in 11 years.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is important.  The carer in our community does a marvellous job.  We should encourage more people to care for people in the home rather than resort to hospitalisation, which costs the State far more.  It is good therapy for people to be cared for in their home where their friends can visit them.  Everyone agrees that carers are not paid too much.  The area should be widened to enable more people to be cared for in their homes.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  This morning we heard the Minister for Social Welfare outline the many changes incorporated in the 1997 Social Welfare Bill.  I welcome many of the changes, particularly those in the carer's allowance and the extension in the contributory pension scheme to include those with a yearly average of ten contributions.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the extension from six months to 12 months in the period for which arrears will be paid in the case of late applications for contributory pensions, I ask the Minister to extend this period even further to include many pensioners who may be two or three years late applying for a contributory pension, owing to confusion about the pensioner's date of birth.  Such a pensioner has paid his or her PRSI contributions and is fully entitled to a pension.</P>
      <P>I recently encountered a case where a small but generous contribution was made to a pensioner by the Department of Social Welfare.  I am anxious that the payment should be backdated three years because of the failure in notifying the person and in informing him of his rights and entitlements.  From the reply I received from the Department of Social Welfare, I now have no option but to forward some supporting information to the Ombudsman, to whom I have already appealed.</P>
      <P>If there was more give and take in the Department of Social Welfare, there would not be such huge correspondence with the Ombudsman. There has always been bureaucracy in the Department of Social Welfare and there is more since this Government took office.  We were told this would change and there would be a more liberal approach from a liberal Government.  They have not been liberated yet.  I have brought this case to the Minister's attention.  If he is not interested, I will pursue it in the normal manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider extending the free electricity allowance scheme to include widows and widowers under the age of 66 years. I have no doubt this can be achieved because we now have one of the most buoyant economics in <Col N="1637" /> the world.  The Minister talks about when Fianna Fáil was in office.  When we were in office, we had reached the bottom of the barrel.  Deputy Woods was one of the most outstanding Ministers for Social Welfare at a time when our economy was on its knees.  When he entered office in 1987, the cupboard really was bare.  When this Government entered office, it was an EI Dorado for them.  They are now distributing the wealth we created.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Our hard work in the management of the economy gave the Government that wealth.  There are no gold medals for the Government.</P>
      <P>At present, the free electricity allowance is applicable to those widows and widowers over the age of 66 living alone or over the age of 80. Very often, those who are under 66 have dependent children.  There are many substantial expenses involved when rearing a family, which are often next to impossible to meet when dependent on a pension.  Likewise, those under 66 years who are dependent on a widow's or widower's pension and are without a family have financial needs which must be met.  I ask the Minister to extend the free electricity allowance scheme and to bring it in line with other schemes where additional allowances are available.</P>
      <P>Since its inception, the free fuel scheme has been very successful.  Many of those in receipt of the allowance find it invaluable in helping to meet the cost of their heating requirements.  However, I ask the Minister to consider increasing the allowance from £5 to £8 per week which would at least cover the price of a bag of coal.  I also urge the Minister to extend the free fuel scheme for a further month.</P>
      <P>We have had harsh winters in the last few years and those in need have had to beg for a concession from the Department of Social Welfare. We are experiencing harsh weather at the moment which will probably continue for the month of March.  There will be a problem, as there was before Christmas.  The problem should be addressed in a more flexible manner rather than bureaucracy prevailing.  We have all experienced the inconsistencies of the weather in this country, particularly when spring and summer seem more like winter.  The elderly often have additional heating requirements.  An increase in the free fuel allowance and extension of the scheme would certainly go a long way to meeting those requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of the income limit for dental and optical benefits.  However, the dental scheme should be extended to include certain orthodontic treatment.  Orthodontistry is an important area of dental care which is being neglected. While the responsibility for orthodontic treatment for school-going children lies with the Department of Health, the criteria to qualify for orthodontic treatment under the health board <Col N="1638" /> services need to be revised urgently to include more students who need to be treated but who are not in categories severe enough.  This service should be operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  The orthodontic scheme is a shambles and no treatment is available for children with serious dental problems.  Many families are unable to meet the cost.  The scheme is not what it should be.  Some relaxation is necessary.  It is no good having a scheme in name only if it does not work.</P>
    <P>Certain orthodontic treatment needs to be included in the dental scheme for those paying PRSI.  While I understand that not all orthodontic work can be included, in view of the costs involved, the Minister should liaise with the Minister for Finance to ensure that income tax relief will be approved for those who undergo extensive work which is not included in the dental scheme.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that further improvements, similar to those I have outlined, need to be made in the area of social welfare.  The financial resources are available to the Minister to carry out these improvements.  We have a buoyant economy, much credit for which can be attributed to Fianna Fáil policies which were pursued, and often criticised, some years ago.</P>
    <P>The medical card scale will be increased when the Social Welfare Bill goes through the House. The inconsistencies from one health board area to another in operating the medical card system are questionable.  That is the case even within the same health board area when one goes from one division to another.  By and large, a medical card must be made available to a person within the guidelines.  Guidelines, however, are only guidelines and what is necessary depends on the severity of the problem.</P>
    <P>I have seen the scrooge mentality being adopted by some social welfare offices in the south Cork area.  Compared with what happens in other areas of my constituency it is amazing and I would like the problem to be addressed.  If it were not for the Ombudsman many people would go without their real benefits and back payments.  Over the years he has been of enormous help to people on social welfare.  Why has there not been more give and take in the social welfare area?  Why do we have to have recourse to the Ombudsman all the time?</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact we have moved away from the disabled person's maintenance allowance as disability benefits are now the responsiblity of the Department of Social Welfare.  That was a step in the right direction which got rid of much bureaucracy and long delays involved in decision making.  Delays were also caused by people having to cash their social welfare cheques every week.  The new monthly system is working reasonably well, but I will reserve judgement until it has been in operation for another year.</P>
    <P>Let us use the resources now available to us to make life easier for those who have contributed to our economy, however many years ago, and who are now dependent on the State for their <Col N="1639" /> bread and butter.  Some people who are made redundant, for one reason or another, attend college for three-month refresher courses in computing and other subjects.  On becoming redundant they qualify for unemployment assistance, benefit or SAA, but when they enrol for courses to improve their skills in order to get a job, they find themselves without any income because of the scrooge mentality that is prevalent.  The policing of the system is over bureaucratic.  I am aware of a number of women who were drawing unemployment assistance and then got onto SAA. Because they were doing short courses they were denied assistance and were thus left without any source of income.  There should be some relaxation in that area.  That happened in Fermoy.</P>
    <P>There is little point in telling us about the dirty dozen cuts when the Government's own house is not in order and there is no liberal approach to welfare.  I wish the Minister of State well in enjoying the fruits of the good work of Fianna Fáil's years in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare does not appear to care for pensioners because his first effort in office was to give them the price of a box of matches &mdash; an increase of £2.33 per week.  A widow receives £2.20 per week and the long-term disability allowance increase is £2.17.  The overall increase has been £7 in total for those categories of social welfare recipient. That is devastating at a time when the economy is flush and there is plenty of money around.</P>
      <P>When one talks to old age pensioners and widows one finds they are really disappointed. They thought their lot would be improved by the budget but, unfortunately, the Minister did not see fit to do so.</P>
      <P>As regards the Social welfare portfolio, we must look at the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the system.  I would have thought that over three years the Minister would have a grand plan for social welfare and that a sustainable rationalisation of schemes and a more progressive outlook on social welfare would have been taken.  The cost of social welfare is escalating but one must question whether it needs to escalate to such an extent.  While the focus has been on child dependants there has been no focus on elderly people living on their own, such as widows and pensioners.  While it may be all right for those people with children who will receive some increase, the Minister appears to have a political entity in mind, or perhaps the Minister of State &mdash; at whom I am surprised &mdash; has asked himself whether there is any advantage for him in looking after the elderly. They have not been catered for in the recent budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke about focus, ad hockery and the fact that I should like the Minister to re-examine a number of measures already in place.  It has been claimed recently that identity cards are useless unless they carry the holder's photograph.  There is plenty of evidence to suggest that there are <Col N="1640" /> groups buying, selling and exchanging identity cards, without such photographs.  While this problem has been brought to the Minister's attention it appears he has decided not to do anything about it.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be well aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General undertook a cost-benefit analysis of all means testing.  There is a means test in respect of social welfare payments, another to determine eligibility for a medical card, a separate one in respect of the disabled person's maintenance allowance sometimes entailing five or six different tests overall.  Is that not a total waste of money on the part of the Department?  Any rational observation of the system would dictate that there should be some rationalisation or co-relationship between the various bodies to obviate waste of administrative funds which could be expended more worthily on realistic increases to social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>The Construction Industry Federation monitors its pension scheme.  Simultaneously teams of social welfare inspectors visit building sites also for monitoring purposes.  Is it not time we examined the monitoring of that pension scheme and its database with a view to eliminating duplication, if not triplication, within those areas?  If the Construction Industry Federation pension scheme were to be brought within the Department's remit, with a common database, it would eliminate much of the groundwork being undertaken by the Department's inspectorate.</P>
      <P>There is a fair amount of organised fraud. While there is an anti-fraud unit in the United Kingdom, there is none here.  It would be worthwhile examining how we could integrate such a unit here, thus reducing the current level of fraud.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has circulated thousands of questionnaires to social welfare recipients.  He may claim to have been successful in the short-term in that this has led to some people being removed from the live register.  Time will tell. Although X number of questionnaires may be sent out and returned to Department offices the same number of staff must endeavour to handle all of them.  They feel demoralised that no extra staff have been allocated to examine the responses in any great detail.  This means that, while many people may vanish from the system in the short-term, the probability is they will gradually return to the fold.  The continuance of this practice of desk-top interviews rather than the departmental inspectorate being given the requisite resources to carry out their investigations in the workplace in order to establish the precise level of fraud means that this exercise is doomed to failure in the long-term, with earlier gains being negatived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken to many housing officers of local authorities who are very concerned at the evidence of fraud they encounter by people seeking <Col N="1641" /> local authority housing.  For whatever reason there is no common database shared by local authorities, health boards and the Department of Social Welfare.  This lack has been highlighted in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in which he indicated the importance of such a common database being made available to reduce administrative costs.</P>
    <P>Many Members have referred to the carer's allowance.  Has the Minister undertaken any survery of the cost of this allowance and its attendant means testing in coparison with nursing home accommodation costs?  Many nursing homes cost an average of £250 per week.  In the case of an elderly person in receipt of an old age pension of between £74 and £80 this will necessitate the maximum subvention of £120, taking that figure to £200, with a resulting deficit of anything between £60 and £100, depending on the type of nursing home in which an elderly person seeks accommodation.</P>
    <P>That takes me to the matter of caring for the elderly at home and the economic advantages of so doing.  While any elderly man or women retains any degree of good health, the last thing he or she will want is to go into a nursing home. Most prefer to remain at home within their local community.  Because of the means testing of the carer's allowance many young people who might otherwise maintain elderly parents or relatives at home refrain from doing so.</P>
    <P>The cost of giving young people who decide to care for an elderly relative a down payment to maintain them in their home environment would be considerably less than a nursing home subvention and would yield much greater social benefits for society as a whole.  The loving care and attention a family give an elderly parent or relative in their home would be rewarded to some extent.  I strongly advocate the elimination of the means test for the carer's allowance.  Bearing in mind the growing numbers of elderly citizens, we will be unable to continue paying nursing home subventions in the long-term.  The time has come to seriously examine how we might help to maintain them at home.</P>
    <P>While it appears the Minister for Health is not amenable to a pricing structure for nursing homes, I am aware that some two weeks ago a nursing home in Cork raised its weekly cost from £185 to £250 and there is absolutely nothing one can do about them.  Perhaps there should be some meeting between the Departments of Health and Social Welfare and nursing homes, as there was in the case of publicans, to arrive at some realistic figure to ensure that these escalating costs are controlled or kept in check to some degree.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Health and Social Welfare jointly should examine the very low amounts being paid for home helps who perform an extraordinary task in assisting the elderly in their homes.  Something will have to be done about the pittance they receive whether it is £1.40 in the Southern Health Board region or £3.20 in another health board area.  It is robbing Peter to pay Paul. <Col N="1642" /> Given the interaction between social welfare and health there should be a meeting of minds between the two Departments on a policy that is comprehensive and all embracing.  If home helps were given specialist training the elderly could be kept in the home much longer.</P>
    <P>If families on social welfare in urban areas have students attending college there is not much in the social welfare system to keep the family intact.  We are forcing 17 year olds out of the home from a safe environment into flats and apartments.  This is bad from a social and from a family point of view in that it means a break-up at a young age.  A number of social difficulties can follow.  If the student remains at home the Minister says £27 per week is available to him or her. I beg to differ.  That person should be entitled to full unemployment assistance while staying at home.  This would ensure a rent supplement is taken out of the system.  If my son leaves home and goes to college and into a flat he has to pay rent of £80 per week.  He can claim not only a rent allowance but other allowances that go with it.  If an unemployed person leaves the home he gets a rent allowance and unemployment assistance. If that person was given full unemployment assistance at home, both he and this country would be better off.  There are many social evils which beset young people in terms of drink, drugs and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not put a plan in place for the future and has not considered the social ills besetting the country.  To do so would be well worthwhile in terms of the social well-being of our people.  The elderly have contributed enormously to society and deserve something better than they have got from a Democratic Left Minister.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Bill is a technical measure but its annual introduction affords us an opportunity to review progress in the evolution of our social welfare system.  It is surprising at a time of unparalleled economic growth and prosperity that so little fundamental thinking has taken place on the part of the Minister in the reform of the social welfare system.  Those of us who have to deal day in day out with a population for whose benefit the system is administered are aware of the widespread public concerns about the operation of our social welfare system.</P>
      <P>The Minister has decided for his own reasons in this election year, despite an unparalleled prosperity generated by sound economic management by Fianna Fáil-led administrations, to do little but tinker around with the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>Section 1: In page 4, subsection (1), lines 21 and 22, the definition of &ldquo;offeree&rdquo; deleted, and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;offeree&rsquo; means a relevant company&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any securities of which are the subject of an offer that has been made or is intended or required to be made, or</P>
      <P>(b)  in respect of which, or in connection with which, a person does any act in contemplation of making an offer to holders of securities in that company;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These and subsequent amendments to sections 16 and 20 were sought by the interim panel after the Bill had passed all Stages in the House.  The panel's proposals were the subject of detailed consultations with my Department and the parliamentary draftsman.  I am satisfied the amendments are necessary for reasons that I will explain in a moment.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendments Nos. 2 and 3, the panel see it as essential to expand the existing definition of &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; and &ldquo;offeree&rdquo;.  The reason is that the former, i.e. &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; is defined as a person who makes an offer while the latter is defined as a company which is the subject of an offer.  When one looks at the definition in the Bill of &ldquo;offer&rdquo; one sees it is defined as an offer made to the holders of securities.  The effect of these three definitions is to limit the applicability of the terms &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; and &ldquo;offeree&rdquo; to a situation where an offer has been made; in other words, neither of these parties comes into existence until an offer is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with anchoring the definitions of &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; and &ldquo;offeree&rdquo; to the point where an offer is made is that the panel wishes to regulate for an entire range of scenarios and to be able to make and impose rules, rulings, directions and so on on the &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; and &ldquo;offeree&rdquo; in respect of certain of their actions taken prior to the stage where an offer is actually made.  That is the point <Col N="1644" /> of the revamping of the definition &mdash; where an offer is contemplated prior to its being made. What the panel has requested is that the definition of &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; and &ldquo;offeree&rdquo; be redrafted to take in all stages, literally between the point of conception of an offer right through to the making of such an offer.  The revised wordings are in amendments Nos. 2 and 3.</P>

      <P>(e)  on any person in respect of a document furnished by him or her to the Panel in relation to any proceedings of the Panel concerning a takeover or other relevant transaction.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is purely a technical amendment.  The text remains unaltered.  Essentially it lays out the paragraphs slightly differently.  The necessity for the change arises from a certain ambiguity created by the existing layout of the text which could be read to imply that the panel should make rules under section 8 in respect of charges to be imposed in relation to proceedings of the panel whereas the clear intention is that the panel be enabled to make charges in respect of the lodging with it of documents in the two specified situations, that is, in accordance with the rules under section 8 or any proceedings of the panel.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate, in any event, to have or to appear to have a provision for rules in relation to proceedings of the panel in a section relating exclusively to the powers of the panel to impose charges in order to finance its activities. Section 11(1) already provides that the panel shall conduct proceedings or hearings in such a manner as it may determine and section 11(3) specifically gives the panel powers, on the production of documents by the parties to such proceedings and hearings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 makes it clear that rules under section 8 do not have to have any provisions in relation to proceedings of the panel.

Subsection (d) will be the first line of the current subsection (d).  The amendment makes a new subsection (e) of the text from &ldquo;on any person in respect of a document furnished by him or her...&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are no fundamental changes in charges. The interim panel is currently considering the schedule of charges it might impose with regard to its functions.  I have not seen the charges but I presume they will be no more than is required for the discharging of the panel's functions.

      <P>In page 20, subsection (4), lines 33 and 34, &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of any enactment or rule of law, the Panel may&rdquo; deleted, and the following substituted:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> Section 20 (4) currently provides that, subject to the provisions of any enactment or rule of law, the panel may indemnify its officer in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by him or her in the carrying out of his or her duties as such officer.  In line with the practice of the London panel, the interim panel wants to be able to take out insurance policies in respect of its officers against possible legal actions against them for defamation in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>However, the panel sees the provisions of section 200 of the Companies Act, 1963, as prohibiting it from taking out such insurance.  This provision is seen as preventing a company from taking out insurance to indemnify an officer of the company from liability for a specified events, negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust.  Any policy of that nature taken out by a company is rendered void except in the restricted circumstances set out in the section.  Given the nature of the panel's functions, it is important we remove any doubt about the capability of the panel to take out such insurance.  However, this solution does not amount to a disapplication of section 200 of the 1963 Act in respect of the panel.  The solution involves a slight amendment to the existing subsection (4) and the provision of a new subsection (5).  The proposed solution is acceptable to the panel.</P>

      <P>This amendment indemnifies the panel against liability that might occur for mistakes or errors of judgment the panel might make.  Is that fair to the offerors or offerees?  If the panel makes a bad judgment in a takeover case it could cause a substantial loss for the participants.</P>

      <P>The fear in this case arises from a defamation case in another jurisdiction.  The panel would normally have the indemnity to which the Deputy refers.  This amendment makes it clear the indemnity will apply in a case arising in another jurisdiction.  One would be unlikely to get people to serve on a takeover panel if they personally were liable for errors or omissions made in good faith.  It does not prevent a company which believes it has been the subject of negligence from prosecuting an action.  It merely means the directors of the panel would be indemnified. If the members of the panel act in <i>male fides</i>, it is a different matter.  If the directors or members of the panel were to act in bad faith, the aggrieved party could institute proceedings for negligence and the panel would be liable.</P>

When Irish Distillers was taken over by Pernod Ricard the London Takeover Panel had responsibility because we did not have a regulatory authority.  We have made great progress.  This Bill will help our country and the people who invest in it.  We have a small Stock Exchange, with approximately 86 members, and I would like to see more people participating in it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion moved by Deputy Dempsey and condemn outright the Government's decision to discriminate against the people of rural Ireland.  This decision was made in haste on the afternoon of 19 December last after the Dáil had adjourned for the Christmas recess.  The left wing parties in Government, Democratic Left and Labour, are obviously dictating to the right wing party, Fine Gael, which because of its desire to stay in office and to <Col N="1649" /> accommodate its wonderful new friends agreed to this decision.  I know from research and representations I have received that there was no consultation with officials in the Department of the Environment or local authorities on the elimination of service charges in the capital city and borough corporations.  The people in rural areas have rightly rejected this decision.</P>
      <P>On 21 January the Minister decided at the opening of a library in Galway to throw water on the fire which was escalating in rural areas by announcing that people connected to a local authority source would not have to pay domestic charges either.  He did not take into account the people in rural areas who had used their own resources to provide a vital water service for them, their families and communities.</P>
      <P>In response to this decision, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes was established on a countywide basis.  It has met with the Minister and politicians and put various proposals to them.  I fully support these proposals.  The Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, was probably at the meeting at which this drastic, discriminatory decision was agreed.  The Government has failed the people of rural Ireland and stands condemned. Until such time as this decision is reversed all schemes, whether they relate to one or two houses or groups, must be subsidised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Government, which introduced this decision without any consultation.</P>
      <P>I am sick of tabling parliamentary questions as I am never given a reply which sets out the <i>de facto</i> position.  On 25 February my Question No. 183 asked the Minister for the Environment the reason capital grants were not paid to group water schemes throughout the country over the previous 12 months; the number of such schemes awaiting payment; the total amount of money to be paid; the date on which these payments would issue and if he would make a statement on the matter.  The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>Last year my Department paid £6.6 million in capital grants for group water and sewerage schemes.  Instalments of grants are paid on foot of certification of work done as schemes progress. Final instalments are paid on the satisfactory completion of the scheme.  There has been no undue delay by my Department in paying grants as they fall due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is totally false as group water schemes involving two, three, four and five houses which were cleared by the Department's inspectors in late 1995 and early 1996 were told payment would be made in 1996.  My backbench Government colleague announced in the local papers, having been informed by the Minister for the Environment, that payment in respect of these schemes would be made in early 1997.  As recently as last <Col N="1650" /> December I raised the matter with departmental and ministerial officials who told me that payment would be made not later than 11 January.</P>
    <P>As a result of the confusion created in the Department of the Environment by the Government and immature Minister for the Environment, people involved in schemes approved in 1995 and 1996 have been told payment will not be made until the files have been transferred to the local authorities.  These schemes have been cleared by the Department's inspectorate and payment should be made now.  I call on the Government to ensure that schemes such as the Boula No. 2, the Baragurrane, Traskernagh and other schemes in County Galway receive payment immediately.  The duplication of work by the Department and local authorities should be eliminated and cheques issued immediately.  I appeal to the Minister to do this forthwith.  I want an update on the position of the schemes in County Galway within seven days.</P>

      <P>The handling of the water charges issue shows a complete lack of understanding by the Government of rural communities and, even worse, demonstrates a complete lack of regard for the principle of equity for all citizens.  This decision shows that the Labour Party got its way at the expense of rural Fine Gael Deputies.  The political cost of this remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>There was little or no evidence of consultation or deliberation by the Minister for the Environment on this issue until public reaction proved that his proposals were unjust.  He then announced that local authorities would take over private group water schemes.  There must have been no consultation with such groups as many of them are vehemently opposed to such a takeover. The Minister seems to have forgotten that private group water schemes were introduced by very strong and influential groups who had done tremendous work in their communities.  The Minister said another study will be carried out. As Deputy Dempsey said, we are back to where we started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey outlined four options the Minister could take to deal with this problem and to remove the inequity he created as a result of his announcements on 19 December and 21 January. These are (1) direct subventions to householders; (2) direct subventions to appropriate group water schemes; (3) the taking in charge by local authorities or the Department of schemes opting for this approach; and (4) the provision of a formal scheme between the Department, local authorities and group water schemes which will ensure that those groups which wish to remain independent can do so without suffering any penalties or inequity and will be facilitated in their function of providing and maintaining a portable water supply to their communities.  He said that options (1) and (2) could be used in the shorter term to remove the inequity created by the Minister and that options (3) and (4) were, of necessity, <Col N="1651" /> of a longer term nature and would require full consultation with the group schemes concerned before any such schemes could be finalised.</P>
    <P>I fully support the motion.  This issue has caused great anxiety throughout rural areas, not least in my own constituency where a number of meetings have been held during which views were vehemently expressed.  I hope the Minister, even at this late stage, will listen to the proposals put forward from this side of the House to ensure an equitable and fair system in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the logical and systematic approach adopted by the Minister for the Environment.  I compliment him on being the first Minister for the Environment in decades to take a genuine interest in local government reform and take positive action on it.</P>
      <P>Over the years local authority members, particularly at Estimates time, demanded the retention of road tax within the county exchequers.  This proposal provides for that.  It also introduces an equalisation fund and abolishes water and sewerage charges, which means that householders in urban areas will no longer have to pay up to £150 per house for these services.  It also provides free water for rural areas where water is sourced from public authority supplies.</P>
      <P>As regards self-sourced rural water supplies, the Minister has given the clearest possible commitment that a comprehensive examination of the rural water supply issue will be undertaken, and a report thereon will be brought to Government. It is administratively easy to abolish water charges for urban dwellers and establish a system for those water schemes which buy their supplies from county councils, but it is not so easy to devise a scheme of remission for private schemes.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to those who availed of Government funding to bring water to huge tracts of rural Ireland where previously there was no domestic water supply.  As a secretary, organiser and trustee of a rural scheme I know at first hand the degree of organisation, administration and frustration involved.  I pay tribute also to the Minister, Deputy Howlin for the dramatic increase in grants for the provision of such supplies this year. In 1994, £3.4 million was made available to rural group water schemes.  In 1996, that figure doubled to £6.6 million.  The Minister has brought about a dramatic increase, from £700 to £1,600 per house this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes put his finger on the problem yesterday evening in underlining the fact that Mayo, for example, has approximately 350 group water schemes.  The reality is that some schemes are being run at a cost of £40 per household while <Col N="1652" /> others are costing £240.  Some schemes are well run, while others are not.  Some schemes are efficient and economic while others are plagued with leaks which results in wastage of water, time and resources.  Some schemes want to be taken over by local authorities, whereas others want to retain their independence.  The reality is that 43 per cent of schemes show levels of coliform contamination. A substantial amount of this contamination occurred over the seven year period from 1987 to 1994 by way of phosphate contamination, proliferation of septic tanks, etc., and nothing happened by way of redress because of Fianna Fáil's typical closed eye solution to most problems.</P>
    <P>The difficulty and complexity of devising a uniform scheme involving public funding which can guarantee equity, efficiency and quality is obvious.  The Minister is examining all the issues in detail, and I have every confidence that when he brings his report to Cabinet it will be thorough, comprehensive will address the issues fairly.  I have every confidence also that whatever formula is proposed will be informed by the vast range of consultation the Minister has had with county councillors and officials at different locations, his dialogue with the IFA and the ICMSA and his meeting with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.</P>
    <P>I listened last night to Deputy Dempsey's timeworn and threadbare cliché about the anti-rural bias.  No Minister for the Environment has allocated as much money to rural areas as Deputy Howlin.  When we came into office, potholes on rural roads were the norm.  Neglect of county roads under Fianna Fáil led to a rash of pothole candidates and pothole councillors.  The Minister faced the issue head on, and in 1995 and 1996 there were huge injections of capital into the county and regional roads structure, with a record allocation of more than £0.25 billion in 1997.  As a result, the day of the pothole and the pothole candidate is at an end and there will be no need for water scheme candidates either.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Hughes in the House yesterday evening and his usual &ldquo;Mayo, God help us&rdquo; argument.  Can Deputy Hughes read?  Does he read his local newspapers, <i>The Western People</i>, the <i>Connaught Telegraph</i> and the <i>Mayo News</i>? Just four weeks ago the Minister announced £3,857,000 for national primary and secondary roads in Mayo.  Up to £5 million is being made available for local authority housing as well as a plethora of schemes throughout the county under the voluntary housing programme.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago, the Minister announced £4,160,000 for Ballyhaunis sewerage scheme, to start immediately; £5,350,000 for Claremorris sewerage scheme, which is expected to start in 1997; £11 million for the extension of the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme to Knock and Ballyhaunis, also taking in a network of group water schemes in the south of the county; £1,750,000 for the Bangor Erris water scheme and £762,000 for the Dugort sewerage scheme; construction <Col N="1653" /> on the Achill water scheme will cost £1.9 million; £2.25 million to the Westport water scheme, Deputy Hughes's native town, and a further grant of £120,000 for leakage control.</P>
    <P>Not only is the Minister putting in place vital infrastructure by way of adequate water, sewerage and roads to ensure rural areas are poised to harness the benefits of the new industrial policy announced by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the IDA this week, but more jobs than ever are being created in rural Ireland. The Mayo County Enterprise Board, for example, created 299 full-time jobs in 1995 and an additional 133 full-time jobs in 1996.  Under Fianna Fáil, the Castlebar and Claremorris bacon factories, Irish Spinners Limited in Kiltimagh and Clare Morris Limited went to the wall, but this Government has announced more than 240 jobs for APC in Castlebar, the consolidation of additional jobs for Farah in Kiltimagh, a proposal for a new cement factory in Kilkelly employing 200, and 63 additional jobs involving an investment of over £7 million at Western Brand Chickens Limited, Ballyhaunis.</P>
    <P>I never cease to wonder at the consistent inconsistency of members of the Progressive Democrats. God was to be removed from the Constitution, but there was a sudden reverse throttle and God stayed put; the Senate was to be abolished, but after a sudden change of heart, they now happily participate in it.  The group water scheme band came merrily down the street, and not only did Deputies Molloy and McDowell get into step behind it, they tried to pass it out by throwing £23 million at the problem.  If implemented, PD policy would result in a net profit of up to £200 per household.  Who would not want to be a member of a group water scheme?</P>
    <P>I will answer the allegation about the lack of a distinct Fine Gael policy on this issue.  Fine Gael, the Department of the Environment and the Government are at one on this issue.  The Government's policies are contained in our tripartite agreement, A Government of Renewal. That is the spirit which continues to reinforce the success of this Government.</P>
    <P>I compliment Minister Howlin on his compatent handling of this issue.  I do not doubt his capacity to deliver an equitable and adequate solution. I appeal for less panic and more logic to enable him do that.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil's amnesic Private Members' motions never cease to amaze me. Deputies Dempsey, O'Hanlon and Ahern referred to &ldquo;the principle of equity for all our citizens&rdquo;. I would like to examine that further. <Col N="1654" /> Everybody knows that Democratic Left's public representatives and non-elected representatives campaigned against local authority water charges since they were first introduced.  Our campaign was based on the principle of equity.  The charges were iniquitous.  They were a form of double taxation and were levied on an arbitrary basis.  In some areas, for example, householders paid nothing; in other areas they had to fork out over £100 and in others in excess of £200.</P>
      <P>In 1985, Fianna Fáil appeared to recognise the inequity of the situation.  It certainly recognised the depth of feeling which was stirred among the voters and, in its Opposition clothes, stated it was: &ldquo;totally opposed to the system of service charges and on return to office would abolish those charges&rdquo;.  The rest is history.  Fianna Fáil was returned to Government and the charges with the attendant inequities remained, forcing householders to pay twice for the most basic of services.</P>
      <P>I applaud the fact that it took Democratic Left's participation in this Government and in the Programme for Government to finally have the charges scrapped.</P>

      <P>At the end of last year Deputy Dempsey, showing a fine disregard for history, accused this Government of pre-election panic. Deputy Dempsey and his Greek chorus in the Progressive Democrats, who are not here tonight, have latched on to group water schemes in their attempt to play to the large farmers' gallery.  With the IFA and the ICMSA they are engaged in what is clearly a transparent attempt to manufacture a urban-rural divide on this issue, blithely forgetting that over 235,000 rural households, around 55 per cent, benefited directly or indirectly from the abolition of local authority water charges, and that figure includes 85,000 rural households belonging to group water schemes which were supplied from a public main.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, announced a new multi-annual programme with capital funding this year of £5 million, the aim of which is to improve water quality and to enable local authorities to take over private schemes where the members wish, a step which would eliminate charges for the householders concerned.  In addition, those schemes that wish to remain fully private will continue to be able to avail of the technical and grant assistance available.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Howlin, because the measures taken by him will inject an element of equity into the system as well as ensuring that the quality of the water supplied by private schemes meets national standards.  There are many low income rural households currently paying for private group schemes.  I agree that the burden on such households should be alleviated.  I wish low income rural households had a more vocal lobby because I would argue strenuously that they are not <Col N="1655" /> served by the local ranchers in the IFA, the ICMSA or the spokespersons on the Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrat benches.</P>
    <P>In campaigning to have local authority water charges abolished, Democratic Left was campaigning for tax equity, and those who have been most vocal in support of private water schemes have steered well away from the topic of tax equity. Many of them know little about taxation, double or otherwise, as is evidenced in the most recent household budget survey which once again highlights the gulf between the tax take from urban PAYE households and that from farm households.  It does not surprise me that Fianna Fáil seized on the rural water schemes issue with great glee because they have been desperately searching for some mast to which they can nail their increasingly tattered colours.  Like the previous speaker, I was amazed when I heard the Progressive Democrats committing themselves on a radio programme to subsidising private water schemes to the tune of £23 million per annum.  I very much doubt whether that promise will survive Deputy McDowell's first &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; or &ldquo;no-help&rdquo; budget.  The fact is that the group water scheme issue is being viewed through the magnifying glass of an impending election, an election that will see this Government returned to office to continue the project of reforming local government financing.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Byrne for allowing me to make a contribution, however brief, to this important debate.</P>
      <P>As somebody who comes from the heart of rural Ireland, a small village called Ballinacarrig in County Westmeath with a population of 550 people, I do not think anybody can deny that I am deeply committed to the concept of rural rejuvenation and regeneration.  It is from this perspective that I recently called for an integrated strategy focusing on a rural renewal concept which would ensure that the problems of rural Ireland would be meaningfully addressed.  One such problem is the decline in population which is accentuated by increasing migration to the larger urban centres of population.  I have called for the implementation of a rural renewal scheme similar to the urban renewal scheme.  Special taxation incentives should be granted to entrepreneurs and business people who locate much needed industry in these areas.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recent initiative of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, in implementing, with the IDA, a new regional policy for employment growth in locations outside the larger urban centres.  This is just a start. In order to ensure that the drift from rural Ireland is halted, we must have a more focused approach to encourage investors and promoters to locate their industries in rural villages and towns, of which there are many in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" /> Problems have arisen in rural areas concerning the running costs of group water schemes and charges to members for domestic supplies.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, is considering this matter and has met representatives of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the IFA and the ICMSA and has received representations on this issue from Deputies and other public representatives of all parties.  I am confident that the Minister will do as he has done so often in his portfolio in the space of two years and two months when he grasped the nettle in regard to issues that had been left on the back burner for years.  He will examine the submissions of various bodies and a satisfactory solution to the problems will be found.</P>
    <P>Let us not engage in hypocritical cant by saying that rural Ireland and those who reside there have been forgotten by the Government and, in particular, by the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  He has done more than all the Ministers in various Governments over the past 20 years to ensure that rural people are placed at the heart of the Government's agenda and are not forgotten.  I intend to demonstrate how untrue is that mantra of anti-rural bias which has been glibly trotted out.</P>
    <P>Westmeath is a large rural constituency, and I will give some examples of the tremendous work the Minister has engaged in on water and sewerage schemes, local authority housing and county and regional roads, all matters of primary and paramount importance to people living in rural areas.  I am aware of these matters because I live in one of the most rural villages in County Westmeath.  Let us compare the record of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to the scandalous level of neglect of rural Westmeath by his predecessor in the Department of the Environment.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, made funds available for urban and village renewal projects throughout the country and County Westmeath received a good share of that funding.  The village improvement schemes carried out under the auspices of the local authority have been extremely successful in County Westmeath.  Work has been carried out which will enhance and improve the villages concerned and underpin their economic position for the future.  Villages such as Castlepollard, Delvin, my village of Ballynacargy, Finea, Clonmellon, Multyfarnham, Fore, Coole, Moate, Glasson, Baylin and Ballinahowen have benefited. The village enhancement schemes provided great impetus for further community development and I am glad I initiated some of those schemes at local authority level.</P>
    <P>The Minister increased the rate of grant for group water schemes.  The new rate of £1,600 per house, subject to a maximum of 75 per cent of cost, and £1,200 per farm was more than double the previous maximum rate of grant and encouraged people in outlying rural areas to get together and provide piped water supplies for themselves. The Kinnegad-Killucan Cloncrave scheme is one <Col N="1657" /> example where the increased grant provided an impetus to development.  Developments also took place as a result of increases for sewerage schemes.  It was acknowledged by the Minister that group water schemes were very successful in supplying the water needs of many rural communities. By increasing the level of grant for such schemes he showed his strong support for and commitment to the development of self-help initiatives, which helped many rural householders and farm families to provide a supply of quality piped water for their farms and homes.</P>
    <P>I live in an area with high unemployment and for 30 years politicians came to the village telling us we would be looked after in terms of water schemes, but when they rode out of town we never saw them again.  When I was elected I gave a commitment that a decent water supply would be provided in my village.  I raised the matter on the Adjournment with the then Minister, Deputy Smith, but the reply left me without hope. However, Deputy Howlin was only a short period in the Department when that 30 years wait ended. I was delighted to be involved in securing a scheme for Ballynacargy, Moyvore and Ballymore. The water supply in the area was totally inadequate and unreliable, particularly in the summer period, and the villages of Moyvore and Ballymore had no public supply.  The people in those areas will not forget that I delivered on my promise.  I pay tribute to the Minister for ensuring that £2.1 million was made available for the area. In the absence of a quality water supply the efforts of local community groups to initiate development and bring worthwhile projects to the area were hindered.  As a result of that scheme a project is in line for my village of Ballynacargy which will create a significant number of jobs.  That is only one example of the importance of water supply schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister provided £4.587 million for Moate sewerage scheme to allow construction to continue this year.  That important scheme, which was promised 20 years ago, is designed to the highest standard and permits the extension of the mains to the environs of the town of Moate and its surroundings.  Tyrrellspass, an area with major hotels and businesses, does not have a proper water supply.  The source is very unreliable, causing major problems for the residents and farmers of the area.  The Minister provided £1.1 million this year for that scheme and tenders are being sought.</P>
    <P>I have given examples of only a few rural areas which were neglected by previous Governments. I am glad a Labour Party Minister delivered on the promises for County Westmeath &mdash; the people will remember that at election time &mdash; and I am proud to have played a role in that regard.</P>
    <P>For many years county roads were in a very bad state of repair.  I have been a member of a local authority for 14 years and at every council meeting motions were put forward, but no money was available to pay for filling the potholes.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, who made many <Col N="1658" /> improvements when Minister for Health, introduced a ten-year initiative to solve the problem of potholes, which have bedevilled county roads for the past ten years or more.  I was acutely aware of the problems of county roads and was delighted the important contribution made by rural people to the economy was recognised by the Minister.  The existence of a sound network of county roads is central to the creation and maintenance of jobs in industry, agriculture, tourism and rural development.</P>
    <P>The development of county roads has a knockon effect in terms of employment.  Not everybody is committed, as I am, to employing a large number of outdoor permanent staff.  In the mid-1980s workers were let go willy nilly from the council. That accentuated the problem of potholes because there was nobody to maintain the roads. Some people, particularly those who advocate right wing economics, disagree that local authority outdoor permanent staff are critical to the implementation of these schemes but I will continue to call for increased employment at local authority level.</P>
    <P>In the housing area, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government provided for only six or seven local authority houses in my area, which was very unsatisfactory because there were about 300 people on the housing list.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, like his predecessors, Jimmy Tully and Deputy Liam Kavanagh, ensured a decent allocation was provided for local authority housing for those unable to provide their own homes.  As a result local authority waiting lists are decreasing.  If there is a change to a centre-right Government will there be a repeat of what happened in the late 1980s when there was no provision for local authority housing?  Local authorities are building houses in rural areas, thereby keeping people in those areas and ensuring that schools, Garda stations and churches remain open.  In some areas there were not enough young people to form a football team, but that position is now changing.  Those matters are very important in rural Ireland and I am glad the Labour Party has made a contribution to those areas. We have provided resources for local authority housing and hope to be in Government to ensure that continues.</P>

      <P>Local Government has become less effective since it lost its main statutory revenue base in 1983.  Prior to that there existed an enlightened sharing of national Exchequer revenue through a statutory formula giving each local authority a rate support grant equivalent in real terms to the amount it would have obtained in receipts from rates on domestic dwellings which were abolished in 1978.  That policy was <Col N="1659" /> supported by all the main parties in the Dáil at the time.</P>
      <P>When domestic rates were abolished, local authorities enjoyed a level of funding that allowed them maintain all their existing services at a high level and acquire property and invest in projects deemed beneficial for the development of their areas.  However, after the general election of 1982, a Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government was elected and Deputy Spring, the leader of the Labour Party, was appointed Minister for the Environment.  He immediately set about enacting the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1983, the result of which meant the rate support grants no longer met in full the domestic rates income which had been foregone on the abolition of rates on houses.  That Act also introduced service charges, which have been a bone of contention ever since.  They did not bring in additional income but were used as a device to justify a reduction in the rate support grant paid annually by the Department of the Environment from Exchequer funds.</P>
      <P>In the years since the introduction of those service charges, many Labour councillors &mdash; even though their party introduced the charges &mdash; urged people not to pay them and indeed many leading Labour councillors voted against them when adopting annual estimates.  This was done of course for local political kudos purposes.  They were happy to spend the money, but were not prepared to accept responsibility for raising revenue.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party's service charges policy introduced inequity into the system.  A large local authority like Dublin, because of its huge commercial base, did not have to rely on service charges to maintain its services and decided not to charge them.  This introduced a serious inequity between a large urban authority and the many rural councils, who had no choice other than impose high service charges which were seen as double taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997 the Labour Party is back in office, in the Department of the Environment and, true to form, we have another iniquitous proposal.  This time it wants to abolish its mistake and replace it with an extraordinary system that copperfastens an inequity between rural and urban dwellers. Out go the service charges and in comes motor taxation as a source of revenue for local authorities, with a right to increase the tax by 6 per cent every year after 1998.  In 1998 alone the increase is to be limited to 3 per cent.  The service charges which are being abolished applied only to those who had the benefit of a public water supply system.  Rural dwellers, who did not have such a service, had to rely on their resources to provide piped water and they invested their capital along with small grants and built a network of group water supply schemes &mdash; 5,500 in all &mdash; around the country.  The 150,000 householders getting supply from group water supply schemes, as well as building the scheme and managing it, have to <Col N="1660" /> pay an annual maintenance charge that could in some cases be as high as £270 per annum.</P>
    <P>These householders must continue to pay maintenance on their private scheme while at the same time pay the local authority increases in motor taxation which are being imposed to compensate local authorities for the loss of revenue from the service charges previously paid by urban householders.  In other words, rural dwellers pay twice.  This is a hare brain scheme.  It is not equitable and institutionalises a rural-urban divide in a most retrograde manner.</P>
    <P>Considering that the leader of the Minister's party introduced these changes, it is ironic, even hypocritical, of him to state that:</P>
    <P>The long-term decline in the financial independence of local authorities needs to be reversed and the basic drawbacks of the existing local finance system needs to be tackled. For a start, the local authority funding base was too narrow and there was little buoyancy.  This problem was compounded by the fact that the authorities have been continuously conferred with new function, without any allowance being made for the additional pressure such functions would place on their finances.  Furthermore, the authorities were at the mercy of central Government to the extent that they never knew for certain how much rate support grant they would receive in the next year and, in addition, this grant did not always keep pace with inflation.</P>
    <P>The sheer audacity of it is breathtaking.  There is not a word of regret, nor one admission that the Labour Party got it wrong then, as it has now. There is not the slightest admission that the Labour Party, with its socialist ideology for central planning and central control, is guilty of gross mismanagement of the local government system. Instead we were subjected last night to a lecture from the Labour Party Minister asking us not to engage in political point scoring.  This is the party that ruined local government and is now only motivated to abolish its earlier faulty system because it faces a political threat from people such as Joe Higgins and other disenchanted former Labour Party members who nearly won the Dublin West by-election on the single issue of abolishing service charges.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not in a position to lecture those who opposed Deputy Spring's Bill in 1983 and who have now been proven right.  For the second time, opposition voices have to be raised against the folly of the Labour Party local government reforms that were ill-thought out and blatantly discriminate against 279,000 households in rural Ireland.  A major blunder has been made and I call on the Minister to admit what Deputies and Senators from his party and the Fine Gael Party are saying at meetings in their constituencies and behind closed doors at Parliamentary Party meetings.</P>
    <P>The Minister sought to rubbish the good work of group water schemes by saying &ldquo;...the quality <Col N="1661" /> of water in many of these schemes is not up to standard.  The recent Environmental Protection Agency report on drinking water quality indicates that 43 per cent of private group supplies suffer some degree of coliform contamination&rdquo;.  A reference for that statistic was not given.  Did the 1995 report of the Environmental Protection Agency not indicate that 62.5 per cent of public water supplies suffer some degree of coliform contamination and that the excess of coliform in group schemes was only 32.5 per cent?  The Environmental Protection Agency report is more critical of public water supply schemes than of group water schemes, but the Minister sought to put across a different image last night.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions he has also sought to reinterpret the announced system whereby for 1998 local authorities would be able to vary the national rate of motor tax by up to 3 per cent and for 1999 and subsequent years by up to a maximum of 6 per cent.  The Minister now says what he really means is a maximum 6 per cent increase on the base year of 1999.  His document did not mention a base year.  It stated that the net effect of these changes will be that in 1998 local authorities will be empowered to vary the national rate by up to 3 per cent and in 1999 and subsequent years by up to a maximum of 6 per cent.  It is only since the Group Water Schemes Federation started its campaign that we heard of the application of a base year.  If this is a backing down, why not admit it?</P>
    <P>I also dispute the Minister's assertion that &ldquo;Under the new arrangements, no household, urban or rural, connected directly or indirectly to a public water supply will have to pay for a domestic water supply&rdquo;.  That is not correct.  All group water schemes that get their supply from a local authority water main incur the cost of running and maintaining their schemes, which could involve more than one booster pump in hilly territory. These annual maintenance costs remain to be paid by the members of these groups.</P>
    <P>The Group Water Scheme Federation sought £80 per house from the 85,000 rural households involved, making a grand total of £6.8 million. That is its estimate of the amount involved.  The Federation sought £160 per house for all of the 55,000 rural householders totally dependent on group schemes with a private water source.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced a package estimated to cost £18 million, which included a figure of £5 million, to enable local authorities take over group schemes.  The federation ridiculed the £5 million figure for the take-over and refurbishment of quality-deficient group schemes and estimated that it would require capital funding of £50 million this year to bring them all up to quality efficient standards.  It is obvious the Minister did not do any preparatory work before making his &ldquo;I'll abolish water charges&rdquo; statement.</P>
    <P>The essence of this debate is that the Minister made a monumental blunder.  He has stirred up a sleeping giant in rural Ireland and has not yet moved to resolve all the complex difficulties <Col N="1662" /> which he has created by lack of judgment in a decision which was politically motivated solely for the purpose of seeking to save the seats of Labour Deputies, not one whom has apologised to the House for the current position.</P>
    <P>To save a few Labour Party seats, 279,000 households must continue to pay for their domestic water while this Government gives a free gift of unlimited, unmetered water supply to every urban household.  The Minister claims no principle of equity is being breached by this decision. That does not bear comment, it is beyond belief.</P>
    <P>Group water schemes are an ideal example of rural communities using their initiative to organise the supply of piped water to their homes and managing the maintenance and administration of their scheme on a voluntary basis.  This Labour Minister wants to replace this voluntary, no cost to the State, effort with a team of civil servants. Thus in one fell swoop he is dealing a death blow to enterprising self-help groups in rural Ireland, adding another burden to the already overburdened taxpayer and motor car owner and in the process creating a grave inequity between rural and urban communities.  I call on the Minister to redress this inequity to give equal treatment to rural and urban dwellers and to stop making irrational, ill-thought out decisions for purely party political gain.</P>
    <P>The Minister's party has a record of messing up the local government system.  He should get rid of these inequities immediately.  The quality of his decisions in office is abysmal.  Need I remind the Minister of the dishonourable way he reneged on his solemn commitment to proceed with the Mutton Island sewage treatment plant in Galway as planned again for narrow, politically motivated reasons?  Because the director of elections for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D.  Higgins, resigned, he announced a reversal of his solemn commitment in favour of an underground treatment system without an access causeway, a proposal of which the Minister and his Department, the corporation and its consultant engineer, knew nothing in terms of technology, cost or construction.  The Minister who speaks about the need for water quality has condemned the citizens of my town to watch the putrification of the water of inner Galway Bay along its beaches and at its harbour and piers where sewage, slime and foul odours permeate the place.  This is the Minister's legacy.</P>
    <P>If the group water schemes collapse, if the trustees walk away, if the systems fall into disrepair, if rural people become reluctant to ever again join forces in the common good, if all this comes about because of this brazen, selfish, outdated socialist and politically motivated decision, then the Minister's legacy will be even worse and his shame all the greater.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on this important subject. I support the case put forward eloquently last night by our party spokesman, Deputy Dempsey, and other Fianna Fáil speakers.  During a recent Question Time the Minister tried to imply that all and sundry welcomed his local government reform proposals published on 19 December last and that he was the first to foresee anomalies with his announcement in the latter half of January about the provision of funding for the upgrading of group water schemes.</P>
      <P>Members of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, particularly Deputies and Senators from rural areas, were acutely conscious of the grave injustice being inflicted on rural communities by this Government's ill-thought out approach to the abolition of water charges.  That concern was evident given the number of parliamentary questions tabled by myself and other Fianna Fáil Deputies the day the Dáil resumed in January. Those parliamentary questions highlighted in no uncertain terms the anomalies and the discrimination against rural Ireland due to the so-called reform of local government proposals announced by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Those proposals are anti-rural and have managed to divide urban and rural communities.  It is obvious this Government gave no consideration to the interests of participants on group water schemes or to people sourcing their water supplies from private wells.  During recent parliamentary questions to the Minister for the Environment I instanced the substantial costs accruing for the ongoing annual maintenance cost of private group schemes.  The Minister and the Government have no proposals to offset those substantial costs for participants in group schemes while households fortunate enough to be able to participate in public schemes receive their supply free of charge.</P>
      <P>Some 129,000 homes are served by private water supplies.  Those of us familiar with rural Ireland are aware of the enormous cost, in many instances, to people sourcing supplies from private wells due to the cost of boring wells and the provision of pumps, etc.  Participants in group water schemes and households with private supplies are not being treated fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I asked the Minister for the Environment if he had any proposals to allocate funds to households that must install a single house mechanical plant for sewage treatment in view of the fact that the average capital cost of such a plant is £4,000.  The household must also meet the running and maintenance costs.  I sought the Minister's views on whether such households now receive treatment equal to that of city dwellers following the abolition of service charges.  His only response was to the effect that there are no proposals to provide public funds or tax allowances in respect of the cost of those facilities.  The <Col N="1664" /> single house mechanical treatment plant is common in my constituency due to the nature of the drumlin soil.  Is that the creed of equity as enunciated by this Government?</P>
    <P>My constituency and most of rural Ireland have been well served by active and committed group water scheme committees.  The organisers and committee members gave and continue to devote much time and energy voluntarily to a worthwhile community effort.  The group water scheme concept has been of enormous benefit to rural Ireland, but the schemes with which I am familiar in my county and County Monaghan need upgrading.  It has been estimated that the appropriate upgrading of those schemes in County Cavan would cost £15 to £20 million.  When will such finding be provided?</P>
    <P>The only demand the organisers of the group schemes made in recent years was capital funding for upgrading purposes.  That was a legitimate request by any standard but the only response of this Government was to create chaos and further inequity.  The people of rural Ireland will not accept such treatment from this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion proposed by our spokesman on the environment, Deputy Dempsey, but I am critical of the amendment which is a rehash of what many Members listened to in the Slieve Russell Hotel in Ballyconnell a week ago when the Minister and an assistant secretary of his Department launched the document Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change.  We listened to phrases such as &ldquo;buoyant funding systems&rdquo; and &ldquo;ring fencing&rdquo;.  The programme is based on funding provided from motor taxation, which will bail them out of funding group water schemes.  The Minister spoke about an extra 6 per cent which could be obtained over the next two years by increasing motor taxation.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister spoke about county roads which is a popular topic.  It was reported in the newspapers yesterday that his boss, the man who carries the purse, had indicated clearly that £40 million of the sum allocated for county roads would be used to meet the nurses' pay demands.</P>
      <P>The decision to abolish water charges was ill-advised. The necessary groundwork was not done.  It appears the Minister disregarded all of the technical advice available.  A sum of £5 million is available to upgrade group water schemes. A further £10 million will be made available by way of a block grant.  The constituency I represent requires the combined sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister now knows that the local authorities are not in a position to assume responsibility for group water schemes, most of which are supplying water of good quality efficiently and effectively.  At least half of the schemes in County Monaghan have treatment plants.  While some schemes have agreed a set price for the repair and maintenance of water mains, the members of other schemes carry out this work themselves.  No local authority could compete with them.  The <Col N="1665" /> members of the small scheme of which I was a member did everything that needed to be done. They took metre readings and collected money on behalf of the council.  That is the reason schemes can supply water to their members at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>Group water schemes operate on the principle of self-help.  Scheme organisers devote all of their spare time to administration.  They are not prepared to transfer responsibility to local authorities because they fear that, in time, supplies could become too expensive.  When I first entered politics there were few schemes in my constituency. Supplies were made available by the Western Water Board in Northern Ireland &mdash; Monaghan County Council was responsible for the connections &mdash; but costs spiralled out of control. Because of this and weak pressure, Monaghan County Council and scheme members had no option but to sink wells and supply pumps.</P>
    <P>Members of group water schemes are entitled to be reimbursed for the domestic water supply element.  In addition, individuals have spent between £2,000 and £3,000 from their own resources on sinking deep wells.  No grants are available for that unless it is provided for in a farm development plan.  If motor taxation is increased, they will face additional charges.  This is inequitable.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question on behalf of the members of a group water scheme who were seeking an extension because the supply was not usable.  I asked the Minister if he would make arrangements to expedite approval and was informed in reply:</P>
    <P>As already announced, responsibility for the operation of group schemes is being devolved to the local authorities, subject to existing commitments on foot of approvals issued by my Department.  Where schemes have not yet been approved, it will in future be a matter for the local authorities to decide on grant applications.</P>
    <P>Monaghan County Council does not know what commitments have been made.  I ask the Minister to clarify the matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The interests of rural dwellers have been disregarded. The Government seemed to have a chip on its shoulder so far as funding for the Border region was concerned.  Over a three year period, 24 out of 26 counties received funding from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. Last week an application to have an incinerator provide electricity from waste located in the region was turned down.  The project was snatched from us and is to be located instead near Dublin Airport where it is not wanted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, dealt fully with all of the issues raised by the motion and placed them in the context of the Government's proposals for fundamental reform <Col N="1666" /> of local government.  These proposals provide for a total revamping of the hitherto ramshackle and inequitable system of funding local authorities. Unfortunately, despite the Minister's comprehensive statement, Opposition Deputies have persisted in deliberately misrepresenting the Government's position.  I will do my best to set the record straight, again.</P>
      <P>The most overused word in this debate is &ldquo;equity&rdquo;. Does anyone suggest the previous method of funding local authorities was equitable or consistent? The system of water charges which has evolved mostly under Fianna Fáil Governments could scarcely be less equitable.  Can it be equitable that a basic necessity of life such as domestic water provided by public authorities varied from being free in two of our largest cities to a cost of £200 per year in some counties?</P>
      <P>The Government has repeatedly been accused by the Opposition of being unfair to rural communities. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Minister referred to the huge programme investment in non-national roads as an example of the Government's support for rural development and communities.  The removal of charges from households connected to a public supply benefits both rural and urban communities. The majority of rural households will benefit directly from this measure.  The decision to abolish water and sewerage charges and to absorb the cost into general taxation stands on its own merits. If the Deputies opposite believe that domestic water and sewerage charges should be reintroduced, let them say so.  Their continued attempts to make this an urban <i>v</i>.  rural issue are negative tactics which do them little credit.</P>
      <P>The Opposition's other tactic of trying to link the abolition of service charges with an increase in motor tax is a red herring.  There are strong reasons motor tax is a suitable basis for the future funding of local authorities.  It provides a buoyant source of income, it is already collected by local authorities and is closely related to the services they provide.  If local authorities wish to increase the level of this tax by up to 6 per cent, they can do so if they wish to expand local services.  It is important to clarify that no local authority will exercise this limited discretion to increase the rate of motor tax because of the absence of water charges.</P>
      <P>If anything positive is to come from this issue, it is that it has focused attention on a relatively neglected aspect of the water service, rural water supplies.  Water quality in many private group schemes is a major cause for concern.  The problems for rural water supplies did not arise overnight or because public domestic water charges were abolished.  It is a separate issue to the abolition of service charges and one I am glad to say the Government is now tackling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House the Government is united in its determination that the problems affecting rural water supplies are tackled in a fully considered, planned and effective manner.  As the Minister has already indicated, we envisage that <Col N="1667" /> such an approach would be based on four broad principles; first, integrated strategic plans for rural water supplies with the improvement of water quality as their main focus will be prepared by each county council with complimentary roles for public and group schemes; second, the continued development of group schemes, whether providing new or expanding or improving existing schemes which includes examining the running costs of schemes and the charges made to members in respect of these costs; third, implementing the new multinational programme to allow local authorities to take charge and upgrade as necessary those schemes which wish to transfer to and be treated as public schemes; fourth, devolving full responsibility for the implementation of all aspects of the group schemes programme and small public schemes to local authorities.</P>
    <P>This kind of planned approach which the Government is intent on pursuing will take some time to develop.  We will not throw money at the problem like drunken sailors as advocated by the Progressive Democrats.  Neither will the &ldquo;too cute by half&rdquo; approach of Fianna Fáil solve this problem. Fianna Fáil is long on rhetoric but short on the specifics of a solution, especially on costings. This Government will not act irresponsibly nor be rushed into piecemeal or quick-fix solutions, not even by this motion.  I commend the Minister's amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy McManus, spoke about Fianna Fáil being short on specifics on this issue.  When I tabled questions to the Minister for the Environment on the number of group water schemes, those sourced by local authorities and those privately sourced, the Minister could not provide me with that information. It is therefore difficult for an Opposition party to be specific about a solution to this problem.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State knows, we explained our approach at an early stage by outlining general principles and by specifying the action needed to be taken by the Minister and the Government to ensure equity.  Despite the rhetoric of the Minister of State, we know about equity. She preaches about it but we know about it and have put it into effect before.  I bow to the Minister of State's superior knowledge only in the area of negative tactics because Democratic Left has never used anything but negative tactics.</P>
      <P>In closing this debate, I wish to open the Minister's mind a little.  The debate proved to be enlightening for us on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>One would have thought the Minister, despite the pressure he obviously feels, would have had the good grace to acknowledge the commitment of these voluntary workers in rural areas.  Instead of acknowledging it or praising them, the Minister chose to insult their contribution, time and effort, not just last night but over the past four to five weeks.  This indicates his attitude to these groups.  He also shows his contempt for the local effort of these people by tabling the amendment to this Fianna Fáil motion.  Government Deputies are tonight being asked to support an amendment which the Minister hopes will kick this issue to touch until after the next general election.  He has attempted over the last three to four weeks, to avoid the issue, to avoid meeting the people involved and to avoid resolving it because he and his friends in Democratic Left have no concept of the anger and resentment felt in rural Ireland on this issue.  The Minister has decided that kicking it to touch will get it out of the way for the election so as not to affect the Labour Party and Democratic Left too seriously.</P>
      <P>The responsibility on the Minister's shoulders is a serious challenge.  His and this rainbow coalition's habit of shirking every issue will be judged by the electorate sooner rather than later.  There is probably some excuse for the attitude of Labour and Democratic Left in adopting this approach but I fail to understand why the approach is being adopted by Fine Gael.  Who would believe that, with its so-called rural roots, it would allow this to happen?  I said last night that Fine Gael is in Government but not in power.  This amendment proves that case.  Despite the obvious pressure on the Taoiseach from rural Deputies, he has managed to get them to allow Labour and Democratic Left to call the shots on this issue.  Some Fine Gael Deputies have tried to ride two horses on this issue.  I visited Mayo at the weekend and read, with great interest, the local newspaper of 29 January which reported statements by Deputy Ring and the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, who warmly welcomed the Minister's announcement on water charges.  There was not a word about group water schemes or inequity.  We all know about the different tune Deputy Ring has played on a number of occasions since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight Fine Gael Deputies have an opportunity in this House to put into effect the sentiments <Col N="1669" /> they are uttering to smooth the feathers of their electorate in rural Ireland.  Under the motion we tabled they have an opportunity to support the group water schemes in their constituencies and the Federation of Group Water Schemes set up three to four weeks ago.  If Fine Gael Deputies follow the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, through the lobbies tonight, they will endorse his policy of putting this issue on the long finger and postponing its address until after the election.  They are ignoring the real anger and hurt felt by people who have organised and availed of group water schemes in rural areas.  By walking through the lobbies with the Minister, Labour and Democratic Left, Fine Gael Deputies will be turning their back on rural Ireland.  They should know the effect that will have on them.  By that decision the electorate will know finally where Fine Gael stands.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister spoke at great length about his programme for local government.  During the past week he accused me and other Deputies of not reading what was in the document about the financing of local authorities. That document states local authorities will be empowered to vary the national rates of tax as they apply to vehicles by a margin of up to 6 per cent, there will be no increase in 1997, there will be an increase of 3 per cent in 1998 and up to a maximum of 6 per cent for 1999 and subsequent years.</P>

He tried to confuse the issue again last night when he talked about motor tax.  The Minister, the public and I know that this year motorists will pay £40 million extra in petrol and diesel to pay for the Minister's provision of free water.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I appealed to the Minister to provide for the making of some payments to group water schemes immediately to cover their running costs and expenses.  That is necessary in view of the inequitable manner in which the Minister acted.  People in rural Ireland feel they have been treated as second class citizens and that they are entitled to free water.  They will not pay fees to the schemes of which they have been members.  In many cases the schemes collect their fees in arrears and many are now facing bankruptcy.  If those schemes cease to operate because of a lack of money to meet their expenses, the Minister and his Fine Gael colleagues will be responsible and they will have to face the consequences.  The Minister believes the forthcoming election will be over in the next six to seven weeks and he will not have to face those consequences for another five years.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister gave no indication that he intended to meet representatives of the federation again to allow them to contribute their views to the study and report that is being prepared. He did not indicate a timescale for the completion of the report and study.  A timescale is necessary as this matter should not be put on the long finger.  I call on the Minister to open discussions with the federation to avoid further chaos in the coming months.  Will he give an undertaking that he will meet the federation, enter into meaningful negotiations and not say something to its members on a Thursday night and something else to us in the House on a Tuesday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the contribution by the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins.  He complimented Deputy Howlin on being the first Minister <Col N="1672" /> for the Environment for decades to take an interest in local government.  That is not complimentary to John Boland, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, Fergus O'Brien and others, not to mention the excellent Fianna Fáil Ministers for the Environment.  He mentioned there has been a constant demand from the members of local authorities for the retention of road tax.  There has been, but they want to retain it to improve the roads, not to finance local government services generally or to bail the Labour Party out of electoral difficulties in Dublin West.</P>
    <P>All this talk about a careful study and devising a scheme shows how badly prepared the Minister was for the announcement he was panicked into making before Christmas.  If he had done his job properly, he would have prepared properly for this and would have entered into discussions before he made the announcement.  He would not be trying to resolve the difficulty and alleviate the sense of grievance he has created in rural Ireland. Nobody is to blame for that but the Government. He and his colleagues in Government will pay for that in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Deputies on the Government side have an opportunity to show their support for group water schemes by voting for this motion.  If they do not they will turn their backs on rural Ireland and give in, once again, to Democratic Left and the Labour Party.  They will not be worthy of the many Fine Gael Deputies who have gone before them.  They are a party with no politics, principles or policies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution on the last occasion I congratulated the credit union movement and its membership.  The movement has been a success story and every encouragement should be given to ensure that continues.  I said that we were speaking in a vacuum in so far as I understand the Minister has agreed to table a number of amendments but we have not been fully briefed on their contents.</P>
      <P>For some time I have been closely monitoring the situation relating to the promised legislation on credit unions, An Post and the third banking force.  I have received various replies.  To illustrate my point, the Minister for Finance in reply to my Parliamentary Questions Nos. 7 and 64 of 12 March 1996 said:</P>
      <P>The issue of how the State banks might be restructured in order to achieve our objective of a vibrant and competitive banking market is such a complex and difficult one that I refuse to be rushed into recommending to the Government a particular solution to it.  We will only have one chance to get it right, and getting it right must, therefore, be given priority.</P>
      <P>I had tabled another Parliamentary Question No. 81, to the Minister for Finance on the same day. His reply was as follows:</P>
      <P>In addition to consolidating and updating existing legislation, the Credit Union Bill proposes to allow credit unions to expand their range of financial and advisory services...</P>
      <P>His reply to my Parliamentary Question No. 60 of 12 December last was as follows:</P>
      <P>Finally, a Credit Union Bill, which is currently being drafted, will broaden the range of services which credit unions can offer, thus contributing further to competition in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those extracts clearly indicate that whenever Members of the Opposition manifested an interest in this long promised Bill they were led to believe the priority was to get it right.  We were <Col N="1675" /> informed its provisions would allow for the expansion of the financial and advisory services of credit unions, thus contributing further to competition in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>In the light of the debate since its publication I am sure the Minister will readily acknowledge the Bill, as it stands, will not achieve any of the objectives outlined in the extracts I have quoted from replies to parliamentary questions.  The Minister must come clean as quickly as possible <i>vis a vis</i> his intentions in this respect, clearly enunciating what conditions he is prepared to accept to meet the requisite expansion in the delivery of credit union services.</P>
    <P>I received a communication dated 26 February 1997 from the Irish League of Credit Unions on this Bill which touches on many of the issues of which the Minister and others will be aware, such as amendments sought to further enhance the success story that is credit unions.  For example, the Irish League of Credit Unions wants a ceiling of £30,000 on shareholdings, recommends that deposits be the greater of 2 per cent of total shares or £50,000 and loans the greater of 5 per cent of total assets or £30,000.</P>
    <P>That communication refers to self-regulation, new services, offences and penalties and clearly demonstrates the level of thought given by the members of the credit union movement to the need for this Bill, the level of debate and contribution devoted to preparing their proposals and their vision for the future, which they enunciate as follows:</P>
    <P>Our vision is that credit unions will satisfy the social and economic needs of their members, with dignity and integrity by offering, in the co-operative manner and on a not-for-profit basis, full financial services for everyone in the community who wishes to join.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister received this communication from the Irish League of Credit Unions.  It goes into great detail on limits on savings and loans and the impact of this Bill, as it stands, along with the need to have its recommendations and suggestions taken into account.</P>
    <P>In recent days I was in communication with a voluntary member of the Artane-Coolock Credit Union.  We owe a great deal to the credit union movement, its membership and volunteers for their excellent work.  He highlighted the fact that the movement is prepared to accommodate its members and be more flexible than any other financial institution in meeting their requests. Within my constituency there are credit unions at Clontarf, Coolock-Artane, Donnycarney, Beaumont and District, East Wall, Fairview and Marino with a massive membership and an enormous level of activity.</P>
    <P>Assuming the Minister was serious in responding to my parliamentary questions last year in relation to the expansion and broadening of the range of services provided by credit unions, I am impatient to see an amended Bill.  I plead <Col N="1676" /> with him to take into account the submission of the Irish League of Credit Unions dated 26 February 1997.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all other Members I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate which I hope will lead to the further development of the credit union movement.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on introducing this Bill which had been a long time in gestation.</P>
      <P>Members of credit unions in all constituencies, quite rightly, have been lobbying all Members of the House in recent months.  Within my constituency there are credit union branches in Tipperary town, the village of Bansha, Clonmel, Cahir, Cashel and Carrick-on-Suir in addition to some subsidiary offices, all of whose members were concerned that, in the event of any further delay, this Bill might not see the light of day.</P>
      <P>Whenever Members of the Opposition raised the matter of its introduction on the Order of Business, there was always a positive reaction from the Government.  Any perusal of the Bill, as it stands, would lead to one readily understand the delay involved in its preparation.  We have endeavoured to reach some measure of consensus among all those involved.  I congratulate the Minister on achieving that, and on his extensive consultation before its final drafting.</P>
      <P>This Bill will have an impact on all our local communities, yet it is under-rated by the media and political commentators.  A true indication of its significance is to be found in the number of Members who have already contributed to this debate and others who no doubt will want to contribute reflecting their constituents' views.  This is a testament to the impact of this legislation on the whole credit union movement since its foundation in 1958.  No social movement has had such an impact on the lives of so many citizens as the credit union movement.  It is in daily touch with the ordinary people in towns and villages in times of need and when the moneylenders are creating havoc in households on the periphery of society. This is important legislation for an important social movement which has an impact across both urban and rural society.  No movement has been so successful and so in tune with the needs of the people as the credit union movement.</P>
      <P>I listened to the debate last week and I join with my colleagues in paying tribute to the founders of the credit union movement and others involved in developing small credit unions throughout the country.  The society we represent and those involved in credit unions owe them a deep sense of gratitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that the Bill will continue to emphasise the community spirit which has motivated the credit union movement since its inception in 1958.  There is a fear that it could forget the reason for its existence.  Without a legal framework or constraints in this legislation what <Col N="1677" /> would prevent the development of credit unions into commercial banks?  I doubt that would happen. We are providing a statutory framework for a movement which has grown enormously with popular support and will continue to develop apace.  It is right that the embodying principle of the movement is again enshrined in statute.</P>
    <P>All sides will welcome the Minister's willingness to consider amendments on Committee Stage.  It is consistent with the open and inclusive manner in which the Government has operated in consultation with the people directly involved at the coalface.  The Minister's response is reassuring in that the Bill as published is now before the House.  He is conscientious enough to realise that sections of the Bill need clarification, if not amendment.  Some reservations have been raised by the credit union movement and the Irish League of Credit Unions.</P>
    <P>My colleagues have addressed some of these issues, including the maximum limits on shares and loans.  I listened to the Minister's contribution on Second Stage and his explanation of the reason limits were chosen.  One can understand there are legal constraints in setting limits and perhaps the Revenue Commissioners had some reservations.  These fears have been raised by the Irish League of Credit Unions and those of us who are dealing regularly with people who use the facilities of the credit union movement. They are real fears and the limits will impinge on some of the movement's more recent activities which are consistent with their founding principles. I am worried that they may be stymied by limits set down and may not be able to expand into our booming economy by playing their rightful role in the area of financial transactions and in the provision of funding for housing projects, house building and house purchase.  We recognise the need for direct involvement by financial institutions in the Government's programme of social housing.  This aspect alone is an important factor in communities everywhere.  If we do not shackle the credit union movement it will play an important role in the future financing of the housing sector, which is only one aspect of its operations. It assists people who would not be listened to or recognised by some of the commercial banking institutions.  These are areas for the small investor and the small borrower.  Due to the changing values of money and the booming economy and people's ability to repay reasonable percentages of their total income I have no doubt the limits set down in the Bill can be examined by the Minister.  I hope he will treat that aspect of the submission from the Irish League of Credit Unions with the seriousness it deserves.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his response to representations I made to him on behalf of various bodies in County Tipperary.  I have no doubt he will be amenable to suggestions when the Bill goes to Committee Stage.  The credit union movement can be involved in all areas of economic development.  The movement represents an emerging force in the housing sector and a considerable <Col N="1678" /> assistance to the Government's policy. It would not be appropriate for any Bill to stymie the efforts of the credit union movement to develop into this sector.  Given the representations made to me it is essential to ensure the credit union movement is able and, by statute, capable of delivering a service into new areas of finance and financial assistance.  I am sure the Bill will not stymie developments in this sector.  It is not beyond the powers of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to conceive of regulations to ensure this does not arise.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has raised its concerns about section 41.  Its view appears to be that if the House is putting a registrar in place to regulate the development of the credit union movement along guiding principles, why not give him or her the leeway to do so?</P>
    <P>I welcome the broad terms of the Bill.  No other industry in the State is developing as rapidly as the financial services sector.  My colleague, Deputy Gallagher, said during this debate last week that he saw potential for the credit union movement to become a benevolent third banking force.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, has advocated the need for a third financial services institution outside the commercial banking sector which will meet the needs of smaller borrowers and depositors, one that is friendly and understanding of their needs and not seek guarantors and the other requirements sought by commercial banks.</P>
    <P>If one is a depositor with the credit union, regardless of the size of the deposit, one is considered favourably when one seeks to borrow, whether the amount is a fraction or a multiple of one's deposit.  It is possible through this legislation to ensure the credit union movement, together with An Post and other agencies of the State, becomes a third banking force in Ireland. It can be regulated and user friendly and it will not cream off millions of pounds in profits, which other financial institutions do with little regard for the social consequences.  That development would not be possible under the 1966 Act, which is why it was necessary to update the legislation in this new dynamic form.</P>
    <P>We have the basis of good legislation and the credit union movement recognises this.  Most of its proposed amendments should not present difficulty for the Minister of State.  I look forward to the Bill being suitably amended on Committee Stage to take on board the reasonable suggestions of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  I support the Bill and I hope the Minister of State will respond favourably to the views expressed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Credit Union Bill was a long time in preparation and its publication was as a result of pressure from this side of the House and the legitimate lobbying of the credit union movement, its volunteers and members.  Our task is to ensure it will provide a basis for the movement to develop in a sound but workable regulatory <Col N="1679" /> environment.  The tragedy is that the Bill will not allow such development and it is thus unacceptable to the credit union movement.</P>
      <P>Various fundamental issues must be addressed. The credit union movement has done an excellent job in briefing Deputies on all sides of the House on how these issues should be handled.  In the first instance, the Bill does not provide the flexibility that is necessary for development.  The absolute monetary limits are unrealistic and have no rational basis.  These restrictions do not currently apply and limits expressed in percentage terms are required to cater for the range and diversity of the credit unions.  Second, the regulatory powers in the Bill go far beyond the requirements of prudent supervision and extend to the internal affairs of credit unions.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement is not opposed to regulation.  It has put forward a basis on which the respective roles of the registrar and the movement can be fully recognised.  Section 94 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, provides a basis for coexistence and co-operation between the movement and the registrar and is, in the opinion of the credit union movement, the only workable and acceptable solution.  I support the movement's case.  The practical implications of the provisions relating to the new services are unrealistic and need to be amended.  The over-emphasis on, and repetition of, offences and penalties in the Bill needs to be reconsidered to ensure the operation of credit unions is not seriously impaired.</P>
      <P>The movement has submitted 82 amendments which they view as fundamental.  I hope the Minister of State will listen to the opinions of the credit union movement.  If not, the Bill will be detrimental to the movement and ultimately to the country.  That must not happen.  I am not exaggerating when I say that.  This movement has branches in every parish and they have done extraordinarily good work.  There are many strong credit unions in my constituency which are well supported and utilised by the local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vision of the Irish credit union movement was illustrated by its strategic plan which was presented at the annual general meeting of the Irish League of Credit Unions in 1996.  Its vision, with which every Member can agree, is that credit unions will satisfy the social and economic needs of their members with dignity and integrity by offering, in a co-operative manner and on a not-for-profit basis, full financial services for everybody in the community who wishes to join.  That vision embodies the philosophy and ethos of the movement but it is undermined by this Bill.  That is a tragedy.  It is a tragedy that Deputies on all sides of the House must ask the Minister of State to amend this legislation.  Having waited so long for this Bill, it is a tragedy that the Minister of State and the Government should make such a fundamental error in its drafting that the vision and philosophy of the credit union movement will be undermined by it.  How out of touch can a <Col N="1680" /> Government be?  There is great need for the Minister of State to listen carefully to Members of the House and to the representations made by the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>Many features of the Bill will hinder the development of credit unions and frustrate the work of their 12,000 volunteers who demonstrate the value of the co-operative, self help approach to economic development in local communities. While the credit union movement has excellent permanent employees, its real strength lies in its core of volunteer workers who are willing to use their expertise in various areas to benefit their neighbours and community.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement has identified a number of issues which it believes are of paramount importance.  In this context, it is important to remember that the movement represents 427 credit unions which have assets of between £500,000 and £55 million, no mean sum.  This diversity is an indication of the strength and representative nature of the movement which should not be threatened by the Minister or Government of the day or by this House.  We must have faith in the credit union movement, give recognition to its achievements and introduce the amendments it regards as essential to meet its future needs.</P>
    <P>The success of the credit union movement lies in its voluntary and community nature.  The movement wants to move forward and, in this respect, it has identified certain sections of the legislation which need to be fundamentally amended.  It is incumbent on us to introduce these changes and not argue against them on some ideological grounds, as the Minister is wont to do. The credit union movement deserves our trust and support.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendments which will be tabled by us on Committee Stage.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has made the not insignificant statement that it is worried many of the proposals in the Bill will pose a threat to the unity of the credit union movement.  No Government should contemplate the enactment of legislation which threatens the unity of the credit union movement.  It is, therefore, incumbent on the Minister to accept amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I know from my experience in Government that the Minister discussed the legislation in detail with the decent men and women in his Department who try to do their best in preparing legislation and offering advice.  In most cases they are wedded to their conclusions and are reluctant to change them.  However, this issue is too important to adopt such an approach.  The credit union movement is important to every parish and most citizens.  I appeal to the Minister to listen to the credit union movement; it deserves nothing less.</P>
    <P>The proposed limits on shares and deposits are unacceptable to the movement.  It is proposed to increase the limit on shares from £6,000, as set down under the 1966 Act, to £20,000.  The limit of £30,000 which we seek is not unreasonable. <Col N="1681" /> Under credit union rules deposits may not exceed 100 per cent of shares.  No monetary limit was set on deposits under the 1966 Act and it is proposed to set a limit on these of £20,000.  The proposal by the credit union movement that the limit should be 2 per cent of total shares or £50,000, whichever is the greater, deserves our support. The reason given for this proposal is that while the bulk of savings in credit unions are held by small savers &mdash; the average is £1,300 &mdash; some individuals have savings in excess of £40,000.  At present 68 credit unions have members with savings in this region.  Any unnecessary restriction on the credibility of a credit union to raise funds will impede its growth.  It is of fundamental importance that the limit on deposits reflects a percentage of shares and is not an absolute monetary limit.</P>
    <P>Unlike banks, insurance companies and building societies, credit unions do not want to make commercial gains, rather they want to look after their members' interests.  The credit union movement has never incurred a loss, which is more than can be said for some financial institutions.  I remember when it was thought State institutions would fall as a result of the Allied Irish Banks-ICI affair.  We had to use taxpayers' money to prop up these institutions.  The credit union movement is concerned only with community development and it deserves our support.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the proposed limits on loans.  The 1996 Act limits credit union loans to a term not exceeding five years.  It is proposed that 20 per cent of loans should be for a period exceeding five years and 10 per cent should be for a period exceeding ten years.  I welcome this relaxation but not the proposed limit on loans.  There is currently no monetary limit on loans but a £20,000 limit is proposed in this legislation.  The credit union movement is suggesting a limit of 5 per cent of total assets or £30,000, whichever is the greater.  It argues that while the vast majority of credit union loans are small, to be paid back over a short duration, there is a substantial market for loans in excess of £20,000.  Currently, 132 credit unions give loans in this category and, given the potential growth in loan demand as a result of the extension of the loan terms, it is more appropriate to consider the current number of loans in the £10,000 to £20,000 category which are given by 293 credit unions.  It is clear that demand for loans in excess of £20,000 will increase. I appeal to the Minister of State to listen to the representations from the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>The proposed monetary limits on savings and loans are unacceptable to the credit union movement. A compromise solution which raises the monetary limits, without allowing for the percentage solution indicated, will not be acceptable because it would impede the development potential of credit unions and divide the movement, with larger credit unions in particular seeking a different legal framework in which to operate.  If that happened it would be a tragedy because the <Col N="1682" /> unity of purpose and vision of the credit union movement, as outlined in its 1996 AGM document, <i>Protecting the Future Together</i>, should not be damaged by legislation which is intended to improve the potential for development of the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>For 38 years the credit unions affiliated to the Irish League of Credit Unions were subject to self-supervision through a comprehensive self-regulatory system.  This is operated centrally by the league through the management of the movement's savings protection scheme which has strict rules and procedures.  I hope the Minister of State listens to the proposals put forward by the movement in that regard and in respect of new services, offences and penalties.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State brought forward the Bill as a result of pressure.  We welcome it but, in its present form, it is unacceptable to the credit union movement which has proposed 82 amendments. As a former Minister I recognise that in publishing the Bill the Minister of State would have discussed it with his officials, who would have given their own views, and then published the legislation.  To some extent Ministers are married to the legislation they produce because it is the result of cogent, well argued points.  I appeal to the Minister of State not to allow the fact that he brought forward the Bill blind him to the issues raised by the credit union movement.  I ask him to listen to the reasons put forward by the movement for the changes and to accept those changes as an act of faith in a movement that has done such a wonderful job for the people of this country and, in a special way, for the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As my party's spokesperson on social welfare, and a former Minister for Social Welfare, I have a particular interest in credit unions and their work.  Credit unions form an enormous voluntary co-operative.  They play an important part in the development of our country because they have helped people who started out with small savings become substantial savers. They taught them how to make use of the funds available in an organised way.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies came forward to speak on the Bill because they know credit unions play a vital part in their local communities.  They know they have contributed substantially to the development and modernisation of those communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit unions have played an important part in tackling issues of poverty and disadvantage.  I know that from my work as a public representative and, before that, as a worker in the community. In those early days, the banks played a part in tackling those issues through their individual managers.  It was possible at that time to negotiate with an individual bank manager to get a family out of difficulty.  It is difficult to do that today unless the credit worthiness of the individual is well established.  I brought many families to the banks 20 or 30 years ago, and the banks established the credit worthiness of those families merely by the honesty of the individuals concerned. <Col N="1683" /> They took a chance on them and it was rare for the banks to be caught out.  When they were, it was only for a couple of hundred pounds.</P>
    <P>People learned to save with banks in those days, as many learned to save with the credit unions.  However, banking has changed.  Local managers have less authority and autonomy in dealing with their own local communities.  I realise banks are part of a world of competition, investment, return on investment and profit, but we meet the people on the ground and know the difficulties they face.</P>
    <P>The credit unions helped in tackling the problems of people in need who could not get support. They developed that work and gave succour to the population to discourage them from going to moneylenders.  There were more moneylenders in those days than people realised.  We carried out a study which showed the extent of the moneylending problem.  People did not understand the percentages being charged by moneylenders.  They thought 25 per cent over six weeks seemed like a reasonable deal but, when taken on an annual basis, it was enormous.  To the person who needed money urgently and who had nowhere else to go, the moneylender had a role to play.</P>
    <P>The research indicated that the moneylending habit was passed on from mother to daughter.  A culture of moneylending was clearly highlighted by the research.  That problem had to be addressed but who was there to address it?  The credit unions were there and they pioneered the work in tackling the problem of moneylending. The Lough Credit Union in Cork did great work in tackling moneylending problems and expended much of its facilities and resources in doing that. I am sure that, at times, they wondered what they were doing and whether they would be successful in helping people to break away from moneylenders &mdash; at times they had to face physical and other challenges and sometimes ended up in court.  That is history now, but it was the voluntary non-profit-making credit unions who did that work.  When we came to tackle that problem on a national basis, we turned to the credit unions. They are the salt of the earth.  The Department of Social Welfare was able to work with them.  A small scheme was devised which has now become the highly successful MABS &mdash; money, advice and budgeting system &mdash; as a result of credit unions, the local society of St. Vincent de Paul, community welfare officers and the Department of Social Welfare working as a team to tackle the issues.  The credit unions played a central role in that.</P>
    <P>I mention these issues because in speaking of the Central Bank, regulation and control, one is inclined to forget that this is about people.  The Central Bank is far removed from the people but the credit unions are not, and those who work voluntarily to keep the credit unions going are on the ground working with people.  The household budgeting system, under which deductions are made, originated in the Department of Social <Col N="1684" /> Welfare as did many such schemes.  Necessity is the mother of invention and if one has initiative and is prepared to tackle problems, new systems will be developed.  In Dublin, the household budgeting system has been effective in so far as the payment of rent, ESB and other regular household bills are concerned.</P>
    <P>To operate properly in this area, credit unions need a number of facilities, including that of electronic fund transfers and the legislation that goes with it.  The movement is developing and improving to meet modern needs.  It is doing work which has a large voluntary element and has become much more professional.  It is managing huge amounts of money.  People are dealing with the credit unions and are happy with them.  If people are concerned about elements in the Bill, it is only natural that Deputies in this House are also concerned.  Some 80 amendments have already been suggested and there will be more as the Bill goes through Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is concern about four key points &mdash; the limits on savings and loans, self-regulation, the ability to introduce new services, and offences and penalties.  The Bill provides for 20,000 shares. Several Deputies have already mentioned that they would like to see this increased to 30,000.  In this modern age it would be almost criminal to refuse such a request.  Regarding deposits, the Bill provides for £20,000 and there is a demand that it should be £50,000 or 2 per cent of total shares, whichever is the greater.  This seems reasonable. Under the Bill, loans are restricted to £20,000 but people want the limit to be 5 per cent of total assets or £30,000 in loans.  Several Deputies have said that £30,000 does not constitute a very substantial loan nowadays.  It is not exorbitant and there is still a reasonably controlled approach which is beneficial.</P>
    <P>The credit unions have their own approach and vision.  They operate in a co-operative way as a not-for-profit organisation offering the fullest possible financial services to everyone in the community who wishes to join.  Their demands seem reasonable for people who have contributed so much to the country and its development &mdash; that hidden development which one does not read about in the newspapers or in Central Bank reports but which occurs.  It is only when it has happened that we suddenly realise the difficulties and disadvantages people had to overcome and the credit unions had a major part to play in that.</P>
    <P>The movement feels badly about the Bill.  It believes its position is being undermined. However, the work of the 12,000 volunteers is worthy of support.  There are some 427 credit unions with assets varying in amount between £500,000 and £55 million.  There is huge diversity and great strength among credit unions.  They have problems and there are issues to be faced.  I am quite certain the Minister and his officials will identify these and put it to the credit unions that it is necessary to regulate them.</P>
    <P>In practical terms, the limits which are proposed will have a detrimental effect on credit <Col N="1685" /> unions.  It will result in some of their members turning away from them.  It is fundamental to them that the limits set on deposits should reflect a percentage of the credit union's shares and should not be an absolute monetary limit.  The current credit union legislation has no individual limit on deposits which a member can hold.  This has not caused major problems over the years. The Minister should not jump to say that there was a little problem here or another problem there.  The banks have huge problems; if this House and country did not support the banks they would have even greater problems. However, we all work within society and, at the end of the day, politics has a huge influence on all those activities.  The credit unions wonder why the rules are being changed adversely.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has heard enough about this issue from both sides of the House to know that he must look at it very seriously.  I will not repeat what has been said, but the question of self-regulation and proper recognition of the league and what it is doing is important to the credit unions.  It must be recognised that all credit unions operate under rules which are approved by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.</P>
    <P>In addition, for 38 years credit unions affiliated to the Irish League of Credit Unions have been subject to self-supervision through a comprehensive self-regulatory system which is operated centrally by the league through the management of the movement's own savings protection scheme which has strict rules and procedures.  That was set up by the movement on a voluntary basis in 1989, which is evidence of the responsibility of the league.  The SPS currently holds funds of £28.7 million, representing 1.2 per cent of savings, exceeding the actuarially recognised norm for credit unions worldwide of 1 per cent and far in excess of the 0.2 per cent represented by the deposit guarantee scheme of commercial financial institutions.  Credit unions are careful and prudent; they are not spendthrift.</P>
    <P>The rules of the SPS set out prudential management procedures, standards and ratios which must be adhered to and require credit unions to carry fidelity bonding for all its employees and volunteers.  Under the SPS a credit union will receive an inspection visit from the league's monitoring division at least once every 15 months, and in 1996, 317 credit unions received such an inspection.  The SPS copperfastens the other levels of support to protect members' savings &mdash; these are numerous and are well known to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Credit unions want to provide new services and regard as important the system whereby the registrar approves additional services, recognises that such services may be of many different types and introduces approval mechanisms which are appropriate to these differences.  They would like to provide services such as ATM machines, with a body such as the league to develop the service, set up conditions and procedures and make a single application for approval.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> In regard to self-regulation, the movement has two fundamental problems with the regulation proposed in the Bill.  First, the Irish League of Credit Unions is not recognised as a supervisory body with the appropriate powers to set standards, carry out inspections and enforce the rules of the savings protection scheme, even though the league, on behalf of the movement, administers this scheme.  Without such recognition, the movement will not be able to continue in the way in which it has operated for almost 40 years.  That is a fundamental issue for credit unions.  Second, while for the first time the Bill makes it obligatory for credit unions to be members of a savings protection scheme, it also removes control of the movement's scheme from itself and subjects it to the control of the registrar.  That is a basic attack on the self-help, independent ethos of the credit union movement, about which it is very concerned.</P>
    <P>The work being done in this area is valuable and important to the development of the credit union movement on an organised and regulated basis.  The Minister should, however, listen to the credit union movement.  As the practitioner in this area, it makes a huge contribution to the local community and the Minister should work with the movement rather than against it.</P>

      <P>I am not sure.  I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this long-awaited Bill, which has been in gestation for a number of years.  Given all the discussions that took place between the Minister's office and the credit union movement, we would have expected general acceptance for the Bill, but unfortunately that is not the case.  Notwithstanding that, I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill to this stage.  In recent years we all had discussions with credit unions in our areas which were anxious that a Bill would be published.  We have an opportunity now to get matters right for the years ahead to ensure the movement continues to grow and develop on the basis on which it was founded.</P>
      <P>Since 1958 when the credit union movement was established there has been phenomenal growth.  The credit union movement has a national profile, with 432 credit unions &mdash; the number is increasing all the time &mdash; membership of about 1.7 million people and £2 billion in savings. Considering that the 1966 Act impacted on only a small number of credit unions, there was need to update the legislation to ensure that credit unions were put on a solid footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the problems experienced by commercial banks over the years and we hope similar problems will not arise for credit unions, particularly given that the majority of people who <Col N="1687" /> have invested funds in credit unions are not well off but, without sounding superior, are mostly working class people.  Nowadays white collar workers, people living in new housing estates who pay vast amounts of money for their houses, go to the credit union for money to furnish their houses and help finance the necessities such as televisions, cookers, furniture and so on.  It is vitally important that rules and regulations are introduced to ensure the future of credit unions.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there was great panic at the likelihood that Allied Irish Banks would go down the tubes, thereby causing great problems for the economy.  If credit unions were to go under it would have a detrimental effect on the thousands of people who save with them.</P>
    <P>The Credit Union Movement developed mainly through the work of volunteers' whom I compliment for giving freely of their time and effort over the past 40 years.  While full-time workers are employed in some of the larger credit unions, the movement could not have developed without the unselfish effort of voluntary workers and directors.</P>
    <P>I have first hand experience of the operations of credit unions through my profession as an accountant before being elected to the House and in my dealings with constituents.  I appreciate the assistance provided by the movement to people who need finance.  Some of those they assist would not be entertained by other financial institutions. In the 1960s and 1970s if one had a good reference one could get finance from a bank. However, nowadays when one seeks a loan from a bank one's details are put into a computer and sent to a central processing depot and unless one has a perfect financial record one will not be facilitated.  There is no flexibility in the matter. Credit unions are able to help people whom the banks will not entertain because they fell behind in paying back loans.  Credit unions have given many people back their confidence.  Were it not for them many people would not have the necessities in life.  Credit unions have helped people buy new cookers, kitchens, televisions, and to pay for funerals and school fees.</P>
    <P>There are some excellent credit unions in my constituency.  The Mitchelstown Credit Union was one of the forerunners.</P>

      <P>And rightly so.  Mitchelstown Creameries provided a good deal of employment and cash flow in that part of the constituency when the credit union was first established.  The credit union movement has spread to many small towns and villages and given a tremendous service to local communities.  Credit unions have been set up in Fermoy, Midleton, Youghal, Carrigtwohill, Cobh and Mallow.  There are also branch offices in smaller villages and I have not <Col N="1688" /> heard any complaints about the services they provide.</P>
      <P>According to a Mr. Paddy Conlon in New Ross, County Wexford, the ethos of the credit union is co-operation.  In a letter to the <i>Examiner</i> on 13 February 1997 he stated the movement is a distinct socio-economic system based on a set of well defined principles which underpin three fundamental strands in the social and economic development of individuals and groups.  He stated that they uphold the dignity of the individual, ensure a fair sharing of the fruits of labour and promote subsidiarity, encourage self reliance and empower people to provide for all their needs through their own efforts.  He went on to state that this Bill would destroy the ethos of the credit union, but I do not believe it will.  However, it should not interfere with those three fundamental strands.  All co-operative movements are set up to develop local communities.</P>
      <P>The main concerns about the Bill have been mentioned by many speakers and I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with them.  I hope he will address them on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The debate on this legislation has gone on for so long that a new Government may have formed by the time it is completed.</P>
      <P>The limits imposed on shares, deposits and loans are unacceptable to the Irish League of Credit Unions.  In 1966 a limit of £6,000 was put on shares.  That limit is now £20,000, but the league wants it increased to £30,000.  If indexation were taken into account I am sure that figure would be much higher than £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The £6,000 limit was set in 1986 and would be roughly £9,000 now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the 1966 Act?  The matter can be discussed further on Committee Stage.  The league wants the limit on deposits increased to £50,000.  I accept that if an individual placed a large sum of money on deposit in a credit union he or she could control it, but the £20,000 limit should not apply to all credit unions. Given the difference between credit unions in terms of deposits, placing a limit of £20,000 should be reconsidered on a percentage basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the limit on loans, £20,000 is a substantial figure but some people could afford to borrow more.  If they are willing to invest their money in the local community, they should be facilitated.  The £20,000 limit should be reconsidered before Committee State to see if it is possible to increase it, although if we increase it the limit will become the rule rather than the exception.  If we want to keep money in the community, we should make this facility available, <Col N="1689" /> otherwise people will lodge it in one of the large financial institutions.</P>
    <P>We will discuss the Bill further on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will take on board concerns expressed by the Irish League of Credit Unions about limits, self-regulation, new services and offences and penalties.  We must ensure that when the Bill is enacted, it copperfastens the future of credit unions which have benefited the communities they served.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  I join Deputies on both sides of the House in welcoming the thrust of the Bill, although I have similar reservations to those expressed by most speakers so far.  I compliment the Minister of State and his officials on introducing this detailed Bill. Obviously, much painstaking effort and work went into producing this comprehensive regulatory framework for the credit union sector.  That the Taoiseach was asked so often on the Order of Business about the legislation illustrated the widespread interest in it.  The Irish League of Credit Unions implemented a successful information campaign for the benefit of public representatives to highlight the need to introduce legislation and deal with the concerns it expressed to us at national and branch meetings.</P>
      <P>In County Cavan credit unions are located in Ballyconnell, Cootehill, Cavan, Bailieboro, Ballyjamesduff, Kingscourt, Shercock, Ardagh, Killeshandra and Ballinagh.  Such a considerable number of branches in a county with a population of 50,000 shows how important the credit union movement is not only to rural areas, but to urban ones.  Recently, I spoke to members of a branch which was established about ten years ago.  The chairman of the branch told me it had 2,077 members.  A considerable number of people in a small sparsely populated community have shown their commitment and faith in the credit union movement.  Its membership comprises people from all income groups and the typical borrower and investor represents all shades of opinion in the community.  The chairman also told me that the bulk of borrowing is for productive purposes &mdash; for example, the provision of machinery on a farm, additional accommodation in a private residence or improvement works to a farm or a small business.  It is, therefore, important the Minister gives favourable consideration to the league's request to lift the cap on borrowing.</P>
      <P>Many young people are familiar with the credit union movement because of its sponsorship of the National Community Games.  The members of the credit unions, like the members of the community games, give voluntarily.  Great credit is due to people in both movements who provide an essential and formidable network of voluntary activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the credit union sector is seen as the poor relation in the financial services sector, perhaps due to a perverse and misguided perception of big being beautiful in financial matters. <Col N="1690" /> The nature of personal and corporate finance has changed radically in the 30 years since the legislation on credit unions was last addressed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The economic infrastructure underlying financial activity has also changed.  We have moved from being a predominantly agricultural society with our trading activity unhealthily concentrated on transactions with our nearest neighbour to a modern industrialised economy with global trade and financial links.  The electronic and information technology revolutions have made, and continue to make, significant changes in the way money transactions are effected.  The cashless society has not arrived but cash on paper plays an increasingly less dominant role in how we manage our personal and collective financial affairs.</P>
    <P>The credit union structure has developed into a strong and essential component of our financial institution infrastructure.  It is appropriate that the regulatory arrangements pertaining to it be renewed and undated to ensure it provides the appropriate climate for the credit union sector to continue to play its role.  The credit union sector's importance lies not merely in that its assets have risen to £2 billion or that there are more than 400 member unions in the sector, but in its being the sole financial institution whose door is open to those on limited incomes.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have played a valuable role in helping people on modest means to manage their incomes and expenditure prudently.  There is a perception, which the banks do little to discourage, that the banking sector is not interested in customers dependent on a social welfare income or a basic wage.  The bank and building society sectors target customers who are essentially in the middle income bracket.  The local credit union has often stood between the hard pressed social welfare dependant and the clutches of the loan shark.</P>
    <P>It has adopted a sympathetic and practical approach to the needs of the small investor and borrower and provided many a hard pressed family with a mechanism for clawing their way back from unexpected health or job loss crises and adjusting to living within their means.  In so doing the sector has proved that providing a sympathetic approach to personal finance is not a risky practice.  There has been a satisfactory safeguarding of the assets of credit unions.  Confidence in the trustworthiness of customers has not been misplaced.</P>
    <P>Much attention has been focused on the £20,000 loan limit.  No one disputes the necessity to maintain the ethos of the credit union sector as a lender and deposit holder specialising in small personal and family transactions.  However, £20,000 is not as considerable a sum as one might think.  A modest development on the part of a small business or farmer could easily exceed that amount.  One hopes it will not be another 30 years before this House revisits the provisions the Minister of State is proposing to enact.  We should think of how low the purchasing power of that sum will have plummeted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> Has the Minister of State given any consideration to allowing himself and his successors flexibility in this connection?  Would it be a feasible alternative to specify a higher limit, or perhaps none and allow the Minister of State to determine maximum limits from time to time by way of ministerial order?  The limit could be set initially at his preferred level which I hope would be in excess of £20,000.  Both he and his successors would have the option of reviewing the limit upwards in the light of experience.  Unfortunately, the threshold set seems to have been interpreted in some quarters as an effort to spancel the credit union sector to some degree, which I am sure is a misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>We live in an era of competition in which the traditional demarcation between financial institutions is becoming blurred.  The demutualisation of one building society and the extension of others into activities which have traditionally been the preserve of banks has been a positive development as far as consumers are concerned. It would not necessarily be a bad thing to have the stronger and more ambitious credit unions diversify into providing a wider range of services. It is important to remember that the customers of credit unions to some degree are not customers of banks.  They should have access to as wide a range of financial services as possible and to modern methods of completing money transactions.</P>
    <P>I compliment the many people throughout the country who have given loyal and dedicated service to furthering the aims and workings of their local credit union network.  They give of their time voluntarily for the benefit of the local community who share in its success.  Without the voluntary effort, diligence and commitment on their part, the credit union movement would not be as successful.  The fact that we are asking for the borrowing limits to be raised is an indication that the Oireachtas has the utmost confidence in its trustworthiness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is quoted in a newspaper article as saying that he will consider increasing the loan limit of £20,000 by way of amendment on Committee Stage, provided the Irish League of Credit Unions makes a convincing case and he can be persuaded there is a significant number of ordinary people with more than £40,000 to invest in their local credit union.  As the Minister of State is aware, there are 427 credit unions of varying size with assets ranging from £500,000 to £55 million.</P>
      <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions has made the point that the loan limit of £20,000 will cause major problems, in terms of the range of services credit unions will be able to offer, and impact greatly on the number of people with a significant stake.  A total of 132 credit unions have provided loans in excess of £20,000 while 293 have made loans of between £10,000 and £20,000 available. The demand for loans in excess of £20,000 is likely to increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> I can understand the reasons the Minister of State does not want credit unions to compete with banks and other financial institutions but the imposition of a monetary limit will impede their development.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has suggested a figure of £30,000 or 5 per cent of total assets, whichever is the greater.  It has made a convincing case.  The Minister of State should be amenable to accepting its proposition.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that credit unions operate under the rules of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  A total of £28.7 million is available under the savings protection scheme. This represents 1.2 per cent of total savings. Although self-regulated, credit unions have been well managed and there have been regular inspections.  The money is in safe hands.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions is seeking recognition by the Registrar of Friendly Societies. The Minister of State met its representatives prior to the introduction of the Bill.  This provided an opportunity for a deep discourse on what the Minister of State is trying to achieve. Many of the Bill's provisions are laudable.  There is such a measure of agreement on the Bill and such acceptance of its provisions that it would be appropriate in the circumstances if the Minister of State were to concede on the three issues outlined to him.  He would not overstep the mark and would improve the Bill.  In the circumstances, will the Minister accept amendments to this effect on Committee Stage?</P>

      <P>I raised the matter of Cork school funding to highlight the appalling conditions under which children attending St. Mary's special school in Rochestown must operate due to the breakdown of the heating system.  It is disgraceful that their needs have been ignored for so long. On a number of days since January, the school has had to close and the children were sent home due to freezing conditions.  Children and staff should not have to endure conditions such as this. Over the past four years, the level of heating in the school has regularly fallen markedly below the acceptable regulation temperature of 16 degrees celsius and the level was nearer to ten to 12 degrees in areas of the school on occasion. Such conditions are in breach of the Government's Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  It is not possible for the school authorities to use alternative heating as the electrical system is not capable of safely providing the additional voltage.  There would be a danger of causing a <Col N="1693" /> serious fire hazard and gas heaters are not allowed in schools for obvious reasons of safety. While most schools close immediately when the temperature is below the regulation level, it is not possible for St. Mary's to send its pupils home once they arrive.  The school transport route serves Blarney, Kinsale and Cork city centre as well as intermediate areas of city and county.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, the board of management has worked tirelessly to secure departmental approval to replace the heating and electrical systems in the school.  The board has found the process a most frustrating experience.  All its consultants' preparatory work has been accepted and approved by the Department.  The school requires sanction to proceed to tender and to acquire the necessary funds to ensure the immediate start of the project.  Otherwise, children will continue to be sent home with the difficulties this entails for parents, staff and the children. The work will cost about £200,000.  The Minister has a budget this year of more than £100 million.</P>
      <P>This project is urgent, demanding an emergency response and I am disappointed the Minister for Education is not present this evening to address the issue and to respond to it.  I mean no offence to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, who will give her reply but it is disgraceful the Minister is not here.  She said in the Dáil a number of weeks ago that emergency funding was allocated to projects which fulfilled the necessary criteria.  This project demands such an emergency response and I fail to understand why St. Mary's cannot be funded under this heading. Deputy Peter Barry wrote to the school principal on 22 January 1997 stating that the project was included in the budget Estimates.  I have no doubt he was acting in good faith but who told him this? I would appreciate it if the Minister would clarify that.  She should act urgently given the circumstances and the obvious need to allow these children to attend their school in comfort and under conditions which will not militate against their health and wellbeing.  I appeal to the Minister to make funding available to ensure immediate construction.</P>

      <P>This is a school for children with special needs.  The Government and the Department of Education must ensure everything possible is done for such a school.  It has had problems with heating and the electrical system over a number of years and has had to close for five days since Christmas.  Imagine those special children in a classroom wearing overcoats and gloves because of the cold.  Imagine the frustration parents and teachers feel as a result. Imagine the organisational difficulties in closing such a school on a day when the children cannot be sent home because parents may be out of the house.  Someone must be in the house to receive them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> It is extraordinary that special funding was to be provided for this school and Government Ministers indicated it was provided.  It is extraordinary that the Minister, replying to my question of a month ago, indicated she would examine this project in terms of providing funding, yet the parents and relatives of these children have had to take to the streets to highlight the issue.  Action must be taken now and the paltry sum of £200,000 provided immediately.</P>

The case has been made by my colleagues.  I strongly urge the Minister to ensure the necessary funding is provided immediately to solve this problem. There is enough pressure on the parents of children with special needs attending the school and I strongly urge the Minister to rectify the situation and announce that funding will be provided to carry out the necessary works immediately.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the heating works is that the Department advised the school management to engage a consulting engineer to report on the heating installation.

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me the opportunity to raise the important matter of the provision of adequate ferry space to the UK market in particular.  Anyone with an interest in agriculture knows the live trade has been cut to third country markets.  There is a market for it in Europe, but that is not facilitated because we do not have adequate ferry facilities.  This trade is important because it is a safety valve and it is an insurance against factory cartels.  Not alone is a lack of a ferry service a problem, but many farmers believe the Minister is colluding in allowing this problem continue.</P>

      <P>IFA President John Donnelly said today (Wednesday) that he was disgusted and dismayed that the Minister for Agriculture Ivan Yates would preside over the further strangulation of the EU Live Export Trade by introducing a 400kg weight limit on two tier trucks which will effectively ban finished live cattle from the European Market.</P>
      <P>Mr. Donnelly called for the immediate lifting of this outrageous imposition on the European Live Export Trade.  The IFA President said it was now clear that the Minister and the Department with this latest weight limit rule were &ldquo;making up the rules as they go along&rdquo; and were intent on strangling the trade with bureaucracy and red tape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the difficulties resulting from BSE, the cutting off of live trade to third countries and weight limitations on intervention, it is regrettable the facility to provide transport to European markets for our most important industry is stymied not <Col N="1697" /> only by the lack of carriers but by red tape and bureaucracy introduced and implemented by the Minister.  It is extraordinary that taxpayers here and in the European Union have invested large sums of money in road networks and port developments here and in European Union destinations to facilitate carriers, yet the carriers cherry pick what they will carry.  The Government has a responsibility to insist that the carriers cannot do so.  The investment has been made for them and it is incumbent on them to ensure that our live trade and our food industry is facilitated. It is a scandal that this important artery to the European Union markets has been cut off to this last remaining island nation of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State to give an assurance to the House that the carriers will be directed to provide for the transport of live cattle in particular, but also some delicate fresh consumer foods, a trade we have built up during the past few years.  Will the Government make a connection between Whitehall and Dublin Port as the ring roads are gridlocked from Whitehall and carriers are delayed for hours?  I look forward to the Minister giving us some ray of hope to resolve this difficult problem.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Walsh for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am aware of the difficulties being caused by the restrictions being placed on live exports from Ireland.  In the first place, Irish exporters are being seriously hampered by the restrictions on exporting through the United Kingdom and onwards to the Continent.  However, this is an inevitable consequence of the ban on exports from the United Kingdom.  Secondly, there are some other restrictions in place which are not justified.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of our commitment to ensuring the highest welfare standards for all animals being transported.  It will be recalled that we brought in national rules dealing with the transport of animals in April 1995 in anticipation of EU rules which eventually came into operation throughout the Union from January 1997.  Under the rules currently applying, all animals being sent for export are inspected by a veterinary inspector and a certificate of fitness to travel is issued only if the inspector is satisfied that the conditions are satisfactory as far as both the livestock and transport vehicle are concerned. For this purpose, transport vehicles must be approved in accordance with strict criteria and similar controls are applied in the case of transport by ship.  These controls include provisions relating to ventilation, drainage and the feeding and watering of animals.  On a number of occasions, my Department has refused permission for consignments to travel on the basis of unsuitable transport arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the stringency of these transport conditions, no restriction should be applied to the export of livestock from Ireland, which complies with these conditions as well as the <Col N="1698" /> appropriate EU animal health conditions.  The livestock should be allowed to travel unhindered to their intended destination.</P>
    <P>Regarding ferry services to the Continent, the House will be aware that one company is currently carrying certain categories of live animals. A second ferry company is to resume operations this month and, subject to availability of space, three sailings per week will be available for exports of all categories of livestock.  As I indicated, the Minister does not believe that any restrictions should be placed on the export of any category of animal and he will continue his contacts with the company to seek to persuade it to remove this restriction.  In this regard, the Minister met representatives of Pandoro today and is confident that a substantial resolution will be achieved on this issue in the near future.</P>
    <P>On the approval of ships, new rules on the transport of cattle by sea were introduced by the Minister at the beginning of 1996 following serious concern as a result of a number of incidents which had taken place during the transport of cattle by sea from Ireland.  Nine ships with a total capacity of 15,500 animals have now been approved under this legislation while a further two ships have been approved subject to the completion of a number of modifications.</P>
    <P>These actions have placed the transport of animals from Ireland on a more secure and defensible footing and in line with our position as a major exporter of live animals.  I am satisfied that without these measures the position regarding the export of animals would be far worse than it is at present.  The Minister is committed to ensuring that due recognition of these high standards of animal welfare is accorded by all concerned in the animal transport business.  He is not in collusion with anyone and I expect he will make a positive announcement on this issue shortly.</P>

      <P>For the second time, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has ignored the legitimate claims of my constituency to secure a contract to generate electricity from farm waste under the AER waste to energy competition.  What this means to the local economy is a restriction on the primary production of poultry and mushrooms.  It also creates a serious problem for the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993, Monaghan secured £100,000 from INTERREG to carry out a waste management study.  The study found that in 1971, 83 per cent of Monaghan's river channel length surveyed was unpolluted which was comparable to the national average.  By 1990, the unpolluted river channel length had declined to 29.5 per cent in Monaghan while the national average was 77.5 per cent. Poultry and mushroom production account for 47 per cent and 12 per cent respectively of the county's gross agricultural output compared with 4 per cent and 2 per cent of national GAO.  The farming pattern in the Blackwater and Finn catchments <Col N="1699" /> is even more skewed in favour of poultry and mushroom production.  It is projected that poultry and mushroom production will grow at 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent respectively each year over the next decade.</P>
    <P>Monaghan's failure to secure this waste contract means it will be difficult to maintain current targets not to mention meeting the projected ones.  The Minister will talk about independent assessments but it is time that the jobs and the development of the economy were considered. We need a co-ordinated examination of projects such as this by the various Departments involved &mdash; the Departments of the Environment; Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Transport, Energy and Communications.  They have responsibility to ensure the environment is clean and that we get an opportunity to meet our agricultural commitments.</P>
    <P>The contract was awarded to Foster Wheeler Power Systems Incorporated and ESB Power Generation at a cost of £113 million for a 30 megawatt project.  The Monaghan proposal would cost £50 million for a 20 megawatt project.  This requires an explanation.  The Dublin based project will not meet the 1999 deadline.  There is serious opposition to it and there are nightly meetings to ensure it will not be built, while we are clamouring to have it built in Monaghan.  The Monaghan project is in order and the proposal is suitable for the disposal of large quantities of meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>Following the issuing of an EU directive in 1993 requiring member states to provide alternative energy sources, in the summer of 1994, I arranged for a deputation from Monaghan County Council to meet the then Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Treacy, to discuss the proposed alternative energy requirement competition.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained that he proposed to target 75 megawatts for alternative energy source with 10 megawatts for biomass waste.  Following discussions, he agreed to increase the biomass waste to 15 megawatts as 10 megawatts would not allow any extra capacity.  Concern had also been expressed by the British company, Monopower, that the 40 per cent corporation tax was too high. Following representations to the Department of Finance, I received a letter saying that generation of electricity would be regarded as coming within the definition of manufacturing and would be subject to a 10 per cent tax rate.  A site was subsequently obtained at the IDA industrial estate in Knockaconny, County Monaghan.</P>
    <P>However, with the change of Government in 1994, Minister of State, Deputy Stagg succeeded Deputy Treacy and, on 7 March, he announced the results of the competition which did not include the 15 megawatts for biomass waste.  He promised another competition, which was launched last Friday, for 30 megawatts at a cost of £7.5 million under the Economic Infrastructure <Col N="1700" /> Operational Programme.  This was meant to be done in October last year but was held over until now.</P>
    <P>We did our homework.  I travelled to England and saw a similar plant in operation.  A subsidiary company of Fibrowatt in England called Monopower has been set up in Monaghan.  When we recommended the benefits of such a plant to the Minister, he travelled to England to see it.  He and his officials admitted it was a good venture. It is not surprising that the people of Monaghan are frustrated.  Development in that area is at a standstill.  We have been told there will be no more AER.  The current project will not meet the 1999 deadline as there are objections to it.  When Dublin people start objecting one can be sure the project will never become a reality.  Will the Minister site the project in Monaghan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Leonard for raising this matter. The first Alternative Energy Requirement, AER 1, competition resulted in power purchase agreements being offered by the ESB power procurer for a 111 megawatts of renewable generated electricity. This included six projects totalling 12 megawatts in the landfill, gas and waste category.</P>
      <P>Following on the success of AER 1, I launched AER 11 on 21 December 1995 with the aim of securing an electricity generating plant of between 10 and 30 megawatts using biomass or waste as a fuel.  In order to ensure the fairness, impartiality and objectivity of the competition process, I decided to appoint independent consultants to run the competition, assess the technical and commercial bids and recommend a winner. My Department invited tenders for an independent assessor and subsequently appointed the UK consultancy firm, ETSU.</P>
      <P>ETSU received ten project proposals, two of which subsequently withdrew from the competition. ETSU has advised me that the remaining eight projects involved a range of fuels including municipal solid waste.  Following its assessment of the technical and commercial bids, ETSU recommended the proposal from Foster Wheeler Power Systems Incorporated and ESB Power Generation as the winner of the competition.</P>
      <P>I stress that neither I nor my Department had any hand, act or part in the selection of the winning bid.  My role in the process, having accepted the recommendation of the independent assessor, is to announce the winner and instruct ESB power procurement to offer a power purchase agreement to the winning consortium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal from Foster Wheeler and ESB is to build, own and operate a £113 million, 30 megawatt waste-to-energy electricity generating plant.  The facility will be located at an existing ESB-owned site, contiguous to its central distribution depot at Goddamendy, Ballycoolin, County Dublin.  It is now a matter for the developers to proceed with the project and to obtain the necessary permissions and licences.  The project <Col N="1701" /> will be required to comply with the relevant planning and environmental licensing requirements.</P>
    <P>I am aware some concern has been expressed by residents in the area about the possible adverse effect of the new electricity generating station.  This appears to have been fuelled by a certain amount of misinformation or lack of understanding about the development.</P>
    <P>Foster Wheeler is one of the world's leading experts in the field of waste to energy technology. The company operates similar facilities in New Jersey and Chicago and is currently constructing one in Lisbon.  The Dublin plant will be constructed to the highest technological and environmental standards.  It will incorporate a boiler system to recover energy from combustion gases and sophisticated emissions abatement systems.  It will, as I have already indicated, have to get planning permission and comply with the very demanding requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency.  There will be no storage of waste on site.  Covered sealed lorries will drive into the building and deliver the waste directly to the fires.  No hazardous waste will be used.</P>
    <P>This development is an integral part of the Government's renewable energy strategy which is designed to increase the share of renewable energy generated by independent producers to 6 per cent of the country's installed electricity generating capacity by the year 2000.  The price cap in the AER 11 competition was 3.6p per kilowatt hour of electricity.  The winning bid price is 3.2p per kilowatt hour.  That was the determining factor in who won the competition.  It was the lowest bid and had much technical competence. This is 11 per cent below the price ceiling and shows that renewables are becoming more competitive when compared with traditional fossil fuels.  Renewable energy is an indigenous, environmentally friendly and sustainable source of clean energy.  Combined with my other renewable energy initiatives this project will reduce our imported oil bill by £25 million per annum and, as a consequence, will reduce the level of CO 2 emissions.</P>
    <P>It will have a number of positive effects on the environment.  As well as reducing the emissions associated with electricity generation from fossil fuels, it will reduce the need for landfill dumps.  About 50 per cent of Dublin's non-hazardous municipal waste will be transformed to energy by this new facility.  The electricity generated will supply the electricity needs of approximately 200,000 people.</P>
    <P>Waste is a resource and we must recognise it as such while seeking to minimise it.  It makes no economic or environmental sense to bury it when we can use it constructively and reduce imports.</P>
    <P>The development will also bring economic benefits to the locality.  Total project investment will come to £113 million and that will be funded by the project's proposers.  During the construction phase, the project will create up to 1,500 construction <Col N="1702" /> jobs.  Once operational, 75 permanent jobs will be created locally.</P>
    <P>Subject to the approval of the European Commission, a European regional development fund grant of up to 9.3 MECUs, or £6.9 million, is available for the project.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Leonard's disappointment that the power station will not be located in his area where there is fuel available from the chicken and mushroom industries to supply the station.  This is in sharp contrast to his colleague, Deputy Ray Burke, who has mounted an outrageous campaign of misinformation against the project in an attempt to create hysteria based on that misinformation.  His actions are irresponsible in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard should be aware this is not the end of such projects.  This competition showed the demand for this type of project.  I will as a matter of urgency look to see how the problems outlined by Deputy Leonard can be addressed in this context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to deal with this matter.  The Government faces a massive compensation bill for damage to the hearing of members of the Defence Forces.  More than 200 cases have already been settled at an average cost of £35,000.  With over 5,000 further cases to be heard the cost to the State will run into millions.  In many cases where settlement has been reached, the Department of Defence allowed the cases to go to court, while others have been settled on the steps of the court. It has taken between two and three years for these cases to come before the courts and looking back at the way in which the matter has been handled one cannot be satisfied.</P>
      <P>A special forum must be set up to deal with the outstanding claims and ensure that compensation is paid to the victims and not the legal eagles.  I realise the Minister for Defence finds himself in a very difficult position.  He must provide adequate compensation to the soldiers who have had their hearing damaged and at the same time he must be conscious of the budgetary implications.  I realise this year the Minister has provided £16 million for compensation but I am afraid it will not solve all the problems nor settle many of the cases before him.  The problem, unfortunately, is a great deal more serious than that.</P>
      <P>The Government must acknowledge that the State was negligent in that it did not make proper provision for the safety of the soldiers.  Thousands of members of the Defence Forces have had their hearing damaged and the State must pay.  The Government cannot continue to challenge all cases.  It is only creating enormous legal costs and increasing the total bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation is proving to be a real bonanza for the legal fraternity and it cannot be allowed to continue.  In relation to the cases settled, a number of different judges adjudicated <Col N="1703" /> and there has been no consistency in the settlements. I appeal to the Minister to set up a special forum.  More than 5,000 cases have to be heard and it is simply not possible for our courts to deal with such a number in an acceptable time.  Setting up a special forum would expedite the hearing of cases, it would reduce the enormous legal expense and consistency in settlements could be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious problem and I appeal to the Minister to deal with it in a constructive manner. It is vital that the compensation is given to those who have suffered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to address the House on this important matter.  It has received considerable attention in the media in recent days and, therefore, I am grateful to Deputy Power for providing me with this opportunity to place the factual position before Deputies and into the public arena.</P>
      <P>More than 5,200 claims alleging hearing impairment from exposure to gunfire have been initiated by ex-members and currently serving members of the Defence Forces against the Minister for Defence and the State.  New cases are arriving at the rate of 100 per week.</P>
      <P>The avalanche of claims began in 1992, when 49 claims were received, and has quadrupled each year since.  In 1996 some 2,522 claims were received and to date this year there have been an additional 934 cases.  The basis of most of these claims is that the individual involved was, in the course of his duty, exposed to gunfire, usually at range practices, whether small arms, rifle fire or artillery.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 some 170 cases have been settled at a cost of approximately £6.5 million.  The projected cost to the State of the 5,200 claims on hand alone is in excess of £200 million.  The plaintiff's legal costs usually run to a minimum of a third of the award, increasing the expenditure to £270 million.  This is before any of the State's costs are included, which could bring the total to £350 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The damaging effect on hearing from exposure to excessive noise has been recognised for many years.  Over the years, since 1952, the Army authorities issued general routine orders, instructions and guidelines on the need to protect the hearing of personnel involved in firing weapons.  Subsequent revisions were made in later years.  These guidelines were incorporated into a comprehensive training circular in 1987 detailing the incidences of exposure to excessive noise, clearly warning of the danger involved.  This 1987 circular which stands as a watershed in the evolution of hearing protection in the Defence Forces, also limited the number of rounds that could be fired even while wearing hearing protection.  These regulations continue to be updated from time to time in the light of current best practice.  Most recently, in 1993, a &ldquo;Manual of range practices, <Col N="1704" /> Small Arms 1993&rdquo; was issued which describes both the cause and effect of noise induced hearing loss and states exactly when ear plugs and/or muffs must be worn.  In addition it lays down the duties of an officer or NCO in charge of firing practices, for example, ensuring that appropriate ear protection is available and worn and that the order to check hearing protection is given, repeated and heard by all personnel.  This manual also lays down the maximum number of rounds that may be fired in a 24-hour period.  Current procedures also include (a) tests of elementary training which must be passed annually by all personnel that include four questions on care of hearing and (b) a lecture on care of hearing to be given to all recruits before attending a range practice.</P>
    <P>With regard to hearing loss, I am advised that it is possible to have good hearing at relatively low frequencies, with impaired hearing at higher frequencies.  It is also a fact that as age increases, the ability to hear very high-pitched sounds decreases.  Other factors can affect hearing.  For example illness, such as ear infection, or environment and lifestyle, such as use of motorbikes or attendance at discos, can produce hearing loss particularly when exposure is over a prolonged period.  Noise-induced hearing loss usually manifests itself in a loss of high-tone hearing. However, a person may be able to hear quite adequately sounds which would arise in normal conversation at medium frequencies.  Some difficulty may be experienced in hearing in a crowded environment such as a public house.  I am told that one in four people who have perfect hearing have similar problems.</P>
    <P>Once an individual's hearing has been assessed it is necessary to determine whether his hearing deviates so far from the norm as to represent an actual hearing handicap.  The major issue facing the State is the present high degree of compensation awarded by the courts for hearing patterns which, I am advised, in other jurisdictions would be regarded as being within the normal range and which would attract little or no compensation. Clearly, against this background I have a duty to the taxpayer to fight those cases where the level of handicap is not significant when judged against internationally accepted criteria.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a compensation tribunal should be established.  In the case of loss of hearing claims, liability is still an issue in each claim.  It cannot be automatically assumed that a plaintiff's loss of hearing is attributable to his service in the Defence Forces or that the military authorities were negligent in each case.  Ear defenders have been provided to military personnel for very many years.  The plaintiff may have exposed himself to some other source of acoustic trauma, as a member of a golf club or at discos where noise levels have been excessive since the late sixties.  There may be medical evidence to suggest some other cause of his hearing loss, such as a previous illness or ear infection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> Under the Army Pensions Acts, compensation by way of a disability pension or a gratuity may be granted to a former member of the Permanent Defence Force who, on retirement or discharge from the force, is found to be suffering from a disablement due to an injury attributable to military service at home or abroad.  Such compensation is payable whether the injury was accidentally or maliciously inflicted.  These provisions are unique to former members of the Permanent Defence Force in recognition of the fact that Army life can place soldiers at risk from time to time.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies and the public at large that <Col N="1706" /> the issue of Army hearing loss cases, and the huge financial threat they pose, is receiving priority attention in my Department.  I am in frequent contact with the Attorney General on this matter and the situation in the courts is monitored on a daily basis.  Every avenue to minimise the cost to the State has been explored and the strategy adopted is under constant review.  I thank the Deputy opposite for having given me the opportunity to put these matters on the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 21 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware Bord Fáilte Éireann is the executive agency responsible for promoting and developing tourist traffic in and to the State, through implementation of Government policy.  It is a statutory body and its powers and functions are set out in the Tourist Traffic Acts 1939-95.  It is run by a board of directors appointed by the Minister for Tourism and Trade with the consent of the Minister for Finance and it is responsible to the Department of Tourism and Trade in respect of its use of Exchequer funds in pursuing its activities.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the recommendations of the Arthur D. Little review of Bord Fáilte in 1995-96 marked the most recent major change in its structures.  This has resulted in a much more focused and dynamic organisation which is now concentrating on its core activity of marketing Ireland as a tourist destination.</P>
      <P>For some time, the board has been working in partnership with the Northern Ireland Tourism Board and with the tourism industry North and South in promoting the island of Ireland as a holiday destination, most recently in advancing the roll-out of the new brand Ireland in our key markets abroad.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development, on the other hand, promotes development of the tourism sector in the mid-west region, a role similar to that of the regional tourism authorities.  It reports to the Department of Tourism and Trade on tourism issues and funds are provided through my Department's Vote to help defray its tourism administration and general expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> Regional tourism authorities were initially established by Bord Fáilte in 1963 under section 5 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.  They are structured as private companies registered under the Companies Acts, limited by guarantee with memoranda and Article of Association which contain <i>inter alia,</i> stipulations relating to their management, administration and general business affairs. In accordance with their memoranda and articles, regional tourism authorities are accountable to, and obliged to operate in accordance with the policies and directions of, Bord Fáilte.  The last major review of the regional tourism authorities was undertaken in 1993 and resulted in changes in their boards and representation.</P>
    <P>Overall, I have found the tourism bodies to be responsive to and energetic in supporting the Government's tourism policies as set out primarily in the current operational programme for tourism.  They work co-operatively towards the very demanding targets which have been set for the sector.  Processes are in place to ensure an appropriate level of co-ordination and integration between all the main players and in particular the sector itself.  Furthermore Shannon development, the regional tourism authorities, Bord Fáilte, the industry and the Department are all represented on the national tourism council which I chair and which advises me on policy matters.</P>
    <P>Government policy for Irish tourism is being implemented in a co-ordinated and effective manner with structures in place which are responsive to the requirements of our markets and customers. But, of course, all such structures must continue to evolve and consequently will be kept constantly under review not only to assist with implementation of short-to-medium term policy adjustments, where necessary, but also to help set the parameters for the development of tourism well into the next century.</P>

      <P>The primary source of EU funding for tourism related projects is the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99.  The main monitoring mechanism for this programme is the national monitoring committee which is chaired by my Department and on which the main interests in <Col N="1710" /> the tourism industry, the social partners, the European Commission and the relevant implementing Departments and agencies are represented. In addition, a tourism operational programme co-ordinating committee, chaired by my Department and representative of all the implementing agencies, meets on a regular basis to ensure proper operational co-ordination within the programme.</P>
      <P>Funding for tourism initiatives can also be provided under operational programmes which are the responsibility of other Ministers &mdash; including the OP for agriculture, rural development and forestry and the OP for local urban and rural development &mdash; and a number of other community initiatives such as the Leader II programme, INTERREG II programmes &mdash; both Northern Ireland and maritime &mdash; and the special programme for peace and reconciliation.  The international fund for Ireland also has a tourism programme.  My Department is represented on the relevant monitoring committees of these programmes.</P>
      <P>This co-ordinated approach has so far served to ensure that activity under the various programmes is consistent with national tourism policy. As part of its overall monitoring role, however, and to assure that co-ordination remains optimal, the national monitoring committee for the tourism operational programme has asked its external evaluator to report on the relationships between the tourism operational programme and other CSF, programmes and initiatives which have an identifiable tourism component in order to ensure a complementary and cohesive approach.  The evaluator's report will be carefully studied by the committee for consideration as to what further action, if any, may be needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 31 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy on tourism development takes full account of the value of the image of Ireland's clean, green environment and the consequent need to protect it.  The ambitious growth targets set for the tourism sector relate to growth in overseas revenue and job creation and emphasise the need to develop a sustainable industry concentration on a quality product.  The strategy of increasing tourism revenue yield is an integral element of the &ldquo;Tourism Brand Ireland&rdquo; campaign launched by Bord Fáilte late last year.</P>
      <P>The operational programme for tourism, 1994-99, acknowledges that a balance must be struck between tourism development and preservation of the environment.  Measures to achieve this objective, as set out in the programme, include improving the seasonality profile of Irish tourism. The aim is that by 1999, 75 per cent of visitors will arrive in Ireland outside the peak July-August period compared with about 70 per cent at present; attracting high yield business.  Priority is given to marketing conference and incentive business and other quality niche and activity markets such as cruising, golf, equestrian, shoppers and users of paid services such as accommodation and car hire; where possible having existing product investment rather than creating new developments; a wide geographical dispersal to minimise capacity problems; capital projects recommended for assistance under the programme are required to comply with all environmental regulatory requirements as a condition for grant approval and support for overseas marketing under the programme is weighted towards projects that aim to extend the season; and progress on the consistency between tourism developments and the principle of sustainability will continue to be monitored as part of the programme.</P>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for environmental protection and the management of environmental problems generally rests with the Minister for the Environment while the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has certain statutory responsibilities in relation to the protection of heritage areas.  I understand that the heritage services &mdash; national parks and wildlife service and national monuments and historic properties services &mdash; of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht operate an ongoing review of the impact of visitors on heritage sites in order that suitable control and management procedures are exercised and applied as necessary.  Similarly, the national monuments and historic properties service aims to keep visiting levels at each heritage property to the optimum number of visitors consistent with site protection and presentation and to manage such properties accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far, I believe that any concerns we might have are being adequately addressed in the context of the strategies and monitoring arrangements that I have already outlines.  I remain <Col N="1713" /> absolutely determined, however, to ensure that the issue continues to be afforded a high priority by my Department and the relevant agencies and the House may take it that very serious thought will constantly be given to the best ways and means of maintaining the strong environmental quality of our tourism product as we look to development beyond 2000.</P>

      <P>The IBEC survey on barriers to trade, which was carried out in 1995 at my request to determine if the single market was working for Irish companies, found that one-third of respondent exporters had experienced difficulties in gaining access to other EU markets.  IBEC was subsequently requested to further analyse the survey results to ascertain the nature of the problems concerned, to enable my Department to pursue these problems with EU Commission and other member states concerned.</P>
      <P>In late November 1995 IBEC confirmed that almost all cases of difficulties reported by Irish exporters had been successfully resolved.  Efforts were still being made to settle the small number of unresolved cases and, if these proved unsuccessful, the assistance of my Department would be sought.  Because of the progress made through other channels, the need for representations to the EU Commission and other member states regarding difficulties experienced by Irish exporters in EU markets has not arisen to date.</P>
      <P>On 26 November last during the Irish Presidency of the European Union, I chaired an open debate on the European Commission's review of the impact and effectiveness of the single market following a presentation by the Commission of the review to council.  The review, which confirms that the single market has contributed to increased levels of income and employment, also highlights the need for further action to be taken to ensure that single market legislation is correctly applied and effectively enforced throughout the European Union.  The Dublin European Council subsequently noted the Commission's intention to present to the European Council in Amsterdam an action plan and a timetable covering all necessary measures that must be taken to ensure that the full potential benefit of the internal market is achieved before the beginning of stage 3 of European Monetary Union.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 40 together.  The Central Statistics Office has estimated that there were over 4.7 million overseas visitors to Ireland in 1996.  The breakdown was as follows: January-March, 685,000; April-June, 1,317,000; July-September, 1,819,000 and October-December, 918,000.  This represents an increase of over 11 per cent on 1995.</P>
      <P>Foreign earnings from tourism for the first three-quarters of 1996 were as follows: January-March, £265 million; April-June, £512 million and July-September, £741 million.  This represents an increase of over 12 per cent on the same period in 1995.  Revenue figures for the final quarter are not yet available from the CSO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the pattern of above average growth rates of recent years was maintained in 1996, with particularly strong growth out of the <Col N="1715" /> US, UK and to a lesser extent mainland Europe. I am confident that 1997 will prove to be another successful year for the Irish tourism industry with Bord Fáilte targeting 7 per cent growth in visitor numbers and 9 per cent growth in revenue.</P>

Apart from direct transport costs which are not subject to Government price control, and the ability of firms themselves in the management of transport and logistics, transport infrastructure also has the potential to reduce significantly competitive disadvantages of location.</P>
      <P>The Government is currently taking a number of strategically important initiatives to ensure that any disadvantage to exporters is minimised.  A range of improvements in transport infrastructure are provided for under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999 which is the responsibility of my colleagues, the Ministers for Transport Energy and Communications, Marine and the Environment.  Under that programme £2.6 billion is being invested in upgrading our roads network, commercial seaports and airports and our rail network, with particular emphasis on those parts of the transport network which play a critical role in linking Ireland to our main export markets.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 30 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a small open economy, we are vulnerable to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates, hence this Government's commitment to Ireland becoming a founder member of European Monetary Union.  The recently published ESRI report on the economic implictions for Ireland of European Monetary Union, which was commissioned by the Minister for Finance, concluded that European Monetary Union membership would be <Col N="1717" /> favourable for Ireland.  The net benefit of lower interest rates, coupled with savings on currency costs, would more than offset any competitiveness losses.  That conclusion applied whether or not Britain joined European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>Specifically to assist any exporters who may currently be experiencing difficulty due to the present strength of the Irish pound against certain EU currencies, ABT has recently established a special task force to work with such companies, and monitor developments in the French and German markets.  ABT is advising exporters to emphasise non-price factors such as quality, design etc. and ensure proper treasury-exchange risk management.  This task force will operate on a similar basis to the sterling task force which assisted companies in difficulty in the UK market for similar reasons last year.  As Deputies may be aware, the Irish pound has depreciated significantly against sterling in recent months.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that ABT is continuing of course to provide very substantial support to firms exporting to Europe as part of their ongoing programmes of activity, known as opportunity Europe, to increase Irish exports to that market; in the current year, this amounts to approximately £10 million.</P>

      <P>The chief executive of Bord Fáilte and the other promotional agencies are members of the foreign earnings committee, which I chair, and which also includes senior officials from a number of Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The committee is responsible for ensuring the co-ordination of Ireland's overseas promotional activities.  The issue of effective co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs is particularly important given that the embassies and consulates constitute Ireland's most extensive overseas network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to encourage greater use of diplomatic missions to support Ireland's business, economic and tourism interests, the committee has established local foreign earnings co-ordination committees, comprising the market-based representatives of the agencies and chaired by the Irish ambassador in the main markets.  The purpose of the local committees is to address specific issues requiring co-operation among the agencies, and most importantly, the potential for complementary <Col N="1718" /> action and co-ordinated pursuit of the particular market objectives.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be also aware that the foreign earnings committee has also supported the consolidation, wherever possible, of our overseas diplomatic, commercial and consular offices in Ireland houses.  These provide a single point of contact for anyone who wants to do business with or seek information on Ireland and contribute to enhanced co-operation between the diplomatic service and agencies, including Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>In addition, Bord Fáilte representatives are based in embassies in a number of countries, and in certain countries, where Bord Fáilte do not have a market presence, embassies display promotional literature and service inquiries.</P>
    <P>As there is currently a high-level of co-operation between Bord Fáilte and the diplomatic service, which is kept under regular review particularly in the context of the foreign earnings committee, the need for discussions with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs does not arise at present.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 49 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with the tourism industry, I have been conscious for some time of the need to plan properly for the time when the current round of EU Structural Funds expires at the end of 1999. The issue has surfaced already in a number of fora such as the tourism council, the overseas tourism marketing initiative and in bilateral contacts between ITIC-industry representatives and my Department.  I have referred to the matter in many speeches over the past two years in which I have exhorted the industry to build on its successes, particularly during this decade, by taking on more responsibility for the development, training and marketing of its own product.  More <Col N="1719" /> recently, I have indicated to Bord Fáilte and the sector that my Department has already begun to look at possible scenarios for post-1999, with a view to future consulation and discussion with the industry on this subject.  This work will, of course, also provide the necessary background to future negotiations with the European Commission in the lead up to the completion of the current operational programme for tourism which runs up to end 1999.</P>
    <P>As to the matter of the EU financial framework post-1999, I understand from the Minister for Finance that the negotiations on the future financing of the European Union, including the structural funds, will not commence until after the conclusion of the intergovernmental conference at which stage the European Commission will submit a communication on the future financial framework as from 31 December 1999.  This could happen as early as the second half of 1997. Ireland's overall approach to these negotiations is still under consideration and the House can be assured that when the negotiations commence, the Government will ensure that Ireland's interests are vigorously and effectively pursued.</P>

      <P>Since the Department of Tourism and Trade was established in January 1993, staff numbers have increased by 37 and not 300 per cent, with the increase being accounted for by additional staffing resources to tourism division in order to meet the demands of an expanding and increasingly important industry; appointment of a Minister of State in January 1995 with specific responsibility for domestic tourism and trade, business competitiveness and cost, and the tourism aspects of the Leader and agri-tourism programmes; establishment of a strategy and competitiveness unit in April 1995 in the Department to monitor key developments likely to impact on the strategic direction and competiveness of the tourism and trade sectors; strengthening of central staff support particularly to deal with personnel, finance and information technology following the gradual transfer of responsibilities for these matters to the new Department from the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications and of Enterprise and Employment which previously held responsibility for the tourism and trade functions respectively.</P>
      <P>My Department continues its establishment in 1993 to exercise lead responsibility for the formulation of national policies on tourism and trade matters and for monitoring the implementation of these policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>During 1990, 30 per cent of overseas tourists visited Ireland during the peak period of July and August.  While there has been growth of 53 per cent in overall visitor numbers since then, the percentage arriving during the peak period in 1996 was down to 28 per cent.</P>
      <P>As I said in reply to a question on 30 January, specific targets have been set under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 for improving tourism activity in the shoulder and off-peak seasons.  At the beginning of the programme 30 per cent of visitors came to Ireland during the peak season and our aim is to have 25 per cent of visitors arrive in the peak period by 1999.  The mid-term target set out in the programme is for 28 per cent of visitors to arrive in July-August and I am happy to say that this target was reached during 1996.</P>
      <P>To achieve the overall 1999 target we need to increase activities during the off-peak season.  As part of our campaign many initiatives are currently under way.  On 15 January I launched the Celtic Flame Music Festival.  This initiative is based on the recommendation of the tourism council and its aim is to further build tourism in the off-season.  Festival events took place in Galway from 20 to 23 February, in Cork from 25 February to 2 March and will take place in Limerick from 7 to 9 March next.  These events will serve to act as a lively lead-in to the St. Patrick's festivities in Dublin which I am convinced have the potential to become a further major attraction in the shoulder period.</P>
      <P>Additionally, on 10 February, Deputy O'Sullivan, Minister of State, launched the 1997 domestic tourism marketing initiative.  This major boost to domestic tourism will provide an added impetus to tourism in the off-season.</P>
      <P>At the level of product, the improvement in the range and quality of weather independent facilities in recent years and the substantial investment in the marketing of these facilities is designed to improve the seasonality profile of the industry. The assistance which the industry has received under the tourism operational programme has been of considerable benefit in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will also serve to complement the success so far of the overseas tourism marketing initiative, <Col N="1721" /> which is a State-industry partnership marketing initiative promoting Ireland on a year round basis in our key markets and whose many campaigns are directed at attracting visitors outside the peak season.</P>
    <P>Finally, the launch last year of Tourism Brand Ireland formed a key part of a new strategic approach to marketing designed to address major issues such as yield, regional spread and seasonality. The advertising emphasis is on aspects of the Irish holiday such as human interaction, culture and historical heritage, which are not season-dependent.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to point out, once again, that overall responsibility for the promotion and development of Irish tourism in overseas markets rests with Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>In pursuit of the most efficient use of their resources Bord Fáilte advise that its marketing effort is of necessity focused on areas where the best economic return can be realised.  Bord Fáilte has, therefore, targeted the Australian and New Zealand market as priority long-haul markets.  It recently undertook workshops in five major Australian and New Zealand cities, involving almost 800 travel agents.  A co-operative advertising campaign has also been undertaken in those markets with British Airways on television, press and cinema.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> The holiday market sector from Australia increased by 9 per cent in 1996 and inquiries to the Bord Fáilte office for January and February of this year are particularly strong, running at 76 per cent ahead of the same period in 1996.</P>
    <P>As to the Far East, the Japanese market also displayed significant growth last year, increasing by 10 per cent and individual specialist segments such as English language schools are now beginning to target this market successfully.</P>
    <P>In South America, Bord Fáilte has increased the Ireland programme with tour operators.  It also brought selected trade and media to Ireland from four South American countries last year and participated with the British tourist authority in four Latin American workshops.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile Bord Fáilte Éireann, which is responsible for promoting and developing tourist traffic in and to the State in accordance with the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1931-1995, is also responsible for determining related research priorities and ensuring that such research is carried out satisfactorily.  Since 1995, BFE has been restructured with a new focus on the international marketing of the Irish tourism product.  As part of this new focus, the board is concentrating on three priorities: (i) selling and promoting Ireland abroad; (ii) helping the less mature elements of the industry to develop their marketing and product development capabilities; and (iii) providing information for enhanced decision making by marketers, investors and managers in the industry as well as Government.</P>
      <P>As part of its new remit, Bord Fáilte is in regular consultation with all elements of the tourism industry to assess their ongoing needs and requirements, with programmes and actions being regularly adapted to take account of the outcome of such consultation.  The board also provides for structured feed-back in many of its marketing and advertising programmes, forming the basis for ongoing research and review of effectiveness in the marketplace.</P>

      <Quest>if it is his policy for Ireland to have a comprehensive information service for visitors planning cycling holidays in Ireland; if so, the reason the Cycling Federation of Ireland is frequently contacted by tourists who cannot get information on cycleways, accommodation with cyclists in mind and useful organisations and contacts; and the plans, if any, he has to remedy this glaring defect in Irish tourism.</Quest>

      <P>There are a number of strategies which are designed to achieve the ambitious growth targets set for Irish tourism for the rest of this decade and among these is the development of niche markets such as cycling holidays.  Bord Fáilte, whose role is to market Ireland and the tourism products we have to offer has lead responsibility in this area and, in partnership with the industry, has been involved in the setting up of product marketing groups for our various product areas. Thus a co-operative marketing group for the cycling product has been established in conjunction with the walking product, and is known as the walking cycling Ireland group.</P>
      <P>This group comprises 19 members who each pay a membership fee for marketing.  It enables individual product suppliers to become more actively involved in how their product is marketed overseas, and Bord Fáilte informs me that a brochure has been produced listing the holidays offered by the members.  The brochure is produced in four languages &mdash; English, Dutch, French and German &mdash; and is distributed to all Ireland's main overseas markets and is available in Bord Fáilte offices overseas.  It is also distributed at all major consumer and trade shows in the markets in which Bord Fáilte participates.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte is not, therefore, aware why visiting cyclist tourists might find it necessary, as the Deputy alleges, to contact frequently the Cycling Federation of Ireland to obtain visitor or specialist information.  If, however, the Deputy can provide me with the relevant information, I will be happy to arrange to have Bord Fáilte investigate and report on the matter directly to him.</P>

      <P>As I outlined to the House on 30 January 1997, the European Commission submitted, in September, 1994, a proposal for a Council directive on harmonisation of the main provisions concerning export credit insurance for transactions with medium and long-term cover.  While the principal of harmonisation was supported by all member states, there was strong opposition to the manner through which the Commission proposed this harmonisation should be effected, and, in late 1995, the issue was considered by the General Affairs Council, who requested the Commission to review their proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Commission is currently <Col N="1726" /> finalising a revised proposal, and, when this is received, I will consider its terms, and what our approach to it should be.  This will then be pursued, in the appropriate Council forum.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House on a number of occasions, most recently on 30 January last, the Government has agreed, in the event of the initial stages of the 1998 Tour de France being held in Ireland, to provide up to £2 million towards its cost as follows; £1.1 million from my own Department's Vote; £0.4 million from the Vote of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry; £0.2 million from the Vote of the Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for sport; and £0.3 million from funds to be provided by local authorities through specific arrangements to be made by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>I understand that local authorities may make some additional contributions over and above the £300,000 already referred to, including helping to meet additional local costs such as crowd control equipment, media power supply, etc.</P>
      <P>A formal decision by the Société du Tour de France as to whether Ireland will host the event is awaited.</P>

      <P>Funding is available under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, the INTERREG II programme and Bord Fáilte's capital development fund towards the development and upgrading of tourist information offices.</P>
      <P>The six regional tourism authorities, together with Shannon Development, operate a national network of tourist information offices.  In 1996, the network comprised 94 offices, of which 38 were open all-year round and 56 were seasonal offices.  In addition, at locations which do not justify a tourist information office, but where visitor demand or potential for tourism exists, tourist information points are established.  These are either display and sales stands, tourist literature at visitor attractions or tourist-related businesses; or unmanned display boards with maps and tourist information at strategic points in towns or lay-bys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of EU funding currently available is expected to result in a total investment of in <Col N="1730" /> excess of £11 million in the tourist information office network over the period 1994-1999.</P>

      <P>At a national level, Bord Fáilte estimates that direct and indirect employment in tourism has grown from 94,000 in 1994 to 107,000 in 1996, a rise of 13,000, which exceeds the end-1996 target set by the operational programme for tourism. However, such estimates are not compiled on a regional basis and it is not possible, therefore, to provide details of tourism employment growth on a regional basis or in specific county groupings.</P>
      <P>In its 1996 manpower survey, however, CERT surveyed a somewhat broader group incorporating those employed in the tourism and catering industries generally, including the licensed trade &mdash; the last such survey was done in 1992.  In its 1992 survey CERT estimated that 14,705 persons were engaged in the tourism and catering industries, including the licensed trade, in the north west region which, at that time, excluded County Louth.  At the end of 1996, the CERT survey showed that there are 21,794 in the extended Border region, including County Louth.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999 agreed between the Irish Government and the European Commission provides that in the case of the marketing sub-programme; and in the case of Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development areas under the product development sub-programme the decision making authority on grant applications shall be exercised by independent management boards, with the excepttion of large projects which also require the specific approval of the Government and the European Commission.  These independent management boards are required to operate within the policy guidelines as set out in the operational programme.  Each of these boards comprises three independent business-professional members, two relevant state agency personnel and one official from my Department.  The membership thus brings broad practical business and professional experience to the decision making process to augment the tourism-related expertise of the tourism agencies and my Department.</P>
      <P>Each management board is required to furnish me with an annual report listing all board decisions and advising of any significant developments or trends in relation to applications falling under their aegis.  The first three reports, for the period to end December, 1995 were published and were laid before both Houses of Oireachtas. The 1996 annual reports are currently being finalised and when available, will also be laid before both Houses.</P>
      <P>As part of the overall mid-term review of the community support framework and in common with other operational programmes, the mid-term review of the operational programme for tourism 1994-1999 has commenced.</P>
      <P>The review process of the tourism OP began last year with the drawing up of detailed terms of reference for a mid-term evaluation, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the European Commission, and the appointment by the national monitoring committee of a mid-term evaluator.</P>
      <P>The mid-term evaluator's report was finalised recently and, as part of the next phase in the review process, was considered at a specially convened meeting of the national monitoring committee of the tourism OP on Friday 28 February 1997, which was chaired by my Department.  This meeting allowed the various interests represented on the national monitoring committee to discuss the report in detail with the evaluator and to put forward initial views.  These initial views will now be fed into the overall CSF mid-term review process thereby enabling the Government and the European Commission to review the general thrust and direction of CSF programmes and to decide on any strategic changes that may be required.  This overall CSF review process is likely to be completed later this year.</P>

      <P>The domestic tourism market is Ireland's largest single tourism market, generating in the region of £350 million in holiday revenue each year.  In addition it supports an estimated 27,000 jobs in the economy, over a quarter of the total employment supported by tourism generally.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the critical importance of the domestic market to the tourism sector generally, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy O'Sullivan, established the domestic tourism marketing initiative in 1996 under the auspices of the national tourism council with the primary objective of working with the industry to renew domestic tourism interest.  A high level working group comprising representatives from the tourism industry, state agencies and officials of my Department was set up to carry this objective forward by developing an integrated national marketing programme to accelerate growth in home holidays, with particular emphasis on the shoulder and off-season periods.</P>
      <P>Following completion of the work of this group, the Minister of State recently launched the 1997 domestic tourism marketing campaign &mdash; the biggest marketing campaign ever undertaken to promote domestic tourism in Ireland.  This £1 million campaign will include an extensive advertising campaign based on the tourism Brand Ireland initiative and various complementary promotional activities such as the national home holiday awareness week, the holiday of a lifetime competition and a comprehensive direct mail campaign.  This level of marketing activity targetted especially at increasing public awareness of home holidays, is unprecedented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the new campaign will be measured particularly in terms of increased domestic tourism business in the shoulder and off-peak season in the current and future years, and in the level of increased marketing activity by industry in the home holiday market.  Bord Fáilte anticipate that the new campaign will result in <Col N="1733" /> growth in domestic tourism of 8-10 per cent over the next three years.</P>

      <P>The recently published CERT employment survey of the tourist industry in Ireland, 1996, covered a number of sectors within tourism, including tourism services and attractions as mentioned by the Deputy.  This sector comprises tourist and cultural attractions, tourism services and leisure and sporting activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to this extensive survey there are an estimated 25,161 people employed in tourism services and attractions, up 28 per cent on 1992 levels. Of the total employed, 66 per cent are permanent and not 29 per cent as suggested by the <Col N="1734" /> Deputy.  A total of 29 per cent are seasonal and 5 per cent are occasional workers.</P>
    <P>This sector is performing well in terms of the high level of permanent employment and skill requirements, reflecting both the priority which investment in this category of tourism product has been given in the current and previous operational programmes for tourism, and the rate of tourism growth which Ireland has been enjoying since the late 1980's.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal in relation to the third banking force arose out of legitmate concerns about the level of competition within the Irish retail banking market and problems regarding access to finance and other banking services. Since the proposal was first mooted, there has been significant change in the regulatory framework and in the competitive forces in the marketplace. The influx of foreign-based banks, the increasing role of building societies, the emergence of the credit unions as a viable alternative to the high street banks and the ongoing development of post office counter services are the main changes we have seen in market competition.  Moreover, an improved regulatory framework, including the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996 and Bills on credit unions and the Central Bank currently before the Oireachtas, has already had and will continue to have the effect of sharpennig competition in the marketplace.  Finally, economic and monetary union will open up the market further to major external competition from other European and international banks.</P>
      <P>This dynamic and changing environment in the retail banking market has obviously had a major impact on our consideration of the future of the State banking sector.  There are a number of options available, each of which would have varying impacts on competition, employment and the delivery of cost-effective, customer-based services. At this time, no final decision has been reached on a preferred option and required changes.  This complex matter is still under consideration within my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">

      <P>I would draw to the Deputy's attention that I did not receive direct correspondence from the taxpayer in question.  However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer and her husband are jointly assessed to income tax. Accordingly their combined income is taken into account for the purpose of establishing their liability <Col N="1761" /> to tax.  The income received by the taxpayer from her employment is taxable.  Her husband is in receipt of an invalidity pension from the Department of Social Welfare.  The pension is also chargeable to income tax but is paid gross &mdash; without tax being deducted &mdash; by the Department of Social Welfare.  The method of taxing social welfare pensions is that an amount equivalent to the annual social welfare payment is deducted from the person's-couple's annual tax free allowances.</P>
      <P>The couple will have a tax liability in any tax year in which their joint income exceeds the exemption limit &mdash; in the current year the exemption limit for a married couple is £7,800 with an additional allowance of £450 for each of the first two dependent children and £650 for the third and subsequent children.  However, as the taxpayer did not commence employment until 4 December 1996 and in view of the fact that the couple have a daughter in full-time education, it is unlikely that the couple will have an income tax liability in the current tax year.  An amended tax free allowance certificate reflecting this will issue to the taxpayer and any tax deducted by her employer will be refunded directly to her.</P>

      <Quest>whether the pensions of all ex-State and semi-State employees will continue to be based on the full equivalent salary scale including productivity or other payments of existing staff; the talks, if any, which have taken place with the ICTU to reduce pensions or base them on salary levels minus productivity payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pension increases in commercial semi-State bodies are primarily a matter for the body itself.  As regards the area for which I have direct responsibility, the civil and public service, the position has been that, since the 1960s, pension increases have been linked to pay.  In practice, pensions are calculated and subsequently increased by reference to the rates of pay of serving officials.  Full parity has applied, on this basis, since 1986.</P>
      <P>As regards the restructuring deals currently being negotiated under the PCW, they are, in the main, being dealt with under Option A of Clause 2 (iii) of Annex I to the PCW which requires &ldquo;changes in structures, work practices or other conditions of service&rdquo; and &ldquo;flexibility and change&rdquo; by employees.  The various Option A deals differ widely from each other in their structure and the outcome of talks has still to be finalised in the case of several major public service groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending completion of the latter and consideration of the pensions issue generally, I am not in a position, at this stage, to set out the effect of such deals on pensions in payment in respect of former public servants.  I should say, however, <Col N="1762" /> that the issue of pensions increases in the foregoing context is the subject of ongoing discussions with the public services committee of ICTU.</P>

      <P>I understand that the premises referred to were developed by a company which raised funds to provide a facility for the community and that Dublin Corporation provided a site and grants to assist this purpose. Unfortunately the facility was never fully completed and the company was subsequently dissolved.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the State Property Act, 1954 property which is undistributed on the dissolution of a company becomes State property. This is what happened in this case.  When my Department was approached about this property the normal steps were taken to establish how the State's interest in the property might properly be disposed of.  My Department has pursued this aspect in conjunction with the office of the Chief State Solicitor and the position has now been clarified; the State's interest in the property has been waived in favour of Dublin Corporation.</P>

    <P>*No statistics were collected for the years 1986 and 1987.</P>
    <P>I am unable to provide an average costing figure in relation to maintaining a child in care as the cost varies from case to case depending on a number of factors, including the age and needs of the child, the type of placement, whether he or she needs specialist counselling, medical or psychological care and the level of supervised access between the child and his or her parents.</P>
    <P>The cost of keeping a child in residential care is considerably greater than the cost of foster care.  The main reason for the difference is the cost of employing professionally trained staff to care for children on a twenty-four hour basis.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note there has been a major shift from residential to fostering as the preferred mode of care.  Between 1982 and 1992 the percentage of children in foster care increased from 56 per cent to 74 per cent.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have been in contact with the Deputy on this matter, as he points out, since my response to his original parliamentary question on 25 September 1996.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the delivery of health services, including mental health services, in Dublin has furnished me with a further report on the person referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The board has pointed out that two consultant psychiatrists have stated that the person does not have a mental handicap and does not suffer from mental illness.  It would not therefore, be appropriate to refer the person to either service for treatment.  A consultant forensic psychiatrist has given a diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder and the board's suggestion that the person be dealt with through judicial intervention is derived from consultants' opinion that he is fully aware of, and responsible for, his own actions.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The term &ldquo;communicable disease&rdquo; covers a wide range of conditions, which cause very many problems and complications for the health services as a whole, including our hospitals.  I have spoken to the House on numerous occasions about matters relating to AIDS, Hepatitis, Meningitis, Tuberculosis and Influenza, to mention just a small number of these conditions, and I have outlined the various measures which are in place to tackle each of the conditions concerned. With specific reference to hospital issues, I have established a group to report to me on measures which need to be taken in relation to problems arising from the infection of health care workers, and I have published guidelines covering procedures for the management of the hospitalacquired infection MRSA.</P>
      <P>Given the breadth of the area covered by the term, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be impossible in the context of a reply to a parliamentary question to set out all of the matters that have been brought to my attention in respect of each and every communicable disease, but I will be happy to respond to any more specific questions which the Deputy may wish to put to me.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department is preparing new mental health legislation.  This legislation will give greater protection to the civil rights of those with mental illness who need to be detained for treatment and will bring Irish legislation into conformity with international law.  The legislation, which is currently being drafted in the office of the Attorney General, will be introduced as soon as possible to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>As set out in the White Paper &mdash; A New Mental Health Act, the legislation will provide for the appointment of a commissioner of mental health whose remit will include a review of the quality of care of patients in our mental health services. The commissioner will also produce a code of practice for the care of the mentally ill.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I am committed to the introduction of a charter of rights for patients of our mental health services, separate to that of the general hospital patients' charter, but believe it would more appropriately be formulated and introduced at the same time as the other protective measures being provided for in the new legislation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The establishment of an independent living fund has been proposed to me by the Centre for Independent Living as a means of funding a personal assistance service to enable people with disabilities to live independently in the community. The development of a personal assistance service was examined by the advisory group on personal assistance.  While it did not recommend the establishment of an independent living fund, it recommended that funding of a personal assistance service should be considered in the context of the development of support services generally for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, <i>Towards and Independent Future</i>, which was published last December, recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that funding deficits for existing services be addressed in the first instance. An additional £2.188 million was built into the health board allocations in 1997 to help put the services on a more secure financial footing and to enable some services initiated in 1996 to be further developed.  Of this funding, £200,000 was provided for the development of existing personal assistance services.  A further £1 million in revenue funding for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities is being provided in 1997.  Discussions are taking place between officials of my Department and the health boards as to the priorities in service development for the allocation of these funds. The personal assistance service is one of those under consideration.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities in viable business enterprises was launched in 1994 for a three year period.  At the end of the pilot phase it was envisaged that the business would be commercially viable having regard for the disabled subsidies to the businesses.</P>
      <P>In November, 1994 six applications from the then Rehabilitation Institute &mdash; known as Gandon Enterprises, the commercial arm of the REHAB Group &mdash; were approved for funding.  In October, 1995 a seventh project, SETC was approved for inclusion in the pilot programme.</P>
      <P>Funding for the programme comprises three elements: capital grants, employment subsidies in respect of able-bodied employees and employment subsidies in respect of disabled employees. Provision for the programme is included in the Department's vote for services for people with disabilities and is based on the overall limit set for the programme each year.  However, actual expenditure relates to the level of uptake of the grants and subsidies in any given year, which is determined by the participating enterprises.  Participating enterprises received in full all funds requested under the programme.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health's annual estimates of expenditure and actual expenditure under the scheme is set out in the following table.  These figures include the costs for the administration and evaluation of the programme.</P>

      <P>The information on the number of reports of studies which have been commissioned by me or my Department in the period since I took office has been provided in my reply to Question No. 33 of 19 February, 1997 &mdash; Vol. 475, No. 2, Col. 437.</P>
      <P>As indicated in that reply much of the work was undertaken to provide a service, conduct polls etc. and no formal report was required. Accordingly, the Keegan report was the one report made public.  It was placed in the Oireachtas Library on 28 February 1995.</P>
      <P>The contents of the QMP and MRBI work in relation to the Divorce Referendum was not published because it related to internal policy matters. It was, however divulged for the information of the courts in the course of both the McKenna High Court and Supreme Court case and the Hanafin High Court and Supreme Court case.</P>
      <P>The Summary Report on the Evaluation of the Pilot Childcare (1994-95) Initiative was published on 7 February 1997.</P>

I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the law centres at Navan and Cavan opened in the latter part of 1996 and the law centres at Newbridge and Tullamore opened in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> There are 30 full-time law centres in operation at present.  Of these, the law centre at Waterford is owned by the Legal Aid Board and the other 29 are leased by the board.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board has an authorised staff complement of 224 and has two extra staff who are on loan from other Government Departments and offices.  In addition, the board has authority to employ a Grade A solicitor and a clerical assistant-typist to operate the private practitioner scheme.  At present it has 14 staff vacancies, all of which are in the clerical grades.</P>

      <P>Under the cultural development incentives scheme which I am administering under the operational programme for tourism 1994-99, I approved, in principle, on 28 June 1996 an offer of grant assistance to an absolute maximum of £750,000 towards the cost of developing the Tipperary South Riding County Museum.  On 19 February 1997 on foot of a revised proposal from Tipperary South Riding County Council, I conveyed my approval for the development of the proposed museum facility on Suir Island, Clonmel.  This offer of grant assistance can only be confirmed when a number of outstanding issues relating to the project are resolved to by Department's full satisfaction.</P>

    <P>The Heritage Council, which I appointed on 10 July 1995 under the Heritage Act, 1995, is an autonomous statutory body which has power to provide assistance &mdash; including financial assistance &mdash; and advice to persons and bodies in matters relating to its functions.  A detailed list of any grants approved or paid by the statutory Heritage Council will be published in its annual reports.</P>
    <P>The figures which I have provided above do not take account of moneys expanded or approved directly by other bodies under the aegis of my Department such as An Chomhairle Ealaíon, Bord Scannán na hÉireann or Bord na Gaeilge during the period in question.  Details of grants awarded by such bodies and the location of specific projects funded are available in their annual reports.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Deputy that, in addition to the expenditure to which I have referred, a significant allocation of £687,500 in relation to Limerick City Gallery of Art has been approved by me under the cultural development incentives scheme but not yet expanded.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision and maintenance of traffic signs on the national roads network, including the funding of such signs, is a matter for the National Roads Authority.  Responsibility for signs on non-national roads is a matter for individual local authorities, financed from their own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grant provided annually by my Department. Road grants have been fully allocated this year and there are no moneys available from which a further grant could be made to any local authority.</P>
      <P>In December last, following extensive consultation with local authorities, I published a comprehensive traffic signs manual which sets out policy, and the standards to be applied, in relation to all aspects of road signage including directional signs.  There have been no significant submissions to my Department in the matter of directional traffic signs since publication of the manual.  The application of the standards set out in the manual will help to ensure that signage is both effective and well maintained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Fingal County Council was given approval last <Col N="1804" /> January to commence immediate construction of an advance section of the Baldoyle flood relief scheme, phase 2.  This section involves the construction of the river Mayne outfall, at an estimated cost of £300,000.  I have also approved the preliminary report of phase 2 of the scheme, at an estimated cost of £2,200,000, and Fingal County Council is due to submit contract documents to my Department later this year.  This phase involves the structural rehabilitation of the Willie Nolan Road culvert using relining techniques and the construction of a pumping station at the western end of Admiral Park.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Howth water supply scheme, I gave approval to Fingal County Council to proceed with construction last November.  The estimated cost of this scheme, which involves the construction of a 1,300 cubic metre capacity service reservoir on a site adjacent to the existing Baily Green Reservoir, is £600,000 and construction is expected to commence later this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>An overall review of the urban renewal schemes as they have operated to date is currently under way.  As part of the review, a consultants' study on the impact of the schemes in economic, social and architectural terms has been completed and published and is now the subject of a process of public consultation.  Submissions have been invited from interested persons and organisations in relation to the study's conclusions and recommendations.  Copies of the study are available in the Oireachtas Library. There are no proposals at this stage to extend the present urban renewal scheme to any additional areas.  It would be inappropriate to consider what new areas, if any, might be suitable for designation as part of any future scheme until general policy in relation to the next phase of urban renewal is determined in the light of the review.</P>

Where schemes have not yet been approved, including the Bawngorra scheme, it will in future be a matter for the relevant local authorities to decide on grant applications.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation has made proposals for a programme of works to upgrade elements of its housing stock, including window replacement.  There are no funds at my disposal from which assistance could be provided for the works in question.  The management, maintenance and improvement of existing dwellings is the responsibility of the local authority, to be financed from its own resources. However, where funding is made available, under the remedial works scheme, to assist authorities in carrying out major structural works to designated housing estates, the installation of replacement windows may be included as part of such works.</P>

      <P>The question of staffing in St. Angela's College of Education for Home Economics, Sligo, was discussed at labour relations conferences on 30 January and 27 February and is to be discussed again at a labour relations conference on 13 March.</P>
      <P>The Labour Relations Commission was established in January 1991 under section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  A conference under the Labour Relations Commission is held to enable the resolution of an industrial dispute. Where the commission is satisfied that no further efforts on its part will advance the resolution of the dispute and the parties to the dispute request the Labour Court to investigate the matter, the commission will report the dispute to the court.</P>
      <P>A review group, under the auspices of the Higher Education Authority is, at the moment, examining the question of teacher supply and demand in the second level sector including home economics.</P>
      <P>Pending the outcome of this review it has not been possible to sanction the creation of permanent posts.  I must also emphasise that Government policy on the limitation of numbers employed in the public service imposes severe constraints on the creation of new posts.</P>

These are the leaving certificate vocational programme and leaving certificate applied equipment grant scheme, the school administration project and <Col N="1825" /> grant scheme for the provision of equipment for pupils with certain disabilities.  The school in question has recently benefited under the school administration project and the scheme for pupils with disabilities.  I understand that the school has not applied to participate in either the leaving certificate vocational programme or the leaving certificate applied.</P>
      <P>Costs associated with the purchase of computers may at the discretion of schools be funded from their general running costs grant.  The basic second level <i>per capita</i> running cost grant has increased from £150 in 1993 to £177 currently.  As this school is designated as disadvantaged the level of <i>per capita</i> grant is £207.  An additional grant of £50 per annum has also been paid to the school in question in respect of each student on its transition year programme.</P>

      <P>The central set-down point is a feature of the post-primary school transport scheme, and is in operation in several large towns throughout the country, which have more than one post-primary school.  Under the arrangement, post-primary pupils are dropped at the central point and make their own way to their appropriate schools.</P>
      <P>A central set-down point has been in operation in Tuam in the past.  However, I understand that the location of the set-down point has recently been changed.  My Department has received correspondence on the matter, suggesting alternative set-down points, and has requested a report on the issue from the local transport liaison officer.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be informed of the outcome as soon as the report comes to hand.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals at present to extend the Early Start Programme or the Breaking the Cycle scheme to additional primary schools.</P>
      <P>Schools were selected for inclusion in the programme on the basis of priority of need as reflected in the level of educational disadvantage of the pupils concerned and also having regard to the availability of suitable accommodation to house a pre-school project.  Unfortunately, the school in question did not have the necessary accommodation available to accommodate a pre-school project at that time.</P>
      <P>The school in question was among those invited by the Education Research Centre to apply for inclusion in the urban phase of the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  All applicants schools submitted data on the educational disadvantage of their pupils under a range of specific criteria devised by the Education Research Centre. The centre selected schools for inclusion in the initiative on the basis of priority of need as reflected in the data submitted.  Unfortunately, based on the data it submitted, the school in question was not among those selected by the Education Research Centre for inclusion in the initiative.</P>
      <P>The needs of the school in question will be considered in the event of any further development of the Early Start pre-school programme or the Breaking the Cycle initiative being undertaken.</P>

    <P>A total of ten consultants' reports commissioned by the Department since the Minister took office, have been completed to date.</P>
    <P>The position about publication of the reports is as set out above.  The above statement does not include payments within the courts building programme to various consultants (e.g. Architects) appointed by the local authorities, who are acting as the Department's agents.  Under the terms of the Government decision of March 1990, such consultants' fees are reimbursed by my Department.</P>
    <P>In relation to the reports and studies as set out in the previous answer the following reports and studies have been made publicly available: report by advisory group on charities-fundraising legislation; inquiry in the Department of Justice into the delisting of Judge Dominic Lynch from the Special Criminal Court panel; report on the violence at Lansdowne Road during international soccer match between Ireland and England on 15 February 1995; and working group on a Courts Commission.  (i) First Report &mdash; Management and Financing of the Courts; (ii) Second Report &mdash; Case Management and Court Management; (iii) Third Report &mdash; Toward the Courts Service.</P>
    <P>Some of the reasons that the remainder of the reports and studies have not been made publicly available are as follows: the confidential nature of the report-study; the report-study has not yet been completed; the report-study was carried out <Col N="1835" /> to provide necessary information on which to base an internal management decision.</P>
    <P>Aside from the specific matters, set out above there are, of course, ongoing studies and research undertaken in my Department as part of normal day-to-day work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the comments to which the Deputy is referring.</P>
      <P>It has not been the practice, however, to comment on statements made by judges in court and I do not propose to depart from the practice followed by my predecessors in that regard.  Comments that may be made by members of the Judiciary outside of the courtroom setting would be a different matter.</P>
      <P>I do, of course, recognise that the protection of potential victims of crime is one of my primary responsibilities as Minister for Justice.  I am, therefore, particularly aware of the need, when considering individual prisoners for temporary release, to be fully cognisant of the potential risk to the public arising in each case.  All releases are carefully vetted in this regard.  It would be less than frank, however, not to recognise, as I have done on many occasions, that for several years, but especially the past ten years or so the shortage of prison accommodation has significantly increased the pressure to grant early release to prisoners.  That is why I decided, with Government approval, to give priority to a major prisons expansion and development programme which will involve a total expenditure in the region of £135 million by the end of 1999 and will see available prison places increased by 35 per cent &mdash; about 800 places &mdash; by that time.</P>
      <P>Some of these extra places have in fact already come on stream and I am proceeding separately with interim measures to reduce the number of offenders who are released early because of the prisons accommodation problem which I inherited.</P>
      <P>It is right to acknowledge, also, that even if there were no accommodation difficulties, nobody could absolutely guarantee that the early release of offenders &mdash; which is a feature of prison systems worldwide &mdash; would ever be entirely free of risk.  It is a fact of life, both within and outside of the prisons context, that some individuals, no matter how carefully vetted or how favourably assessed by those dealing with them, will nevertheless betray the trust placed on them and proceed to re-offend.  What this argues for, however, is the exercise of care and professionalism in the vetting procedures, not an end to parole concessions of any kind.</P>

      <P>The format of identification parades, and the manner in which they are held, are procedural matters for the Garda authorities, and are not governed by any legislative provision.  Comprehensive guidelines on the procedures to be followed have been prepared by the Garda authorities.  There is an obligation, on the part of the member conducting the parade, to explain to the suspect that he or she is not required to take part in the process.  No inference may be drawn from a failure to take part.  The need for the witness to make an identification clearly is explained to witness who is not obliged to participate in an identification parade system.  Nor is he-she obliged to put their hand on person contrary to some recent press coverage.</P>
      <P>The overriding consideration in any identification procedure is to exclude any suspicion of unfairness or the risk of erroneous identification, and to make sure that the witness ability to recognise the suspect has been fairly and adequately tested.  The inherent fairness or otherwise of the procedure followed at the identification parade is amongst the matters which can be questioned by the defence in the course of a criminal trial.  Case-law has consistently stressed that those in charge of prosecutions should be scrupulous in looking after the rights of the accused.  It can be anticipated that any changes to the procedures adopted in identification parades will be met by rigorous challenges in the courts by defence counsel.  There is also a danger that the introduction of screens will prove counterproductive because of suspects declining to participate, as is their right.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these constraints, I understand how traumatic it can be for a witness to take part in an identification parade and I am aware that the gardaí do all they can to reduce the difficulties for witnesses.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the SMI steering group appointed by the Government to conduct a strategic management review of the Garda Síochána.  The questions raised by the Deputy are issues which I understand are under consideration by the steering group who will be reporting soon on its conclusions.

There are, however, seven gardaí and one sergeant attached to Mountjoy garda station for <Col N="1842" /> the escort of prisoners.  I understand that, on average, four additional members are provided from within the Dublin north-central division on occasions when extra gardaí are required for escort duty.</P>

      <P>The allocation and utilisation of the Garda fleet is a matter for the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>They have informed me that the number of Garda vehicles in use throughout the country as of 1 January 1997 was 1810 and that the allocation of Garda vehicles to particular areas is based on consideration of a number of matters including population, criminal activity, availability of Garda drivers, special needs such as traffic, serious crimes etc.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that Garda vehicles which are allocated to Garda districts are in use every day, except when vehicles are being serviced or repaired.  Certain specialised units within the Garda Síochána operate a five day week while other units are subject to call out at any time and could work every day for a number of weeks.  The daily usage of transport allocated to such units will vary according to the changes in working hours and days.</P>
      <P>The allocation and deployment of the Garda fleet is under continuous review by the Garda authorities and, at present, a computerised fleet management system is being installed which, when fully implemented later this year, will provide for greater efficiency with regard to the management of all aspects of the Garda fleet including utilisation levels.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to clerical staff employed in the Garda area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the anti-crime package <Col N="1844" /> announced by the Government on 2 July 1996 provided for an increase of 200 in the number of civilians to be recruited to enable an equivalent number of gardaí to be released from clerical-administration type duties to operational duties. This figure included a provision for 120 clerical staff.  There were 728 clerical staff working in the Garda area at 28 February 1997 as compared with 675 on 31 July 1996 and it is expected that this figure will rise to 793 by the end of June 1997. There are some vacancies in the clerical assistant ranks and the necessary arrangements to fill those posts have been put in place which will allow positions to be filled by June 1997.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of personnel to fill the 80 nonclerical civilian posts under the anti-crime package is dependent on selection from competitions run by the Civil Service Commission.  The results of one such competition are expected shortly. Arrangements to have further competitions held are at an advanced stage and it is expected that these competitions will be advertised shortly.</P>

      <P>The number of individuals granted varying periods of short-term temporary release has averaged about 4,000 a year for the last five years.  In 1993, the latest year for which accurate figures are available, the number was 4,212.  In that year, 3,564 individuals were granted full temporary release.  I must stress that one cannot simply add these two figures together to arrive at a total number of individuals who obtained some form of temporary release in that year as there would be a significant overlap of individuals between the two groups e.g. a prisoner may have received a day's temporary release to attend a funeral and subsequently been given full temporary release later in the year.  This prisoner would be counted in both sets of figures. Figures are not kept in such a way as to readily give the exact extent of this overlap.</P>
      <P>Exact figures for 1996 and 1997 are not yet available.  However, indications are that the number of full temporary releases granted is about the same as 1993 i.e. 4,000 per year and approximately 4,500 individuals would be granted varying periods of short-term temporary release in the course of any one year.  Again, there would be a significant overlap of individuals between these two groups.  I will, of course, be happy to let the Deputy have the exact information for 1996 and 1997 as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>The membership and terms of reference of the Commission on Public Service Pensions were announced by the Minister for Finance in February 1996.  The commission is to examine and report on the occupational pension arrangements for public servants having regard to the emerging costs of public service pension scheme benefits, and claims for improvement in those benefits.  Its terms of reference include the Garda Síochána as well as public servants employed in the Civil Service, non-industrial and industrial, Defence Forces, education, health and local authority services. The commission is to present its report to Government in 1998.  I will consider the implications of the report for the Garda Síochána pension scheme at that time.</P>

      <P>Just prior to the task force on security for the elderly report an evaluation was carried out of a number of community alert schemes.  This evaluation showed that these schemes had a positive effect on crime levels in the areas surveyed.  The actual results recorded were: 17 per cent decrease in attacks on the elderly, 25 per cent decrease in burglaries, 21 per cent decrease in other crimes.</P>
      <P>In addition, the community alert groups received £50,000 during 1996 to provide them with the resources to significantly expand the number of schemes in operation over the next couple of years.  This has facilitated increasing to five the number of development officers employed by the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have continued to assist and support the community alert-neighbourhood watch groups.  Further research needs are being <Col N="1859" /> refined so as to continue the evaluation of these schemes.  When such evaluation is completed I will consider its findings.</P>

      <Quest>the number of prisoners transferred from Mountjoy to other prisons since 1 January 1997; the number subsequently granted temporary release; and the number of prisoners who are obliged to sign on at the prisons to which they have been transferred, having been given an early release.</Quest>

      <P>The total number of transfers of prisoners from Mountjoy Prison to the other prisons and places of detention in the State between 1 January 1997 and 28 February 1997 inclusive was 386.  Records are not currently maintained in a manner as to readily identify the number of prisoners included in the above number who were subsequently granted temporary release.  It should be noted that Mountjoy is a committal prison and therefore many prisoners arrive there and are then distributed around to other places of detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All offenders who are granted temporary release are obliged &mdash; as a condition of the release &mdash; to return to their prison or place of detention on the expiry of the period of release. <Col N="1860" /> In each case the offender will either be returned to custody or she/he may be granted a further period of temporary release.  This involves signing a form of undertaking under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  In cases where an offender is close to the end of his or her sentence full temporary release may be granted.  In these cases offenders are not required to return to the prison but all other conditions, including the requirement to be of good behaviour, continue to apply.</P>

    <P>It should also be noted that there are from time to time spare spaces in the three open centres as there may not always be suitable offenders for transfer on any particular day.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give an exact breakdown of offences as this would entail the manual examination of all files of those in custody and such a use of staff time could not be justified.  However, I can inform the Deputy that the typical percentage breakdown by category offence of the sentenced population in prison at any one time would be as follows: offences against the person, 27 per cent; offences against property with violence, 33 per cent; offences against property without violence, 23 per cent; other offences, 17 per cent.  (Note: This final category includes those serving sentences for drugs offences &mdash; 5 per cent of the total approximately.)</P>
    <P>About 11 per cent of the total population at any one time would be prisoners on remand or awaiting trial.</P>

The number and rank of members currently serving on UN Missions in Bosnia has dropped by one with the return in January 1997 of an Assistant Commissioner from Bosnia Herzegovina.  We continue to have 15 members serving with the <Col N="1868" /> United Nations in Cyprus and there are 15 members, one inspector, three sergeants and 11 gardaí, also serving in Eastern Slavonia bringing the total number serving outside the State on UN missions to 60 members.</P>
      <P>The overseas allowance as stated in my previous reply has been adjusted and can vary from £12.04 to £19.49 per day.  Approximately 405 members of the Garda Síochána have served with UN missions since the first Garda contingent was deployed on UN duty in April 1989.  The other information requested by the Deputy is as set out in my previous reply.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As with most serious problems which afflict the community, drug abuse has, inevitably, become a major issue in some of our prisons.  I am satisfied that in facing this problem in the prison setting, the initiatives which I have brought forward represent a well balanced and effective response to what is, without doubt, one of the greatest menaces facing society world-wide, both inside and outside the prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of means have been employed in an effort to curb the supply of illegal drugs to prisoners in Mountjoy and throughout the wider prison system.  These have included, in respect of Mountjoy prison, the adaptation of the existing areas, the provision of improved searching facilities and a much improved closed circuit video surveillance system in the prison's main visiting area. The implementation of these measures in mid-1995 resulted in an immediate increase in the number of seizures of drugs and associated contraband and a sharp reduction in the quantities of illegal drugs circulating in the prisons.  Other steps have and are being considered.  I have asked for a report on the efficacy of using sniffer dogs in the prisons.  If the indications are positive, I will <Col N="1869" /> have no hesitation in employing this and any other means of cutting off the supply of drugs to prisoners.</P>
    <P>The duty of care towards persons committed to custody in the prisons extends to all health related issues of which drug addiction is, of course, one of the most significant.  The general medical service at the prison has been developed over recent years in order to meet the needs of the increased number of drug addicted prisoners committed from the courts.  Subject to the direction of the prison medical officers in appropriate cases there is now a 14-day detoxification programme available for drug addicted committals. A working relationship has been established with a number of the treatment agencies who mostly operate under the aegis of the Eastern Health Board.  Individual offenders are, in suitable cases, granted conditional temporary release in order to avail of recognised treatment programmes in the community, often following extensive contact through the offices of the prison medical service, the probation and welfare service and the relevant Eastern Health Board clinic or general practitioner.  A level of co-operation has also been established with the courts in respect of the monitoring of offenders' progress &mdash; often through drug urine testing &mdash; prior to planned court sentence reviews.</P>
    <P>A number of treatment-avoidance options for drug addicted prisoners in Mountjoy have also been specifically developed over the last 12 months.  These include the drug treatment unit based at the prison's health care unit which has now been in operation for over seven months. The treatment unit provides a structured programme with humane detoxification followed by a six week therapeutic course.  The unit has medical, nursing and psychiatric services in place and all personnel are experienced in addiction treatment. The therapy programme is co-ordinated by a senior probation and welfare officer and draws on the experience and expertise of a number of community based agencies which are active in this field.</P>
    <P>This is based at the training unit adjacent to Mountjoy prison, has been in operation since June 1996.  It currently accommodates about 80 offenders in an environment where a drug-free existence has become the norm.  Prisoners with a background of chronic drug abuse who have come to terms with their addiction, as well as those who have had no prior involvement with drugs, are equally availing of this facility.  The regimes in the health care unit and the drug-free unit are underpinned by a strict drug urine testing programme.  These initiatives have been developed in response to a real demand for treatment and avoidance options for prisoners.  They <Col N="1870" /> are working well and I intend to expand and develop both models throughout the wider prison system in order to maximise their effect and availabilty. Treatment in all cases must be voluntary and, in order to be effective, the individual concerned must show the necessary commitment and motivation.  It is unfortunately the case that despite the availability of the treatment options which I have outlined above, many offenders continue to fail to grasp the opportunities provided to address their addiction.</P>
    <P>Finally, regarding the prosecution of visitors found attempting to supply drugs, I wish to emphasise that in such cases the gardaí are informed and are called to the prison.  Proceedings in respect of such incidents have been taken over the last 18 months with convictions and, in a number of cases, sentences of imprisonment being imposed.</P>

      <Quest>the current position regarding an appeal lodged on 4 December 1996, by a person (details supplied) in Dublin 17 whose unemployment assistance has been reduced by £40 from 4 December 1996, in view of the fact that his wife took up a child minding position at the rate of £40 per week; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this person approached an official at his Department prior to taking up this employment and specifically mentioned the nature of the employment she wished to take up and the amount she would be receiving per week and was assured that it would not affect her husband's unemployment assistance; if his Department will refund to her husband the £40 per week deducted from his unemployment assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The advice given by the local social welfare office to the person concerned was on the basis that his spouse would be engaged in insurable employment where a working spouse allowance of £45 per week is deductible from earnings.  However, as a self-employed person the spouse's earnings, less any expenses incurred, are assessable as means on her husband's claim. Accordingly, his means were reviewed resulting in an assessment of £40 per week derived from his spouse's self-employment.  This rate was effective from 4 December 1996.</P>
      <P>He appealed this decision and the appeal was received at the social welfare appeals office on 19 December 1996.  The case has been considered by an appeals officer who has decided that an oral hearing of the appeal will be necessary.  The hearing will take place in the social welfare appeals office during week commencing 24 March 1997.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over as well as to certain incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  The scheme provides eligible people with free travel on a range of services provided by the CIE group of companies as well as on the services provided by a large number of private transport operators. There are currently about 486,000 people who qualify for free travel at an estimated cost this year of £32.60 million.</P>
      <P>According to the 1996 labour force survey, there are 40,500 people in the State in the age group 60-65 years who are classified as being retired.  It is estimated that the cost of extending the free travel scheme to that category would be in the region of £2.7 million per annum.</P>

      <P>It is a normal rule of career breaks that recommencement of employment at the end of the specified period is conditional on the existence of a fillable vacancy.  Where no such vacancy exists there may be a delay in resumption.  Such waiting periods are seen as part of the career break. Where persons on career breaks find themselves in financial difficulty they may apply for assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The allowance is subject to a means test. Each case is dealt with on an individual basis, taking into account all the relevant circumstances.</P>

      <P>Customer service is one of the key priority action programmes within the strategic management initiative in my Department.</P>
      <P>Meaningful consideration with customers has been identified within their programme as the key to understanding their needs and expectations and a number of mechanisms have been put in place to elicit the views and perceptions of our direct customers.  These include customer panels, surveys on a systematic basis and the provision of comment cards in all local offices.</P>
      <P>To date customer panels of unemployed people have been established in Dublin, Cork and Longford, while a lone parents panel is in operation in Limerick.  Panel members are selected on a random basis and meet regularly with officials of the Department to discuss various issues and express their views regarding the quality of the service delivery process.  The panels have also proved to be a useful sounding board at the development stages of new initiatives or procedures.  Feedback on action taken in relation to issues that are raised by panel members is a particular feature of the meetings.  Among the issues raised to date have been the timely provision of information, access to and privacy in local offices, queueing times and the back-to-work initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The panels have proved to be most worthwhile and it is my intention to extend this consultative process further to cover other geographic areas and also to extend the coverage to include other categories of customers.

      <P>CERT is the State body with responsibility for tourism training.  Last year they trained almost 12,000 people for the tourism industry including 2,177 commis chefs at a cost of almost £12 million.  They plan to train similar numbers for the industry in the current year and in each subsequent year up to end 1999 in line with projections in the current operational programme for tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT persue a multi-pronged approach with regard to the provision of in-service training for <Col N="1886" /> the existing tourism workforce.  Day release programmes are provided for young entrants to the industry, which allows them to pursue a formal qualification, while continuing to work in the industry.  Other tourism workers are enabled to climb the skill and career ladder in tourism through attendance at a formal training programme during the tourism off-season.</P>
    <P>Parallel with these formal qualification-based training programmes, CERT has a wide range of short-term flexible programmes which allow tourism managers and workers to develop their skills without disrupting their work commitments. Some 5,000 people are targeted by CERT annually through advisory projects, in-company training and externally delivered training programmes. Though not part of the formal education system, these programmes have the flexibility and responsiveness to be developed and operational within a short time frame that can meet specifically targeted needs.</P>
    <P>Specifically with regard to standards, CERT has the assistance and support of the National Tourism Certification Board which includes a range of representatives from the Department of Education, other educational bodies, the industry and CERT itself and whose primary remit is to seek to maintain high standards in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent employment survey commissioned by CERT happily confirms that overseas tourism growth in recent years has translated into steady job growth.  Employment in the tourism sector has increased by some 20 per cent over the past four years and all regions have shared in that growth.  The regional distribution of employment in the sector is broadly in accordance with what might have reasonably been expected given Bord Fáilte estimates of regional tourism performance.</P>
      <P>While the south west region provides most jobs in hotel and guesthouses at 25 per cent and in self-catering accommodation at 39 per cent e.g. restaurants, fast food outlets, tourism services and attractions in a number of other sectors, the average number employed per business in Dublin was higher than for its regional counterparts.</P>
      <P>The spread of employment regionally for licensed premises is more even.  Dublin provides 19 per cent of jobs in this respect, with the south west and mid west supplying 17 per cent and 16 per cent of jobs respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that Dublin employs 24 per cent of the overall figures reflects the fact that the city has become a major &ldquo;capital city&rdquo; tourist attraction <Col N="1887" /> for visitors to this country, now competing very effectively with other traditional European &ldquo;city visit&rdquo; locations such as Amsterdam.  Additionally, the regions have also benefited, with the south west accounting for 19 per cent of total employment and the mid west and west together accounting for 25 per cent matching the Dublin contribution.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the survey forecasts tourism employment growth of 4 per cent for 1997.  Tourism remains a vital contributor to our further economic development and to the creation and maintenance of employment opportunities both in urban and rural areas and especially in disadvantaged areas offering little alternative employment potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>Barriers to trade that have been brought to my attention in the recent past relate mainly to failure to fully implement the rules governing the free movement of goods and services within the European Union Single Market and tariff and non-tariff barriers in major markets outside the EU.</P>
      <P>The issue of remaining barriers to trade within the Single Market was one of the subjects of a major review of the functioning of the Internal Market which was presented by the EU Commission to a meeting of the Internal Market Council which I presided over during the Irish Presidency.  The review, which confirms that the Single Market has contributed to increased levels of income and employment, also highlights the need for further action to be taken to ensure that Single Market legislation is correctly applied and effectively enforced throughout the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Dublin European Council subsequently noted the Commission's intention to present to the European Council in Amsterdam an action plan and a timetable covering all necessary measures that must be taken to ensure that the full potential benefit of the Internal Market is achieved before the beginning of Stage 3 of European Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>In relation to barriers to trade in non-EU markets, the main focus of attention is the World Trade Organisation.  I represented the EU Presidency at the first ministerial conference of the organisation which was held in Singapore in December last.  The conference reviewed the implementation of the trade liberalisation commitments entered into by WTO members in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations and established a work-programme for the organisation focusing on further measures needed to eliminate obstacles to trade.  The conference also laid the basis for subsequent specific liberalisation measures in the area of telecommunications, information technology goods and spirits.  The liberalisation of trade in information technology goods and in spirits is of particular importance to this country.</P>
      <P>I continue to avail of various bilateral meetings with representatives from other countries to raise issues relevant to the export interests of particular sectors of Irish industry or of individual companies. Where action at EU level is required, such issues are also raised by my officials in the specialised EU committees dealing with obstacles to trade in the Single Market and in third countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála is actively involved in assisting Irish companies to deal with practical issues related to selling their products in various export markets.  The board brings to my attention <Col N="1889" /> any problems requiring action at the intergovernmental or EU levels.</P>
    <P>The representatives of other countries continue to draw my attention to concerns they have about aspects of the EU common commercial policy. Such representations are brought to the attention of the EU Commission as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal source of incentive for the promotion and development of the Irish tourism industry is the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-9.  The Operational Programme for tourism aims to generate investment of more than £650 million for Irish tourism over the period 1994 to 1999, of which £369 million will be provided in the form of grants by the European Union.</P>
      <P>Grant assistance for the private sector is primarily available under Sub-Programme 2 (Product Development) and Sub-Programme 3 (Marketing).  The total European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) aid available under these sub-programmes amounts to £190 million for the period 1994 to 1999.  The selection of projects for assistance under the Product Development and Marketing Sub-Programmes of the Operational Programme for Tourism is determined in the case of each application by independent management boards established under the programme.  Details of European Regional Development Fund grants for individual projects are contained in the annual reports of the management boards, copies of which have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the period 1994 to end 1996, it is estimated that the total amount of European Regional Development Fund aid spent under these sub-programmes amounted to some £49.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding for private sector tourism initiatives is also provided under other operational programmes, which are the responsibility of other Ministers, including the OP for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry and the OP for Local Urban and Rural Development &mdash; and a number of other Community Initiatives such as the Leader Programme, INTERREG Programmes &mdash; both Northern Ireland and Maritime &mdash; and the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  Also, the International Fund for Ireland provides assistance in the Border counties for certain tourism enterprises.  As I do not have responsibility for the administration of these <Col N="1890" /> other programmes, I do not have available details of their final 1996 expenditures.</P>
    <P>All registered and approved tourism accommodation is also deemed eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Some £52 million of this £208 million fund was specially earmarked for tourism projects throughout the country.  A similar scheme especially for the Border counties, was introduced under the &ldquo;Peace and Reconciliation&rdquo; fund.  At this stage, the tourism funds under both these schemes have now been fully committed.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas under which investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in the 15 resort areas designated may also qualify for generous tax relief and the business expansion scheme which makes provision for tax relief on investments made in certain tourism companies.</P>
    <P>Overall, I believe the current range of incentives and grant opportunities available for tourism development will serve to provide a sound platform for tourism growth well into the future.</P>

      <P>Growth targets for indigenous exports other than food in the period 1994 to 1999 aim for an annual average increase of 14 per cent.</P>
      <P>According to OECD estimates, world merchandise trade is expected to grow by 6.7 per cent in 1997 and 7.3 per cent in 1998.  The Central Bank forecasts that the likely growth in Irish merchandise trade in 1997 will exceed these figures and will reach 14 per cent.  The expected increase in trade will depend on continued improvement in the economic and financial environment in Ireland's main trading partners. Robust and sustainable growth in the United States and a continuation of growth in Japan and Europe are expected to contribute to expansion in Ireland's export performance.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that more job losses are threatened in Keytronic Ireland, Dundalk, County Louth; the action, if any, he, or the State agencies propose to take in this regard particularly in view of the assurances given in 1996 when nearly 300 jobs were lost in this company; if he will agree to special measures to tackle the high and stubborn unemployment in the north east region, particularly in Dundalk and Drogheda; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined to the House in the Adjournment Debate last night, Keytronic, Dundalk, last week announced their intention to lay off a further five employees.  The company, in conjunction with staff and the union, successfully implemented an agreed major restructuring of its business in 1996.  This agreement included the transfer of part of the manufacturing operation to a sister company in Mexico and the retention of 75 employees in a significantly downsized operation in Dundalk.  Since then market factors, in particular pricing pressures, have continued to impact adversely on the Dundalk operation and as a direct result the company is now faced with further lay-offs. In addition, the company has indicated that unless orders significantly increase in the next two months, they will be forced to reduce employment from 86 to 53 by the end of April.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is monitoring the situation very closely and maintaining close contact with the company in the matter.</P>
      <P>On foot of the significant lay-offs at Keytronic in 1996, I requested the industrial development agencies to embark on a vigorous campaign to bring alternative jobs to the north east.  In late 1996, two large new projects were announced. DSC Communications intends to create 475 jobs at Drogheda over the next four years.  Engineered Plastic Components, Dundalk, expects to employ 300 persons by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is actively responding to the challenge of attracting new inward investment to the north east region through the acquisition of land for development.  An advance factory is currently under construction in Dundalk.  This factory is being promoted by IDA Ireland.  A new industrial site for an advance factory is being acquired in Cavan and a developer will be sought to provide an advance factory in Monaghan as soon as a project has been secured for the Cavan factory.</P>

The Order brings Part IV of the Act, dealing with penalties for those convicted of the offence of cruelty to animals, into operation from 5 March, 1997, while the provisions of the Act dealing with horse control will come into operation on 18 March 1997. Regulations are being drafted under the Act in relation to the licensing and identification of horses and will be in place by early April 1997.  I have provided £2 million in my Department's Vote for 1997 to assist local authorities in implementing this legislation.  The by-laws are a matter for the local authorities themselves.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the beef processing sector faced major difficulties in the period following <Col N="1915" /> immediately after the BSE crisis last year. These earlier losses, however, were more than adequately counter balanced by gains over the remainder of the year due to the increase in throughput of cattle in meat factories and the availability of raw materials at the lower prices.</P>
      <P>Producers, on the other hand, had a very difficult year, particularly in the second half of the year when prices remained close to safety net for a lengthy period.  While the June 1996 compensation package will go a considerable way towards compensating producers for the losses incurred, I am satisfied that the extent of their losses justifies the allocation of the entire October package to this segment of the beef industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I am awaiting a formal application from CIE for a light railway order for the Tallaght-Dundrum line in accordance with the provisions of the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996.  I indicated to the House last December that the statutory public inquiry into CIE's application would probably be held in the first half of 1997.  This was in the expectation that an application would be received in February. At this stage the earliest a public inquiry is likely to take place is summer 1997.  There is a commitment in the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99 to provide EU funding for light rail and substantial EU funds have in fact already been paid to CIE.  It has been agreed with the European Commission that the first phase of the light rail network will comprise the proposed Tallaght-Dundrum line.  This project is still on schedule for completion in the year 2000 and EU funding is not in jeopardy.  I am committed to the completion of the three line network including extensions to Sandyford and Ballymun.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 260 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my answers to Question No. 299 of 28 January 1997 and Question No. 32 of 11 February 1997.  The number of reports which have been completed by consultants since I took office was three.  The total cost of their reports/services was £60,242.  One report related to computerisation in the Naval Service which was funded jointly with the Department of the Marine.  The report was not made public as it was of a specialised and technical nature relating to aspects of fishery protection and not of public interest.  The other two reports were produced in connection with the strategic management initiative in the Department and the Defence Forces and both of their strategy statements will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>All vessels engaged in commercial sea fishing, including those fishing for lobster, are required to be licensed and registered.</P>
      <P>A special scheme was introduced in 1994 to regularise the position of a substantial number of mainly small vessels which had been in the fleet since 1984, but which for various reasons had not been formally licensed or registered.</P>
      <P>The costing date for receipt of applications under the scheme was 17 February 1995.  As I explained to the Deputy in my reply of 4 February, there is no record in the Department of an application under the scheme being received from the person to whom the Deputy refers.  However, if the person in question can produce documentary evidence, such as proof of postage the Department may be willing to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced on 2 August 1996 that the Government had approved the award of a contract to Bond Helicopters (Ireland) Ltd., for the provision of a marine emergency helicopter including search and rescure based at Shannon airport.  The contract commenced on 1 January 1997, on the expiry of the previous contract with Irish Helicopters Ltd., and is for a minimum period of two and a half years with an option to extend for up to five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bond advised my Department on 20 February 1997, in accordance with their contractual obligations, that the fully compliant helicopter with auto-hover, which was to be delivered to Shannon by 28 February 1997, was now expected to be in service by the mid to end of March 1997. The delay in the delivery of this helicopter arose from an electrical design fault identified during a recently completed independent quality check. Adverse weather conditions have also hampered flight testing.  The fault has since been remedied and flight testing has resumed.  The Bond helicopter development programme, which commenced <Col N="1932" /> after the contract award in August 1996 and has been the subject of close monitoring and regular review by the Department, was fully on schedule up to this recent development.</P>
    <P>A fully serviceable marine emergency helicopter is already in permanent operation by Bond from Shannon.  This helicopter has been providing marine emergency response since 1 January 1997 and has carried out nine successful rescue missions to date.  It has rescued or assisted 19 people including the rescue in extreme weather conditions of 13 fishermen from a fishing vessel, which caught fire at a location 150 miles off the coast of Galway, on 1 March 1997.  It has all the features of a fully compliant helicopter, with the exception of an auto-hover system.  Bond have made available, with effect from 1 March 1997, a second helicopter to improve the capabilities of the existing helicopter at night time and in bad weather conditions.  Crews and specialist lighting devices have been provided to support the operation of two helicopters on a rescue mission.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor developments very closely and will review all matters relating to the service, including contractual obligations, on a week to week basis.</P>
