      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the Irish Genealogical Project, sponsored by his Department up to August 1996.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General wrote to the Secretary of my Department on 7 September 1995, advising that he wished to carry out a detailed value for money study of the Irish Genealogical Project.</P>
      <P>The main issues to be examined were: whether prior appraisal of the project was adequate; the extent to which the project had achieved its objectives within time and budgetary targets, and the systems and procedures established for managing the project.</P>
      <P>The result of that study is the report on value for money examination of the Irish Genealogical Project which I laid before the Dáil on 22 April 1997.</P>
      <P>In the study, the Comptroller and Auditor General concentrated on the extent to which the project had succeeded in creating a computer database which would provide a family history research service and the study also examined the management of the project.</P>
      <P>The study concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that by the end of July 1996 just over 29 per cent of the estimated 29 million records had been included in the database and that monitoring of progress in implementing the project had been ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the report.  It provides a committed and hardworking team of genealogy tourism service providers throughout Ireland with an independent assessment of how improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of their operation can be put in place in the years ahead.  Focusing as it does on the effectiveness of the management of the project and the extent to which it has succeeded in creating the computer database, it highlights <Col N="150" /> several important needs.  Chief among these is the need for the project to establish clear targets and to periodically assess progress relative to those targets.  As the report itself acknowledges, following the appointment of a chairperson and chief executive officer to Irish Genealogy Ltd. &mdash; IGL &mdash; a company established to function as the project's central co-ordinating agency &mdash; clear targets have now been set for the creation of a central referral index and for the development of a marketing plan for the project.  The research methodology employed in the compilation of the report provides a sound basis on which IGL will continue to plan and monitor progress.</P>
    <P>As stated on page 32 of the report, recent management developments in the project are designed to ensure that the necessary leadership and direction are provided to build on the expertise, energy and enthusiasm of the many participants engaged in the project, whether in the Irish Family History Foundation centres, or as members of the professional genealogists associations North and South, or in IGL and to ensure that the objective of providing a comprehensive family history research service, based on a countrywide network of centres and independent professional genealogists, is brought to completion.</P>
    <P>The Irish Genealogical project will build this service for posterity which will be to the benefit of countless future generations of people of Irish ancestry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach will be aware, I was actively involved ten years ago in the establishment of the Genealogical Office and its services by one of his predecessors and in its endeavours to initiate various schemes and programmes in parishes nationwide to build on its records.  I too welcome the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Is it the Taoiseach's understanding that the Comptroller and Auditor General undertook its preparation because the demands on its services could not be met?  With the huge interest by tourists in this issue &mdash; the National Library informs me that a huge number now check baptismal and other family records to trace their roots &mdash; does the Taoiseach agree it is time we recruited some trained genealogists to raise the standard of the services and expertise and to ensure its computerised information data is of the highest possible standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At present 65 full-time staff are employed overseeing the collection of the data. There are 39 full-time and 27 part-time genealogical researchers in the centres and 24 independent genealogists working for them in respect of the service.  In addition, 516 trainees, co-ordinators and researchers from FÁS are working under the appropriate supervision.  There is a very significant staffing commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In attempting to put this data on computer and assemble it in a co-ordinated form for the first time, the Government of the day entered unchartered <Col N="151" /> territory.  Unduly optimistic expectations were probably expressed about how quickly this work could be done when it commenced, which was recognised in the report.  There were also a number of difficulties.  All offices were not set up at the same time and some were slower than others to be set up.  As of July 1996, parts of the country had not yet been covered by centres, particularly south Cork, Wicklow, Monaghan and Louth, which explains part of the non-capture of the records.  It has proven more difficult to gain access to some of the targeted records.  The 1911 census, for example, was expected to be more accessible than it has proven to be.  I understand the same is the case with the General Register Office data from the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that only 29 per cent of the targeted records have been entered after this length of time and there is a need for improvement. Targets have been set to ensure the project, while maintaining the necessary local autonomy and enthusiasm which is the secret of its success, is managed in a more pro-active way so that the work will be done as quickly as possible and we will be able to offer a comprehensive service covering the entire country to visitors, no matter where their ancestors lived.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will implement the recommendations in the report of Ireland's information society steering committee.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12156/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the recommendations of the Report of Ireland's Information Society Steering Committee, I launched the Government's Millennium Initiative on the Information Society on 9 April.  I gave details of this comprehensive initiative in my answer to the House on 15 April and a copy of the press statement at the launch has been placed in the Library.</P>
      <P>The Government's initiative, which will form part of Ireland's millennium celebrations, includes the Schools IT 2000 initiative announced by the Minister for Education, proposals to stimulate further developments in the business sector and the establishment of an Information Society Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Information Society Commission will have the function of shaping and overseeing the implementation of a strategic framework for the development of the Information Society Initiative in Ireland.  The commission will be asked to recommend changes in legislation to remove any limitations on the use of information and communication technologies.  The commission will also advise on measures to increase access to information and communications technologies, particularly measures aimed at those in disadvantaged groups.  In addition, the commission will establish sectoral advisory groups to develop <Col N="152" /> detailed recommendations for action based on the ideas put forward in the steering committee report.  I have already announced the appointment of Ms Vivienne Jupp as chairman of the commission and the membership of the commission was announced last Friday.</P>
    <P>The Information Society Initiative can be made most cost effective if there are elements of compatibility with what is being done internationally, in Britain and elsewhere.  The new British Government plans to wire-up schools, libraries, colleges and hospitals to the information super highway.  It plans a National Grid for Learning, franchised as a public-private partnership, which will help teachers update their skills.  It also plans a new University for Industry, collaborating with the Open University to bring new opportunities to adults seeking to develop their potential.</P>
    <P>As a follow-up to the Information Society Initiative, I explored the possibilities for co-operation with the British Government on these matters during my visit to Britain last week.  There are opportunities for savings on educational hardware and software investments, and for co-operation on particular courses and subjects.  Specifically, I would like Ireland to have inputs to, and benefits from, both the proposed new National Grid for Learning, and the new University for Industry in the UK.  I look forward to developing the possibilities for co-operation in these areas with the new Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, who responded positively to my suggestions.  I agreed with the Prime Minister that the structured east-west co-operation mechanism already in place would provide a suitable forum for initiating progress in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the projects included in the initiative is the establishment of a digital park. What is the Government's view on the location of such a park?  Will it be determined to maximise job creation?  I wish to return to an issue I raised with the Taoiseach when we last discussed this matter in the House.  He said at that time that some of my ideas on addressing the lack of graduates were worthy of merit and that they would be referred back to the commission.  I recently attended a conference where a number of senior executives from large technological companies highlighted this difficulty and said that it is not becoming a crisis, it is a crisis.  This is the most urgent issue to be dealt with by the commission. If there are high quality jobs available in the industry we should be able to produce people for those jobs.  If we are not doing so, what proposals has the Government to rectify that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the establishment of a digital park, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has asked Forfás to identify the appropriate place for such a park &mdash; that will involve important site selection.  In view of the fact that the overall effect of the implementation of the information society proposals could ultimately be the creation of up to 48,000 additional jobs, the <Col N="153" /> decision on a digital park, which will play a central role, using broad band technology in a concentrated area to maximise its use, particularly in the co-ordination of sounds and pictures, and using co-operative techniques to enable workers in the park to work with people in other parts of the world without moving to those parts, will be a very important decision which Forfás is best qualified to take and will take in the near future.</P>
      <P>On the issue of skill shortages, we are fortunate to be in a position where this is becoming a problem. If we did not have substantial growth in employment we would not encounter this difficulty, but it is a difficulty which must be tackled if we are to sustain the present rate of growth in employment.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment has announced proposals to deal with that matter.  He proposed a competitive tendering arrangement for higher education institutions which would compete to provide training or education in the specific skills where skill shortage has been identified.  The most cost effective and educationally effective providers will be selected on a competitive basis to ensure the maximum number of places for the resources devoted to that purpose and that we overcome skill shortages as quickly and systematically as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that in excess of 50,000 jobs have been created since 1993-4, why has the Government not dealt with this issue before now? Why is the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, in the dying days of the Government, trying to find ways to deal with this matter when he should have done so in 1995 when it was first highlighted?  I raised with the Taoiseach previously the difficulty of a two-tier society in information technology where the well educated will receive further education &mdash; everyone welcomes that &mdash; but there are no proposals in the various reports of the commission to cater for those on the margins of information technology.  There are long-term plans for first level education.  What efforts will be made to co-ordinate those plans? Since people taking part in post-leaving certificate courses, who are totally ignored by the Government, have a certain level of qualification, will programmes be restructured to give those people an opportunity to take up the jobs that exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment has moved promptly and effectively to deal with the emerging skills shortage. The arrangements he is now putting in place are extremely effective and well targeted and will deal with the problem in a way which will deliver extra skills in co-operation with the industries which need these people.  Because of the recent acquisition by the Minister of certain overseas flagship projects, some of which have only been announced in the past year, the skills shortage must be addressed in co-ordination with those concerned.  I am glad to say the Government has <Col N="154" /> acted speedily on this matter.  Further measures will be taken if necessary and we will monitor the situation closely to ensure emerging skills shortages do not remain unmet.</P>
      <P>The Government gives exceptional priority to disadvantaged areas, especially to schools in those areas.  We recognise that one of the principal problems is that some young people rarely attend school, if at all.  There is a need to develop home-school links as well as to reform the school attendance service to ensure it supports families by assisting them to appreciate the value of education rather than exclusively adopting a penal or regulatory approach.  That reform is one of the priorities of the Government for next year.  This matter must be dealt with purposefully for the reasons I have given.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bertie Ahern's suggestion that we must ensure the information society is not two-tier and that everyone has the means to participate in it.  That is why we are providing computers in every school, with priority for schools which are relatively disadvantaged.  We are also providing computers with Internet access in public buildings such as libraries, so that people without the means to have such facilities in their homes at their own expense will have access to them in public places.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  I had a very constructive meeting with the British Prime Minister last Thursday.  We had useful discussions on a comprehensive range of issues, including those relating to Northern Ireland and the European Union. As regards Northern Ireland, he shares my view on the need to inject energy and momentum into the political process and to build confidence in the two communities.</P>
      <P>I addressed the Oxford Union on Wednesday, 7 May.  The main topics I covered were Northern Ireland and issues within the broad British-Irish relationship.  Rather than summarising all the points I made in a broad ranging address, I have instead had copies placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express my deep sympathy to the family of Mr. Seán Browne who was found murdered in Randalstown, County Antrim.  Mr. Browne, the chairman of Bellaghy GAA club, was abducted outside the grounds and was found murdered in what is apparently a callous sectarian attack.  I express my deep sympathy, that of the Government and, I believe, of all the <Col N="155" /> people of this State to the family of Seán Browne, to the people of Bellaghy and Derry and to the Gaelic Athletic Association against which this must also be seen as an attack, as well as against the individual who died in such terrible circumstances. It is extremely important that this spiral of sectarian killing be brought to an end.  We must recognise that this is a blot on the good name of all people who live in the affected areas.  Everyone must co-operate with the relevant law authorities in combating this by giving the necessary information to ensure those who are responsible for this and other sectarian attacks are brought to justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this side of the House, I join with the Taoiseach in strongly condemning the murder of a senior GAA official in Bellaghy and in sending our sympathies to his family and the community.  Is the Taoiseach concerned at the recent rapid growth in sectarian attacks in all communities, attacks, assaults, attempted murder and murder in some cases?  I warmly welcome the strong and pointed remarks of the Church of Ireland primate, Archbishop Eames, which I heard at lunchtime.  He spoke of issues which would concern me.</P>
      <P>Last week when the Taoiseach rightly asked for a flawless ceasefire from the IRA, I raised the question about eyes being turned away from what seemed to be increasing loyalist attacks and assaults by whatever source within the loyalist communities.  Can anything further be done on this issue in conjunction with the British authorities? In arguing for a ceasefire it is important that it be held by everybody in all cases.  It is of no benefit if any one movement says there is a ceasefire if there are regular attacks from that community.  I would like to hear the Government's view on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Sectarian attacks are not just awful injustices to the families and the individuals targeted but they also are a shame on the community from which the perpetrators come.  We need to restore some sense of shame about what is happening.  There is a tendency to speak about attacks like this in a formulistic way and to become almost numbed by the repetitive copycat character of some of these attacks.  There must be a serious sense of shame among the communities from which these killers come.  However, the continuing attacks from the loyalist community is obviously a matter of grave concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The participation of political parties in the talks should be as comprehensive as possible.  My objective in obtaining the establishment of the inclusive all-party talks, to which the British Prime Minister agreed and which opened on 10 June 1996, was to have all parties at the table. The talks were specifically designed to have all parties at the table but clearly the parties must be there to represent non-violent politics and not something else.  The Mitchell principles set out <Col N="156" /> the requirements in very clear terms.  Parties must adhere to the Mitchell principles in every sense, not just on paper but in the behaviour of their adherents and in the way in which they exercise control over the behaviour of their adherents. The Mitchell principles are not simply a formula, they represent a commitment which must be made by all of the parties.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy and the House knows, the procedures for raising a question about the compliance by any organisation with the Mitchell principles are set out.  It is open to anyone who wishes to make a complaint to lodge a complaint and there is a procedure for hearing complaints. No one should attempt to prejudge a matter in the absence of a complaint being lodged and investigated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach and the leader of Fianna Fáil in expressing my sympathy to the Browne family on the brutal murder of Seán Browne.  As the Taoiseach said, it is not just the murder of Seán Browne but an attack on the Gaelic Athletic Association and all it stands for. Coming as it does in the wake of the murder of Constable Bradshaw and the brutality meted out to Robert Hamill which led to his death last week, one can only wonder what kind of people can carry out these dreadful brutal sectarian attacks.  The Taoiseach said he and the British Prime Minister agreed they need to inject energy and momentum into the process.  Will he agree the most effective short-term injection of energy and momentum into that process would be a reinstatement of the IRA ceasefire?  Will he join me in asking the two new MPs to use their considerable influence to bring that about sooner rather than later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree a reinstatement of the IRA ceasefire and a total cessation of violence, would be of enormous positive benefit.  I urge all those with influence in the republican movement, elected or otherwise, to use it to achieve a total cessation of armed action by the IRA so that Sinn Féin can exercise its mandate as a normal political party without threat of, or recourse to, violence by the republican movement ever again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach received any response from the British Government regarding the case of Róisín McAliskey.  This case reverts to the days of Michael Howard.  Is there any progress in this case?  Is there a meeting planned between the Taoiseach and Mr. Trimble?  Will that meeting be solely between the Taoiseach and Mr. Trimble as it appears that he has some difficulty meeting the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste? Will the Taoiseach clarify if the Government is prepared to reopen contact with Sinn Féin at official level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the case of Róisín McAliskey with the British Prime Minister and pointed out the need to intensify efforts to find a <Col N="157" /> humanitarian approach through the ongoing official contacts between the two Governments.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion from Mr. Trimble that it might be possible to meet while I was in London. However, my diary could not facilitate any meetings other than those already scheduled.  I have suggested to Mr. Trimble that we meet in the near future.  The normal process by which I meet political parties is that the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare and, perhaps, other Ministers are also present.  The Government approaches this matter on a collective basis and it would be to the benefit of all our interlocutors that they have access to all the relevant decision makers.</P>
      <P>I have outlined the position on contacts with Sinn Féin on a number of occasions.  I am willing to authorise official level contact where there is clear evidence of a specific matter to be discussed which, if satisfactorily dealt with, is liable to lead to an imminent ceasefire.  That has been and remains the position.  To the extent there is any increase in optimism with regard to an imminent ceasefire if certain matters were dealt with, the relevance and possibility of such meetings is enhanced.  The position remains as it has been since the last meeting and since I made this statement of policy.</P>

      <P>Regarding the Róisín McAliskey case, is the position that the British Government is to shortly inform the Government of what it intends to do?  I am sure the Taoiseach has seen the reports that her state of health has deteriorated and she is in need of further attention.  Even though the circumstances have been set out to improve her position, this issue cannot be delayed much further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is being monitored on a daily basis by the Irish Embassy in London. The Embassy is in very frequent contact with the relevant authorities in Britain.  I cannot give the Deputy the up to date position as of today but I will make inquiries and inform him.</P>

      <P>Given that the Taoiseach said on Sunday there will be an early June election, is it still the Government's position that the talks should proceed on 3 June and, if so, will it be represented at those talks at ministerial level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saddened and horrified at acts of sectarian violence and join others in expressing sympathy to the family of the late Mr. Browne and others affected by such brutal acts. What additional support can be provided for initiatives to promote cross-Border and inter-community understanding in which organisations such as Co-operation North are involved?  Low key events such as inter-school activities and sporting events do not get the headlines and are <Col N="158" /> not big news but are of critical importance in overcoming what we are talking about here.  Will the Government keep the doors open so that Nationalists and loyalists or British nationalists do not feel isolated?  This is of critical importance in bringing about a ceasefire which is urgently needed if further progress is to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On what can be done to promote North-South co-operation, it is extremely important to promote co-operation between the United Kingdom and this State on an east-west basis to create a context in which it will be easier for those of a Unionist disposition to agree to co-operation on a North-South basis.  The proposals I put to the British Prime Minister to promote co-operation on the environment, the use of technology in learning, homelessness and food safety should be of help.  It is hoped the two national food safety authorities we are establishing will co-operate with each other.  It will be much easier, from a political point of view, for Northern Unionists to agree to co-operation on a North-South basis on a more intensive basis under a rubric which includes east-west, United Kingdom-Ireland co-operation.  That is the reason I have stressed the need to develop Strand III of the discussions to make it easier to develop Strand II and to create a supportive context in which a network of contacts necessary to reduce tensions can be created.</P>
      <P>On what can be done to reduce the sense of isolation felt by both communities, the purpose of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is to reduce the sense of isolation felt by the Nationalist community by ensuring the Irish Government is consulted and has an input to policy on Northern Ireland.  There is also an important need to ensure the Unionist community or, as the Deputy described it, the British nationalist community in Northern Ireland does not feel isolated either. That is one of the reasons I have attempted in various symbolic ways to recognise the importance of the British tradition in Ireland.  My attendance, for example, at Islandbridge was designed to emphasise this on an all-island basis. My attendance recently at the launch of a book commemorating the people of Bandon, County Cork who fought and died in the Great War was also designed to emphasise that we recognise there are a variety of heritages on this island, all of which have a validity which needs to be celebrated and affirmed.  It is important that symbolic recognition should continue.

      <P>I agree this is an appropriate time for such an intervention, particularly when we see sectarian attacks of the kind which are occurring and which seem to have something of the nature of spontaneous mob hatred about them.  Such attacks are not necessarily organised in the deliberate way terrorist attacks are organised. Terrorist attacks are possibly not as capable of being influenced as to their execution by what church people might say, whereas the spontaneous expressions of anger and hatred which have been seen in recent times are more likely to be influenced quickly and positively by interventions of the kind suggested by the Deputy.  I strongly agree with him there should be strong intervention not only at the level of the leading figures of the churches but at local level by the churches in seeking to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the Deputy that in terms of intervening at a higher level with those who control organisations which support or use terrorist methods, the churches can play a particularly useful role at this time as they have done in the past. It is fair to say that the Catholic and Protestant churches have played a significant role in the past, and I urge them to do so with increased intensity at the present tragic time.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of regional accounts and under the last EU Structural Fund regulations, GDP is used as the income measure.  GDP <i>per capita</i> is converted to purchasing power standards to take account of different price levels in the EU member states.  In 1994 Ireland's GDP <i>per capita</i> was 88 per cent of the Union average.  while the United Kingdom's GDP <i>per capita</i> was 99 per cent.

More than half of this increase occurred between 1994 and 1996.  In those two years alone, the numbers at work grew by 103,000 with the result that there are now more people at work than ever in the history of the State.  In the same nine year period, unemployment fell by 42,000 to 190,000.  The internationally comparable unemployment rate was 16.9 per cent in April 1987, and the corresponding figure for 1996 was considerably lower at 11.9 per cent.  I will now give the Deputy the figures for the number of people at work during those years: 1987 &mdash; 1,090,000; 1988&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of the sale of Irish art is complex.  On the one hand, while it can be argued that the sale of major paintings to buyers outside Ireland constitutes a loss to the country, it can equally be argued that the nature of the international art investment market serves to draw attention to the great talent of visual artists from this country and that many purchases at international sales of Irish art are by Irish-based collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the specific auctions on 21 and 22 May 1997, with works to be auctioned by Christies and Sotheby's, it is not a matter for me as Minister to mandate people to purchase major works of art.  The cultural institutions under my aegis act autonomously in acquiring items for their collections.  It is a matter for those bodies to decide on priorities within their acquisitions budget and their priorities between acquisitions and other needs.  They establish the figure that is available every year.  In the case of the Connolly papers to which the Deputy referred and which were auctioned last year, the National Library bid for the papers up to a level it considered appropriate to their value but was not prepared to pay <Col N="162" /> a sum in excess of what it believed to be a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sales referred to by the Deputy, the National Gallery is the main institution under my aegis which will be considering whether it will participate.  Even if I were aware that an institution under my aegis had the intention of participating in a particular auction for a particular item, I would not consider it desirable to comment given the possible effect on prices if it became known that an institution was bidding.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that in approaching the issue of acquisition generally the institutions under my aegis are constrained by the funding available to them from the Exchequer and from other sources.  As I have said on many previous occasions, I am not satisfied these institutions have sufficient resources, financial and staffing, to play the full part they could and should be playing in Irish life.  While I have been able to provide significant increases in the Exchequer funding since becoming Minister, which helps in developing their programmes including acquisitions, this was from a very low base and funding is still not at a satisfactory level.</P>
    <P>In order to further facilitate major acquisitions by the institutions this Government introduced a provision in the 1995 Finance Act permitting tax relief on donation of important cultural objects to our main collecting institutions.  This provision is now worth £750,000 in a calendar year.  The initiative has been successful in attracting a number of important gifts, including the archives of the great Irish painter, Jack B. Yeats, and the original architectural drawings of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I hope to see this generous tax relief provision continue to be availed of by donors now and in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure key items that are crucial to our heritage are kept in Ireland.  For this reason the Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, provides for the establishment of a register of key cultural items.  Export of these items can be prohibited when they have been in public care for a certain period or deferred for up to one year when the items are in private custody.  This period would allow time to negotiate their purchase if considered desirable.  Of course, as was discussed during the Oireachtas debates on this Act, any protective measures must balance private property rights and the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not disingenuous to say our national cultural institutions are independent and have their own acquisitions budgets?  In his reply the Minister admitted that only the Exchequer and political will can ensure such acquisitions budgets are at the disposal of those institutions.  At present, only £250,000 is available to our cultural institutions for acquisitions and restoration and about £200,000 of that sum is earmarked for the National Gallery.  This causes great concern when the institutions are confronted with the moneys available to other institutions and individuals at auctions held by <Col N="163" /> Sothebys and Christies.  Will the Minister encourage such auctions to be held in Ireland as this might help raise awareness of and interest in our heritage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an increase in awareness in Ireland of our heritage.  It was assisted by the passing of the Heritage Act and the inclusion in that legislation of an educational role.  The previous advisory heritage council was given a mandate to be involved in education and explaining heritage.  That was good.  There is a general sensibility of the importance of our heritage in different ways, although I would not claim competence as Minister in second guessing the acquisitions committee of the National Gallery.  I am not an expert in the visual arts and do not pretend to be.</P>
      <P>I said the funding had moved from a low base. That base was £116,000 in 1993.  I could have said the increase to £257,000 represented an increase of 121 per cent but I preferred to tell the House that the baselines with which I started were excessively low.  One needs to make a qualitative improvement and to be careful.  The purpose of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1996 was to establish autonomy and ultimately whoever is Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht can strengthen the budget for the arts.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be controversial during this rather special Question Time, but at a time when I was out of the Department, in 1994, the allocation for the Arts Council was cut by 13 per cent, the same percentage by which I increased it for 1996-7.  I hope whoever is Minister in future will receive the support of everyone in the House in making dramatic increases in provisions, including the acquisitions budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the National Cultural Institutions Act was a welcome one in that it gave us an opportunity to look at our institutions to see how we could improve the structures, would the Minister not agree that talking about structures is one thing and can be helpful, but is of very little use if there is no funding to go with the structures?</P>
      <P>As to the specific items that will be considered at the upcoming auctions at Sotheby's and Christie's, the eight paintings and, particularly, the Harry Clarke windows, I am aware the Minister has a particular interest in them and, like everybody else in this House, understands their value to our heritage.  It would be wonderful if the State were in a position to acquire these nine panels. Perhaps the Minister would ensure that moneys will be made available by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in order that we should not lose this important part of our heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One should never have to choose between good legislation and making provision. The legislation dealing with all of these <Col N="164" /> institutions was archaic, the institutional procedures were out of date and the baselines in funding were unrealistically low.  I will not waste anybody's time by speaking of the state in which I inherited them.  On a previous occasion I recall the Heritage Council identifying very important furniture and not having sufficient resources to purchase it at auction.  It was by a combination of effort on the part of the Office of Public Works, the Heritage Council and other bodies, including my Department, that eventually a sum was put together which, by effective bidding at the auction, managed to secure the work.  I can assure the Deputy that the institutions are aware of the significance of the objects that are for auction and I would be sympathetic to repeating the previous exercise if it were likely to be successful and of assistance to the institutions concerned.  It would be inappropriate for me to say more than that.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of the production company to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of any certificate that may be issued following conclusion of the Department's examination.

      <P>The issue of a certificate does not represent a guarantee that a film will be produced or that tax relief will be granted.

I understand the Revenue Commissioners are involved in talks with representatives of the investors to whom the Deputy referred.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the matter.  There are three components involved.  The dealings of the film section of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht are with the producer and when a producer publishes a prospectus it is an invitation to invest.  A point frequently stressed by the Revenue Commissioners is that if there is not any risk involved it cannot be called an investment.  A portion of the funding for the film to which the Deputy referred was transferred to the film made eventually, but the precise sum involved is the subject of discussions between the Revenue Commissioners and the representatives of the investors.</P>

In the recent months there has been an increase in the number of projects submitted for certification.  A further test of capacity would probably delay the application process.

Nach bhfuil sé costasach páistí a chur chuig an mór-thír chuig na meánscoileanna?  Tá daoine nach bhfuil in ann aon chabhair nó dóthain cabhrach a fháil chun na costasaí sin a íoc.  De bharr sin, tá brú á chur orthu éirí as an oileán ar fad.  Nach bhfuil saor oideachas ag na páistí agus na tuismitheoirí de bharr na rialacha atá leagtha síos?  Nach mbeadh sé cóir na rialacha sin a athrú ionas go mbeadh <Col N="167" /> sé de cheart ag na tuismitheoirí ar Inis Meáin saor oideachas a fháil dá bpáistí ag cur san áireamh, costaisí na scoileanna cónaí agus costaisí taistil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Constituents of mine on Inis Meáin are being denied free education.  Parents on the island do not qualify for the scheme because they are employed in certain positions on the island.  There are enormous costs in sending children, sometimes more than one per family, to boarding schools.  The lack of adequate subsidies for transport is denying them their legal right to free education as promised to all students.</P>

    <P>What is the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht doing for the rights of these parents? Deputy Ó Cuív and I have raised this issue on a <Col N="169" /> number of occasions but no progress has been made on the matter.  I asked the Minister if he was aware that those on the island feel that his Department, which has two Ministers, does not seem able to make the representations on matters that affect them in their ordinary lives?  What is the point in having Ministers for the Gaeltacht if they are not prepared to recognise the difficulties of island residents and to alter schemes where obvious injustices are being imposed on parents?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in my reply of 19 December, 1996 to a similar question, the position is that An Chomhairle Ealaíon has redesignated The Arts Plan to cover the five year period 1995-1999 and has reordered its priorities accordingly. It follows that the funding targets in The Arts Plan now apply to this five year period.</P>
      <P>The increased provision of £20.8 million for An Chomhairle Ealaíon for 1997 means that I have succeeded in more than doubling An Chomhairle's allocation since my initial appointment as Minister in 1993.  It also represents an increase of £2.4 million over An Chomhairle's allocation for 1996, or, in percentage terms, a 13 per cent increase.  Percentage increases of the same magnitude in 1998 and 1999, years four and five of the plan, will bring the resources of An Chomhairle to a level of over £26 million, the funding target for the final year of the Arts Plan.</P>
      <P>I look forward to securing the remaining funding necessary so that in 1999 the funding target for the final year of the plan will have been achieved.</P>

      <P>I cannot but be slightly amused listening to Members opposite whose only defence appears to be to ask what the other side did when in Government since the Labour Party, at any rate, appears to have forgotten that some of its members have been in Government for four and a half years.  Does the Minister agree his legislative record is abysmal?  Three Bills were passed and five others are awaited, including one on broadcasting.  Does he agree the £12 million shortfall for 1995-7 has eroded a major part of his election plank, party manifesto and Programme for Government?  Furthermore, does he accept that the necessity to redesignate the Arts Plan has necesssitated a revision of priorities with regard to its contents?  Would he explain how these issues have been reordered and when he expects to receive the additional funding he seeks from Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is the atmosphere prevailing that encourages people to take such an historical view.  When I began in 1993 the funding for the Arts Council stood at £10.1 million and now stands at £20.8 million.  Whether one portrays <Col N="171" /> that through a small or large poster it remains more than double the original figure.</P>
      <P>When I decided in partnership with the Arts Council to establish an arts plan, an estimated cost had to be put on its implementation.  It was emphasised that the delivery of such an arts plan in an adequate manner would require funding of £26 million.  As part of the negotiations with the Department of Finance, it became possible to implement the plan decided by the Arts Council over a five-year period.  That is what I did, there is nothing vague about that.  There was one interruption in its implementation, which needs to be stressed, which is that in the dying days of a minority Government in November 1994 there was a savage cut of some 13 per cent in the allocation to An Chomhairle Ealaíon for that year from £13.2 million to £11.6 million.  I was not then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I had been replaced by the present leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  That was the only time between 1993 and today that, instead of obtaining the increased funding sought, the Arts Council, was fired into reverse.  I must assume it is somewhat cynical for any Member to point out that we are reaching the target of £26 million, from a base of £10.1 million, in five rather than three years.</P>
      <P>In regard to my legislative programme, I am very happy at the amount of legislation passed and look forward to introducing other measures later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather disingenuous of the Minister to speak about the funding made available until he assumed his present portfolio.  It is important to remind him that the target for the Arts Council of £26 million &mdash; which was to have been reached by 1997, not 1995 in the Minister's original plan &mdash; was promised by him, his party and Government and nobody else, which promise he has been unable to fulfil.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not refer to the reordering of the priorities of the arts plan consequent on its becoming a five rather than a three year one. Would he comment thereon for the benefit of Members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>After the decision had been taken to fund the arts plan over a five-year period, its authors, the Arts Council, announced it would be able to retain its integrity within a five year period.  The reason for that is simple: the plan has been constructed around modules which meant simply that one could reorder these without losing its integrity for example, with regard to the kinds of issues in which those people in the arts community are interested, when not being encouraged to have unnecessary fears.</P>

      <P>In 1996 and 1997, these parts of the plan were progressed, when partnerships were entered into between An Chomhairle Ealaíon with the local authorities of Laoighis and Donegal.  By 1988 all local authorities will have appointed arts officers.  In fairness to Deputy de Valera, she will recall that the first arts officer to be appointed was in County Clare and remained a solitary flower for a long time.</P>
      <P>In addition, there will have been undertaken a complete review of the provision of theatre in Ireland by the relevant division of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, an important report completed by Combat Poverty and An Chomhairle Ealaíon, aimed at affording access to arts by those who were excluded along with further co-operation with the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.  No significant elements of the plan had to be deleted but there was rearrangement of all of the modules planned.</P>
      <P>It would have been better to have implemented all of its proposals in three years rather than five but that is still preferable to firing the whole project into reverse.</P>

      <P>Since the Arts Plan is now more than halfway through its revised lifespan, is it the Minister's intention &mdash; if he finds he is returned to his present portfolio after the general election &mdash; to present a report on the progress made on the implementation of its objectives?</P>
      <P>Will he also state what has been the outcome of the theatre review to which he referred?  Has that review group produced a set of recommendations and, if so, when will these be implemented and what progress is being made under that heading within the overall context of the Arts Plan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a good idea to have a mid-term review of the plan but that is primarily a matter for the Arts Council.  I merely gave examples of what had been achieved in 1996 and 1997 to date.  I would have no difficulty in placing such an interim review before the House if such has been completed by the Arts Council.</P>
      <P>The theatre review, to which there are many different dimensions, was long overdue.  I will correspond with the Deputy on its detail but she will appreciate that the quality of venues in her native city has improved immensely over the past two or three years and will improve even more so over the next 12 months when the funding provided for so many venues yields returns, including the magnificent Everyman Palace Theatre; all these magnificent theatres of which I know she is rightly proud.</P>

An bhféadfaidh an tAire Stáit a rá cén chaoi ar tharla sé gur dhúireadh linn i mí Feabhra seo caite go mbeadh athbreathnú á dhéanamh i mí Aibreán, ach tá mí Aibreán caite gan aon athbreathnú déanta?  An bhféadfaidh sé a rá go mbeidh an t-athbreathnú roimh an toghachán? Nuair a chonaic mé an tAire Stáit ag seasamh suas, bhí a fhios agam nach mbeadh muid ag fháil an dea-scéal inniú.  An mbeidh an tAire ag dul ar Raidíó na Gaeltachta roimh lá an toghachán ag fógairt an dea-scéile?  Caithfidh mé comhgairdeas a chur chun Aire d'éirí leis airgead na healaíne a mhéadú ó £10 milliún go £20 milliún sa mbliain ach, mar is léir ó na statisticí a gheobhfaimid ar ball, níl an tAire céanna in ann an cúpla bpunt is úracht chun na bóithre Gaeltachta a chosaint leath chomh maith.</P>

Tá meath a teacht ar adhmaid an báid agus cur sé as dom go mór é sin a cloisteáil.  Tá mé ag scríobh chuig Rannaí Stáit le roinnt bliain anuas agus níl toradh sásúil fáighte agam fós.  Is bád an-tábhachtach é seo ar stair na tíre.  Ó mo thaobh fhéin, táim bródúil gur sheol mé an bád seo sa bhfarraige mór blianta ó shin agus bhí baint agam leis é a chur san áit ina bhfuil sé faoi láthair.  Níl aon cúram ormsa ó shin faoi cén chaoi a bhfuil siad a bhreathnú i ndiaidh an báid agus tá an-imní orm faoi na scéalta a chuala mé.  Ba mhaith liom a ndeimhneoidh an Aire go bhfuil rudaí i gceart, go bhfuil an bád á choinneál slán agus nach bhfuil sé ag meath nó ag titim as a chéile ag teacht.  An rinne sé aon bhreithiúnas nó survey a bhféadfaigh an báid a dheisiú agus a chur ar ais ar an fhairraige? Tá daoine a rá gur bhféadfaigh é sin a dhéanamh, cé narbh é sin an comhairle a fuair mé nuair abhí mé ag plé le cursaí seo sa Roinn Cosanta.</P>

      <P>Glacaim le suim an Teachta sa cúrsa seo agus cúrsaí seoldóireachta go háirithe agus go ghinearálta.  Ba mhaith liom an méid eolas agus is mó a thabhairt do.  Tá cúram á thabhairt don <i>Asgard.</i>  Faoi láthair, tá bealaí éagsúla chun é aúsáid san dea-chaoi á breithniú againn. Mar shampla, do bhuail fo-choiste ón Comhairle Oidhreachta leis an dream fiondúireacht a raibh suim acu é a athchomhrú.  Ghlac siad le tuairim áirithe ach níor phlé siad é san comhradh ghinearálta don Comhairle Oidhreachta.  Glacaim leis an suim ag an dream chun é a dhéanamh ach tá difir an-mhór idir é a athchomhrú agus é a chuimhnigh. Mar go bhfuil sé i gceist acu é a athúsáid i maith coinníollachta, beidh poiblíocht faoi sin go mbeadh sé ar an farraige arís agus mar sin de, níl sin an díreach a bhí acu.  Tagann duine go dtí an poinnte sin ar an bealach is fearr í a chuimhnigh agus bhí tagairt sna páipéirí ar chóir go mbeadh <Col N="175" /> sé i coileán ionad nua an Museum.  Nuair a dhúirt mé go mbeadh sé á breithniú faoi láthair, b'fhéidir go bhfuil bealach ann, mar shampla, é a lonnadh i Ringsend ar talamh.  Caithim a glacadh le tuairimí na saineolaithe chun an chaoi is fearr chun an obair a dhéanamh.  Mar a dúirt mé ar na bealaí éagsúla, ba chóir duinn ord cheart a thabhairt má déanfar an cuimhne é a caoimhniú.  Táim ar a laghad sásta sin a dhéanamh ach caithfidh muid eolas breise a fháil faoin chaoi chun is féidir sin a dhéanamh agus an áit is caoi chun é a lonnadh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the immense historic importance of these buildings, will the Minister confirm that the provisions of the National Monuments Acts will be utilised to provide emergency legal protection to the threatened house and farmyard complex?  Will he also confirm that this complex will be scheduled as a registered historic monument bearing in mind its immense historic importance and its association with John Philpot Curran, the father of Sarah Curran, a famous orator, a champion of liberty and defender of the United Irishmen?  Next year we celebrate the bicentenary of 1798 and the United Irishmen and it would be a shame and a disgrace on all of us, who have inherited the principles of the United Irishmen, if this building was lost because proper legal steps were not taken to protect and preserve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that the question of the Whitehall complex being offered protection under the National Monuments Acts is being examined by the heritage service of my Department, which is appropriate.  The complex of buildings is owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union. The architectural division of the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service assessed the buildings in 1995 and noted a number of features, apart from the historical references mentioned by the Deputy, including the plasterwork and so on.  An application was made to demolish the Whitehall complex but it was refused by Dublin South County Council on 13 June 1995.  I have asked the heritage services to prepare a report on the complex with a view to offering it protection under the National Monuments Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The heritage services are examining the complex with a view to affording it protection under the National Monuments Act and that examination is not yet completed.  It is appropriate I tell the Deputy everything I know. On registration of a structure as an historic monument the owner is required to give two months' notice of intention to carry out work, and that is a significant protection.  It allows the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service time, if necessary, to have the work recorded, to negotiate with the owners on the works, to preserve what is of importance and to address the integrity of the building and important procedures.  A preservation order is made on work or material of exceptional merit.  I expect the report from the heritage services on the protection appropriate under the Act will address these issues.  I will have no difficulty in communicating with the Deputy to update her on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that a Bill dealing with this matter was voted down by the Minister and other members of Government, has he a guilty conscience on leaving office without putting in place law to give proper protection to buildings of historic, architectural and artistic merit?  A clear understanding was given that the Government would put in place alternative legislation, but because that was not done buildings of this nature are threatened.  Does the Minister have an apology to make to the House and the people for failure to put in place proper legislation to protect buildings of this nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is no.  Last week I published new architectural policy.  I had much sympathy with the legislation proposed by the Deputy.  A great deal of work is necessary on legislation to protect the heritage and that work is at an advanced stage in the Department.  Deputies contributed to the debate on the Heritage Act and as a result of that legislation and the national monuments legislation we have a stronger heritage package.  Much more could have been done if the resources were available.  I am very happy that in the past four years there has been a quantum leap of interest in this area.  I hope my colleague or I will be able to continue this work and I look forward to a very busy legislative autumn.  If I am in this position I promise plenty of legislation for 1997.</P>
      <P>On whether I should affect guilt and beat my breast, the answer is no.  People who stood in this place before me may feel like doing so, but guilt is an emotion I do not recommend generally.</P>

      <P>There is probably no point in my asking about legislation for next week or the rest of the session.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to legislate before Thursday for the rights of Telecom Éireann employees to purchase 15 per cent of the shares in the company based on the commitments they negotiated and agreed to with management so that the company can be a strong, viable, competitive and efficient organisation?  In all the years I have dealt with it, it has achieved great strength without losing working days.  Will the Government introduce legislation to give them that right before the business of the House closes on Thursday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government supports the view that Telecom Éireann employees and those of other State companies should be shareholders in the companies, should have the capacity to play a part in the working of the company and should share in its profits achieved as a result of their efforts.  The Government is working in partnership with the management of the company and the trade unions representing employees with a view to achieving this with agreement, thus enhancing the commercial strength of the company and protecting employment within it.</P>

      <P>The Government wishes to comply fully with commitments it and others gave to employees on this matter.  We are working with them to achieve an outcome satisfactory to all concerned which protects all interests.  The purpose is to strengthen our national telecommunications company to ensure it can compete internationally and make commercial decisions in an effective way, thereby enhancing the job prospects and incomes of those it employs.  It is also the purpose that the company should operate as a genuine partnership between management and employees and that everyone feels they own a share in it.</P>

      <P>I recall the day not many months ago when this Government, without a Cabinet meeting, held a hurried meeting in the Taoiseach's office between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, to decide to sell 20 per cent of the company for half its value, according to stockbrokers.  However, there seems to be great difficulty in granting the workers who made the company a success the 15 per cent share for which they ask.  They do not <Col N="181" /> ask for it nothing.  They are prepared to abide by all market conditions and provisions.  I am very disappointed the Government, in the dying days of this Dáil, cannot give a straight answer to a straight question.</P>

A decision of this complexity must be well prepared to ensure the ultimate result is one which benefits the company, thereby giving the best possible guarantee of high incomes and employment security to those in the company.  We are working with all relevant interests in a spirit of partnership to achieve that objective.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 34 and 36 and in page 6, to delete lines 1 and 2, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  (a)  Sections 1, 2 and 4 Part IV, sections 45, 46, 47, 56(1) (other than paragraph (b), and sections 49 and 60 (in so far as they relate to donations at a presidential election), 70 and 72 (other than paragraphs (a) and (c)), and 73 shall come into operation on the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>(b)  Parts I, III, V, VI and section 72 other than those provisions specified in paragraph (a) shall come into operation on the first day of January, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  This Act, other than those provisions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b), shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed therefor by order or orders of the Minister either generally or with reference <Col N="185" /> to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for the insertion of a new subsection in place of subsection (6) of section 1.  As I announced on Committee Stage the Government has decided the provisions of the Bill relating to the disclosure of donations for political purposes will come into effect on enactment of the Bill.  It will not be subject to a commencement order.  However, donations received before the commencement of the relevant sections will not have to be disclosed.  Thus Part IV, which deals with disclosure of donations for political purposes by political parties and Members of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament, candidates at Dáil, Seanad and European elections, will automatically commence when the Bill has been signed by the President, so also will the provisions of Part VI in so far as they relate to disclosure of donations by candidates at a presidential election.  Ancillary provisions, such as sections 2, 4, 70, 72 and 73, in so far as they relate to disclosure of donations, will also commence from the day of signing by the President.  The provision dealing with payments to political parties and control of election expenses at Dáil, European and presidential elections will, as already announced to the committee, commence from 1 January 1998.  These will automatically commence on that date without the necessity of a commencement order.  The remaining parts of the Bill will be brought into operation as soon as possible by means of a commencement order. These are the parts dealing with the establishment of a constituency commission, postal voting and other miscellaneous amendments.  We have had some debate on the commencement of all the provisions of this Bill and by and large we have a political consensus on the timeframe I am now suggesting.  I ask the House to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage we had extensive discussion on this aspect.  There was a fear at the commencement of Committee Stage that the Minister would decide to implement certain sections immediately and delay the implementation of other sections.  On Committee Stage we reached a level of agreement in relation to this matter.  The amendment reasonably reflects agreement with the funding of political parties and paying grants of £5,000 and so on to candidates at election time.  As they stood at the time of discussion they were impracticable and could not be met.  There was general agreement, as far as disclosure was concerned, that it was more straightforward.  The discussion is reflected in the amendment.  I will not oppose the amendment on the basis that disclosure will commence immediately on enactment of the Bill, which I presume will be around the same time as the election is declared on Thursday morning.  However, we are opposed to the sections relating to the £5,000 <Col N="186" /> grant to candidates and the funding of political parties.  In so far as these provisions will not come into operation until 1 January, we will have time to amend and remove them after the election.  I will not oppose this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never opposed the principle of disclosure of donations above certain thresholds.  I am content to live in a world where those who give more than £4,000 to a party or more than £500 to an individual should disclose that fact.  It will affect some of our more munificent donors, particularly those who have been the subject of discussion at the tribunal in Dublin Castle.</P>
      <P>This measure preserves some important principles, namely, the right of every citizen to donate to a political party within reason, the right of every political party to seek funds from other citizens and the right of every person to contribute in privacy to a political party as long as the extent of the donation does not, in the view of the ordinary person, create a sense of obligation thereafter.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats have consistently supported the proposition that there should be a threshold over which donations to political parties should be published.  In practice, with the exception of large institutions such as the banks who have made donations to parties on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, the effect of this measure will be to reduce the size of corporate donations.  Few donors will wish to appear as supporting one party rather than another.  Only those with a wide public base will be able to put their hand on their heart and say they have given equally, or in some proportion, to all parties and will continue to do so above the levels provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>That is not the end of the matter.  With the exception of the Constituency Commission which receives all party support, the other provisions of the Bill fly in the face of popular sentiment.  The public does not wish to see a system in which parties are part funded by the Exchequer.  It is suggested that this will take the pressure off politicians to solicit moneys from private individuals. The effect of the cap will be to fragment and reduce the amount of donations.  The vast majority of people do not want a situation in which the activities of political parties, apart from their parliamentary duties, are funded by the Exchequer.  Part of the scheme envisaged by the Bill is that these moneys will not be expended for electoral purposes.  That is nonsense.  I do not know what political parties do between elections other than prepare for the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should come and live on planet Earth.  Political parties are always preparing for the next election.  All their expenditure and effort is geared towards success in the next election.  That is the life force of parties. I have never heard of a party which believed <Col N="187" /> that its function was &ldquo;to serve the country&rdquo; without regard to the next election.  That is not the function of political parties.  They are support machines for implementing their policies through success at elections.  That is the case in every party.</P>
      <P>Not merely is popular sentiment totally against this proposal, there is a serious constitutional issue involved.  I am not arguing that it is beyond doubt one way or the other by reference to the Constitution.  However, if one was to start a political party such as the New Progressive Democrats or New Labour &mdash; we could do with a new Labour Party &mdash; and one was to prepare for the next general election it would be unfair that one would spend the next four and a half or five years battling with organisations funded by the Exchequer.  The Progressive Democrats were formed not so long ago.  There could have been a Christian national party formed in the last few years.  Without doubt, the process of political representation through parties will continue to develop as time goes by, nothing is cast in stone. It is a manifestly unfair and unjust law which gives taxpayers' money to one group to organise its activities between elections and gives nothing to another group which has to face it at an election.</P>
      <P>It is threadbare hypocrisy of the worst kind to suggest that this money is not available for electoral reasons and is ring-fenced from electoral purposes.  The Minister's implicit proposal that the new arrangement for funding political parties should commence at some future date is unfair, unconstitutional, improper and undemocratic in that the great majority of people do not want it.</P>
      <P>The great majority of voters do not want leaflets, pamphlets, posters, opinion polls and all other activities of political parties at election time funded by the Exchequer.  Nor do they wish to give a £5,000 grant to everyone who retains their deposit.  The majority of people regard politics as something which should be funded by parties from modest donations.  They can draw a distinction between research and assistance with parliamentary duties but they do not want taxpayers' money spent on electioneering.  People regard this as a measure akin to allowing the kids into the candy store.  They do not believe it will clean up politics.  It will not clean up politics because if it was the be all and end all of funding I could see some hare-brained theoretical argument which would make politics less open to outside influence.  However, when the funding is a dollop on top of whatever parties can raise themselves it is indefensible.</P>

    <P>Placing a cap on the amount of money which can be spent at elections is a related matter.  Some Members of this House, from all parties, are the butt of daily criticism in the media.  Perhaps in this election people will be singled out for personal vituperation by their opponents in the media.  Whether they deserve it is their business but as night follows day such people will emerge. <Col N="188" /> I do not accept a newspaper has the right to set up and hunt down Deputy Dempsey by a relentless series of articles, if its owner or editor is so minded, to suggest to the people of County Meath &mdash; or the people of Dublin South-East in my case &mdash; that he should not be re-elected.  In reply, we would be able to place only one small newspaper advertisement.  That is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>If the Ceann Comhairle was an ordinary Member of this House, if things that were untrue were said about him in a campaign conducted against him and if he decided to buy one half of one page in a newspaper which had devoted many pages to vilifying him, to say he could not do so and that he had spent too much in his election campaign would be outrageous and unconstitutional.  Why can I, if I want to, or those who support me, if they want to, not place a half page advertisement in a newspaper which has spent weeks vilifying me?  Why can I not issue my own propaganda in the form of a glossy leaflet denying what has been said about me?  Why can I not respond in kind if the media barons, such as they are, decide to get at me?  I see no reason in logic why the law should prohibit an individual candidate from spending any amount of money in rebutting criticism of himself or herself or in stating his or her own policies truly when others are misrepresenting them.</P>

      <P>I am dealing only with the effect of the amendment.  The concomitant to party funding and the funding of candidates' election campaigns, the so-called cap on expenditure, is impracticable.  Although I am a member of a party which normally puts one candidate into the field, I am aware that in a multi-seat constituency it is crazy to hope there will be transparency and truthfulness in accounts within a political party in highly competitive situations.  If three candidates in a constituency are vying for a single seat, it is not possible for a single director of elections to indicate how much each of them has spent and say, with hand on heart for fear of prosecution, he or she is giving a truthful account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was tried before in the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923 and was found to be unworkable in the years that followed, allowed to fall into desuetude and removed from the Statute Book.  In England this exact model exists in theory but is seriously broken in practice.  This was the nonsense that nearly had Dr. Hendron hounded out of a seat by Gerry Adams after the last Westminster election.  It does not clean up politics, is not fair in its result, makes politics unfair, plays into the hands of the unscrupulous and ties the hands of the scrupulous.  It is more nanny state control.  If the opinion polls are to be <Col N="189" /> believed, it looks as if the next Government will repeal all of these measures and we will have a proper electoral law which provides simply for an electoral commission and the disclosure of contributions to political parties above certain thresholds. That is as good as one can get.  The rest of this nanny state bureaucracy is unnecessary and will not clean up politics although it may keep the Labour Party happy.  It is unfair, arguably unconstitutional and retrograde.</P>

      <P>These issues were the subject of a long debate on Second and Committee Stages.  I thank Deputy Dempsey for his comments generally. We had a constructive debate on Committee Stage and the Bill is better as a result.  Many of the amendments I have tabled have their origins in the Committee Stage debate.  I regret that the Progressive Democrats chose not to table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy McDowell objects to the thrust of the Bill &mdash; we have agreed to disagree &mdash; but there is a need for a measure of transparency.  The Deputy has decided, however, that this amounts to nanny state interference. This is the position in many democracies to ensure there are reasonable thresholds to cap expenditure by political parties and candidates at election time.  Significant contributions to political parties have to be disclosed.  I suggested in opening the debate that the thresholds should be lowered, if there was popular support for such a move, but we have reached a reasonable compromise.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the concept of State funding of political parties.  No matter what way we look at it, it erodes the principle of democracy if political parties are beholden to companies or wealthy individuals.  While people may give with the best of motives, there is a perception among the general public that there is something more involved. We must address this responsibly.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell used the word &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo;. There is hypocrisy because prior to the change in the law at the end of last year the Progressive Democrats were the main recipients of State funding.  They received £150,000 per year by way of the leader's allowance.  This year they will receive £185,000.</P>

      <P>Up to the end of last year the money could be used in whatever way the party leader decided.  It would be interesting to know if every penny received prior to last December was used exclusively for parliamentary purposes.  The scheme has now been placed on a statutory basis and extended to provide support for non-party Deputies.  I was delighted about this as it is important that everybody should receive the <Col N="190" /> necessary support to contribute fully to debates in the House.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that an extra £1 million should be made available per year and that every political party which receives a minimum of 2 per cent support in a general election should receive funding. It has been agreed that this mechanism will not come into operation until next year.  It is not possible to have the control and capping mechanisms in place before the next general election which is likely to take place in the immediate future.  I regret this as I worked to have them in place.</P>
      <P>I reject the notion that it is not possible to have transparency and truthfulness in the making of declarations by candidates.  Once this measure is enacted, there will be an onus on each candidate in subsequent elections to account for his or her expenditure. A director of elections will not be asked to account for the expenditure of a political party in a constituency.  Each candidate will have his or her own election agent who will have to account for his or her expenditure.  Deputy McDowell said that a person may be hunted by those who write for newspapers.  He has declared his advantage over me in that he has been a member of more than one political party.  However, he also has an advantage over me in that he writes a column for a newspaper.</P>

      <P>It is clear that some Members of the House have suffered a focused attack by the free press.  The press is entitled to do this and it is not much defence for someone like me to counteract this by buying space in a newspaper. If there was a concerted effort by a newspaper or group of newspapers to single out a Deputy in the way instanced by Deputy McDowell it would be very difficult for him to buy space in a newspaper column to fight back.</P>
      <P>I believe strongly in the principles set out in the Bill.  I listened carefully to the points made on the earlier Stages and I believe we have achieved the broadest consensus possible.  I gave a commitment at the beginning of the debate that I would be open and listen to the points made.  The Bill goes to the heart of the electoral process and it should be supported by as many Deputies as possible.  I have striven to accept as many amendments, suggestions and good proposals as I can.  I hope to amend the Bill for the better on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on a point put to me by many Deputies.  The Ethics in Public Office Act provides that Members who receive more than £500 are obliged to make a declaration. Some Members have been approached by <Col N="191" /> people who want to make a contribution to their general election campaign.  If a donation of more than £500 is paid before the Bill is enacted is it covered by the Ethics in Public Office Act or is it regarded as an election donation?  Members would appreciate clarification on this point.</P>
      <P>On the general points made by him about capping expenditure on elections, the Minister is ignoring or choosing to ignore some important points about our electoral system, that we have multi-seat constituencies and a written Constitution, which some jurisdictions do not.  The McKenna judgment also comes into play.  The Minister referred to the UK and the US.  In the UK one party spent £45 million on its election campaign, while President Clinton spent $80 million on his Presidential election campaign.  These two examples of state control on expenditure do not have much to recommend them.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 9 to 13.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete the definition of &ldquo;non-party candidate&rdquo;.  The Bill published in 1994 contained a mechanism for funding non-party candidates.  This matter was dealt with in the legislation introduced by the Minister for Finance and enacted by the House.  As there is no reference to a &ldquo;non-party candidate&rdquo; there is no need for a definition of it.</P>

      <P>Will a non-party candidate be put at a disadvantage in that a party candidate can place advertising in the national newspapers relative to that candidate or clarifying a falsehood spoken about him, while the non-party candidate will be stuck with the limit proposed?  In other words, the North Tipperary constituency where there is an independent candidate, Fine Gael will be able to put as much money as it wishes into national newspaper advertisements which mention one candidate while the non-party candidate <Col N="192" /> will be stuck with the limit proposed.  Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The method of capping expenditure is based on individual candidates, not parties.  The proposals in the 1994 Bill in this respect have been changed.  The amount spent nationally by a political party is based on the amount which can be spent by individual candidates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It can spend nationally from that pool as it likes.  However, the overall amount which can be spent by a political party per candidate is identical to that which can be spent by an independent candidate.  Ten candidates standing under the same political banner can spend the same amount as ten independent candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Progressive Democrats Party were to run, say, nine candidates in the Malin Head area it could use all the available funding to place in the newspapers advertisements about a row we are having with a person in County Meath.  Aspirant independent Deputies will find themselves at a disadvantage as they will be stuck with a global figure, while national parties will be able to place in the newspapers advertising which is clearly aimed at them, and collect surpluses from individual candidates in other areas to target certain constituencies.  Independent candidates in marginal constituencies will be able to do nothing when the national parties bring in their wagons of war and use advertising which features Deputies with whom they are in competition. If I were an independent candidate and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, featured strongly in the Labour Party's parliamentary broadcasts, I could not respond to it.  He could be on television several times during the election campaign and I would be stuck with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a national pool but that would be spent on the national campaign. Most national parties regard the national pool as modest when one adds the sums of money available. It will not give someone a great wagon of war to wheel around the country if any sort of national campaign is to be mounted.  The Deputy's fear is based on a false premise.  In terms of defending independent candidates, they will be in a much better position, with a cap on the moneys available to a large party, to bring in their wagons <Col N="193" /> of war rather than the current position whereby independents with limited resources &mdash; and I say this to somebody who has some experience of it &mdash; face large parties with no cap who have an enormous capacity to spend money.  We have seen political parties literally spend hundreds of thousands, if not in excess of a million pounds, on an election campaign.  If the two larger parties in particular, and my own party to a lesser extent, want to concentrate their fire now, without any amendment in the law, they can run an irresistible campaign against any independent who clearly would not have the resources to fund a similar campaign.  The situation will be immeasurably improved by capping the available resources at local and national level.</P>

With the current emphasis on natural justice, we could run foul of natural justice, particularly having regard to the well known maxim that no one should be the judge of his own cause.  If the Bill remains as it is, that is what the Ceann Comhairle will be doing.  I understand the Public Offices Commission feels strongly about this matter.  I ask the Minister to <Col N="194" /> accept this simple and straightforward amendment, the effect of which would be that reports would be made to each House of the Oireachtas, not to the Chairman of the Dáil.

      <P>I have thought about the amendment and the effect of the section as drafted.  The amendment proposes to amend the provision to require the report to be furnished to each House of the Oireachtas.  I assume the reason behind the amendment is the one given, namely, that the Chairman of the Dáil, the Ceann Comhairle, is also chairman of the commission and that it would be unusual, in terms of the reporting arrangement, to have the chairman reporting to himself.  The section does not require the chairman of the commission to furnish the report; it could be done by the commission secretary.  Even if it was felt necessary for the chairman of the commission to furnish the report, it should not cause a problem.  The report is simply being sent from office to office, not to the chairman or the Ceann Comhairle.  It is being sent to the office for it to deal with the issue.  In view of the potentially serious nature of the matters which may be contained in any report furnished, the reporting arrangements envisaged in the section are adequate.  It is not necessary to make the amendment Deputy Dempsey suggests and I ask him not to press it.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting that if a report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas Members of this House, particularly members of the party the report does not affect, will ignore it simply because the Ceann Comhairle has not given it his blessing and commented on it?  The proper procedure should be to lay these reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Much of what is contained in the Bill is to do with public perception.  In the circumstances Deputy McDowell outlined, the public perception may not be favourable if reports are being accepted by the Chairman of the Dáil, the Ceann Comhairle, who might be personally involved in the matters contained in those reports.  There should not be any problem with laying these reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not see how that mechanism should cause any difficulty from the Minister's point of view.  These reports should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas rather than having the Public Offices Commission reporting, in effect, to one of its own members.  I do not see the logic in that.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment because it makes sense and is better from a public perception point of view to have the reports laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

The Deputy's concern, therefore, is addressed in the Bill. Any Deputy not a Deputy in the party of the Deputy who has questions to answer will be in a position to raise the report, but it should be an established reporting arrangement.  I do not make this point glibly.  The notion of the Chair coming under some sort of suspicion or that there might be a row about an appointment &mdash; we can do this in a neutral way since the incumbent will not be involved &mdash; does disrespect to the Chair.

These reports should come directly to the Houses of the Oireachtas and not by way of a committee reporting to the House in the manner outlined by the Minister.  The report of the Public Offices Commission should be laid before the House and not given to the Chairman.

      <P>(3)(a)  Where the Public Offices Commission, following consideration by it of a statement furnished to it pursuant to sections 23, 35, 47 or 55 or regulations made under section 71 or a notification furnished to it under section 22, is of the opinion that there may have been a contravention of the provisions of Part IV, V or VI or regulations made under section 71, the Commission shall furnish to the person who provided the statement or notification details of the possible contravention and the Commission shall inform that person that he or she may furnish comments on the matter to the Commission within 14 days from the date on which the notification issued to that person and that any such comments will be considered by the Commission before considering the matter further.</P>
      <P>(b)  Where the person to whom a notification issues under paragraph (a) furnishes to the Public Offices Commission his or her comments on the matter referred to in the notification within the period referred to in paragraph (a), the Commission shall have regard to the said comments.</P>
      <P>(c)  Where, following consideration of any comments which the person to whom a notification issues under paragraph (a), or where such person fails to make any such comments, the Public Offices Commission continues to be of the opinion that there may have been a contravention of the provisions of Part IV, V or VI or regulations made under section 71, it shall furnish a written report on the matter (together with any relevant document or other thing in its possession) to the Director of Public Prosecutions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>This amendment arises from a commitment I gave on Committee Stage when discussing an amendment tabled by Deputy Dempsey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4(3) provides that where it considers there may have been a contravention of provisions of the Bill, the commission may make a report on the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It was pointed out on Committee Stage that such a report should not be furnished to the DPP without first giving the person to whom it relates an opportunity to comment on the matter and on its content.  I accept this proposal has merit.  A provision such as that suggested would be in keeping with section 4(2) which already provides that where the Public <Col N="197" /> Offices Commission identifies a minor error or an omission in a statement of election expenses furnished to it, the commission is required to give the person making the statement an opportunity to correct the error or make good the omission before the statement is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I put down this amendment to take account of the views forcefully put in the Select Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the principle of the amendment I proposed on Committee Stage.  I will withdraw amendment No. 6.  I was obliged to table it without having sight of the Minister's amendment which meets my concern about this matter.</P>
      <P>I wish to address amendment No. 7 and seek clarification from the Minister.  My concern does not appear to be addressed by the Minister's amendment.  Where the Public Offices Commission believes there may be a case to be answered it will send a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  However, the Director of Public Prosecutions, having studied the case carefully, might decide there is no case to answer.  If the Public Offices Commission has already made a report which simply states that files relating to certain candidates have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, people will draw certain inferences.  The purpose of amendment No. 7 is to prevent that happening.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that if the Public Offices Commission reports that a file has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the public and the media will assume there was something wrong, even if the person's name is cleared by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Amendment No. 7 seeks to ensure that a report from the Public Offices Commission will not mention that files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions until the director reports his intention to prosecute or otherwise, after which a relevant report will be laid before the House.  I am not sure if what I have outlined is covered by the Minister's amendment.  If it is not, I intend to press amendment No. 7.</P>

      <P>I will deal with Deputy Dempsey's point about amendment No. 7.  I have taken further legal advice and have been told section 4(5) is clear.  It requires only reports furnished by the Public Offices Commission under subsection (1) to be laid before the Houses.  Reports to the Director of Public Prosecutions relating to possible contravention of the Bill will be furnished under subsection (3) and they will not be required to be laid before the House.  If a prosecution ensues it will obviously become a public matter. However, the Deputy's fear does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McDowell's point, the <Col N="198" /> procedure is the mechanism whereby the House will regulate its affairs.  It is open to a citizen to petition the High Court on a matter of law and challenge the validity of an election result.  That is not circumscribed by the provisions in the Bill which regulate the conduct of Members of the House.  Regulations drawn up by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are applied to Members of the House but, in the past, Members have had recourse to the High Court to vindicate personal rights notwithstanding the mechanisms in the House.  There are two parallel procedures and I do not see how one can be affected by the other.</P>

      <P>Yes, if the breach of the Bill was deemed to be material to the extent that it would have affected the result, for example, if the expenditure threshold was breached to the degree that it would have a material effect.  We tried to include the same degree of proof that is required in the current Petitions Bill in relation to a referendum.  A minor breach should not be the cause of striking down the result of an election, either in a constituency or in a national election. However, a significant breach that would materially affect the outcome certainly could be subject to such a petition.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 41 and 42, to delete &ldquo;be established by the Minister, by order,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;stand established&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This refers to the section that deals with the establishment of the Constituency Commission on a statutory basis.  There is no mention of an independent Constituency Commission, which my party would favour.  The series of amendments I have tabled are designed to make this an independent commission.</P>
      <P>This amendment endeavours to underline the independence of the Constituency Commission by not having it subject to the whim of a Minister. We discussed this at length on Committee Stage. The Minister may tell us that once he has the final census figures he is obliged to put a Constituency Commission in place.  The Constituency Commission should stand established and should need no order or direction from the Minister to start its work once the final census figures are before it.  Not only should the Constituency Commission be independent, as we would all claim it is at the moment, but it should also be seen to be independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> It is necessary that the public should feel a Constituency Commission is fully independent. Whether the Minister or Members of this House accept it, a body that needs to be cranked up by a Minister after every election or on publication of a report is not regarded by the public as independent. Their perception may be wrong, and is wrong in the case of the Constituency Commission, but perception is important, and we want to put this and other bodies forward as being independent.  The purpose of my amendment is that the Constituency Commission would stand established and start its work as soon as the final report of the Central Statistics Office on the census is published and would not be seen to be beholden to any Minister.  Will the Minister accept this amendment and accede to the principle that this body should not just be independent but should be seen to be independent.  As long as such a commission requires an order of the Minister to start its work, it will not be seen to be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long discussion on Committee Stage about this matter.  I do not see the logic of the argument.  Somebody has to start the procedure.  As to the notion of the publication of the report bringing this automatically into effect, somebody has to notify the Chief Justice so that he can appoint a suitable judge.  Somebody has to start the mechanism.  That the Minister is given responsibility for it is a good thing because it means he has to make sure it is done.  Otherwise the Chief Justice would have to look for the report of the census and then nominate a judge and so on.  Somebody has to take responsibility for that, and that is appropriate to the Minister.</P>
      <P>In terms of independence, we have had good independent commissions.  Section 5(2) states that the Constituency Commission and its members shall be independent in the performance of their functions under this Act; it is a statutory imperative. There is no flexibility in the Minister's obligation to establish the commission once the census figures are to be published &mdash; the section assigns responsibility to an individual for doing the job.  That is as it should be.  I do not want to rehearse the debate we had on Committee Stage, but this is sound, logical and sensible and does not impact on the independence of the commission. By its membership, and by the statutory provision explicit in subsection (2), it is independent and will be seen to be independent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denigrating them.  This Bill is based on the Labour Party's perception of what the public perceive politicians to be.  The Minister cannot pick and choose and, on the one hand, tell me that the public perceive all politicians to be on the make and beholden to people because they get a few pounds from them at election time and, on the other hand, ignore what the public perceive.  Their perception is that once the Minister has to start this process it is not independent of the Minister.  The public also perceive that when the Secretary of the Minister's Department is a member of the commission, it cannot be independent. I am not saying that is the truth, but it is the perception.  As we are into perceptions, let us not pick and choose perceptions to suit individual cases.  The Minister should go the whole hog or else he should not go down that route.</P>

      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 47 and 48 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where an order under this section is proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before Dáil Éireann within one month of the publication of the Census Report referred to in subsection (1) and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by the Dáil.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a long debate on this matter on Committee Stage, but it is worth having another long debate on it.  The purpose of this amendment is to make the process more open by allowing Members of the House discuss the draft under which the Constituency Commission will operate.

      <P>The Deputy should listen to the logic of what I have to say.  The enabling resolution will kick-start the process of establishing an independent commission.  This amendment would require the order, in draft form, to be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is not necessary and runs counter to the thrust of the Deputy's argument on the previous amendment. The independence of the commission is established. Its personnel will be enshrined on a statutory basis and have a statutory function.  Therefore, it is not necessary to place a draft order before the House.  That would only delay the work which, under the previous amendment, the Deputy wanted done immediately and automatically.</P>

While Members might not have a great deal to offer on the composition of the commission, their recommendations might benefit the Constituency Commission before it starts its work.  Will the Minister consider the benefits that would accrue to the commission from a debate in the House on this matter?

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 12, after &ldquo;breaching of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provincial and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a straightforward amendment which proposes that the Constituency Commission should avoid breaching county and provincial boundaries. This has been recommended by previous constituency commissions.  While provincial <Col N="203" /> boundaries are not breached very often, there is nothing to stop it happening.  The provincial, Euro and county boundaries in the Longford-Roscommon constituency have been breached by the Constituency Commission.  If this amendment is accepted the relevant wording in the Bill would read, &ldquo;the breaching of provincial boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable&rdquo;.  On the last occasion we referred to this, the Minister compared it to a jigsaw.  We should send out a clear signal that if possible provincial boundaries should not be breached.  The Longford-Roscommon constituency suffers most in this regard. There is not much difference between the people or the topography in Kilkenny and Tipperary and in most other constituencies.</P>
    <P>However, there is a major gap between east and west &mdash; the division between Leinster and Connacht, west and east of the Shannon, and that should be taken into account.  It was not taken into account by the last commission.  This amendment would not make it imperative that provincial boundaries should not be breached, but it would make the commission aware that Members would prefer if they were not breached.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this at some length on Committee Stage.  As Deputy Dempsey explained, the amendment seeks to include a further term of reference, the avoidance of the breach of provincial boundaries.  The terms of reference proposed in the Bill have been tried and tested by past commissions.  Given the constitutional requirements &mdash; an eminent lawyer is present &mdash; and court rulings, I am advised there is little scope for changing them.  This proposal to revise the terms of reference would affect the situation to date.</P>
      <P>The Constitution sets out the parameters to be taken into account by constituency commissions. The main point in the Constitution is that each Deputy must represent broadly the same number of people.  That is a constitutional requirement that can only be changed by referendum.  The High Court decision in the 1960s was clear.  It states in regard to that constitutional provision that there is nothing in the Constitution about constituencies being based on counties and the same logic applies to regions and provinces. There is no point in adding a further term of reference of which a commission would not be obliged to take account.  In drawing up a constituency the only constitutional imperative is the population base per Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports of commissions to date illustrate that, where possible, commissions are mindful of county boundaries and, as Deputy Dempsey acknowledged, of regional or provincial boundaries. Practical decisions must be made and often the population distribution does not fall so neatly into place that every county and province can have an exact number of Deputies.  By and large the thrust of what the Deputy requires is being <Col N="204" /> done, but it is not practical or prudent to seek to require the commission to do what goes further than the constitutional requirement.</P>

      <P>I do not follow the Minister's suggestion that provinces should be excluded on constitutional grounds.  Provinces have very little legal recognition.  I do not know if they are provided by law.  They may be provided in some British statute, but they do not leap to mind in my case.  I agree with Deputy Dempsey that the Longford-Roscommon constituency was a startling result of the last constituency review. The effect of accepting his amendment would direct a commission to undo that and since it is a startling decision, it might not be a bad idea.  If we were to tinker with the edges of the County Louth constituency the same could happen as happened in the past when areas of Monaghan were included and excluded from it.  I do not believe anybody was outraged by the idea that they were switched from one province to another. The same could apply to Clare-South Galway constituency, which, as a child, I remember used to be a constituency and many areas of Kilkenny were included in the Waterford constituency from time to time.  I do not remember people thinking their birthright was being destroyed because they were moving from one province to another.</P>

I would have thought that the Shannon River was a significant physical feature &mdash; that appears in a later subparagraph (e) &mdash; which should have guided the commission away from that decision.  I would not go to the stake to stop County Louth constituency including a small area of County Monaghan or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more valid to include my amendment than to have included the subparagraph to which Deputy McDowell referred. Regard should be had for geographical considerations, including significant psychical features and the extent of and the density of population.  I question if the commission took account of significant physical features.  Apart from the River Shannon, Carrantuohill is probably the only other significant physical feature in that area.  I will not press the amendment, but it is as valid to have included provincial and county boundaries as to include significant physical features.  If the Minister consults his officials after this debate and considers the reports put forward by previous constituency commissions, he will note that they have referred to this on a number of occasions and recommended that provincial boundaries should be included.  For that reason I do not know <Col N="205" /> why his officials are advising him not to accept my amendment.</P>

A similar provision is to be found in section 6 relating to the replacement of the judge originally nominated due to ill health or other reasonable cause.</P>
      <P>The point was made by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage that it might be necessary to include in these provisions that consultation should take place between the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court where it is proposed to nominate a judge of the High Court to the commission.  Having considered the matters and taken further advice since Deputy McDowell's intervention, I agree these provisions should be amended to refer to consultation between the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court.  These amendments provide for that good advice accordingly.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Secretary of the Department of the Environment.  It relates to the argument, which I will not repeat, about the perception <Col N="206" /> of the Secretary of the Department of the Environment being involved in the constituency commission.  The Minister will recall that on Committee Stage I suggested a number of people other than the secretary who could fill that role. Because of the brevity of Report Stage, I favour allowing the Director General of the Central Statistics Office to replace the Secretary of the Department of the Environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this matter on Committee Stage and have not since been convinced otherwise.  The knowledge in the franchise section of the Department of the Environment should be available to the Commission and the Secretary is the proper person to be on that Commission.  If the logic is that the Secretary will be amenable to political pressure, the same would apply to any office holder: the Director General of the Central Statistics Office holds that office under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Would that person be subject to pressure from the Taoiseach? I do not believe that any such holder of high office is amenable to political pressure and the statute specifically forbids it.  They are required to be independent and always have been.  I do not want to repeat my views on this. The Deputy should not press his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred before to the fundamental difference between the Secretary of a Department and the people we are discussing. That is the difference between civil servants and public servants.  Apart from the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, most of the people on this body, such as the Ombudsman, the judge from the Supreme Court, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad, are clearly seen as absolutely independent of political influence.  I had the honour of working with the Director of the CSO as a Minister of State, and he and the others I mentioned are fundamentally different from the Secretary of any Government Department. That is why the Director General should be included.</P>
      <P>The argument for the inclusion of the Secretary of the Department is that the franchise department of the Department of the Environment is supplying information to the Commission.  That does not hold water.  The Minister is surely not suggesting that the franchise section would mutiny if it did not have its own man in the Constituency Commission.  The Minister will not accept my amendment unless I have convinced him since I began to speak but this would allow total independence to be seen to be there.  The Minister does not accept that argument but it is worth making.  He will talk to people over the next three weeks and if he speaks to people who know about constituency commissions, I will bet him £10 that nine out of ten will say that the Constituency Commission is independent but that they know the Minister has a finger in the pie.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 15, before &ldquo;report&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;draft&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage.  The purpose of these amendments is to change the procedure in relation to the Constituency Commission's reports.  We are probably back to my word for the evening, perception, for the reason that no Government has tried to amend this, even though there was general agreement that it would be good to change some matters in the Constituency Commission's report, Deputy Nealon spoke on this matter during the Committee Stage debate.  Nobody dared to do that because of the public perception and the political correctness of our times.</P>
      <P>My proposal is reasonable.  The current procedure means the Commission usually meets behind closed doors, and the Minister has accepted some amendments to make this process more open.  My proposal is that instead of the current procedure, the Commission would work to produce a draft report, allow interested parties to make observations on it and that the report would give clearly stated reasons for its recommendations. It would also outline to the public and this House the alternative recommendations to those adopted.</P>
      <P>If we adopted this approach it would delay the publication of reports, but the interests of democracy would be better served.  This would make the system more transparent and people would have a say before the final decision was made.  On Committee Stage the Minister said that one is allowing for appeals and scenarios whereby those unaffected originally are affected by a revised position.  However, I do not accept that argument because appeals are allowed in all our systems, from planning to licensing systems, and a decision can be made after these appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should accept the principle behind these amendments, which proposes to allow practitioners to comment on interim or draft reports of the Constituency Commission which can continue to operate independently, having taken such views into account.  When the <Col N="208" /> final report comes before the House it is too late to do anything about it, and no Government in the foreseeable future will alter that final report. However, in the interests of openness, transparency and accountability, as well as the interests of maximum participation in a fundamental decision that affects the electorate, this amendment should be considered.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the electorate I ask the Minister to accept my amendments, in particular No. 15, and follow this route of opening up this procedure to the general public and Members of this House.  When the report of the Constituency Commission has been finalised, we can, as we have done in the past, speak for as long as we like, in this House.  That practice will not change. While that is perhaps a good thing, at draft stage it is only right that practitioners, those who represent the public, should at least have the right to put down markers to the effect that the commission is travelling in the right or wrong direction and raise issues, as was done when the final report was presented to this House in the case of, say, Tipperary South, Mayo or any other constituency. In the interests of democracy, it is important that that be allowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the general thrust of Deputy Dempsey's arguments.  Any body of people, however eminent, learned or fair-minded, through no fault of theirs, can make elementary mistakes.  There is a particular danger of this occurring from time to time since, generally speaking, no member of the commission will have had practical experience in the operations of politics.  Let us admit that a fairly elementary mistake was made recently which would not have occurred had a draft report been made available and people given an opportunity to examine it.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless we have moved a considerable distance from the period when all of this was undertaken by the Minister for Local Government, who burned the midnight oil in the Custom House and undertook the task with the census returns under one arm and the tally sheets under the other. Many a potentially great political career sank as surely as a stone thrown into the nearby River Liffey, as the Minister moved a few ballot boxes across a boundary, travelled some three or four miles into a constituency and moved other ballot boxes to make good the balance.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House have often derided the many promises made in 1977 &mdash; for which we still pay &mdash; including one by former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, that if returned to Government he would establish a Constituency Commission.  True to his word he did and this led to an amazing change and improvement on what had been a very serious blemish on our democratic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey's amendments have merit but could lead to inordinate pressure on the Constituency Commission in areas not eligible for special attention.  The Deputy seeks to ensure <Col N="209" /> that mistakes which occurred in the past are not repeated by recommending discussion on a draft report and its possible amendment.  On the other hand, there is a danger that Members, with their own interests and survival at heart, would attack areas in a vigorous, compelling way, seeking to override many decisions, thus giving rise to many other difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Dempsey's comments on Committee Stage and today.  I listened even more intensely when a person as knowledgeable on these matters as Deputy Nealon intervened.</P>
      <P>We have travelled a long way from the days when a Minister for Local Government, of his own volition, decided where constituency boundaries lay.  Perhaps it was not so difficult for former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, to take that decision in 1977 when he saw the results of the constituency divide of the former Minister for Local Government and its effect on the then Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The notion of allowing a Minister for Local Government to draw up constituency boundaries, with the express intent of affording advantage to a party or Government, has not always proven to be a successful venture.</P>
      <P>Generally we have incorporated a very independent, open mechanism here but it must also be practicable and lead to a conclusion.  Unlike, say, planning permissions, when somebody applies to build a house and those interested will give their views, in the first instance for consideration by the relevant local authority and thereafter through the relevant appeals mechanisms, constituency boundaries are a different kettle of fish since any change will have repercussions for somebody else.  Therefore, in seeking to address any anomaly invariably one causes another, additional difficulty or redirects focus in some way.  There must be a process that brings this to a conclusion.  Whenever one has a draft report, has received comments thereon and produced a set of amendments, people will say they were not affected by the original draft but we will be by the amendments.</P>
      <P>I have travelled a considerable distance to address the issues raised by Deputy Dempsey. After listening to the arguments, I will require the Constituency Commission to publish data on the population of each constituency and its variations from the national average.  My amendment No. 23 will achieve that objective.</P>
      <P>I also indicated I would examine the possibility of requiring the Constituency Commission to make available for public inspection copies of all submissions received.  There was a long discussion on this on Committee Stage and I have made appropriate provision in my amendment No. 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have given the matter considerable thought, I do not think we can travel the road <Col N="210" /> of a draft report being debated here.  As Deputy Nealon rightly said, every Member has an interest in this matter, not always of obtaining perfect proportionality or boundaries but rather that to which most of us would have to admit, our own survival.  Therefore, the openness of procedures and mechanisms we have stipulated represent a very good regime.  No doubt if we have ideas in the future for their improvement they can be debated.  We will have done a very good day's work if we can, for the first time, give statutory effect to this set of proposals.</P>
    <P>Mindful of my amendments, which represent the logic of Deputy Dempsey's arguments on Committee Stage, I ask him not to press his.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>I accept the Minister's general comments on possible difficulties.  I do not believe and, in fairness to the Minister, I do not think he believes that just because some difficulty arises in working out the appropriate mechanisms, they should be abandoned or ignored.  If the system I propose is sufficiently open, affords all interested persons an opportunity to see the submissions made to the Constituency Commission and an opportunity to submit their observations, it is then up to the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; to take the appropriate decision.  There is a need for further discussion on the way we do this, whether in Government or Opposition.  I found the discussion on Committee Stage beneficial as were some of the views expressed, which helped me to modify my ideas. We should discuss this matter further, but I will withdrawn my amendments.  I acknowledge that the Minister has gone some way to making the system more open and I hope we can improve it even further.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> In page 12, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  (a)  As soon as may be after its establishment, a Commission shall prepare &mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a statement setting out the relevant provisions of the Constitution in relation to Dáil constituencies to which the Commission is required to have regard in preparing a report under section 6(1) (a), and</P>
    <P>(ii)  statements based on the population as ascertained by the Census of Population last taken before the establishment of the Commission showing, for constituencies for the time being in force for the Dáil and European elections, in relation to each constituency &mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the number of members or representatives, as the case may be;</P>
    <P>(II)  the population of the constituency;</P>
    <P>(III)  the population per member or representative, as the case may be, of the constituency; and</P>

    <P>(b)  The Commission shall furnish, on request, to any person a copy of the statements referred to in paragraph (a).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These amendments relate to our previous discussion. In considering amendments on Committee Stage, I agreed to consider bringing forward an amendment to require a commission, when established, to make available to the public information on the constitutional constraints to which the commission must have regard.  I also agreed that the commission should make available statistical data relating to the constituencies then in force showing the latest population figures based on the most recent census and the variation from national average of the population from each constituency.  Having considered this, I tabled amendment No. 23 which proposes to give effect to that suggestion so that people can make submissions on the basis of the same data which is current and available to the commission.</P>
    <P>In the debate on Committee Stage, I also indicated I was prepared to consider making available for public inspection submissions received from the commission because there was a fear that a constituency colleague or a political opponent of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for example, would make a submission to the commission which might disadvantage him and of which he would be unaware.  Amendment No. 25 proposes that submissions will be available for public inspection which would greatly assist persons wishing to make submissions as they may wish to make counterproposals to submissions <Col N="212" /> made.  This links our discussions on Report Stage and previously on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 requires the public notice to be published inviting submissions to include a reference to the availability of statements received by the commission &mdash; a point made by Deputy Dempsey.  Notification inviting people to make submissions will state that submissions received will be available for public inspection and will state where.  There is agreement on these amendments.</P>

Amendment 23 states: &ldquo;The Commission shall furnish, on request, to any person a copy of statements referred to in paragraph (a).&rdquo;  I am not sure if this matter is dealt with elsewhere but is it necessary to amend it so that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas will automatically get this information rather than having to request it?</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage an amendment tabled by Deputy Dempsey sought to preclude anyone seeking information from members of staff of commission.  I indicated that I thought the amendment would not achieve what was sought and that I would consider an amendment to protect the commission from the import of the Deputy's intention, that is, to protect the commission from unwarranted influence.  This amendment provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to communicate with the members of staff whose services are made available to the commission for the purposes of influencing them in carrying out their functions.  This issue was not only pursued by Deputy Dempsey, it was strongly argued by Deputy Lenihan, who made a convincing case.

      <P>This amendment proposes to delete Part III of the Bill which provides for making payments from the central fund to political parties.  It indicates the Deputy's total opposition to political funding.  Lest my explanation is unclear, I am opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister indicated his opposition to the amendment, I thought we had achieved a major coup.  We argued this case in great detail in Committee and today's discussion started on the basis of funding for political parties.  I do not wish to delay the House because the Minister will not change his view &mdash; he can rightly say that Fianna Fáil changed its view in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it, except at a time when we perceive the public mood is more in favour of political funding.  When Fianna Fáil and Labour were in Government both parties sought accommodation on this matter and reached a degree of agreement.  Subsequent to that the McKenna judgment necessitated the Minister to substantially alter the proposals before the House and propose a three-pronged strategy.  As a result of that judgment the Minister changed his position, but the principle remains the same.  The change in public mood was displayed to us before Christmas when we discussed the legislation dealing with Oireachtas allowances and privileges.  I was shocked at the level of antipathy to the notion that the taxpayer should fund political activities.  I make no apology &mdash; I did not do so the night that Bill was passed &mdash; for stoutly defending the notion that duly elected Members should have as much back-up facility as possible to do their job.</P>
      <P>However, what we are talking about here is different.  In regard to funding political parties, that money would be spent on day-to-day administration, back-up to parties generally, which to some extent is covered by the leaders' allowance, and the upkeep of and employment of staff in party headquarters, in our case, in Mount Street. Perhaps the Minister does not sense the public mood on this matter, as my party does.  There is deep resentment of the fact that political parties are asking the taxpayer to fund their activities, and in recognition of that we have tabled this amendment to delete the section.</P>
      <P>Whatever arguments can be made about funding political parties &mdash; the Minister said that this money will be ring-fenced and will not be used for party electioneering, I do not know how such a guarantee can be given because political parties are generally geared towards elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but general administration and expenses are slightly different.  Political parties are very much geared towards what happens in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with the benefit of television coverage and so on.  The research and back-up staff employed with the party leaders' allowance are very much focused on what goes on in the House, on legislation, research and so on whereas those in party headquarters are more focused on organising party branches, constituencies and so on.  It is difficult to say that the money which goes towards party headquarters will not be used in the electoral process.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of my views on the reimbursement of election expenses of candidates and I will not bore him by repeating them <i>ad nauseam.</i> We would probably get away with making payments to political parties for administration purposes, but if we agreed to the proposal that emanates from the McKenna judgment, to give people who get one quarter of a quota £5,000 of taxpayers' money provided they have expended that amount, we would be decimated on the doorsteps. I cannot agree to that proposal under any circumstances.  Our profession is a noble one and I am committed to it, but nobody should be paid by the taxpayer to contest an election.  Because of the McKenna judgment, the Minister may be caught in a dilemma in terms of making payments to political parties.  The McKenna judgment stipulates that the election expenses of candidates must be paid for.  I feel so strongly about the proposal to reimburse such expenses that, if it is the price to be paid for payments to political parties, I am not prepared to pay it.  That is as simply, directly and straightforwardly as I can make the argument.  It is a personal one and I have also put forward a party political argument.  That is why I tabled this amendment.  I know the Minister will not accept it but I tabled it on the basis that I wanted my views on the record.  I do not expect the Minister to respond to them or to be swayed by my argument but it is important they are on the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the principal position Deputy Dempsey outlined.  We had discussions on the concept when this Bill was first mooted in <Col N="217" /> 1994.  It was part of a noble package for politics of restoring damage done to it by fears of golden circles prevalent in 1992 and 1993.  The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, was designed as part of a package to have complete disclosure about personal interests.  Most of us were only too anxious to put on record our worth and interests because they were so painfully pathetic.  People's feeling that we were in politics for our own advancement was shown by that disclosure to be hollow. However, we have to go further because the notion still persists that people can buy influence in politics by contributing to political parties.  We know the stories, the belief is still there and the only way to deal with it is by having openness in the funding of politics.</P>
      <P>The mechanism we have devised is consistent with the constitutional view taken by the Supreme Court.  If we are to fund the political mechanism, we must fund political parties as they are the lifeblood of politics.  Under these proposals, every party which receives 2 per cent of the national first preference vote will be entitled to some measure of support to continue as a political party in the democratic debate.  That is a good objective.</P>
      <P>Reimbursing candidates' election expenses is not paying people to stand for election but giving them some measure of reimbursement for the money they spend by doing so.  It should not be such a crushing debt or burden on people to stand.  It is not to some because they are independently wealthy but, for many, it is a huge commitment to stand for election and I make no apology for saying there should be State support.  It is an imperative of the McKenna judgment and the advice I have been given that we deal with candidates individually if we are to fund parties and politics generally.</P>
      <P>The three sets of proposals stand together very well, they are very fair and financially very modest. The amount of Exchequer funds spent on politics is relatively very small.  We starved ourselves of resources for too long.  A well funded Opposition is a good asset to the State.  A strong Government and an informed Parliament helps debate and makes good law.  This Bill has improved because of informed and thoughtful debate with a number of Deputies.</P>
      <P>We will agree to disagree fundamentally on this issue.  Politics should be open and contributions should be declared.  I am not averse to banning all contributions to political parties, which runs counter to Deputy Michael McDowell's view. Good people donate money because they are committed to the cause but I do not like the notion of businesses donating to everyone.  I do not like being beholden to them or writing to them.  Unfortunately, I am required, like everyone else to accept donations to run a political campaign because I have no other way of getting money other than through my friends and family. To run a campaign of any sort costs money and that is true for every party and individual in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> We should not apologise for ourselves.  Neither should we be terrified by public opinion, even if it is strong.  We must convince people of the merit in funding our democracy and I am willing to do that.  We have debated this repeatedly.  I accept Deputy Dempsey's honourable position but disagree with it.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Dempsey, in his general contribution suggested that paragraph (b) could be deleted from the section.  It requires a party to have put forward at least one candidate in the preceding general election as one of the conditions to be fulfilled before qualification for payments under Part III.  Paragraph (c) contains a further condition, that the party must have achieved at least 2 per cent of the first preference vote cast nationally in the election.  I accept that, as paragraph (c) in effect requires a party to have nominated a candidate at the election, paragraph (b), while technically in order, is superfluous, as one would logically have to have fielded a candidate to achieve 2 per cent of the vote.  If it pleases the Deputy and logic, I accept the argument and move the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> In page 13, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;16.  &mdash;The Electoral Act, 1992, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (3) of section 25:</P>
    <P>`(3)  Subject to the provisions of this section, the Registrar shall register every political party which applies in accordance with this section for registration provided that at the time the application is made&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the organisation and direction of the party are governed by a constitution, articles of association, rules or other regulations which have been adopted by the party and which provide for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  annual or other periodic meetings or conferences of the party; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the conduct of the business of the party by an executive committee or similar body elected by the party; and</P>
    <P>(b)  (i) the membership of the party as certified to the Registrar in writing by a person qualified for appointment as auditor of a company in accordance with section 162 of the Companies Act, 1963 comprises not less than 300 persons (or, in the case of a party applying for rigistration as a party organised to contest a local election only, 100 persons) each of whom has reached the age of 18 years, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  at least one person who is a member of the Dáil or an Irish representative in the European Parliament (or, in the case of a party which applies for registration as a party organised to contest a local election only, each of three persons who are members of a local authority) certifies in writing to the Registrar that he or she is a member of the party.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We spent longer on this section on committee Stage than on any other but it is worth reiterating the thrust of these amendments.  Amendment No. 32 outlines a criteria for registration of political parties.  The Minister will recall the registrar of political parties made a submission to the select committee on possible changes to the law in regard to the registration of political parties.  I had tabled a very full amendment to cover all parts of section 25 of the Electoral Act, 1992.  For Report Stage I have taken out a number of key issues in relation to this section.  In the most recent appeal against the disallowance by the registrar of an application for registration, the chairman of the appeals board, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, described the threshold for registration of political parties &mdash; which was set previously in <i>Loftus v. the Attorney General</i> in 1979, quoted on Committee Stage &mdash; as low and drew attention to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the matter of interpretation of the terms &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; and <Col N="220" />&ldquo;organised&rdquo;.  In view of these judgments it is almost impossible for the registrar to apply any real or qualifying standard for the registration of political parties.</P>
    <P>The amendment recommends a new standard be established, that it be based on numerical strength and visible structures of a party.  That is reasonable.  We are talking in terms of the organisation of the party, that it be governed by rules and annual meetings, that the business be conducted by an executive, committee or some other elected body.  I am mindful of the fact that the Green Party does not have the same structures as most other parties in the House but that is catered for in the amendment.</P>
    <P>We are into the era of the Government proposing the funding of political parties.  It is not unreasonable that the criteria for registration should be specific.  The words &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; and &ldquo;organised&rdquo; political party should be more clearly defined than at present.  It is very difficult if the registrar has to make a decision on the basis that it is his opinion that a political party is organised and is genuine.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 34 was proposed by the Minister on Committee Stage.  For some reason, which I cannot recollect, the Minister decided not to move this amendment but to consider the matter further as part of his consideration of the registration of political parties and come back to us on Report Stage.  The amendment seeks to give a wider role to the appeal board which exists under section 25 of the Electoral Act, 1992 but which may, at present, hear only appeals from refused applications or cancellations of registration.  In his careful consideration of the other sections of the Electoral Act, I presume the Minister simply forgot to table his own amendment and that he will accept my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is the Minister's amendment word for word.  Obviously the Minister accepted the argument and the position on Committee Stage that the registrar needed greater powers to require that information be provided to him in the form of a statutory declaration. The amendment will allow the registrar to decide on matters of information on a more definitive basis and might also cut out the need for appeals and the bringing of issues to the appeals board.  I do not propose to dwell unduly on the amendment since I am sure the Minister sees the merit of his original amendment and will accept it.  I have not yet studied the Minister's amendment No. 88 but I am sure he will tell me what it is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We had much discussion on Committee Stage on the whole registration process.  In essence what Deputy Dempsey proposed was a new Bill on the registration of political parties.  I deemed it inappropriate to graft it into this <Col N="221" /> measure.  He made a number of valid points today and on Committee Stage which I said we would consider.  We have extra time to consider them because all the matters about funding of political parties and so on will not come into effect until next year.  In the interim we will have time to deal not only with the issues of the Public Offices Commission but the registration of political parties. We can give more thought to the specifics of registration which are a matter of fundamental importance to all Members.  We will be returning to this matter early in the new Dáil session.  It will not be complicated legislation but rather than simply deciding on the thresholds suggested by Deputy Dempsey, there is a certain obvious arbitrariness for choosing a number of Members or the structure of a party.  I ask the Deputy not to press amendments Nos. 32 and 33.  Irrespective of what side I am on in the new Dáil, it will be imperative to deal with the upgrading of the registration process.  That is something we undertake to do.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dempsey has rightly acknowledged that amendment No. 34 is a recycled amendment of an amendment I tabled on Committee Stage.  I withdrew it on Committee Stage in light of the general discussion on registration.  Apparently there are some difficulties in relation to registration that could be facilitated by the acceptance of this amendment, but not simply for the sake of an amendment in my name, it just does not fit into the section.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment which will appear, in identical form, as amendment No. 88.  That will facilitate its correct location in the Bill and avoid consequential amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government and the Minister for Health to waive their claim of privilege so that an explanation can be given to the McCole family and to the public for the adoption and use of the offensive legal strategy in the particular case of Brigid McCole; calls on the Government and individual members of it, given the admission by Deputy Howlin, to clarify their state of knowledge of the strategy and to divulge in full the circumstances in which that strategy was <Col N="222" /> devised and executed when it was known the Blood Transfusion Service Board had no defence; and calls on the Government to furnish in full to the Dáil and lay before the House all documentation, including documentation from the Chief State Solicitor's Office, giving the state of knowledge of the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Cowen.</P>
    <P>Writing to the Minister for Health on 8 October, the family of the late Brigid McCole asked five questions.  The last of these was the following: &ldquo;In their letter of 20 September 1996, the Blood Transfusion Service Board did two things, they admitted liability and apologised but only in the context of a threat that were she to proceed with a case for aggravated, exemplary damages and not succeed they would pursue her for costs.  What was the justification for this threat?&rdquo;  The family is still waiting for an answer. This motion is designed to get the truth.</P>
    <P>This unhappy saga began on 5 November 1977 when Mrs. McCole received an injection of anti D immunoglobulin.  The appalling manner in which the resulting illness of Brigid McCole, and hundreds of other women and men, mainly women, caused by anti-D and other contaminated blood products was dealt with in the Finlay report.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one point in relation to the Finlay report.  It was commissioned because of the failure to lay the full facts before the preceding Hederman-O'Brien committee.  From the outset and up to the present, the handling of this issue has been characterised by evasion and mendacity.</P>
    <P>The facts which prompted the Hederman-O'Brien and Finlay reports came out only in the course of legal action.  In other words, if Mrs. McCole and others had not had the courage to go to the courts this scandal would have remained buried.  The adversarial legal system which the Minister for Health has latterly been so anxious to spare the victims from has been their only weapon in the face of his obduracy.</P>
    <P>The heart of this matter is who authorised the legal strategy in the McCole case?  We know that it was a concerted strategy.  The empirical evidence is clear.  Mrs. McCole and others were thwarted at every turn.  The fiction of the BTSB acting as an independent legal entity is a legal nicety which, like so many other legal niceties used by this Minister and Government, was, primarily, political fiction rather than legal fact.  If the empirical evidence was not enough, we have the bald assertion by Deputy Howlin that the Government decided on the legal strategy in the McCole case.  Deputy Howlin has never elaborated on his admission.  It flatly contradicts statements by Deputy Noonan.</P>
    <P>What the McCole family has asked for and what we are again demanding is the full truth. Deputy Noonan's failure to release the State Solicitor from client confidentiality and allow him to testify to the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs is only the latest obstruction he has thrown up.  It was the Minister's failure to co-operate <Col N="223" /> with the committee which prompted this motion.</P>
    <P>The tragic, human reality behind the case of Brigid McCole, and hundreds like her, could readily be lost in the Byzantine labyrinth of this affair in the courts and in this House.  The tragedy is of a woman seriously ill for years with she knew not what.  For years thereafter, when she realised the cause of her illness, her treatment by the Minister for Health and the BTSB was cruel and inhuman.  All through those years of illness and litigation was the daily task of survival.</P>
    <P>The character of serious illness in Donegal is often different than in places closer to the main centres of population.  Illness in Donegal is often exacerbated by distance, it certainly was in the case of Brigid McCole.  Her daughter has spoken movingly of the loneliness of the bus journey her mother had to make to Dublin at 5 a.m. on a dark winter morning.  For years that journey was part of Brigid McCole's life.  However, through it all she kept her dignity.  Her family have done her proud in the way they have conducted themselves since her death, their search has always been for the simple truth.</P>
    <P>Political accusation is the stuff of politics. However, it is unwarranted in the McCole case. The accusation by Deputy Noonan at the weekend that the question posed by the McCole family at the Sunday press conference was connected with a political agenda is despicable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question posed by the family is the same one asked last October.  It is a question the Government is prepared to go to almost any lengths to avoid answering.  The Minister's weekend outburst was only the latest in a series of attacks on the integrity of the victims.  In a previous debate in this House, Deputy Lynch said, &ldquo;There are people who have a different agenda to the women involved.  They see the possibility of another beef tribunal.  It is appalling that women who have been treated disgracefully by an arm of the State would now be treated equally disgracefully by a section of society that should <Col N="224" /> know better.&rdquo;  So much for Deputy Lynch's contribution.</P>
    <P>The Deputy continued, &ldquo;As to the peddling of fear.  Last year Positive Action produced a list of items, virtually all of which had been dealt with. However, every time a demand is met by Positive Action another one is made.  I worry that the agenda of those who advise these people does not include the good health and the well being of these women and their families.&rdquo;  The innuendo that the truth is not a sufficient motive and that Brigid McCole and the others involved are somehow puppets on someone's string is shameful propaganda from a shameful Government. Deputy Lynch's remarks remain on the record of the House.  She has never apologised.  Her political superiors who are more practised have done so.  The most recent apology came from the Taoiseach on Sunday.  These apologies relate to a scandal the very same people vociferously denied even existed and are predicated on a refusal to tell the whole truth.  There is once again tonight the deeply disturbing spectacle of the Government, the Minister and his colleagues ducking their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>To know the truth about a loved one who has died is a basic human need.  We are familiar from the media with the anguish of families when loved ones go missing or whose cause of death is unknown.  To grieve fully one must know, without knowing the dead cannot be laid to rest.</P>
      <P>The question the McCole family are asking is one, in the first instance, they are asking for themselves.  On that account alone, it deserves to be answered but it is also being asked on behalf of the families of all those involved.  It is: why is the State setting upon them as adversaries.  The Opposition parties ask the same question for another reason also.  We want to bring the Government to account.  We want to know who directed the resources of the State in this campaign of intimidation.  Strip away the legal niceties and all one is left with is thuggery.  Someone in a position of great power and influence, using the resources of the State democratically entrusted to them, gravely abused that power, in the process deliberately terrorising a dying woman.  The Minister has decided not to co-operate in the search for the truth.  We want to know why.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but that is far from saying the matter should be brushed under the carpet because an election is in the offing.  I am reminded of a remark made by Professor Joe Lee on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night.  While he was not happy that there were people who would leap at an opportunity to grab at what they might regard as a heaven sent vote catcher, he stressed most emphatically that the principle involved &mdash; which is in keeping with the Freedom of Information Bill for which the Government claims much credit &mdash; was worthy of mention at this time, that is, we must abandon for good the idea that Ministers must be constantly protected by civil servants.</P>
      <P>We have heard a great deal in recent times about the need to make employees of the public service accountable for their actions so that they attract the credit or the blame as the case may be. Civil servants are only a small part of the public service.  The same principle must apply to semi-State bodies and all those on the payroll of the State.  What we are looking for is complete openness and honesty as well as fair play and equality before the law.  The rules and regulations to be applied in calculating damages bear all the hallmarks of a draftsman instructed to save every penny possible ignoring the human misery and trauma involved.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, 8 October 1996 the Minister spoke in this House to a motion tabled by the Progressive Democrats.  On the same day the family of the late Brigid McCole sent him a letter in which they posed five questions.  Brigid McCole died 12 days later.  The last of the five questions remains unanswered.</P>
      <P>In January, February and March of this year I raised important questions about this matter in the House.  The Minister will recall that I was the first person to raise the name of Brigid McCole on the floor of the House.  Throughout that period the Government constantly reminded us that the general election was not due to be held until next November.  I could not be accused, therefore, of electioneering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the subjects I addressed was the appalling situation in which the families of a small number of hepatitis C victims found themselves. I referred to a constituent of mine, a 54-year old teacher and joint breadwinner of her family.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment I have tabled because the woman concerned died <Col N="226" /> in January 1996 before her case could be heard by the tribunal.  In the week she died the tribunal met specially and agreed compensation with the families of two others on the point of death.  In the case to which I am referring the family are only entitled to £7,500.  Had she survived a little longer the story would have been different.  This family, and a small number of others, are the forgotten victims of this sorry saga.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister was angry when he made the point that he personally was not responsible for what happened some years ago.  We have never held him totally responsible but the manner in which he has handled this tragedy is a sorry episode in his political life.</P>
    <P>This morning on Radio Ireland the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, said we should be discussing more important issues relevant to the general election rather than getting to the bottom of this affair.  He, too, has not apologised to the House.  In a despicable outburst in the House for which Democratic Left has not apologised Deputy Kathleen Lynch stated:</P>
    <P>I have four extremely healthy children.  That might not be the case were it not for anti-D.  I am, therefore, very grateful for its development. The manner in which the transfusion service operated was disgraceful but I find it difficult to blame it entirely in view of the fact that my children are so healthy.</P>
    <P>No doubt the late Brigid McCole voiced the same sentiments as she said her last goodbyes on her deathbed to her 12 beautiful and extremely healthy children.</P>

      <P>This is the thirtieth time in the past two years that there has been a major debate in the House about the hepatitis C affair.  At the end of each debate the victims hoped that it was the last time they would have to trudge in to Dáil Éireann and that their simple demands for justice and truth would be granted.  They were certainly of this view when the tribunal of inquiry was mooted and believed that, at last, everything would come out into the public domain. However, on the morning the terms of reference of the tribunal were laid before the Dáil, 17 October last, it quickly became clear that the cover-up would continue.  Buried in paragraph 9 were the words &ldquo;in so far as these questions relate to the terms of reference above&rdquo;.  This was a reference to the questions put by the family of the late Brigid McCole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the uninitiated, this appeared like a simple, straightforward focusing of the tribunal. However, the words were much more sinister and, as events have unfolded, prove that the Government planned the tribunal in such a way as not to fully expose the deep-rooted cover-up perpetrated against the citizens of the State.  It is abundantly clear that the establishment of the tribunal in a limited way was part of the cover-up, not the end of it.  It is necessary to outline some of the background to illustrate the point. <Col N="227" /> Following their mother's death, the McCole family wrote to the Minister for Health on 8 October last.  They put five questions to him which they believed deserved to be answered.  Question No. 5 asked the justification for the BTSB threatening their mother while she lay on her deathbed with an action for costs if she pursued a case for aggravated or exemplary damages.  By inserting the words &ldquo;in so far as these questions relate to the terms of reference above&rdquo; the Minister for Health and the Government effectively excised question No. 5.  The &ldquo;terms of reference above&rdquo; related to the BTSB and the infection of anti-D with hepatitis C but did not allow for any investigation into the political handling of the affair or the legal strategy involved.</P>
    <P>On the day the terms of reference were debated in the Dáil Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, objected to the inclusion of this limit on the terms of reference.  We believed all the questions asked by the family of the late Mrs. McCole deserved to be answered and there could be no picking and choosing of them.  Our fear, which has since proven to be correct, was that, with the Government wording, the Minister for Health and the Cabinet were attempting to limit the scope of the inquiry.  We tabled an amendment to delete those limiting words but this was resisted by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, despite support for the amendment by some Government backbenchers. Deputy Shatter spotted what was at play and warned that he would vote in favour of our amendment.  He did not vote with us but this may have been because of the confusion about which amendment was being decided first.  During the debate that morning the Minister for Health said he could not accept our amendment on McCole question No. 5 because what we were seeking to do would infringe the separation of powers between the Oireachtas and the courts.  He tried to imply that what we were seeking to do was to investigate how a case was run by the courts.  This is not the only time the Government has put forward this political concoction in relation to the hepatitis C controversy.  The Minister has done this on the Order of Business on a number of mornings and has attempted on several occasions to mix up the issues.</P>
    <P>What we have sought to do since the McCole family wrote its letter on 8 October is establish why the Government and State agencies acted in the way they did when Mrs. McCole initiated her legal action.  It was despicable for the Minister for Health to claim yesterday that we are somehow jumping on the bandwagon in terms of this issue because a general election is in the offing.  As he well knows, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has been pushing this issue since 8 October when the McCole family wrote its letter.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's amendment was debated on 17 October this matter has been raised at least ten times by way of debate, while questions have also been put to the Minister during <Col N="228" /> Question Time.  I deeply resent the attempts by the Government to smear others.  It smacks of desperation and panic and signals that the Cabinet has not learned anything from this terrible episode and is hell-bent on continuing the cover-up.</P>
    <P>Having completely failed to protect the public interest and the rights of citizens in this affair, the Minister for Health is trying to turn the gun on all those seeking accountability.  The reality of the hepatitis C affair is that the legal strategy in the McCole case was not decided by the courts but was a political decision.  We firmly believe it is a matter of public policy that there should be accountability for that decision.  That is why we have tabled this motion.  Our firm legal advice in the matter, which has been taken from three eminent counsel, is that there is no barrier preventing the disclosure of who authorised the legal strategy in the McCole case.  Claims to the contrary are an attempt by the Attorney General, and others, to muddy the waters in relation to the state of knowledge of members of the Government throughout the hardball negotiation on Mrs. McCole's case.</P>
    <P>We have also taken legal advice on the position of the Chief State Solicitor and our request for him to disclose the background to the offensive McCole legal strategy.  In the letter of 7 May from the Chief State Solicitor to the Clerk of the Select Committee on Social Affairs the writer declines on his own behalf and on behalf of the Attorney General to assist the committee in the discussion on how the State case was conducted.  A number of reasons were given in the letter, including that there were comparable cases still pending before the courts and the question of legal professional privilege.  The point about the existence of comparable cases is best dealt with by distinguishing the McCole case from the others on the basis of the State's conduct of that case which surely the Government must accept is unique.  To put it another way, there will be no interference with the running of other cases by the discussion of the behaviour of the State in the McCole case unless the State intends to take the same reprehensible attitude to other cases, including the McCole case.</P>
    <P>I plan to examine the reliance by the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General on the principle of legal professional privilege.  Privilege is said to exist when one is not obliged to answer particular questions or to produce particular documents.  It is distinct from non-competence or non-compellability of witnesses which relates to the incapacity of a witness or his right to refuse to testify.  Legal professional privilege arises in respect of communications between a lawyer and his client made in confidence for the purpose of pending litigation or for the purpose of obtaining professional advice.  It extends to communications between the lawyer or the client and a third party for the purposes of that litigation.</P>
    <P>It is fundamental that the privilege is the client's privilege and cannot be waived by the <Col N="229" /> lawyer.  Correspondingly, if it is waived by the client, the lawyer cannot claim it on his own behalf.  In the context of this case, it appears from the Chief State Solicitor's letter that while legal professional privilege is specifically mentioned there is no indication that the client is claiming it. The writer is seeking the best of both worlds by, on the one hand, citing the principle as &ldquo;a fundamental norm&rdquo; and, on the other, not specifically claiming it on behalf of the client.  There is no legal reason based on this principle which precludes the Minister, as the Chief State Solicitor's client, from waiving the privilege which appears to be claimed by the Chief State Solicitor on his behalf.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister, Deputy Noonan, knows he is on thin ice on the privilege issue, it has now been suggested by him that the Chief State Solicitor as law officer is not amenable in respect of policy matters and is only amenable in respect of administrative matters.  I do not know where this legal theory is emanating from but it is bizarre. The Minister for Health is trying to suggest that the reason the Chief State Solicitor cannot be freed so that he can come before the Select Committee on Social Affairs is that he decided policy in the McCole case.  This is a reckless and serious suggestion by the Minister for Health.  If he is suggesting that the decision as to policy came from the legal advisers then he should admit that he has completely abdicated his responsibility.</P>
    <P>Privilege would allow the Chief State Solicitor, as a witness, to refuse to disclose communications made to him by the Minister or the Government as his client without the client's consent.  This is the first aspect of legal professional privilege. Privilege would also allow the Minister or the Government as the Chief State Solicitor's client to refuse to disclose communications to the Minister from the Chief State Solicitor.  This is the second aspect of legal professional privilege; both aspects are outlined by Fennell in the &ldquo;Law of Evidence in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At common law, legal professional privilege in both its aspects is that of the client.  This is backed up by available case law.  Another point in relation to privilege is that if it is claimed in respect of a communication or document it remains privileged for the benefit of that client and his successors in title.  This means that in the unlikely event of the rainbow Government being returned to office the Minister for Health or his successor could continue the cover-up, should they continue to refuse to waive the privilege.</P>
    <P>The significance of the Chief State Solicitor relates to his role in cases involving the hepatitis C victims, including Mrs. McCole.  On 11 December 1995 the Chief State Solicitor wrote to victims warning them:</P>
    <P>If, despite the Scheme of Compensation, your client is advised to ignore the Tribunal and to pursue litigation and your client chooses to accept such advice, the resulting litigation will be fully defended by the State, if necessary, to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> This related to the fact that even in making an offer to Mrs. McCole on her deathbed the State and its agencies stated categorically that they would not pay aggravated damages if she pursued her claim in the courts.  Furthermore, she was told by the State and its agencies that if she did so it would be resisted and they would pursue costs against her and, if necessary, appeal it to the Supreme Court.  In ordinary language, this amounted to legal blackmail.</P>
    <P>The Minister has sought in his amendment to separate himself from the conduct of the State agency which is directly under his aegis and responsibility by referring to separate legal teams. Yet, the bogus defence regarding the statue of limitations was jointly pleaded by the defendants even though the State knew that the BTSB had concealed what had happened to Mrs. McCole at that stage.</P>
    <P>In a further delaying tactic the State objected to the defendant pursuing her case under an assumed name.  I want to state categorically that it is impossible to believe that the BTSB strategy was not co-ordinated with the State.  How could the BTSB offer to pay the large sums concerned in an attempt to settle the case without State consent?</P>
    <P>The assertion by Minister that &ldquo;the main thrust of the case was between the legal teams&rdquo; is astonishing, if it is true.  Given that the lawyers were representing the State and its agencies and would have been aware of the very significant political implications regarding the way these cases were to be handled, no lawyer on any of those legal teams proceeded with the statute of limitations defence without asking their clients for instructions whether to proceed with such a defence.  A letter of the type forwarded to the late Mrs. Brigid McCole which sought to threaten her into submission could only have been taken on the instructions of the client.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his Government colleagues asking the people of Ireland to accept they were doing their job properly by trying to suggest they were in blissful ignorance of the way the case was being handled? Not only is there a provision in the statutory instrument establishing the BTSB for the Minister for Health to take over any legal action the board is pursuing but the Minister has <i>de facto</i> been running the blood bank.  A newspaper article about some crisis at the BTSB has only to appear and the Minister for Health has the chief executive in his office.  Yet he expects us to believe that he has done his duty when, in relation to the biggest crisis to envelop his Department during his tenure, he has no idea or interest in what way the State and its agencies are treating the victims of hepatitis C whom they have single-handedly, knowingly and recklessly infected with a life threatening disease.  Such legal fictions will not wash.  Political responsibility can not be abdicated away with fanciful legalisms which portray the political master of the Department of Health treating a State agency's defence <Col N="231" /> of this tragic case as if it were somebody else's business.  Even the Minister would have to concede that that falls far short of the most minimalist definition of political accountability.</P>
    <P>The absolutely amazing aspect of all this &mdash; and the public should know this &mdash; is that these sorts of tactics are continuing against another woman who has decided to seek to vindicate her rights through the courts rather than a tribunal.  Mary Quinlan issued proceedings on 22 June 1995 contemporaneously with Brigid McCole.  These proceedings were superseded by an application for an injunction against the BTSB so that Mary Quinlan could obtain medical test results in the possession of the BTSB to enable her attend a UK consultant hepatologist.  Over 40 applications later, the BTSB furnished an admission of liability with its defence.  Mary Quinlan has been continuously required to fight each and every step to obtain justice.  This case has yet to go before the courts and, as of tonight, the Minister is denying the content of the Finlay tribunal report in these court proceedings and is acting in a contradictory and inconsistent manner while willing to accept the content of the Finlay tribunal report in cases before the compensation tribunal.</P>
    <P>In the past, both Mary Quinlan and Brigid McCole could have obtained the payment of ordinary damages before the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal.  However, they decided to continue to fight in the High Court for the payment of those damages and many other victims have benefited from their stance.  After Brigid McCole died, Mary Quinlan continued to pursue aggravated damages in the High Court.</P>
    <P>In the Bill to be debated later this evening, the Government is offering aggravated damages of 20 per cent of general damages if cases are taken before the compensation tribunal.  The Minister continues to refuse to admit liability for aggravated damages in the case of Mary Quinlan simply because she wants the High Court to adjudicate on the level of damages, both general and aggravated, in her case.  With the intention of preventing her obtaining more than 20 per cent aggravated damages, it is likely the State will appeal her case right up to the Supreme Court, if she wins.  Does this stance remind the House of anything?  It echoes the tragic case of Brigid McCole.  Persecution of this silent victim who has not fought her battles in the media or on the floor of this House is destined to continue as she exercises her constitutional right to have her day in court.  Presumably, the Minister's answer in relation to the conduct of this case will be the same lame duck excuse he has been parroting for months &mdash;&ldquo;it is nothing to do with me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday, the daughter of Brigid McCole, Bríd, gave the following statement: &ldquo;Today I am speaking to the press on behalf of my family to ask the Minister for Health to give us answers as to why our late mother, Mrs. Brigid Ellen McCole, was threatened because she pursued her <Col N="232" /> compensation claim through the courts.&rdquo;  She continued:</P>
    <P>I have come from my home in County Donegal today to ask the Minister and the Government to give us the answer to that question. Many other issues have been resolved in recent weeks but our fifth question has not been answered.</P>
    <P>She went on to say that she feels it is important that the Minister for Health now gives the answers to the question he has been asked.  She stated: &ldquo;He, and members of his Government, have the power to do that and let the McCole family continue to come to terms with our sad loss, knowing the full truth as to why our mother suffered so much.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There would have been no tribunal of inquiry or promise of a statutory compensation scheme but for the courage of Brigid McCole.  For this reason there is an obligation to secure the truth in the McCole case.  Her family want question No. 5 answered and it is in the public interest that this should happen.  The difficulty for the McCole family is that they see all the other issues being resolved because of the bravery of their mother, but the single most important question to her has still not been answered.  There is a moral and public accountability imperative that the question be answered.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the Government's blanket response has been to pull down the shutters on the controversy. That position is not tenable and the political strategy of the Minister for Health and the rest of the Government has been blown apart.</P>
    <P>What is happening here is in contrast to the promises at the time the rainbow coalition Government came to office, and the period just prior to that.  For example, on 6 December 1994, the then Deputy John Bruton told the Dáil:</P>
    <P>My concern today is to ensure that the facts are fully known to establish political responsibility for what happened.  There are questions to be answered.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that it would be helpful if full and frank answers were given to a committee of the House.</P>
    <P>On 26 March last in this House, the Taoiseach promised that whatever questions were tabled on the legal strategy in the McCole case would be answered in full.  I tabled a series of 20 questions to the Taoiseach, none of which was answered by him.  Two were transferred to the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach said he had no responsibility for the rest.</P>
    <P>Despite the Taoiseach's limited and belated apology last Sunday, when we heard for the first time that the leader of this country had something to say about the biggest health scandal in its history, the State has still not admitted liability for this affair.  Will the Minister explain tonight why this has not happened?  The victims of this controversy should be spared further difficulty and the State should now accept responsibility for the <Col N="233" /> injury caused to them and their families.  The Minister has vacillated and manufactured fallacies in relation to the difference between the liability of the State and that of the BTSB.</P>
    <P>All the evidence suggests this Government continues to be more concerned with being saved from further embarrassment and is more sensitive to the protection of its image than addressing the substance of the just cause of the victims.  If nothing else, it would serve the purpose of perhaps exorcising the guilt of the members of this Government who so ineptly and insensitively sought to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government has been equally unforthcoming about its own involvement in the affair.  It has been uncovered that, in parallel with a grossly inadequate and totally incompetent public response to the crisis, the Government has been involved in covert and ruthless campaigns to frustrate the victims, and in particular those who refused to accept the compensation tribunal and all its conditions.</P>
    <P>The revelation disclosed by Minister Brendan Howlin on the &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme renders the position of this Government in relation to the hepatitis C scandal totally untenable.  In the interview, Minister Howlin disclosed that in relation to the despicable conduct of the State in the handling of the Brigid McCole case &ldquo;the legal strategy was decided by Government and that's a question that needs to be answered&rdquo;.  I am not asking that question, a Minister of this Government is asking it.  Minister Howlin went on to say, when asked if he took the decision, that &ldquo;the Government made the decision as to how all these things happen&rdquo;.  He further admitted: &ldquo;I now see that that didn't necessarily suit certainly the McCole family and they were right to go the course that they went&rdquo;.  Those are the words of a Minister of this Government, not mine, and the Minister for Health is not claiming that Minister Howlin is trying to make political capital out of this issue.  That explains why the fifth question in the McCole letter was excluded from the terms of reference of the hepatitis C tribunal.  This is the first public admission by a Minister that this Government was collectively responsible for the strategy adopted in the McCole case.  That admission is a damning indictment of this Government, from the Taoiseach and Tánaiste down.</P>
    <P>Minister Noonan has always tried to maintain the fiction that the Government was not involved in the legal strategy so insensitively pursued against a defenceless woman.  Indeed, in its response to this motion, the Government is still seeking to shift the responsibility for this debacle on to the shoulders of others.  Minister Howlin's statement blows this out of the water.</P>
    <P>Recent revelations, and in particular those articulated by Minister Howlin, give every indication that this is a scandal with the most profound implications and one that will be seen in time to have been the most rotten in the history of the State.  The evidence shows that rather than facilitate hepatitis C victims exercise their full rights <Col N="234" /> in terms of a fair hearing, the Government was supporting every legal stratagem to frustrate the affected women in their quest for justice.</P>
    <P>Since the single most important duty of any public representative is to protect at all costs the rights of each citizen, it is beyond belief that the Government embarked on a vindictive course against an innocent group of women who had been grievously damaged by a State agency.</P>
    <P>In order to minimise further damage to our democratic institutions as a result of the hepatitis C scandal, it is now imperative that the full facts surrounding the State's role in defending the case against the late Mrs. McCole are fully and publicly established.  Specifically, the following details must be ascertained.  The exact chronology of events between the State and Mrs. McCole's legal representatives must be explicitly and comprehensively established; all documents, formal, and informal, relating to the matter must be identified and made available; all relevant meetings, formal and informal, involving State representatives must be identified; and all decisions made, and actions taken, by the State must be made known, and the party or parties to such decisions and actions must be explicitly identified.</P>
    <P>The most effective way forward in this dire matter would be if the Government collated all this information and placed it before the Dáil as a matter of the gravest urgency.  The Government has refused point-blank to do this, fuelling the view that the cover-up continues.  The establishment of the Finlay tribunal on such narrow terms, avoiding any question about the McCole legal strategy, was a deliberate part of the cover-up by this Government.</P>
    <P>The Government hopes the Finlay report will be the last word on the matter, but that report is only half the story.  The other half will require an investigation.  I will be proposing that the Chairman of the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs, Deputy Pattison, should begin the investigation into the matter to ensure political accountability is established.  If this is voted down by Government parties, Fianna Fáil in Government will ensure the matter is investigated fully and properly.  Nothing less is acceptable if respect and trust is to be fully re-established at the core of our democratic system.</P>
    <P>What is forgotten in this saga is the human suffering and misery caused by the scandal.  Men, women and children have had their lives destroyed by the indifference and incompetent actions of a handful of experts at the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  More than 1,000 mothers contracted hepatitis C from contaminated blood products.  The mothers contracted a serious and potentially life-threatening virus for which there is no effective cure.  Half of those women have the full virus, while more than a dozen children of the mothers and some partners have also been infected.  According to the Virus Reference Laboratory at UCD, up to 75 per cent of those infected with hepatitis C develop chronic <Col N="235" /> hepatitis.  Hepatitis C is a most uncertain disease and there is no known treatment available.</P>
    <P>Life assurance is currently impossible to obtain, mortgages are restricted and leave from work is unpaid.  The treatment of victims is by injection into the abdomen which is painful and has caused serious side effects.  It goes without saying that the immediate and longer term needs of the victims of the scandal must be urgently addressed and satisfied.  This involves responding comprehensively at three levels: explicitly accepting responsibility; putting in place the most effective possible levels of medical and counselling support for those affected; and providing a level of compensation commensurate with the appalling damage inflicted on recipients of hepatitis C infected blood and blood products.  The last of these might be resolved tonight.  However, if the State had treated the victims fairly and honestly from the start there might not now be a need for the payment of aggravated damages.</P>
    <P>The admission of liability is restricted to just 28 cases out of about 1,800 as far as the State is concerned.  Why admit liability in just those cases?  It is more legal manoeuvring by the Government rather than an up-front admission of guilt.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The death of Mrs. Brigid McCole was a major tragedy.  Again, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I extend my sincere condolences to the family on the death of Mrs. McCole. It is recognised by all Deputies that the hepatitis C disaster is a source of deep distress to those <Col N="236" /> persons who have been diagnosed positive for the illness, and for their families.  It is fully recognised that it has seriously affected their lives, their livelihoods, their health and their future.  I have met many of the victims of this public health disaster and have been humbled by their forbearance and courage.</P>
    <P>I have been subject to criticism which has centred on the State's defence of the High Court case taken on behalf of the late Mrs. McCole.  The State did not admit liability in Mrs. McCole's case.  My strong legal advice, both orally and in writing from independent senior counsel, was that the State, as distinct from the BTSB, is not liable and that an admission of liability should not be made.  The State's agents are obliged to follow the law in using public funds; this is a country governed by laws.  If I had acceded to the demand that I admit liability on behalf of the State in that case and similar cases, I would be accepting liability contrary to legal advice on behalf of all Ministers for Health over the years and in relation to pending court cases back to 1970 in respect of the hepatitis C infection of the anti-D product.  If I were to admit liability I would be acting against all legal advice in a way which would be contrary to overall public policy for which I, as Minister for Health, have functional responsibility.</P>
    <P>As I stated on numerous occasions, there were three distinct defendants in the McCole case &mdash; the BTSB, the NDAB and the State &mdash; and all three defendants had separate legal teams and conducted their defence cases separately.  At the heart of the criticisms levelled at me is a refusal by the Opposition to recognise the statutory legal independence of the BTSB.  I wish to emphasise that at no time were instructions given by the BTSB or the NDAB, now the Irish Medicines Board, to the State's legal team nor did the BTSB or the NDAB receive any such instructions from the State's legal advisers.</P>
    <P>The State, through the Chief State Solicitor's office, conducted the defence case on behalf of the State parties, namely, the Minister for Health, the Attorney General and Ireland, and did not issue any policy directive or exercise any control or management of the defence cases which were being separately defended by the BTSB and the NDAB.  It is also clear that the State and the BTSB had different cases to answer.  This is quite clear to anybody who has read the report of the tribunal of inquiry by Mr. Justice Finlay into the BTSB.</P>
    <P>There have been many allegations about specific aspects of the way the State conducted its defence.  I propose to address these allegations during this debate.  It has been alleged that I had known for some time that the BTSB intended to admit liability in the McCole case and did not inform this House.  I wish once again to inform the House that the BTSB notified officials of my Department on the 16 September 1996 of its intention to admit liability and on 17 September 1996 I was told by my officials of the BTSB's intention.  The admission of liability was conveyed <Col N="237" /> by letter of 20 September 1996 by the solicitors for the BTSB to the solicitors for the plaintiff. This letter, contrary to what is alleged, was not issued by the Chief State Solicitor's office.  It was issued by the solicitors for the BTSB.</P>
    <P>On 24 September 1996 I informed the Government of the BTSB's admission of liability.  The Government noted the position.  We neither made any decision nor gave any direction on any strategy or action.</P>
    <P>The BTSB informed me at that time that it undertook with counsel an extensive review of the facts of the case which went back over 25 years.  The various allegations made in the proceedings were put by the BTSB to such witnesses as were available to give evidence and a range of experts at home and abroad were also consulted. On consideration of this extensive review and following legal advice, the BTSB admitted liability in the late Mrs. McCole's case in relation to her claim for compensatory damages for negligence. I did not attempt to direct the BTSB in any decisions it took in relation to the proceedings. The BTSB is a separate legal entity and it would not have been appropriate for me to issue directives to the BTSB on the conduct of the proceedings. It would also have been improper for one defendant to compel another defendant in the case to take a particular course of action in the conduct of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>There followed on the admission of liability by the BTSB much speculation about the ultimate settlement in the case and it was alleged that the State's &ldquo;fingerprints&rdquo; were all over the settlement agreed in the late Mrs. McCole's case.  In relation to the settlement in the case in question, I was not consulted by the BTSB in this regard.  Mrs McCole's case was settled between her lawyers and the BTSB by agreement.  I appreciate that the settlement was arrived at in particularly tragic circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the motion tabled by Fianna Fáil it is suggested the State adopted an offensive legal strategy in the McCole case.  It has in the past been alleged by the Opposition that the State delayed and obstructed the plaintiff from beginning to end.  I deny this because it is simply not true.</P>
    <P>It was alleged, for example, that the State delayed in entering its defence.  This is not true. The State delivered its defence when the plaintiff's claim was adequately particularised.  This issue was the subject of an application to the court and was resolved by the court in favour of the State.  It was alleged the State delayed the discovery of documents while, in fact, the dates for completion of discovery were set by the High Court and adhered to by the State.  The State sought and was granted, without objection by Mrs. McCole's counsel, two working days extension of time for filing its affidavit of discovery. Between 4,000 and 5,000 documents were discovered and made immediately available by the State, of which a small number became the subject of dispute which was resolved without ultimate recourse to the court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> On a previous occasion in this House, I reflected on the manner in which issues in relation to legal cases are prepared for the adversarial court system with which we are familiar.  I stated that pleadings are the means by which the issues to be tried by the court are both netted down and clarified, so that not only the parties but also the court, which otherwise knows nothing about the matters in controversy, can become familiar with the matters which require to be adjudicated upon and the evidence which will be required to establish or refute these matters. What may appear to be convoluted or tortuous descriptions of highly charged allegations are sometimes recited and must be denied in detail. Otherwise they are deemed to be admitted.</P>
    <P>I have previously informed the House that in Mrs. McCole's case a large variety of allegations of wrongdoing on the part not only of the BTSB but also the State parties and the NDAB were made.  The State rightly called for matters to be properly established by Mrs. McCole's lawyers.  It was open to Mrs. McCole's legal team to either provide documentary evidence of the matters as the case proceeded or prove them by evidence in court.  Exchanges of correspondence and documents between parties, with other pre-trial proceedings such as discovery and interrogatories which occurred in the McCole case, even further netted down the matters at issue.</P>
    <P>There was also much criticism of the State's position in relation to the statute of limitations. It was repeated tonight by Deputy McDaid.  In respect of the statute of limitations, one should look at the defence delivered by the State parties to understand what precisely was pleaded.  It was:</P>
    <P>In so far as the date of acquisition of the plaintiff's condition alleged in the Statement of Claim was in or before 1980 and not the date of knowledge as defined in the Statutes of Limitation is pleaded, such claim herein, if any, is barred by the provisions of the said Statute.</P>
    <P>A plaintiff is required to give reasonably specific details of the occasions on which important events are said to have occurred and this detail was omitted from Mrs. McCole's Statement of Claim.  In pleading this, and in the notice of particulars, the State required her lawyers to specify the occasion on which she contracted hepatitis C or the occasion on which she became aware of having contracted such a serious condition.  It was not unreasonable for the State to require this detail which is after all basic information necessary for a full evaluation of the case.</P>
    <P>Criticism was also made of the decision by the State to contest anonymity in the McCole case.  I would like to give the background to this decision.  A number of plaintiffs represented by the same firm of solicitors, issued writs against the BTSB, the NDAB and the State using aliases and giving their solicitors' offices as their addresses.  On 7 September 1995, the solicitors notified the defendants of the true identities and addresses of the plaintiffs.  However, in Mrs. <Col N="239" /> McCole's case, they did not notify the State of her identify until 27 September 1995.</P>
    <P>On 22 September 1995, Mrs. McCole's counsel was told that, while the confidentiality of her medical condition and other intimate matters would be maintained by the State parties, as a matter of constitutional law the client could not proceed under an assumed identity.  This was confirmed in subsequent correspondence.  Mrs. McCole's counsel and solicitors took a different view and ultimately they brought a motion before the High Court seeking a ruling on the point. Their application in this regard was decided on 14 February 1996 by Miss Justice Laffoy, who dismissed it.  The court in its judgment stated it had no jurisdiction to allow the plaintiff to prosecute her proceedings using a fictitious name and to do so would contravene Article 34.1 of the Constitution which required justice to be administered in public.  This judgment is available to anybody who may wish to read it.</P>
    <P>It is not an option for the State, or any other litigant, to selectively ignore, or turn a blind eye to Article 34.1 of the Constitution.  This provision has hard outcomes in some cases, but it is a very basic protection of civil rights.  The State is obliged to uphold, not to ignore, the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There has been an allegation that the State opposed an early hearing in the late Mrs. McCole's case.  I would again like to inform the House that Mrs. McCole's initial application for an early hearing was withdrawn by her lawyers and when it was ultimately re-entered on 26 April 1996 it emerged that the case would not be ready for trial in June as her lawyers had requested.  The President of the High Court adjudged it should proceed on 8 October 1996 and the President of the High Court said that in exceptional circumstances the court will give priority to cases and fix an early trial date but that this power must be exercised sparingly as it affects other litigants. The judge also stated that the defendants had met the plaintiffs claim fairly and stated that they would be in a position to go on in October.  The judge added that the rights of both parties have to be weighed and also considered it relevant that should Mrs. McCole's condition deteriorate, the compensation tribunal was available to her.  In fact, the tribunal indicated its willingness to sit at short notice to facilitate the claim if that was the desired option.  The fact that the case was put down for hearing for October enabled Mrs. McCole's lawyers to amend her statement of claim substantially on two subsequent occasions and to make a considerable number of interlocutory/pre-trial applications to the court for reliefs considered necessary in the late Mrs. McCole's case, even into the summer vacation.</P>
    <P>While the State indicated that the case would not be ready for trial in June, it is clear that the case on behalf of Mrs. McCole was not ready either.  In fact, a new issue in the case, which was also an issue specifically for the Tribunal of <Col N="240" /> Inquiry into the BTSB, that is, the issue in relation to the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932, was introduced for the first time by the plaintiff's solicitors by way of an amendment to the statement of claim on 23 July 1996.  As a matter of interest, it should be noted that the tribunal of inquiry found that anti-D was not a therapeutic substance under the 1932 Act and that the grant of a manufacturer's licence under that Act would not have been appropriate because it would have been of no legal effect.</P>
    <P>The judge adjudicated that 8 October was the appropriate date for the early hearing on the basis that neither side was ready.</P>
    <P>Rather than there being any delay or obstruction, as has been suggested, this complex trial which was estimated to require six weeks had it proceeded in October 1996 was processed with considerable expedition.  It commenced by plenary summons in 1995, involved four parties, dealt with numerous motions and other applications to the court, was the subject of an extraordinary volume of discovered documents, including the invoking of sworn interrogatory procedures and yet was ready for trial within 15 or 16 months.  All this could not have been done in the normal course without extensive co-operation between all those parties and the good offices of the courts and court staff.</P>
    <P>The BTSB has also been criticised for paying a lodgement into court in the legal case in question. On the advice of their lawyers, the BTSB made a lodgement into court in accordance with Order 22 Rule 1(1) of the Rules of the Superior Courts on 15 May 1996.  The lodgement was not accepted.  I would like to reiterate that this lodgement by the BTSB in this case was made in accordance with the Rules of the Superior Courts and is a procedure open to all defendants involved in litigation.  This lodgement was made by the BTSB on its own behalf.  I was not aware that the lodgement was being paid into court by the BTSB prior to it being made.  I was informed by the BTSB subsequent to the lodgement being paid into court.  It is open to all defendants to take this particular action.  Once again, I would like to reiterate that the BTSB conducted its case separately and the State did not issue any policy directive nor exercise any control or management of the BTSB's defence case.</P>
    <P>At this point, I wish to summarise the points I have just made because, surprisingly, misunderstandings are still current about the McCole case.</P>
    <P>1.  In the McCole case, it was the BTSB which admitted liability and which settled the case with the representatives of the McCole family.  In law, the BTSB is a separate legal entity, had its own legal advice and its own insurers.</P>
    <P>2.  The State was at all times advised by independent senior counsel who advised that there was no State liability and this remains the State's position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> 3.  Cases in court are conducted according to the legal rules which govern a civil liability.  The cases are presented in accordance with the adversarial rules in use in cases of that kind.</P>
    <P>4.  It is for this reason that an alternative channel was and is available which removes the adversarial element and ensures privacy, namely the hepatitis C compensation tribunal. Every claimant is entitled to use it and or is perfectly entitled to decline to use it and opt for the adversarial and more public court system.  What is not possible is that the rules which govern cases generally should be ignored or broken for cases that are brought through the courts.</P>
    <P>5.  Again, I emphasise that the State, following the normal practice in cases of this kind, took independent legal advice from highly reputable independent counsel, were advised that the State was not liable and the case was settled by another party who admitted liability.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised in relation to a letter which issued from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor on 21 July 1995 which set out the State's legal position in relation to the legal cases in question.  Contrary to what has been alleged, the letter did not issue to the late Mrs. McCole.  However, the solicitors who acted for the late Mrs. McCole also act for Positive Action, and the late Mrs. McCole was a member of Positive Action.  These solicitors wrote to the Chief State Solicitor on behalf of their client, Positive Action, seeking, among other matters, that the State admit liability.  The Chief State Solicitor wrote a letter in response describing the benefits of the compensation scheme which could not be achieved in litigation, and pointing out that it was difficult to understand how any of their clients could choose to ignore the scheme in favour of the uncertainty, delays, stresses, confrontation and costs involved in High Court litigation.</P>
    <P>It was entirely appropriate and necessary to inform the solicitors for Positive Action in clear terms in July 1995 of the State's legal position, so that no client of theirs would embark on litigation against the State under any misapprehension as to the fact that the State intended to fully defend any litigation initiated.  Any litigation which has subsequently been brought against the State in relation to the infection of the anti-D product has been defended.</P>
    <P>In all proceedings brought against the State in the hepatitis C issue the State defendants, acting on strong independent legal advice, have not admitted liability.</P>
    <P>In a letter to me dated 16 April 1997 the BTSB stated its intention to admit liability in certain proceedings.  The following is the statement of its position:</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board has decided that it will admit liability for negligence in court proceedings where claimants were directly or indirectly infected with Hepatitis <Col N="242" /> C through Anti-D Immunoglobulin supplied by the Board.  In such proceedings and in other court proceedings where claimants allege infection with Hepatitis C from blood, blood components or derivatives supplied by the Board, the Board will admit the findings of fact contained in the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Board is not in a position to decide whether aggravated or exemplary damages should be awarded in any case, as this is a legal issue which falls to be judicially determined. The Board notes that the Government has decided that the terms of reference of the Compensation Tribunal will be amended to empower the Chairman of the Compensation Tribunal, Mr. Justice Egan, to decide whether such damages should be awarded in individual cases.  Similarly a judge in court proceedings would determine this issue in individual cases.</P>
    <P>As I have said on many occasions in this House, I do not consider the courts a suitable vehicle for awarding compensation in such circumstances where there are a large number of plaintiffs who have broadly similar claims.  There appears to be a refusal on the part of the Opposition to recognise the adversarial nature of the courts.  I cannot change the way in which court cases are conducted. That is a matter outside my control.  For that reason I established the compensation tribunal for the hepatitis C victims and later this evening I will commend the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Bill, 1997, to the House, which will place the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The most recent criticism of the State's position in the McCole case is contained in the Fianna Fáil motion put down for debate this evening which, <i>inter alia</i>, calls on the Government and myself as Minister for Health to waive the claim of privilege in the McCole case.  The late Mrs McCole's action was one of a number of actions which are at various stages of progress through the courts. Mrs McCole's case was the first of these cases to be set down for hearing.  A second case, to which Deputy Cowen referred, is listed for hearing on 1 July.  It is not necessary to know anything about the rules of privilege, or even to be a lawyer, to understand that where cases are decided in an adversarial courtroom and where a party to litigation has many other cases of a similar kind at various stages in the court system, that party is put at an obvious disadvantage if its detailed legal advice is made public, especially if that is done before all the cases are finished.  The House is aware that the Government, while recognising a person's right to take court proceedings, has put in place a non-adversarial compensation tribunal for certain persons who had contracted hepatitis C since December 1995.  While the State is still a defendant in those other similar proceedings, it would not be appropriate for it to disclose legal advice on this litigation where comparable litigation is pending before the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> The Fianna Fáil motion also calls on the Government to divulge in full the circumstances in which the State's defence of the McCole case was devised and executed and to lay before the House all documentation, including documentation from the Chief State Solicitor's office, giving the state of knowledge of the Government. There is a fundamental objection to any process whereby lawyers advising a party to litigation could be required to account to the Legislature for its advice or indeed for decisions made by the courts in the administration of justice.  Even a court of law is not entitled to inquire into the instructions given to a lawyer by his or her client or the advice given to the client by his or her lawyer. This is the basis of legal professional privilege and is a fundamental norm, without which the interests of justice could not be served.  If the Legislature insisted on receiving an account of such advice, this could amount to an interference by the Legislature with the independent administration of justice and constitute a breach of the doctrine of the separation of powers.  It is not, therefore, appropriate that the State's legal advice be made public or that the management of the litigation be analysed in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>A court system which is independent of the other branches of Government requires not only that the judges should be free of interference or influence from the Legislature or the Executive, but that the litigants who come before the court should be free to conduct their litigation in any lawful way that they are advised or see fit, without the prospect of themselves or their lawyers being required to answer to another arm of Government in respect of the exercise of that freedom.  For the reasons I have outlined, I am sure that Members, in particular those who have a legal background, will appreciate that the Government could not waive its claim to privilege in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The State is defendant in thousands of cases each year.  Each of them concerns an individual citizen and that citizen's family and involves important concerns for individual citizens.  Some of these cases are settled, others are fought and of those fought some are lost and others are won.</P>
    <P>The State is obliged by law to conduct its litigation in accordance with the same rules as any other litigant.  It is entitled to take advice and required to work in an adversarial system in the courts to the same extent as any other litigant. The State did not want to be in this position on the hepatitis C issue and for that reason I recommended to the Government that we should set up the compensation tribunal to settle cases non-adversarially. The attempt to develop a parliamentary scrutiny of the conduct of individual cases is liable to lead to a position in which the State will be substantially impaired in its ability to conduct its litigation in a way that does not apply to any other litigant.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to have debates about why the State denied liability, why it did or did <Col N="244" /> not call certain witnesses or why it asked certain questions in the course of cross-examination in all the thousands of cases with which it deals every year.  That is the precedent the Opposition is seeking to establish.</P>
    <P>A system of parliamentary scrutiny of how any class of litigants exercise their freedom to conduct their litigation before the courts &mdash; provided they are behaving lawfully in doing so &mdash; comprises a breach of the doctrine of the separation of powers. An independent court system requires not only that the judges be free from interference, but that the parties who appear before them, provided they behave lawfully, can do so without fear of being made answerable to another arm of Government, namely the Oireachtas, for the exercise of that freedom.  This is fundamental to the separation of powers under our Constitution and helps to guarantee a fair balance of rights.</P>
    <P>The BTSB conducted its defence of the McCole case in accordance with the legal advice it received.  It did not receive, nor did it request, policy advice from me or the Government.  It conducted its business in accordance with the rules of the court.  There is no mystery and nothing to be covered up.  The State took and maintained its legal position.  The BTSB took an initial position and changed it on a full review of the case.  In this, it acted no differently from many other persons or bodies.</P>
    <P>It is almost impossible to come to terms with the enormity of the scandal surrounding the hepatitis C infection of the anti-D product and the blood supply and to fully comprehend the devastating effect it is having on the health and everyday lives of those persons who have been infected and their families.  As I said before, no words of mine could ever adequately make amends to the 1,600 women and men for the injury caused to them by a blood transfusion system in which they had previously placed their trust and confidence.  In all these matters, I made decisions and acted on the basis of the best information available to me at the time and on the basis of independent legal advice.  In retrospect if, when I first became Minister for Health, I had all the facts I now have, I have no doubt I would have made some different decisions.  Arising from my review of the findings of the Finlay Tribunal, later this evening I will introduce a Bill to put the hepatitis C compensation tribunal on a statutory basis.  I will include in the statutory scheme many concepts which are not included in the non-statutory scheme.  If they had been included originally, it would have been a better scheme.</P>
    <P>This has been the worst tragedy ever in the health services.  As Minister for Health, I will continue to do everything in my power to ameliorate the pain and suffering of all hepatitis C victims and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion, I am disappointed the Minister continues to behave like a defendant in this matter.  That is central to the unsatisfactory way in which the matter has <Col N="245" /> been handled since the full facts came to the knowledge of the two Ministers over two Administrations involved in this matter.  The Government is uncomfortable with Opposition Deputies referring to the legal strategy in the late Brigid McCole case.  While this is not surprising, it has only itself to blame.  The Government and the State agencies involved conducted the defence of her case in the same way as they would have conducted a case in which an opportunistic plaintiff was claiming against the corporation for tripping on a slippery cobblestone.  That was outlined by the Minister tonight.  It is clear the same tactics were used in this awful case as would have been applied in any common case taken against the State by any plaintiff.  This was no ordinary case. It was a highly unusual case.  The late Brigid McCole had been mortally wounded by the negligence of a State body and that was known to the State at the crucial times it conducted its defence in its harsh way.</P>
      <P>There is now political embarrassment because the matter of the legal strategy is persistently raised by the Opposition.  In a most unconvincing leap for the moral high ground the Government with a brass neck now accuses the Opposition of making political capital out of this case.  It is the persistent refusal of the Minister and this Administration to account properly for the handling of this case which keeps it in the public arena and keeps the wound open for the relatives of the late Brigid McCole.  It is clear there is collective Cabinet responsibility for that strategy, but the Government is still running away from accountability in regard to the handling of the McCole case.</P>
      <P>The Government specifically excluded it from the terms of reference of the Finlay tribunal.  The Minister has refused to publish his legal advice and he outlined the reasons for that tonight.  He also refused to waive client privilege over that advice.  He did this in the face of the wishes of the late Mrs. McCole's family.  The Government has ensured there will not be any accounting for that harsh legal strategy by excluding it from the tribunal's terms of reference and by persistently denying accountability to Dáil Éireann for the conduct of its defence in this case.</P>
      <P>On 7 May the Chief State Solicitor, on his behalf and that of the Attorney General, the Government's legal adviser, refused an invitation to attend a meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  His letter continues the legal fiction of a complete distinction between the BTSB and the State.  The BTSB is an arm of the State. It is a State board.  The persistent use of that legal fiction continues to be as unconvincing as when it was first used.  It may be legally convincing, but politically it is a fiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first reason given in that letter for refusing to discuss the McCole case is that &ldquo;it would not be appropriate for the State to discuss this litigation where comparable litigation is still pending before the Courts.&rdquo;  That is also unconvincing. Was the Chief State Solicitor on a trip to Mars <Col N="246" /> when the Finlay tribunal took place?  The circumstances of the McCole case have been the subject of exhaustive public debate.  Shortly after the McCole case was settled, the Minister for Health said on RTÉ radio that &ldquo;it would be totally illogical if the BTSB were not to admit liability in other cases that would come to court.&rdquo;  Did the Chief State Solicitor complain to the Minister that this comment was inappropriate?  The Chief State Solicitor does not say why it is so inappropriate to discuss the McCole case while the other cases are pending.</P>
    <P>The Chief State Solicitor seems to be under the mistaken impression that the Select Committee on Social Affairs wants the lawyers to account for their advice.  As I understand it and know it to be, the select committee simply wants to know what the advice was and to make the Minister accountable for the decisions he took on foot of it.  It is the function of lawyers to advise and for the Minister to decide and it is difficult to believe the Chief State Solicitor is not aware of that distinction.</P>
    <P>The next argument advanced in that letter is that the lawyers could be asked &ldquo;to account to the Legislature for decisions made by the courts in the course of the administration of justice.&rdquo; That is totally spurious.  First, there was not a court decision in Mrs. McCole's case, apart from the decision that she was not entitled to use an alias in the proceedings.  Second, the select committee is aware of the distinction between lawyers and judges and there is no question of the committee asking the State's lawyers to account for judgments of the courts.  Judges, unlike the Minister, give reasons for their decisions.</P>
    <P>The Chief State Solicitor goes on to state in that letter, &ldquo;Even a Court of Law is not entitled to inquire into the instructions given to a lawyer by his/her client or the advice given to the client by his/her lawyer&rdquo;.  That is an incorrect statement of the law.  The courts do not apply an absolute rule that instructions and advice are always privileged. In the case of Murphy <i>v.</i> Kirwan, 1993, the Supreme Court stated &ldquo;Professional privilege cannot and must not be applied so as to be injurious to the interests of justice&rdquo;.  Is the Minister saying it would not be in the interests of justice to comply with the wishes of the family of the late Mrs. McCole?</P>
    <P>The Chief State Solicitor is also concerned that for him to appear before the select committee would constitute a breach of the doctrine of the separation of powers.  I do not believe the Chief State Solicitor really believes that.  The separation of powers means that the Dáil and the Government cannot usurp the functions of the Judiciary. It was not the function of the Judiciary to conduct the State's defence in the late Mrs. McCole's case, therefore it is ridiculous to say that the principle of the separation of powers precludes the select committee from inquiring into this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>The next argument advanced is that &ldquo;litigants who come before the court should be free to conduct <Col N="247" /> their litigation in any lawful way that they are advised or see fit without the prospect of themselves or their lawyers being required to answer to another arm of Government in respect of the exercise of that freedom.&rdquo;  That was repeated by the Minister tonight as a justification. He is saying that any litigant, including himself as Minister, the BTSB or the NDAB, is entitled to conduct a case in whatever way he or she thinks fit.  It is ridiculous to suggest the select committee would wish to inquire into the way a private litigant conducted his or her case.  The point which seems to have escaped the Chief State Solicitor and the Minister tonight is that the defendants were the Minister for Health and two State agencies. It is not good enough for the Chief State Solicitor to say that the Minister for Health is entitled to conduct his litigation in any way he sees fit.  This is a democracy and where actions are taken in the name of the people, those who take those actions must account.  The Minister should account for the way in which he saw fit to defend the McCole case.  There cannot be a proper accounting until we know the legal advice the Minister received.  We want to know whether he was presented with a range of options, what instructions he gave his legal team and if he asked what his powers over the BTSB were.  We also want to know why his defence denied that the BTSB had manufactured anti-D from the plasma of a patient with infective hepatitis when this fact had been, to use his words to the Dáil, &ldquo;as clear as crystal&rdquo; since January 1995.  Why did the State persist with that denial when that fact was as clear as crystal since January 1995?</P>
    <P>The only thing that prevents proper accountability is the Minister's refusal to waive his privilege. There is no doubt he is entitled to do so. The definitive statement of the law comes from the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Smurfit Paribas Limited <i>v.</i> AAB Export Finance 1990.  It states:</P>
    <P>Where it is established that a communication was made between a person and his lawyer acting for him as a lawyer for the purpose of obtaining from such lawyer legal advice... that communication made on such occasion should in general be privileged or exempt from disclosure, except with the consent of the client.</P>
    <P>It is clear there is no consent forthcoming from this client, the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the extensive legal work on the role of the Attorney General, <i>The Irish law Officers</i>, Dr. James Casey, Professor of Law at UCD, states:</P>
    <P>It cannot be said that the Attorney General's opinions may never be disclosed; the practice is quite the contrary.  Ministers and Departments have often publicly referred to the advice given them by the Attorney, and some Departments have published actual opinions when answering queries from the Seanad Select Committee on statutory instruments.  Clearly, then, the privilege can be, and has been, waived.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> Professor Casey also refers to an opinion of the Attorney General being made available to the Committee of Public Accounts in 1970.  In the Brendan Smyth controversy, the advice given by the Attorney General was made public.  In the McCole case the Minister has given selective quotations from the advice given to him.  He has said on many occasions that the advice to him was that the State was not liable, so he is quite prepared to waive the privilege when it suits him.  That is not good enough.  We need to find out the full extent of the advice in order to see on what basis he took the decisions to direct the legal strategy.</P>
    <P>We want to know, for example, why the Minister, in his defence, denied that the BTSB had used plasma from a patient who, to the BTSB's knowledge, had been diagnosed as having infective hepatitis.  On 16 October 1996, the Minister told the Dáil that the first time he became aware that patient X had infectious hepatitis was when he read the Miriam Hederman O'Brien report, &ldquo;some time in January 1995&rdquo;.  He went on to say: &ldquo;It is as clear as crystal in the conclusions that Donor X had hepatitis C, which is infectious hepatitis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In June 1995 Brigid McCole served proceedings against the BTSB, the Minister and the NDAB.  According to the Minister, it had by then been as clear as crystal to the Minister for almost six months that the BTSB had administered anti-D made from the plasma of a person with infectious hepatitis.  He knew that a very considerable number of people had been infected but the service of Mrs. McCole's proceedings seems to have had a very strange effect on the Minister.  It caused him to abdicate his responsibility to the victims as Minister for Health.  Because Mrs. McCole had sued, all other considerations were subordinate.  The Minister turned into a defendant.</P>
    <P>Apparently, his legal advice was that the Department of Health did not have legal liability. It seems that the Minister was prepared to stop there.  He said on 8 October: &ldquo;I have been legally advised that the Department of Health does not have a liability... The BTSB had a different role and it had to make up its own mind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would seem from this and other statements that the Minister never took a view as to whether the BTSB was liable in negligence.  It was &ldquo;clear as crystal&rdquo; to him that the BTSB had administered anti-D made from the plasma of a person with hepatitis C, but he was unable to form a view as to whether the BTSB was liable for the consequences of that action.  As far as he was concerned, that was a matter for the BTSB.  It is quite extraordinary that at the vital time when we had a Minister for Health who was unable to make any assessment as to the legal liability of a State board &mdash; the BTSB &mdash; we also had, in the Minister's words, the greatest public health scandal in the history of the State.  Yet the Minister for Health had no view on who was responsible.  He was prepared to put the victims through the courts if they wanted to establish that responsitor <Col N="249" /> bility.  He offered them money from the compensation tribunal if they would leave the issue of responsibility alone.</P>
    <P>Having left it to the BTSB to consider if it felt it was negligent, one wonders whether the Minister ever inquired of the BTSB about its attitude towards its liability.  There is no doubt that he was entitled to be told.  Article 21(2) of the Statutory Instrument which governs the BTSB states: &ldquo;The Board shall submit to the Minister such information regarding the performance of its functions as the Minister may from time to time require.&rdquo; Had he asked the BTSB to account for its liability, it would have had to inform him.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister ever ask the BTSB how it was going to defend the action, or did he first know of this matter when the BTSB filed its defence in the McCole case?  If he never asked it, that was surely a grave dereliction of his duty.  As late as his speech to the Dáil on 16 October, the Minister continued to pretend that his political failure was due to the legal process.  There are echoes of that tonight.  He claims he was a victim of the adversarial system and was only doing what the lawyers told him.  Lawyers advise, but Ministers make decisions based on that advice, and there must be political responsibility to the Dáil for those decisions.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the BTSB and the State, when they submitted their defences, denied that the BTSB had used plasma from a patient who, to the BSTB's knowledge, had been diagnosed as having infective hepatitis.  This was despite the fact that it had been crystal clear to the Minister since January 1995 that this was exactly what the BTSB did.  In his speech to the Dáil on 16 October, the Minister attempted to justify this. He said:</P>
    <P>I now wish to reflect on the manner in which issues were prepared for court in the adversarial system with which we are all familiar.  Pleadings are the means by which the issues to be tried by the court are netted down and clarified so that not only the parties, but also the court, which otherwise knows nothing about the matters in controversy, can know what matters need to be adjudicated upon and the evidence which will be required to establish or refute those matters... The State rightly called for matters to be properly established.</P>
    <P>In January 1995 it was &ldquo;crystal clear&rdquo; to the Minister that the BTSB had made anti-D from the plasma of a patient with infectious hepatitis.  How then could it subsequently become a &ldquo;matter in controversy?&rdquo;  Why did he feel that it was legitimate to make Mrs. McCole call evidence about it?  How can he say that the State &ldquo;rightly&rdquo; called on Mrs. McCole to properly establish this matter when it had been crystal clear to him since January 1995?</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for him to say that he was following legal advice.  If the lawyers decided to run the case in this way, it was an abdication of responsibility by the Minister which let them <Col N="250" /> do so.  This, after all, was the greatest public health scandal in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Mrs. McCole's case was no ordinary case.  This was not a chancer's claim against the corporation for tripping on a cobblestone.  Mrs. McCole was suffering from what the Minister for Health surely knew was a very painful and probably fatal disease.  Why did the State and the BTSB deny that the BTSB had made anti-D from infected plasma when they knew that to be true?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there are two possible reasons, both of which reflect very badly on the Minister.  The first, which the Minister seems to prefer, is that he simply abdicated his responsibilities to the lawyers and the lawyers made the decision to deny that the BTSB had manufactured anti-D from infected plasma.  The other, which seems more likely, is that the Minister made or at the very least approved of the decision to deny that the BTSB used infected plasma, and the lawyers then implemented the Minister's decision.</P>
    <P>What could have motivated the Minister to make such a decision?  It seems that it was part of his strategy to make the victims go to the compensation tribunal rather than the courts.  It would certainly have been easier for Mrs. McCole and others to go to the compensation tribunal, but that was not a complete solution.  The tribunal, could not make any determination as to who was responsible for the victims' suffering and could not award aggravated damages for the use of infected plasma in the manufacture of anti-D.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember the purpose of aggravated damages and exemplary damages. They are related to the culpability involved in a case.  Aggravated damages are usually 10 per cent of the compensatory damages and are awarded because of the manner in which the wrong was done &mdash; in Mrs McCole's case, because of the use by the BTSB of infected plasma.  They are awarded because of the conduct of the wrongdoer after the commission of the wrong, such as a refusal to apologise &mdash; one of the greatest concerns of Mrs. McCole and the other victims of the first infection.  Mrs. McCole and the other victims went through years of being told that there was nothing wrong with them, when the BTSB had known the reason for their illness since 1976.</P>
    <P>Aggravated damages are also related to the conduct of the wrongdoer and his or her representatives in the defence of the claim, which is particularly appropriate in Mrs. McCole's case.</P>
    <P>Exemplary damages are awarded to mark the court's particular disapproval of the defendant's conduct and its decision that it should publicly be seen to have punished the defendant for such conduct by awarding such damages.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes play of his desire to get the claimants out of the adversarial system and into his <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal to avoid stress on them.  The other reason was to avoid the issue of responsibility, because the tribunal did not deal with responsibility or liability; it was just a cash dispensing mechanism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> If ever there was a case for the award of aggravated and exemplary damages, it was this case. The Minister, however, took the view that a certain amount of money was good enough for this category of victims.  He was not prepared to say they were entitled to an apology or to an admission of liability.  He was not prepared to say they were entitled to an award which would mark disapproval of the BTSB's conduct.  If they had all been ushered into that tribunal, if the brave Mrs. McCole had not held her ground and fought her case in the courts, none of this would have emerged and we would not be debating a Bill to establish the hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal statutorily.  A public inquiry would never have been held into the affair and the truth would have been hidden.  I believe that was very much in the minds of this Administration, of all the defendants, to avoid liability at all costs.  It explains the harsh legal strategy for which we have not yet had full account.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell raised the necessity for and relevance of the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; as used in the expression &ldquo;qualified political parties&rdquo; in section 16 (3) when we debated this issue on Committee Stage.  This was raised in the context of &ldquo;qualified party&rdquo; which is already defined as a political party to satisfy certain conditions.  I agree with Deputy McDowell that the word is not necessary and my amendment seeks its deletion.</P>

      <P>In page 14, lines 23 and 24, to delete &ldquo;Public Offices Commission&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arose directly out of a submission to the committee by the Public Offices Commission.  It is fair to say that the commission felt very strongly that the drawing up of guidelines under this section was not one for its members but was more properly a matter of policy in respect of which the Minister and his Department should draft the relevant guidelines. There is a justified fear on the part of the Public Offices Commission that, in enforcing its members to draw up these guidelines, they would be politicised or have their independence <Col N="252" /> impaired.  Because of the very strong reservations expressed to the committee I ask the Minister to give this amendment favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered it since Committee Stage and am not minded to accept it for the very reason that I do not want to politicise the guidelines to be issued.  As drafted, the Bill requires the guidelines to be drawn up by the Public Offices Commission whereas Deputy Dempsey's amendment would require the Minister to do so.  That runs counter to the whole thrust of the Bill, which requires guidelines on a variety of issues to be drawn up by the independent Public Offices Commission.</P>
      <P>The matter provided for in section 17 is extremely politically sensitive.  For example, it involves regulating how a party can spend money it receives from the State.  It would be undesirable, a bad precedent, for those guidelines to be drawn up by a politician, that is a Minister, rather than by the Public Offices Commission who should be given the necessary support which I intend doing between now and 1 January next in terms of the resources it needs to provide such guidelines.  It would be a move in the wrong direction to remove from that body the power to draw up these guidelines and give it to a political officeholder.</P>
      <P>I ask the Deputy not to press his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears the Minister and I are diametrically opposed.  Under this Bill the Public Offices Commission will have a statutory obligation to ensure that its provisions are enforced and the intentions of the Oireachtas carried out. I am not sure I agree with the Minister, that allowing his Department to draft the guidelines, to interpret the intentions of the Oireachtas, would politicise the issue or cause any great difficulty. If the Minister issued guidelines on how the Public Offices Commission should perform its part of the task, I would accept his argument but, since its role is to police the legislation, regulations and guidelines set down by the Minister, I do not think that body should itself undertake the task.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this amendment. For the sake of clarity and honouring the political wishes of this House in the broadest sense &mdash; rather than within a party political manner &mdash; those guidelines should emanate from his Department with no interference thereafter.  If the Public Offices Commission has to draw up these guidelines, at a later stage, that body could be in dispute with political parties and individual Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We appear to have a difference of opinion on this matter.  Acceptance of Deputy Dempsey's amendment would cause difficulties if the guidelines, which are very sensitive and important in relation to this Bill overall, were seen to be tainted in any way by having a political <Col N="253" /> slant, as they would if drawn up by a Minister.  It is much safer that when the Bill is enacted, the guidelines &mdash; the &ldquo;do's and don'ts&rdquo;&mdash; are drawn up independently by the Public Offices Commission, comprising people of the highest independent calibre.  That would safeguard the overall thrust of the legislation whereas acceptance of Deputy Dempsey's amendment would dilute it.</P>
      <P>I must request him not to press his amendment.</P>

While it would be better if the Department laid down the guidelines, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a simple drafting amendment, amendment No. 38 being consequential on an amendment already made to section 1 which brings Part III of the Bill into operation on 1 January next. Under the Bill as drafted, payments to parties will apply from polling day at the next general election and continue until the day after polling at the subsequent general election.  We have agreed that any such payments should not begin before 1 January next.  This amendment provides that the first payment to qualified parties shall not be made until not less than three months will have elapsed after 1 January 1998.  It also provides that payments made after 1 January 1998 will apply from the date before polling at the next general election thereafter.  The commencement procedure for payments to political parties, as envisaged in the Bill, will begin from 1 January next, with the first payment being made three months thereafter.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4) No payment shall be made under this section after the thirtieth day of April in any year (other than the year in which this Part comes into operation) unless and until the statement and the report of the auditor referred to in section 19 and the donation statement and statutory declaration referred to in section 23 as respect the party concerned for the preceding year have been received by the Public Offices Commission and the said Commission has furnished a copy thereof to the Minister for Finance and certified to the said Minister that the said statement and report, and the said donation statement and statutory declaration were completed in accordance with guidelines issued by the Commission under section 4 and comply with the provisions of this Part and Part IV, respectively.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the course of considering amendments tabled by Deputy Dempsey during the long Committee Stage debate, I agreed to consider changing the arrangement provided for in the Bill under which the annual audited statement to be prepared each year by the appropriate officer or qualified parties in relation to the use of payments received by them is to be furnished to the Minister for Finance. Under section 19 the audited statement is furnished by the appropriate officer to the Minister for Finance, who is required to furnish a copy of the statement to the Public Offices Commission and to cause a copy of the statement to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey made a strong argument that the statement should be furnished to the Public Offices Commission in the first place and that the commission should be responsible for sending a copy to the Minister for Finance and for subsequently causing a copy to be laid before each <Col N="255" /> House of the Oireachtas.

      <P>In page 21, line 17, after &ldquo;subsection (4)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including in the case of a candidate at a Dáil election, donations received in relation to that election at any time before the issue of the writ or writs in relation to the election and, in the case of a candidate at a European election, donations received at any time before the date of the order appointing polling day at the election&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 46, 48 and 70 arise from contributions on Committee Stage on this section. Section 2(a) and (b) relate to disclosure of donations received by candidates at elections who are not subsequently elected.  Under subsection (2) they are obliged to furnish a statement of election expenses to the Public Offices Commission within 56 days of polling or the close of poll at the Seanad election, as is appropriate.</P>
      <P>The point made on Committee Stage was that, as drafted, the section might not cover donations made to a person before he or she is nominated as a candidate.  It was stated that the section could be construed as not applying to donations received by a person before they were nominated. The point was also made that an outgoing Deputy who, on dissolution, ceased to be a Member could argue that he or she is not required to furnish details of donations received between the dissolution of the Dáil and the time when he or she is nominated officially as a candidate at the subsequent general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments provide clarity on this point.  Under the amendments it is specifically provided that donations received by a candidate at any time, including those received before the issue of the writs at an election or the making of an order appointing dates and times for a Seanad election, in relation to the election must be disclosed. <Col N="257" /> Again, the key phrase is &ldquo;donations in relation to the election&rdquo;.  This clarifies the issue and removes the doubts Members expressed on Committee Stage.  I ask the House to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>The Minister has gone as far as he can to address the serious concerns expressed on Committee Stage.  There were grounds to believe that the Bill, if it were not amended, would be found unconstitutional.  It would have been contrary to the McKenna judgment because it would have allowed people who were not Members of the House to receive large donations and spend a considerable amount of money before they lodged their nomination papers.  Having looked at the Minister's amendments, I no longer see a loophole.  This levels the playing field between Members of the Oireachtas and non-party candidates, who may collect money well in advance of an election.  It even covers the point about Members of the House who would not be candidates until ten days after the moving of a writ.  I thank the Minister for addressing the concerns we expressed.  We support these amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I tabled amendments to provide that expenditure incurred in the taking of an opinion poll by or on behalf of a political party or the candidate would be deemed to be an election expense.  This gave rise to a lengthy debate. I eventually agreed to withdraw the amendment so I could examine the possibility of clarifying that it is only such a poll carried out in regard to an election which could be deemed to be an election <Col N="259" /> expense, because an opinion poll taken 12 months earlier could be deemed to be part of the election campaign.  To clarify that it relates to an election.  I decided a period of 60 days before polling would be appropriate and I tabled the amendment accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone a long way towards meeting our objections to this section.  Will he clarify why he decided on a period of 60 days before polling day?  This section deals with matters that could affect the outcome of an election campaign.  The Minister made the case for his predecessor who, in attempting to pass an Electoral Bill in 1992, wanted to ban opinion polls during the course of an election campaign.  It may be time to reconsider that aspect of electoral law.  Despite what may have been argued in the previous Bill, in this Bill we accept that an opinion poll may influence an election campaign and therefore there is a case to be made that opinion polls should not be allowed during the course of an election campaign.  That matter will have to be considered in the near future.</P>
      <P>Opinion polls were discussed on Committee Stage and it was stated that Fianna Fáil may have invented them during the last general election.  I was somewhat surprised to note in Cork recently the Labour Party was accused of inventing or distorting opinion polls.  At least we all play on a level playing field.  The period of 60 days has been plucked out of the air.  It could have been 30 days, but I will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The period of 60 days is reasonable in terms of deeming that period to be part of an election campaign.  I do not accept the argument that an opinion poll affects the result of an election, but it is a useful election tool and, like a poster campaign or an advertisement in the local paper, should be deemed to be an election expense.  I expressed my view on banning opinion polls during an election campaign.  If an opinion poll is not a legitimate published poll from a reputable organisation, it is an invented poll, and all political parties try to bolster their position.  I gave the instance on Committee Stage of reputable opinion polls stating the reality while the Deputy's party had its own tracking polls which gave a different result.  It is important that there is not distortion of the position by invention &mdash; if there is to be distortion, it should at least be predicated on reality.  I would have no difficulty in setting a moratorium period close to an election date, and that may be discussed in the future because there should be a calm period in which people can make up their minds without being barraged by influences in the last day or two of a campaign.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 54:</P>
      <P>In page 28, between lines 47 and 48, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) The publisher of a newspaper, magazine or other periodical publication shall not publish any advertisement or notice in relation to an election purporting to promote or oppose, directly or indirectly, the interests of a political party or a candidate at that election at the request of any person other than the national agent of a political party or a person authorised in writing by such agent, or a candidate at the election or the election agent of such candidate, or a person authorised in writing by such candidate or agent, unless the person produces to the said publisher a certificate from the Public Offices Commission that that person has complied with the provisions of subsection (7) in relation to that election.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of Committee Stage we dealt with the provision requiring persons or bodies not directly involved in an election incurring election expenditure such as advertising for or against a candidate or party to register with the Public Offices Commission.  The chairman of the select committee, Deputy Mitchell, said it should be an offence for newspapers to carry an advertisement <Col N="261" /> unless a certificate is produced by the Public Offices Commission.  I was not sure whether it was possible to provide for that and in the interim I took the advice of the Attorney General.  I have concluded that Deputy Mitchell's suggestion is a sensible one and would help ensure compliance with the general thrust of the provisions in this section.</P>
    <P>A strong feeling was expressed during Committee Stage that a third party could simply ignore the registration requirements and canvass by buying advertising space against an individual party or candidate.  Newspapers are now required to ensure such a party has declared its position with the Public Offices Commission before accepting such an advertisement.  I recommend the amendments to the House.</P>

It addresses the serious concerns expressed by a number of members of the committee, particularly the chairman.  Having considered the matter, the Minister has gone as far as he can to ensure people act responsibly. It puts the onus on the publisher not to accept an advertisement unless a certificate is received from the Public Offices Commission.  On the earlier point about having proper offices and staff available to the Public Offices Commission, I am concerned there should be no undue delay in the processing of certificates.  I commend the Minister and his officials on the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the expenditure limits imposed on candidates and parties in individual constituencies. The amendments seek to raise the limits in the Bill of £14,000 for a three seat constituency, £17,000 for a four seat and £20,000 for a five seat to £20,000, £22,500 and £25,000 respectively.  I explained in considerable detail on Committee Stage the problems larger parties have with two or three candidates in four or five seat constituencies. It is something the Minister would not be familiar with being a member of a party which generally fields one candidate per constituency.  I hope I never have to spend £25,000 in a five seat constituency but, by tabling these amendments, I ask the Minister to allow a little headroom for parties which field more than one candidate in each constituency.  The increases I suggest are not outrageous when one considers that those figures will be cut in half because of inevitable agreements between the national and local party.  In a five seat constituency such as mine, Meath, it <Col N="262" /> means each candidate being allowed to spend £12,500.</P>

      <P>It is enough if they are spending it.  Without revealing any secrets to the opposition at this stage, there is a budget of £20,000 from the Fianna Fáil Party for the coming election in Meath to cover organisation.  If the provisions of this Bill were in place, the total amount available to the constituency for three candidates would be £60,000.  This would be halved to £30,000 because of the 50 per cent rule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is assumed the Deputy's party's national average expenditure per candidate is £20,000, the total expenditure for the three candidates to whom he referred is £60,000.  That means they will have £40,000 to spend between the three of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they will not.  Let me explain.  If we have a total of £60,000 to spend, half will be given to the national party headquarters because it comes into the reckoning for expenditure limits.  That leaves £30,000.  The constituency party may decide to spend £20,000 on the election campaign, some of which will admittedly be for posters for the three candidates.  That leaves £10,000 between the three candidates, which is less than £3,500 each.  I do not care how modest one's campaign will be but one would almost spend that much on petrol, meals, etc., during the course of an election campaign.  The Minister would not understand the difficulties which arise in a constituency where three candidates contest the seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty which the Minister does not recognise.  I do not fault him for that because he has not experienced it.  Where three or four candidates of a political party run in one constituency, they are entitled to half the limits set in the Bill.  I do not seek the modest increases in my amendments for us to go mad spending money in the election campaign.  I will not breach any of the limits and neither would most people.  The figures I propose are more reasonable than the Minister's for parties with more than one candidate in a constituency.  The Minister told me he would discuss this with his Government colleagues and I know those in Democratic Left would not be favourably disposed towards it.  Perhaps he might implement this on the eve of the general election without informing anyone until afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced one is at a disadvantage by having more candidates because one has a larger amount to spend.  The economies of scale must affect the efficient use of money. The organisation, canvassing and structure is not tripled because the geography remains the same for a single candidate as for three candidates. Most people would see limits of £14,000, £17,000 and £20,000 as reasonable and they apply to each candidate.  Having considered them, I am not disposed to accept the amendments which are not modest as they propose increases of between 25 and 43 per cent.  My limits are reasonable and it will be good for politics as well as for our pockets when they are put in place because much money is wasted on elections.</P>

      <P>I knew the Minister did not understand the plight of candidates of the larger parties and the thrust of the Bill displays that. There are no economies of scale for election candidates, whatever their political affiliations.  The reason the budget in Meath is so modest for this election &mdash; it was £30,000 for the last one &mdash; is that we have three candidates to take three seats. <Col N="264" /> There would have been four candidates previously.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled this amendment to take account of a pertinent point made by Deputy Lenihan on Committee Stage.  Under section 35, all statements of election expenses have to be submitted to the Public Offices Commission within 56 days after polling.  This would include a statement furnished by the agent of a candidate who dies at some stage during the election period.  Every eventuality was discussed in detail during our long days in committee.  The amendment relates to a very <Col N="266" /> specific case where a candidate who has acted as his or her own agent under the Bill dies.  In that case the personal representative of the candidate may appoint another agent to look after the candidate's election affairs.  Deputy Lenihan pointed out that 56 days may not be sufficient to allow for probate etc. to have been duly processed in that eventuality.  The amendment makes it clear that in such a case where it is not possible to comply with the 56 day limit, the statement should be furnished as soon as is practicable.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately this amendment is as morbid as the previous amendment.  Section 40 provides for a situation where, due to the death of a candidate, a fresh election is held in a constituency.  The section provides that the original election and the fresh election are deemed to have been a single election.  It provides that where a candidate had contested the original election and contests the fresh election, expenditure limits specified in sections 31 and 32 would be increased by one half.  There was some debate on that provision. Having considered the matter I am now of the view it would be appropriate to treat the original election and the fresh election separately with separate accounting for election expenditure in each case.  Rather than the more complicated position proposed in the Bill I suggest where a candidate dies the election would simply stop and the new election with the new candidate would begin as a fresh election and fresh accounting period and new limits would apply to that case. That is clearer and in line with the views expressed on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 61, to delete lines 34 to 41, and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  An application by an elector to have his name entered in the supplement to the postal voters list received by the registration <Col N="271" /> authority after the date of the dissolution of the Dáil at a general election or the date of the order appointing polling day at a Dáil bye-election, or a presidential, European or local election or a referendum shall not have effect in relation to that election or referendum.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 72 provides for various amendments to the 1972 Act relating to the registration of electors. Among these amendments are proposals to allow eligible electors, not already on the postal voters list or the special voters list, to apply for entry to the supplement of the postal or special voters lists during the lifetime of a register.  The provision provided for a cut-off point of 50 days before polling.</P>
    <P>I was of the view that this is a long time and sometimes elections occur with less predictability than the one we are facing.  That period was originally suggested to allow for applications to be processed and a supplement printed and published in good time for the poll.  In this context the postal ballot papers are issued and special voting takes place relatively early in the course of an election or referendum.</P>
    <P>The period could be shortened and still allow adequate time for applications to be processed before the supplement is used.  It is in all our interests to bring the date as close as possible to the date of polling.  These amendments propose to fix the cut-off point for entry onto the supplements as the date of the order appointing polling day at a referendum and at all elections, except Dáil elections, where it is the day of the issue of the writs.  I hope this is practical and am advised that I am cutting it close.  I hope presiding officers and others will not find this too onerous a responsibility but it is worth attempting.</P>

However, the basic thrust of the amendments and the committee's approach was to be as inclusive as possible during Committee Stage. These measures will not apply to the forthcoming election.  I presume they apply to all of those we discussed.  We discussed those who had become 18 years of age since the drawing up of the register. Will the Minister clarify if they will be eligible?</P>

The categories that it would apply to are 18 year olds who became 18 subsequent to the coming into force of the register but previous to the date of the poll, to people who by virtue of their occupation find themselves unable to vote at elections &mdash; this would include students &mdash; and people who have moved house and are not on the register at their previous or new address.</P>

We have commitments, for example, on the registration of political parties that I will live up to if and when I am in a position to do so after the next election.  We are moving inexorably to a more open and inclusive type of political involvement which will allow more people to participate in the political process and I hope this Bill will advance that move.  I believe it will.  It is an extremely important advance in electoral law and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy McManus and their officials for their assistance and co-operation.  There were fears expressed on both sides of the House that this Bill would be rushed through and we would end up with an unworkable Bill which would bring us into disrepute. Having initially feared unnecessary delays, the Minister accepted the bona fides of Opposition Deputies that, whatever disagreements we might have on specific aspects of the Bill, at least if it was passed it would be reasonably workable. Thanks to the detailed Committee Stage, Report Stage has been very good.  I thank the Minister and his officials for the way they took the spirit of our amendments on board, if not their exact wording.  The Bill is the better for it.  There are other areas at which I would like to have a good look.  These include the establishment of the Public Offices Commission as an independent body and its staffing arrangements, the registration of political parties to which the Minister referred <Col N="274" /> and the establishment of an independent referendum commission.</P>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Ceann Comhairle, the chairperson of the committee and, in particular, the Minister and his officials for their assistance in dealing with the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a tribunal on a statutory basis to be known as the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal to award compensation to certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C within the State from anti-D immunoglobulin, other blood products or a blood transfusion and to provide for connected matters.  A non-statutory compensation scheme for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from the use of anti-D or other blood products within the State has been in place since December 1995.  It is acknowledged by the representative groups, Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Kidney Association that this scheme has been effective in its objective of dealing sensitively and efficiently with the claimants who have gone before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The non-statutory tribunal was established to fulfil the Government's commitment to fair compensation for women infected with the hepatitis C virus as contained in the policy document, A Government of Renewal.  I published the scheme of compensation in June 1995 and on 5 September of that year the Government decided to extend access to the non-statutory tribunal to blood transfusion recipients.  The non-statutory tribunal has provided an alternative to the courts <Col N="275" /> system for persons infected with hepatitis C and alleviated many of the anxieties which might arise if claimants only had recourse to the courts which are adversarial by their nature.</P>
    <P>As with the non-statutory tribunal, the Bill provides that the making of a claim to the tribunal does not involve a waiver of a right of action.  It is only if the claimant accepts the award made by the tribunal that he or she is required to waive a right of action which he or she may otherwise have.  Should a claimant not be satisfied with the tribunal award made to him or her the claimant can initiate or continue court proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Government resolved that the operation of the non-statutory tribunal would not be disrupted or delayed while the legislation was being prepared to place it on a statutory basis.  As I stated previously in the House, I am determined that any advantages conferred by the enactment of the Bill will also apply to those claimants who have already had their cases processed by the non-statutory tribunal or those who in the interim will process their claims.  I have made provision for this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that following the publication of the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board the Government embarked upon a full reappraisal of the non-statutory tribunal.  The reappraisal was required principally because the state of knowledge was significantly altered by the publication of the report.  For this reason the Government has decided to place the compensation scheme on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in the Dáil on 20 and 25 March I made a number of commitments in respect of the non-statutory compensation scheme.  These were that it would be placed on a statutory basis, that the prohibition on the payment of exemplary or aggravated damages would be removed, and that there would be a right of appeal to the High Court on awards made by the tribunal.  I am glad to inform the House that these commitments are being fully honoured and are reflected in the Bill with many other new provisions which improve the scheme for claimants.</P>
    <P>In line with the terms of the motion agreed by both Houses of the Oireacthas on 25 and 26 March, I engaged in a process of consultation with the four representative groups and the chairman of the compensation tribunal in relation to the reappraisal of the compensation scheme.  As set out in the motion, the reappraisal had to take account of any necessary legal advice.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been prepared exceptionally quickly, particularly when one considers its many innovative provisions and the significant legal complexity of many of the issues involved.  The positive experience of members of the representative groups at the hearings before the non-statutory tribunal and the extensive consultation process on the Bill formed the foundation for the draft legislation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the extensive consultation process <Col N="276" /> was to ensure the Government's legislative proposals would take account of, in so far as is possible, the views of the representative groups. A number of difficult and complex issues were raised.  As far as possible, the views of the representative groups have been incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The consultation process commenced in late March, early April.  On 16 April a copy of the draft heads of the Bill placing the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis was presented to the representative groups.  This was followed by numerous meetings with the representative groups which made submissions, both oral and written, to assist my Department in preparing the Bill.  The representative groups put forward suggested amendments to the draft heads of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The following are some of the more notable amendments which have been incorporated in the Bill which were not included in the non-statutory scheme of compensation, many of which have been included at the request of the representative groups: provision for aggravated or exemplary damages to be assessed by the compensation tribunal and that a claimant may rely on the facts found in the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board or any other fact in relation to their case for such damages; provision for the establishment of a reparation fund from which 20 per cent of the total amount of an award of general and-or special damages or 20 per cent of the settlement of a claim be paid to applicants; provision for a claimant's right of appeal of any decision of the tribunal to the High Court; provision for oral evidence by a claimant to the tribunal or his or her medical practitioner or both &mdash; in the non-statutory scheme the tribunal had discretion in this regard; provision for a person who has had a claim for compensation determined by the non-statutory tribunal to apply to the tribunal to hear evidence, at its discretion, which was not made available to the non-statutory tribunal in calculating the award made to that person; provision for the Minister to make arrangements to provide for the settlement of claims in respect of general and special damages; provision for a claimant to compel a witness to attend and give evidence; provision for a claimant's right to discover documents; provision for the tribunal to sit in divisions to hear claims, that is, more than one tribunal can hear cases simultaneously; provision for a dependant of a person who has died as a result of having contracted hepatitis C or whose hepatitis C was a significant contributory factor to the cause of death to make a claim to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work of the four representative groups and thank them for their assistance which has significantly contributed to the expeditious preparation of the Bill.  They played a major role by their attendance at numerous meetings with, and the submissions they made to, my Department.  I also thank Mr. Justice Seamus Egan, chairman of the tribunal, for his contribution to the consultation process on the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> I turn now to the detailed provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the interpretation section and defines the terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 is a standard provision which provides for the establishment day for the purposes of the Bill.  Section 3 provides for the establishment of the tribunal on a statutory basis.  It also provides that the tribunal may sit in divisions, for the appointment of members to the tribunal and for the appointment of employees.  It further provides for the compellabillity of witnesses and the discovery of documents by the tribunal on its own behalf or at the request of a claimant.  This provision is to meet a particular request of the representative groups.</P>
    <P>The section provides that the tribunal shall determine its own procedures and, in so doing, shall as far as is practicable adopt procedures which are informal.  The groups were anxious to ensure that the informality of the procedures of the non-statutory scheme, which has served its purpose very well, would be preserved.  The section further provides for hearings to be held in private and that written reports which the tribunal is primarily relying on will be made available to claimants.  The section precludes the cross-examination of any claimant.</P>
    <P>Section 4 defines the categories of persons who may make a claim for compensation to the tribunal and provides that negligence need not be proved by the claimant in respect of his or her claim for general and special damages.  It also provides for legal representation for the claimant at the tribunal and deals with the requirement that a claimant may have to compel witnesses or discover documents.  It extends from six months to three years the time limit within which a claimant can make an application to the tribunal.  This extension to the time limit was a requirement about which the representative groups expressed strong views.  The section also provides that a claim to the tribunal does not involve the waiver of any other right of action by the claimant.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for awards in respect of aggravated or exemplary damages.  It provides that an award of the tribunal to a claimant shall be made on the same basis as an award of the High Court calculated by reference to the principles which govern the measure of damages in the law of tort and any relevant statutory provisions and including consideration of an award on the basis which reflects the principles of aggravated or exemplary damages.  This section also provides that an appeal shall lie to the High Court by a claimant in respect of any decision made by the tribunal and such appeal may, if the claimant wishes, be heard in private.  Both of these provisions meet key requirements of the groups.</P>
    <P>The section provides for the making of a provisional award which heretofore has not been available under Irish law.  This gives the claimant the right to return to the tribunal in a situation where her or his hepatitis C condition has deteriorated.  While this provision is a feature of the non-statutory scheme, the payment of a provisional award is at the discretion of the non-statutory <Col N="278" /> tribunal.  The groups requested that a claimant should have the absolute right to a provisional award if she or he so requested an award on that basis, and I am now providing for this in the Bill.  The section also provides for the period within which a claimant must accept an award and that, if the claimant so chooses, the tribunal may direct that the award be paid in instalments. In addition, it provides that reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the claimant will be awarded by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the dissolution of the non-statutory tribunal on the establishment of the statutory scheme.  It also provides that the tribunal may hear evidence of a claimant which was not available to the non-statutory tribunal in calculating that claimant's award and also that such claimants may apply to the tribunal for aggravated or exemplary damages or for an amount to be paid to her or him from the reparation fund.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a general provision which empowers the Minister to make regulations. Section 8 provides that the Minister may make arrangements for the settlement of a claim in respect of general and special damages by a claimant.  The Government has decided that mechanisms for settling claims be devised in co-operation with the Attorney General and this will be facilitated by the provisions of section 8. Section 9 provides that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by regulations extend the class or classes of persons who may make a claim for compensation before the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the establishment of a special account, to be funded from moneys provided by the Oireachtas, to be used to pay awards made by the tribunal, statutory and non-statutory, and to pay their administration costs.  A supplementary estimate provided for £60 million under the Appropriation Act, 1995.  A further £50 million will be included in the Estimates for 1997. Section 11 provides for the establishment of a reparation fund to enable payments to be made to claimants as an alternative to applying to the statutory tribunal to assess aggravated or exemplary damages.  The amount paid out of the fund to a claimant will amount to 20 per cent of the total amount of the award of general and-or special damages or 20 per cent of the settlement of a claim.  The fund will contain £22 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the submission of reports by the tribunal to the Minister and the laying of these reports before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 13 is a standard provision which deals with the laying of regulations made by the Minister under the Bill before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 14 is a standard provision dealing with the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill.  Section 15 provides for the Short Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A small number of amendments to the Bill have been suggested by the representative groups and the Opposition.  These amendments are being <Col N="279" /> actively considered and I will, as far as possible, take account of them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to update the House on the non-statutory compensation scheme.  To date it has received 1,686 applications, of which 1,530 are primary claimants, 87 are dependants and 69 are carers.  Since it commenced hearings in January 1996 &mdash; regular hearings commenced in March 1996 &mdash; it has made 326 lump sum and provisional awards, while no award was made in two cases.  No award of the tribunal has been rejected.  Further hearings have been scheduled up to end 1997, with further claims awaiting hearing beyond that date.</P>
    <P>In order to reduce the waiting period for a hearing at the tribunal the Government has decided to expand the tribunal to include a second division.  In this regard, I have recently appointed two additional ordinary members to the tribunal.  As already stated, the Bill provides that the tribunal may sit in divisions to hear claims before it.  The Government has also decided that mechanisms for settling claims be devised in co-operation with the Attorney General and this will be facilitated by the provisions in section 8.  I have always believed that claimants should have speedy access to the tribunal and these measures will undoubtedly reduce the waiting period for hearings.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the awards made to date is approximately £38 million, excluding administrative and legal costs.  The average amount of awards made to date is £116,481.19, while the awards have ranged from £15,200 to £453,904.  A claimant to whom an award is made is entitled to the legal costs and expenses associated with the claim.</P>
    <P>I thank the officials of my Department who have worked tirelessly on all matters in relation to this issue.  I very much appreciate their hard work.  The priority over the past four-five weeks of the small section of my Department which has the expertise to deal with these issues has been the legislation which is before the House tonight. They and the staff of the Attorney General's office and the parliamentary draftsman's office, who have assisted them, are to be commended.  I am confident that the Opposition parties will co-operate in ensuring the speedy passage of this Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been sought for a long time and is to be welcomed.  Its introduction has meant the Minister for Health has had to do a head stand on endless somersaults.  He has been opposed for more than two years to a statutory tribunal.  In bringing the Bill before the House the Government has made a significant concession.  It has conceded something which, as a matter of policy and principle, it refused to concede since this débâcle began under the stewardship of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin.  The Bill is a major victory for the victims who have had to suffer as a result of the criminal negligence <Col N="280" /> of a State agency.  However, it is not a proactive, generous response by this Government.  Even at the Finlay tribunal, Minister Noonan was still denying the granting of a statutory tribunal and said there that, as a matter of policy, he would not concede it.  The statutory tribunal has been dragged out of him as every other concession has had to be dragged out of this Government.</P>
      <P>The hepatitis C victims first sought a statutory tribunal in November 1995 as they believed it was the only way the complex issues involved could be satisfactorily dealt with.  Positive Action drafted its own Bill for a statutory tribunal and, even though the work was done for him, the Minister refused to accept it.  He denied them one of their fundamental requests for more than two years.</P>
      <P>From the outset, Fianna Fáil favoured a statutory tribunal.  We recognised that this route was the best one and we have been calling for it since the end of 1995.  We went so far as to draft our own Private Members' Bill to provide for a statutory tribunal.  However, due to the rules of the Dáil we, as an Opposition party, are not entitled to bring forward legislation that would put a charge on the Exchequer.  We were then left with a toothless Bill so we sought to raise the matter during six different Private Members' debates, by way of priority questions, through debates on the Adjournment and other political devices.  On each occasion the matter was voted down by the Government parties who are now presenting this statutory tribunal Bill.</P>
      <P>Minister Noonan established an <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal despite the opposition of victims and the promise in the rainbow coalition's programme for Government to pay fair compensation. He unilaterally announced a scheme of compensation while he was still in negotiations with the victims.  At the time he made that announcement, he never mentioned health care which was and remains a primary consideration of victims.  The Minister continues to believe that this was all about money and lawyers.  It was a flawed belief on his part and explains much of his mishandling of the affair.</P>
      <P>The compensation scheme continues to fail a fairness test on many counts but the Minister has resisted, despite numerous Dáil debates and calls from victims to make any substantive changes. This Bill at last delivers on the promise in the programme for Government to pay fair compensation, but it is only happening now, over two years and four months on, in the dying days of this administration.</P>
      <P>The hepatitis C victims are well used to Minister Noonan's failure, or slowness, to deliver. They remember many commitments that have not been honoured.  They remember his promise to consult them before publishing the health care Bill for hepatitis C &mdash; that never happened.  They also remember that he announced the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal while he was in the middle of negotiations with them on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill, Fianna Fáil nevertheless <Col N="281" /> has some concerns.  Section 4 states that those who may make a claim for compensation to the tribunal include persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C resulting from the use of human immunoglobulin anti-D &ldquo;within the State&rdquo;.  The scheme which was originally published did not confine the giving of compensation to persons who had become infected within the State only.  This was added in at a later stage to the scheme which currently operates.  That is repeated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>At meetings with the Department of Health it has been pointed out by victims that there are circumstances where an individual can be and has been sent abroad for treatment due to the fact that the necessary medical facilities were not available at a particular time in this jurisdiction. This could be for reasons of lack of finance, expertise or facilities resulting in a long waiting list.  There is one specific case of which I am aware.  It relates to a man who was sent to England for bone marrow treatment in the course of which he received an infected blood product. He was referred by the Mater Hospital and his expenses were paid by the Eastern Health Board. He had no choice in the matter and no say as to where he would be treated.  This individual, who suffers from the virus and whose condition is well advanced, has the hepatitis C medical card and is entitled to all of the services to which hepatitis C infected persons are entitled.  However, because he received his treatment in a foreign jurisdiction at the behest of the State, he is now wholly excluded from any possibility of receiving compensation. There are few people in this category and circumstances such as this should be provided for.  I will be proposing an amendment to provide for this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One of the constants in this affair has been the Minister for Health's use of legal manoeuvring to short-change victims.  We have seen this in the McCole case and again recently in relation to the admission of liability.  It is also apparent in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Section 4(14) provides that an application may be made to the tribunal within three years from the date upon which a claimant is diagnosed positive for hepatitis C or within a period of three years from the date when the claimant first became aware of the fact that he or she had been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C.  We see no reason why a somewhat different wording than that already included in the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991 should be included in this Bill, possibly giving rise to a different interpretation in hepatitis C cases and those to which the 1991 Act applies.</P>
    <P>In section 4(15) there is a provision for the extension of time where a person suffers from a legal disability such as being under-age or of unsound mind.  The normal provision under the statute of limitations is that, where a person is injured or entitled to sue in some respect and is a minor at the time the right of action arises, the limitation period provided by law only begins <Col N="282" /> from the date upon which that person attains majority.  In other words, if a person under 18 years of age is injured, the three year period within which proceedings must be issued if personal injury is suffered begins only from the date the person attains 18 years.  Under section 4(16), such persons only have six months in which to claim.  This is at variance with the general principles which should apply and I will be putting forward amendments to deal with both these anomalies.</P>
    <P>When the heads of the Bill were first circulated some weeks ago, Fianna Fáil was concerned that Minister Noonan was attempting to limit the scope of awards for aggravated damages to only some categories of victims.  This arose because of the reference in the draft documents only to the Finlay tribunal.  This has improved somewhat in the Bill but there is still no reference to the upcoming tribunal to investigate HIV, haemophilia, renal and transfusee issues.  The Finlay tribunal solely investigated matters relating to anti-D. I will be proposing that section 4(13) should include a reference to any other tribunal of inquiry into the BTSB.</P>
    <P>Section 5(17) deals with the situation where a person wishes to appeal against a ruling of the tribunal.  Strangely, it requires that the claimant must agree to waive any right of action which the claimant might have against any party, and to discontinue any other proceedings.  The norm in all of these cases is that High Court proceedings are issued on behalf of the claimant and an application is also made to the tribunal.  This facilitates cases where not only are proceedings issued as soon as possible to ensure the person is not outside the limitation period, but where an individual might be able to prove a case in the High Court, that individual would then have the choice of either going to the tribunal, accepting or rejecting the award and, if rejecting it, maintaining a case in the High Court.</P>
    <P>The appeal introduced in this Bill against an award of the tribunal is not equivalent to taking a High Court action.  It is merely an appeal against the ruling by the tribunal, whether as to amount or entitlement.  In law and in substance, it is the tribunal award which is being appealed to the High Court, and it is not a court action of any nature which is being submitted to the High Court for review.</P>
    <P>We see no logic in requiring a person to waive any other proceedings pending just because that person wishes to appeal an award of the tribunal. It would be better to have a wording which provides for situations where, if a person accepts the outcome of the appeal to the High Court against the award of the tribunal, that person discontinues any High Court action but is at liberty not to accept the outcome of the High Court appeal and to continue any court proceedings he or she might wish to take.  I will propose an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify if the Bill provides for the payment of legal costs in respect of High <Col N="283" /> Court appeals.  This does not appear to be included in the Bill.  Section 5(4) provides that where the tribunal makes an award, it shall award any reasonable costs and expenses.  Strangely, there is no provision to provide for any award of costs upon appeal.</P>
    <P>It has also been a concern of transfusees, where their medical records are destroyed or where donors have not returned since 1 October 1991 when testing was introduced, that they are not in a position to prove in the normal fashion that they positively received an infected blood product or an infected transfusion.  This is something about which Transfusion Positive lobbied extensively before the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal began its hearings.  The <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal has worked in a satisfactory manner to date for transfusion victims in relation to the manner in which the standard of proof is applied, that is, the balance of probability.  I am concerned that the Bill might attempt to change this.  To ensure there will be no discrimination against this group of victims and no change in the manner in which that standard of proof must be administered when the Bill becomes law, I will propose an amendment to ensure the rights and benefits which have already been established for the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal cannot be diminished by the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the heads of the Bill, which were circulated some weeks ago, was clearly directed at creating an entitlement in those who had already been before the tribunal to &ldquo;the benefit of any adjustments to the compensation scheme provided for under this Bill&rdquo;.  Regrettably, section 6 does not reflect that and I will propose an amendment to address this matter also.  The Bill does not refer to persons who have died since the termination of their claim before the tribunal.  It is necessary to include a provision for a personal representative to be able to hold powers under section 6 in the instance of such a death.</P>
    <P>This side of the House will co-operate in the passing of the Bill.  It is important to deal with Committee Stage as the aims and objectives of a statutory compensation tribunal were articulated during the many debates in the House while the controversy raged.  Now a Bill is before the House with whose aims and objectives one would agree since it seeks to address many of the issues raised by the representative groups concerned.  On Committee Stage we must ensure all angles are covered and no anomalies are left open in the transition from an <i>ad hoc</i> to a statutory compensation tribunal.  In a number of amendments there is the prospect of further generosity on the part of the Minister and the Government in seeking to address particular matters for a limited category of persons who are suffering to the same degree as those who are obviously covered by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Its provisions are largely satisfactory to the victims' representative groups.  It is helpful that there was <Col N="284" /> plenty of consultation with those groups before drafting the Bill.  Some technical amendments are required and they have been communicated to the Minister by the groups concerned.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents yet another step in what has become a tortuous trek towards justice for the victims of a major public health scandal.  The compensation tribunal is to be established on a statutory basis and the victims will be entitled to an award of aggravated or exemplary damages, with provision for appeal to the High Court. These objectives have been sought for a long time by the persons concerned and have been advocated by the Opposition on many occasion.  This latest concession gives effect to the long-standing wish of the people concerned and their families to have the tribunal established on a statutory basis. Sadly, it has been a feature of this Administration's handling of the matter that all concessions have been wrung from it and we have not seen a generosity which derived from the Government's own sense of moral or legal responsibility to the victims.  It has been a long journey to this point for all concerned.</P>
      <P>This is the Administration which, despite its denials, has collective political responsibility for directing the legal strategy whose aim was to intimidate, frighten and wear down the unfortunate women who were simply seeking justice and the truth.  It is remarkable that the Government still seeks to avoid taking political responsibility for that strategy.  I accept that members of the Government parties have great sympathy for the McCole family.  However, the legal advice which was given to the Government over a long period of time was politically naive and that is why the Minister and the Government are so politically embarrassed by this affair.</P>
      <P>The legal strategy was a major contributor to the grievance of the women, particularly the late Mrs. McCole.  It is a significant element of the claim for aggravated damages.  Yet the legal strategy and its impropriety and cruelty to the victims was deliberately excluded from the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry.  As a result of its exclusion, the chairman of the tribunal was able to use the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; to describe the actions of the Ministers concerned.  There is no doubt that had the tribunal been apprised of the conduct of the defence and the battle engineered by the State through its legal teams against the women, the judge's finding would have been scathing about the people who had political responsibility for authorising it.</P>
      <P>When the Finlay tribunal was established I suspected there was a danger that the political responsibility of Ministers would be shelved or buried or specifically excluded from the terms of reference.  I had earlier anticipated that the role of the Ministers would be examined in great detail under the terms of reference and I believed the Official Report would be scrutinised and conclusions drawn about how the Dáil was obstructed by the evasion of parliamentary questions. However, no such analysis took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> There was no coherent or satisfactory trawl of the Official Report for the progression of the matter through the Dáil.  The Ministers would not have emerged from a review of their conduct in that regard with flying colours.</P>
    <P>At the time of the establishment of the tribunal, the Minister said he would account separately to the tribunal and the Dáil.  However, this appears to have been an empty and hollow statement. When I asked the Minister in October 1996, before the tribunal's terms of reference were announced and debated in the Dáil, if he expected the establishment of the tribunal to mark the end of his being questioned about the matter, he said that would not be the case.  When I put it to him that it suited him to transfer the matter from the political arena to the tribunal, he denied it.  We now know that political responsibility for the legal strategy has been avoided.  It was filleted from the tribunal's terms of reference and we have not had full accountability to Dáil Éireann either.  It is bad enough that the tribunal's terms of reference ensured that the strategy would not be reviewed, but the Dáil has now been thwarted in that regard as well.  This was made clear by a unconvincing letter last week from the Chief State Solicitor representing himself and the Attorney General to the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  That committee had unanimously sought an account of the legal strategy.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising this Administration would seek to avoid political responsibility for that strategy. It is politically indefensible.  The same harshness which motivated that strategy was revealed in the Minister's carefully scripted statement to the House on 16 October 1996 when he asked if Mrs. McCole's solicitors, in selecting a test case from the hundreds of hepatitis C cases on their books, could not have selected a plaintiff in a better condition to sustain the stress of a High Court case.  These words and others, for which the Minister was later forced to apologise, indicate and convey the coldness which lay behind the State's attitude not merely to the late Mrs. McCole but to all hepatitis C sufferers.  If, as the Minister clearly wished, a healthier woman had chosen to fight the Minister through the courts, there would have been no tribunal of inquiry, no admission of liability, no statutory compensation tribunal and none of the political embarrassment which the Minister and the Government are now suffering.</P>
    <P>From the beginning the State presented to the victims a cold and emotionally bankrupt face.  In court or across the table when, with great difficulty, the women negotiated, the attitude of the State was minimalist and begrudging.  The women were treated as a cohort, referred to by batch numbers, questioned about their lifestyles, badgered about medical bills.  They were cajoled into the compensation tribunal which, against their wishes, was not statutory.  They were urged to accept <i>ex gratia</i> payments rather than the aggravated damages to which they were entitled.  They were denied an extension of the closing date for <Col N="286" /> receipt of applications, and they were threatened with the full defence of any court action.  The late Bridget McCole was bullied until her death to accept damages with no admission of liability. Even when liability was conceded in her case, there was no apology or admission of liability for the other women victims.</P>
    <P>One woman, whose case is pending, has been treated in similar fashion.  She refused to go to the tribunal.  She refused a medical card and demanded private treatment of her choice outside this jurisdiction, so devastated is her confidence and respect for this jurisdiction by the manner in which the State treated her as an injured citizen.  She had to go to court to get her records. She has had to harry officials to pay her bills for medical treatment abroad.  The State also refused her anonymity as it did the late Bridget McCole. Her prognosis is not good; time is not on her side.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister said that, generally, there was satisfaction with the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal among most persons who appeared before it, the transcript of one case before it showed that a certain amount of nit-picking went on regarding, for example, pharmacy bills and the amount of money that would be awarded for home help.  I found it embarrassing to read because there was a certain lack of generosity in the manner in which certain bills were being scrutinised and questioned as to their legitimacy.  The chairman was most anxious throughout to avoid any discussion of punitive damages or liability, precluded as he was by the terms of reference of the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal. When counsel for one of six women, first infected in 1977, put it on the record that the BTSB had been informed about this woman's infection in 1977 by her medical consultants, the chairman was quick to excise that line of evidence. Responding to a statement by Mr. Rogers for the woman that her complaint and the source of her complaint was adverted to and brought to the attention of the BTSB, that her infection was related to anti-D and this was something which the chairman should take into account in the woman's case, the chairman retorted: &ldquo;Not by us. Are we back to punitive damages now?  Under our scheme we cannot deal with that aspect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This telling exchange took place on 12 September 1996 before the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal.</P>
    <P>Crucial to the argument for aggravated damages is the disgraceful behaviour of the wrongdoer in this scandal.  In 1991 the Supreme Court described aggravated damages as follows: Compensatory damages increased by reason of (1) the manner in which the wrong was committed involving such elements as oppressiveness, arrogance or outrage; (2) the conduct of the wrongdoer after the commission of the wrong, such as a refusal to apologise or to ameliorate the harm done and the making of threats to repeat the wrong; or (3) conduct of the wrongdoer and-or his representative in the defence of the claim of the wronged plaintiff up to and including the trial of the action.  The terms &ldquo;aggravated&rdquo;, &ldquo;exemplary&rdquo; or &ldquo;punitive&rdquo; are interchangeable and <Col N="287" /> derive from the nature of the wrong committed and-or the manner of its commission, which are intended to mark the court's disapproval of the defendant's conduct in all the circumstances of the case and its decision that it should be publicly seen to have punished the defendant for such conduct by awarding such damages, apart from its obligation where it may exist in the same case to compensate the plaintiff for the damage.</P>
    <P>It is truly amazing, given the facts revealed in the tribunal, that the Government has held out so long against permitting an award of aggravated damages.  How could the State, the BTSB or anybody else concerened in this matter have a leg to stand on in the light of the following: the knowing use of plasma from a donor who had infective hepatitis to make anti-D and the continuing use of anti-D even after six women became jaundiced in 1977 as a result of receiving anti-D; the ignoring of the 1991 Middlesex letter which confirmed the link between anti-D and hepatitis C; the failure to report that fact to the Department of Health until 1994; the failure to tell donors who tion; and the giving of misleading information to an expert group established by the Minister to examine the whole matter.</P>
    <P>Added to this disgraceful and culpable behaviour, the victims had to endure the hardball legal strategy employed by various State legal teams in defending their claim.  The manner in which a defendant presents a case in any court case can be the subject of an award for aggravated damages. However, even when this statutory tribunal is considering an application, for example, by the McCole family for aggravated or exemplary damages, it seems it will be precluded from considering the State's legal strategy in their mother's case.  Compensatory damages is what the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal offered.  The reason the late Mrs. McCole was so determined right up to the end was that a finding of aggravated or exemplary damages in her case would have marked the court's and the people's disapproval of the defendant's conduct in all the circumstances of this dreadful case. Unfortunately, Mrs. McCole died with the threat ringing in her ears that if she pursued her claim for aggravated damages her family would be penalised by the costs.  It is truly ironic that the person who brought this whole affair out into the open and ultimately succeeded in wrenching this final concession of aggravated damages from the State for other victims was herself denied aggravated damages.</P>
    <P>The difference between compensatory damages and aggravated damages is that aggravated damages implies an element of culpability way beyond that of mistake.  Such culpability can arise from one individual's acts or omissions or from the collective acts or omissions of a State authority or of various State bodies or the State itself. Conveniently, the Finlay tribunal was not asked to review the strategy adopted by the State or the BTSB in the courts against the late Bridget <Col N="288" /> McCole.  There was cherry-picking of the open letter by the family of the late Bridget McCole of 20 September 1996.  The McCole family sought an answer as to why the BTSB had threatened their mother with costs if she pursued her claim for aggravated damages.  They made public the harsh, narrow, threatening and intimidating terms on which a settlement was offered to them.  The tribunal was not asked to explain this strategy.  The Minister will not account for it, although the relatives of Mrs. McCole still require an explanation.</P>
    <P>Similarly another victim, whose case is pending, is being threatened with costs by the NDAB if she pursues her claim for aggravated damages against them.  It would appear those women who exercise their constitutional right to have their cases heard before the courts are being treated less favourably than those who go before the tribunal. Those who go to the tribunal at least have the dignity of anonymity, a dignity denied to those who opted to go to court.</P>
    <P>The same hardball was played with the Positive Action women when they were being cajoled to go to the <i>ad hoc</i> compensation tribunal.  A letter of 21 July from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor warned of the &ldquo;uncertainties, delays, stresses, confrontation and costs involved in High Court litigation&rdquo; and stated that &ldquo;should they pursue litigation it would be fully defended by the State, if necessary to the Supreme Court&rdquo;.  These threatening terms were used when the State and the Minister knew full well, since 1995, that there was no defence to the action.</P>
    <P>One has lost count to the Dáil debates &mdash; Deputy Cowen said this is the thirtieth debate.  It has been a most traumatic, frustrating, parliamentary exercise for everybody concerned.  The women and their families who have been central to the exposure of this scandal, many of whom are sick and traumatised as a result of being so badly treated by the State and its agencies who did the original wrong to them, have had to endure a very long trek towards justice.  Heaped on top of the original wrong was what turned out to be a cover-up of the events.  It is no thanks to the BTSB that there are not 60,000 women infected with hepatitis C.  Sixty thousand women were screened, but many have not been screened. Some infections may be dormant, or transient, or may have cleared.  We know that 1,600 women are infected.  Testing is continuing.  I am informed that some women are confused because they are not being informed as to why they are being retested.  Has the Minister been informed the BTSB is testing women who are presenting with another strain of hepatitis, called hepatitis G, or whether there is a possible link between hepatitis G and anti-D manufactured by the BTSB?  It appears some women have live disease but are not testing positive for hepatitis C.  The haemophiliacs and those infected by blood transfusions await justice.  The scale of the wrong is almost too great to contemplate and it may not be over yet. One of the disadvantages of a group or class <Col N="289" /> approach to this matter is that the stories of individual women have not been told.</P>
    <P>Calls for a tribunal of inquiry were stoutly rejected until one woman died and the full facts were revealed by her case.  The public realised the scale of the scandal only when they saw the thin, pale and agonised face of the late Brigid McCole and her beautiful daughters on our television screens, when a public letter sent to the Minister and the legal strategy was exposed.  The documents discovered in one case were the key to the solution of all cases.  In many ways it was a triumph for individual human rights in that one case which provided the key to vindicating the rights of all the other victims.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill aggravated damages can be obtained in one of two ways.  The victim can attempt to establish a legal entitlement to such a claim before the tribunal or can have her or his award for general damages topped up by 20 per cent from the reparation fund established under section 11 without having to prove that aspect of the claim.  It appears from section 11(5) that a victim who has a claim for aggravated damages turned down by the tribunal can still opt for the 20 per cent top up from the reparation fund, but a victim who is awarded aggravated or exemplary damages cannot opt for the reparation fund if the award from the tribunal is less than 20 per cent. I fail to understand the basis for this distinction. Will the Minister elaborate on this on Committee Stage?</P>
    <P>It is obvious the Government does not like people referring to the McCole family.  Given all that has happened, surely this Bill must also be judged on what it does for the McCole family.  By way of the BTSB, the State has paid £175,000 for the death of the late Mrs. McCole.  Under this Bill it appears the McCole family will be able to apply to the tribunal for £20,000 for injury or mental distress to share between them.  They may also be able to apply for a financial loss or expense as a direct result of providing care for Mrs. McCole. They can also apply to the top up fund for an extra 20 per cent of these amounts, not 20 per cent of the £175,000 paid to their mother.  That is not a great amount of money, but of course no money could compensate for the loss of a beloved mother in such circumstances.  Alternatively, they can apply to the tribunal for aggravated or exemplary damages.  One of the factors a court takes into account in deciding whether to award aggravated or exemplary damages is the conduct of the wrongdoer or his or her representatives in the defence of the claim.  However, the only claim before the tribunal will be the application for compensation.  It appears the conduct of the Minister and the State agencies in court proceedings will be excluded from the terms of the compensation tribunal just as the Minister and this Administration sought to exclude them from everything else.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that a victim who claims aggravated damages from the tribunal rather than from the reparation fund will still have to establish <Col N="290" /> negligence.  Even at this stage &mdash; I may be wrong in this observation &mdash; the Minister is not prepared to concede that the BTSB was negligent. Section 5(6) allows the tribunal to make a provisional award where there is a possibility that a claimant may suffer particularly serious consequences in the future.  If those consequences occur the victim may go back to the tribunal. However, there will be no element of aggravated or exemplary damages if such serious consequences occur.</P>
    <P>One of the many criticisms of the State in the McCole case was the running of the statute of limitations defence.  Although section 5(13) stops the clock running for the period between the start and finish of an application to the tribunal, it keeps alive the possibility of that defence in respect of time which elapsed between the infection and the application to the tribunal.  Section 5 also introduces the possibility of an appeal to the High Court from the tribunal.  A number of points arise in that regard.  The Bill does not make it clear how the appeal will work.  There are essentially two possibilities.  The entire case, including the evidence, can be heard again or the High Court will simply review a transcript of the evidence heard by the tribunal and rather than make its own findings of fact confine itself to asking whether there was evidence to justify the finding of the tribunal.  The first approach would probably be more satisfactory.  Perhaps the Minister would refer to that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>If a claimant wishes to appeal against the finding of the tribunal, section 5(17) appears to require that she or he must waive their right to legal proceedings before making the appeal.  This is fair enough if the appeal to the High Court includes the hearing of evidence but if it is conducted in a more restricted way the claimant is being asked to sign away his or her right of appeal without being given a full court hearing.  Where a claimant appeals, the Minister is to be allowed to cross-appeal such an appeal.  However, the Minister will be allowed to appeal an award of aggravated or exemplary damages irrespective of whether the claimant has appealed.  The Minister's obsession with aggravated damages continues. Why has he given himself a right to initiate an appeal against aggravated damages when his right to appeal an award of general damages is far more restricted?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen raised many other issues and there will be a further opportunity on Committee Stage to deal with the fine print of the Bill.  I warmly welcome the Bill which has been a long time coming.  There has been a great deal of aggravation and stress in bringing this matter to this conclusion.</P>

      <P>It has been a protracted battle to ensure the Bill arrived before the House tonight.  For more than two years the Government denied the need to set up a statutory tribunal. This is a major victory for the victims of hepatitis C as their right to compensation for the <Col N="291" /> suffering, pain and insecurity has at last been recognised by the Government.  It has failed to understand the trauma hepatitis C has caused the victims and their families and the pain will continue. It must ensure there is no further delay caused by the lack of personnel to deliver.  As outlined by Deputy Cowen, the speed of the statutory tribunal is essential.</P>
      <P>For more than two years and four months Fianna Fáil has recognised the immediate need for a statutory tribunal.  It called on the Government to set up such a tribunal during Question Time, six Private Members' debates and other motions in the House.  Positive Action deserves to see the fruits of its action in the presentation of this Bill tonight.  Since its initiation it has been clear, fair and more than responsible in debate. Because of the gravity and sadness of the matter, it must have been very tempting to become emotional, but Positive Action did not give in to such emotion.  I commend it for its professionalism over a long and arduous fight since the victims first sought a statutory tribunal in November 1995.  It is a shame the Government resisted and denied this fundamental request for more than two years.  It failed to have real consultation with Positive Action and issues relating to HIV, haemophiliacs and transfusees were not allowed before the Finlay tribunal.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has certain reservations about the Bill.  It is concerned about section 4 and the fact that compensation will be confined to persons who have been infected within the State only. The section on the statute of limitations should be extended to include hepatitis C victims.  Many will view this Bill with legitimate concern as there is no reference in it to the upcoming tribunal to investigate HIV, haemophiliac, renal and transfusion issues.  The Finlay tribunal investigated matters solely related to anti-D.  Our spokesman is also recommending changes to that part of the Bill.  The issue of appealing an award of the tribunal needs further teasing out.</P>
      <P>What will happen in regard to compensation made to persons who have since died and what about compensation for families of deceased victims? I deeply regret that the Minister for Health and the Government did not deliver on this legislation a long time ago.  The admission by the Government that such a statutory tribunal was the way forward two years ago would have lessened much of the anguish suffered by victims and their families to date.  Why has the Government to be dragged kicking and screaming into the House to finally admit to the need for such legislation? Could it not have seen the need for such action at an earlier stage?  It gives me no pleasure to say that the Government viewed its stubbornness as a show of strength rather than an admission of weakness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I hope this substantial Bill will go a long way to address the issue.  Like other Members I welcome the Bill although we have difficulties with it and would like to table amendments. <Col N="292" /> I look forward to hearing Deputy Cowen and other Members discussing it on Committee and Report Stages.  This issue should have been dealt with many years ago.  All I can do at this stage is wish well to all those who campaigned for this legislation for so long under difficult and emotional circumstances.  I commend Positive Action especially for its brave attempt to ensure these unfortunate women, in particular, have had their voices heard here.</P>

      <P>Brigid McCole was given an injection in 1977 that was meant to save the life of her baby, but in fact was the cause of her death 18 years later.  We have heard from Mrs. McCole's daughter of her mother's suffering during those years.  The media and the population in general used words such as &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; and &ldquo;travesty&rdquo; to describe her case.  As with the other cases of hepatitis C, after all we have heard in the past few months, those words seem totally inadequate. The picture that has emerged is not one of tragic scientific mistakes about a relatively new condition, but of revelations that have shocked the scientific and medical world.  Unfortunately for Brigid McCole, it appears the scientific facts concerning her case were known to the BTSB before she received her injection.</P>
      <P>If we analyse the evidence to date and put it in a simplified form, it will show that a doctor identified the source of infection of one of his patients as an injection of anti-D and informed the BTSB, as did another consultant who wrote to him confirming that case later.  That letter from the consultant was dated 4 October 1977.  Brigid McCole received her injection on 5 November 1977. Those who followed the tribunal will note that in July of that year the BTSB received at least seven reports of severe hepatitis in women who received anti-D, five months before Brigid McCole received her lethal injection.  In that same month the BTSB knew precisely, as we have now discovered, where to look for the source of that infection, batches of anti-D from who was then known as patient X.  I have a great deal of compassion for patient X because before the tribunal she was known as donor X.  It has emerged since that neither she nor her doctor knew her plasma was being used to manufacture anti-D, nor did the BTSB have consent to use her plasma.  Why did the BTSB use plasma from such a patient? More importantly, at that time an extraordinary decision was made by the BTSB.  It took a decision to stop using that plasma to manufacture any more anti-D but, unbelievably, it decided to carry on using the anti-D that was already made. One of the batches made was batch 250 and on 5 November 1977 Brigid McCole received anti-D from that batch.  The quality of her life and the tragedy for her family over the next 18 years was determined by that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated previously, we all can forgive someone who makes a genuine error provided he or she, on realising his or her mistake, does everything possible to minimise the consequences.  I do <Col N="293" /> not intend to be in any way political and, as a doctor, I understand the Minister's dilemma.  We have not blamed him personally, but it is obvious from his demeanour that he is a very angry man at the manner in which this whole sorry saga has developed.  He has had his days in the sun in this portfolio, but the manner in which he is currently handling this tragic situation is not that of a compassionate Minister for Health which this tragedy deserves.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil pursued this issue through our previous spokesperson, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and now through our spokesperson, Deputy Cowen.  We have pursued it ruthlessly during the past two and a a half years and eventually the pieces of the jigsaw of justification are beginning to fit in slowly piece by piece.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from the Minister in December 1995 and one line that immediately caught my attention is that which described his proposed tribunal as one which &ldquo;will assess compensation on an ex gratia basis&rdquo; for the victims of the blood transfusion negligence.  It was in effect saying to those people &ldquo;we are not to blame, nobody is to blame, but here is a few quid out of the generosity of our hearts&rdquo;.  I asked at that time, if we were not leaving ourselves open to further legal action down the road.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that one of the subjects I addressed at that time and have addressed here on a number of occasions &mdash; I am glad Deputy Cowen included it in his speech and I hope the Minister will accept an amendment on it &mdash; is the appalling position in which families of a small number of hepatitis victims are left.  I refer to the case of one of my constituents, a 54 year old teacher who was a joint breadwinner in her family. She died in January 1996 before her case could be heard by the tribunal.  In the week she died the tribunal met specially and settled compensation with the families of two other victims who were on the point of death.  In the case to which I refer the family is entitled to only £7,500. If she had survived a little longer the story would have been different.  This family and a small number of others are the forgotten victims of this sorry saga.  There are not more than ten or twelve such cases in which grief, stress and trauma have been the order of the day.  The Minister has not addressed this issue at all.  These families are entitled to full and fair compensation in exactly the same way as the other victims.</P>
    <P>That some victims died sooner than others should not be used as a method of prudent bookkeeping. The Leader of my party handed over a thriving economy to this Government less than two and a half years ago.  As a result, we can well afford to give fair play to all these people.  The extra amount due to this small group would certainly not bankrupt the State.  If I were a cynic I would be expected to suggest that if they constituted a larger number of voters, the necessary funds would be found like magic.</P>
    <P>When the full story of the hepatitis C scandal is documented, future generations will find it <Col N="294" /> inconceivable that such a thing could have happened in the late 20th century.  Possibly the worst aspect of the matter was that the initial scandal was compounded by subsequent disgraceful cover-ups by various authorities, including the Minister, lest any blame should attach to them. The sad part is that there was absolutely no need for them to become so paranoid.  Nobody on this side of the House, or outside the House, suggested the Minister or his predecessors were to blame for what happened at the BTSB.</P>
    <P>On 13 December 1995, I contributed to a debate on this matter.  I said then: &ldquo;Last night the Minister was angry when he made the point that he personally was not responsible for what happened some years ago...&rdquo; No one on this side is suggesting that he was responsible.  I am certain the Minister, as an individual, is as genuinely concerned for those people as anyone could be.  The trouble is that by his own admission, he is at the mercy of the accountants in the Department of Finance.  I wish the Minister would have the courage to tell them we are not dealing here with an ordinary piece of accounting which must add up to a certain figure; we are dealing with people whose health has been ravaged through no fault of their own and who must be compensated properly, regardless of the cost.  If the Minister could have been seen to address the problem in that manner, I would have assured him, as Deputy Cowen would, that nobody on this side of the House would use that necessary expenditure as a stick with which to beat the Government at budget time.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that as well as over 1,000 people suffering from the infected anti-D, there are other victims &mdash; men and women &mdash; who contracted hepatitis C through blood transfusions, people with haemophilia, kidney illnesses, transplants and so on.</P>
    <P>Transplant patients have the added problem that, because of anti-rejection drugs, they cannot be treated for hepatitis C with Interferon.  Their families are totally devastated.  In February 1996, I referred to a constituent of mine.  I am in regular contact with her family and know only too well the grief and trauma they suffer every time the hepatitis C matter is raised.  There are other bereaved families we should not forget, and to whom Deputy Cowen has referred, who have gone through trauma and suffering.  There is a large number of people whose death certificates do not reveal what they died from.  Those people, I realise with hindsight, died from hepatitis C or had their deaths expedited by it, and could have had that put on their death certificates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen raised the issues on which we will table amendments.  I am particularly concerned with the amendment which deals with capping awards.  The Minister might deal with that in his reply.  He should state clearly there will be no capping of the amounts of general damages awarded to dependents of those who died prior to having their cases heard by the tribunal.  The issue of compensation is determined by the Civil <Col N="295" /> Liability Act and a ceiling of £7,500 applies.  The Minister should consider this in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>Limerick East): I thank all Deputies who contributed to tonight's debate, particularly the Opposition spokespersons, Deputies O'Donnell and Cowen.</P>
      <P>In debating these issues, it is worth pointing out that the existing tribunal is working very well. Although we are working to establish a statutory tribunal, Deputies should appreciate that the present tribunal, with Judge Egan in the chair, has done an excellent job.  More than 300 applicants have had their cases dealt with satisfactorily. The proof of the pudding is how people deal with the awards made by the tribunal.  Not one applicant has refused an award.  That is a great tribute to Judge Egan and his personnel.</P>
      <P>The statutory tribunal will have features that will enhance the informal tribunal significantly. However, that informal tribunal has provided a non-contentious, non-adversarial avenue to many plaintiffs to have their claims processed speedily, satisfactorily and in total confidentiality.  Any Deputy who knows an applicant, or his or her legal representative, will know that tribunal is held in very high repute, not only by those who process claims, but by the groups that represent victims and by the legal profession.</P>
      <P>The demand has long been made for a statutory tribunal.  There are many reasons a statutory tribunal is more satisfactory for victims but a main plank in the case for a statutory tribunal is no reflection on the present tribunal, although some of its features are to be enhanced.  A reason was the need to ensure that subsequent administrations would not reverse what this administration has done.  The statutory basis would supposedly ensure that whatever about discontinuing an informal tribunal, the Government would not have the gall to come into the House and relegislate.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We will see.  I am glad we went through an extensive consultation process in bringing this Bill before the House.  I met representatives of the four groups and consulted the chairman of the compensation tribunal, on the reappraisal of the compensation scheme which arose from Judge Finlay's report.  The purpose of this consultative process was to ensure the Government's legislative proposals would take account of the views of the representative groups, and as far as possible, those views have been incorporated in the Bill.  We have included what could be done from a policy perspective.  The only things that have been excluded are matters which were legally impossible to include.  I am open to amendments.  We shall have a proper and full Committee Stage when I shall take into account not only those amendments which have been signalled by the interest groups &mdash; now that they <Col N="296" /> have seen the published text of the Bill &mdash; but also those tabled by Members of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined some amendments incorporated which make provisions significantly different from the tribunal now in place, including provision for aggravated and exemplary damages which can now be assessed by the compensation tribunal, when a claimant may rely on the facts found in the report of the tribunal of inquiry or any other fact in relation to their case for such damages; provision for establishing a reparation fund from 20 per cent of the general or special damages or 20 per cent of the settlement of a claim.  As Members will also be aware, I will be very interested to have a settlement procedure work in parallel with the tribunal so that, if people felt it was to their advantage, they could opt for settlement rather than a hearing.  Of course, dependent on the amount of the settlement, they could then make a free choice whether to accept the settlement.</P>
      <P>I do not want circumstances to arise in which a tribunal, statutory or otherwise, will have a waiting list longer than that of the High Court, with further frustrations being built up through people being unable to gain access.  I am approaching this in a number of ways: first, through significantly increasing the personnel of the tribunal.  I envisage Judge Egan continuing as overall chairperson. I foresee the tribunal meeting, in two divisions in parallel, thus doubling its throughput.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I have incorporated in this Bill a provision for settlement.  I had discussions with the Attorney General on how we might put the settlement process in place.  If we double the personnel of two divisions of the one tribunal &mdash; working simultaneously and in parallel &mdash; and have a mechanism for settlement, we can avoid foreseeable long delays as people process their claims or lodge their applications with the tribunal.</P>
      <P>There is already a delay, in that at present applicants cannot obtain a date for hearing of their case for two years.  That is not satisfactory &mdash; there is nothing magic about the long High Court waiting lists &mdash; but the statutory tribunal will fail in its primary objective if its waiting lists are longer than those of the High Court.  Why would one opt for the fast-track, confidential, easy way to obtain compensation if one can reach first phase faster by going to the High Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members should also be aware that it will cost an enormous amount, not of extra money but expenditure will be brought forward into the current year and 1998.  Before we agreed the establishment of the reparation fund the estimated total cost was approximately £200 million, to which 20 per cent can be added.  If that cost was spread over four or five financial years, one would obtain one result but, since we are also increasing the personnel of the tribunal and putting in place a mechanism for settlement, we are endeavouring to ensure that, whatever the compilation of the next Administration, regardless of whoever may be responsible for this portfolio, he <Col N="297" /> or she will not be faced in six or 12 months by a whole lot of very unhappy, frustrated people because the best efforts of this House would not have succeeded in gaining them speedy access to the compensation to which they are entitled and which will involve the procedures to which I referred.</P>
    <P>One of the amendments which makes the statutory scheme different from the non-statutory one is the provision for a claimant's right of appeal of any decision of the tribunal to the High Court. There is also a provision for a person who has had a claim for compensation determined by the non-statutory tribunal to apply to this tribunal to have evidence heard, at the discretion of the tribunal, which was not made available to the non-statutory tribunal in calculating the award made to that person.  There is also provision for the Minister to make arrangements to provide for a settlement of claims.</P>
    <P>There are some things that are virtually legally impossible to do, some things we cannot include because, even though the statutory tribunal is different from the courts, there is at times a difficulty at a level of general principle if something could be done within the tribunal which could not be done in the courts and which might give rise to much wider legislative provision.</P>
    <P>I will approach amendments tabled by Members of the Opposition in the spirit which was signalled this evening.  I know they want the best possible statutory compensation tribunal that can be devised and passed by this House tomorrow evening.  We will work together in an endeavour to improve the draft now before the House.</P>

      <P>My objective in raising this issue is to obtain some movement from the Minister and Government.  Indeed I regret that I have had to bring it to the floor of the House to highlight it <Col N="298" /> and obtain some solution, particularly in the interests of the students involved.</P>
      <P>The staff of UCD School of Diagnostic Imaging will not be providing summer examinations for any of its radiography students undertaking its four-year honours undergraduate degree this year.  This action is the culmination of a ten year dispute, aimed at establishing a transfer of the school from the auspices of the Department of Health to those of the Department of Education, thus introducing employment conditions and recognition of radiography lecturers equal to their university counterparts.  The first examination was due to be held on Friday, 25 April 1997.</P>
      <P>This school has seven teaching staff and an acting principal.  The staff undertakes the range of duties required of university staff and are listed in the university calendar.  Despite that, they are not employed as full university staff and cannot, therefore, attend faculty meetings, cannot vote in university elections or apply for occasional grants offered by the university to facilitate research.  In addition, the acting principal can attend faculty meetings only as an observer.</P>
      <P>To quote the United Kingdom model, teaching staff in all 28 radiography education centres there are employed as full university staff at lecturer or senior lecturer level.  It is paradoxical that here the staff of one of the foremost European teaching and research radiography institutions are not appropriately employed.  These circumstances have obtained since the UCD School of Diagnostic Imaging initiated the first radiography degree in Europe in 1987.  In the same year a firm commitment was given that the staff would be employed as university lecturers, which did not happen despite a number of additional assurances having been given.</P>
      <P>In 1995 staff informed UCD that, because of the circumstances continuing to prevail, they would not be taking up their positions of assistant examiners in the 1996 summer examinations which had been undertaken previously on the basis of good will.  This action was deferred in May 1996 following a written assurance that a decision was imminent but, by January 1997 no progress had been recorded.  On 3 February last the staff informed appropriate university personnel they would not be taking up their assistant examinership roles in the forthcoming 1997 summer examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resolution of this problem is dependent on documented evidence of a commitment to the transfer of the School of Diagnostic Imaging to the Department of Education within an acceptable timescale. The issue here is the transference of responsibility and management from the Department of Health to the Department of Education. My understanding is that the Department of Education has been dragging its feet for some time past and has been reluctant to assume responsibility for this school.  This is regrettable and it is a pity it should arise at this stage because it undermines the careers of the students involved. <Col N="299" /> This ongoing dispute is a cause of stress and worry for the students whose examinations have been disrupted.  When students' examinations have been disrupted, the Minister should move fast to endeavour to resolve the issue.  It is clear how this dispute can be resolved.  Will the Minister indicate when the School of Diagnostic Imaging, which is based in UCD, will come under the auspices of the Department of Education?  I would appreciate some news on this issue.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor my Department has any objection to transferring the schools of radiography at both St. Vincent's Hospital and St. Luke's-St.  Anne's Hospital to the Department of Education and the Higher Education Authority. A tripartite working group comprising officials of my Department and the Department of Education and chaired by the Higher Education Authority is currently examining the feasibility of the transfer of responsibilities.  The working group has met with representatives of Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin and has also visited both schools of radiography.</P>
      <P>The working group is confident of having its report finalised at the end of this month.  The report will then be submitted to both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education for consideration of its recommendations.  The Higher Education Authority recently advised both universities of the work schedule for the working group and it is hoped that this will facilitate the staff of both schools to participate in the examinations process.</P>

      <P>I thank you sincerely for allowing me to raise this life and death issue for two schools in South Tipperary &mdash; Shronnell and Newtown national schools.  These schools have been two teacher schools for a number of years. Unfortunately, in the past week they received notification from the Department of Education that each school will lose its assistant teacher resulting in Shronnell and Newtown national schools becoming one teacher schools.  The situation is devastating for the teachers, parents and the local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In each area the schools are the lifeblood of the community which do not have traditional local villages.  Many parents believe that once the schools are reduced to one teacher schools, it will be the beginning of the end.  From an educational point of view, this is a poor strategy.  It is unfair to expect a teacher to cope with seven different classes.  In September 1996 Newtown national school had 20 students on the roll, three students <Col N="300" /> short of the number required for two teachers. Because of that, the school was informed that it would lose its assistant.  Yet in September 1997, it will have the required number of 23 students. There is no logic in having a school with 23 students and one teacher when it will have the numbers in September 1997 for two teachers. Shronnell national school will be two students short of the required number.  Having one teacher schools is poor educational policy and it should be avoided.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to expect a teacher to be the only person in charge in the school.  We are living in an age when accusations are made and there is no other adult in the school to vindicate the teacher or to provide evidence if something serious happens.  I fear what would happen if the teacher got sick or had to leave the school suddenly for family reasons.  Who would take charge?</P>
    <P>From an educational point of view and that of the students, I ask the Minister for Education to seriously consider allowing these two schools to keep their assistant teachers.  If she accedes to this request, she will not only provide a better education for the students but will ensure the continuation of a vibrant rural community in these two areas.  Parents are not impressed with one teacher schools and will move their children to schools which are closer or to those in Tipperary town.  That will be the death-knell of the rural community.  The parents, teachers and the community plead with the Minister for Education to allow those two schools to retain their assistant teachers in September 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for allowing me to join her in expressing our concern.  Deputy Ahearn did not overstate the facts.  Although this Government reduced the pupil teacher ratio by three students in recent years, schools like Newtown and Shronnell national schools have slipped through the net and will find themselves with one teacher, which is unacceptable and inoperable.  It could be the death-knell not only of the school but of the community.</P>
      <P>These matters were raised with us in recent weeks by the teachers and parents because they were unaware of the figures decided on in September last year.  Parents face the dilemma of making arrangements to move all their children from the schools, which would lead to their closure, or awaiting a decision by the Department and the Minister.</P>
      <P>I had meetings with the Minister for Education in the past week on this subject and she asked that the schools, their boards of management and chairmen, and the teachers make a case in writing. I will present that case to the Minister tomorrow. I hope when their case is made that a review will take place of how these two schools slipped through the net.  I hope the Minister of State will be positive in his response to this dilemma.  This year's figures will improve somewhat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I discuss the staffing at the two schools mentioned, I would like to draw the Deputies' attention to the manner in which the staffing allocation of primary schools is determined.</P>
      <P>In accordance with an agreement made between the Government and the INTO, the staffing of a national school for any particular year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  Arising from the agreement referred to above a staffing schedule is drafted annually.  The schedule sets out the relevant enrolment which schools must have attained on 30 September of the previous year to qualify for extra staffing. Likewise, the schedule specifies the minimum enrolment required to have been attained to retain posts.</P>
      <P>The staffing schedule has been amended for the 1997-8 school year.  The retention figure for the first assistant teacher has been reduced from 25 to 23.  Twelve schools which were due to lose their first assistant will retain their two teacher status because of this reduction.  In addition, the Minister for Education has reduced from 28 to 25 the level of enrolment required to be achieved by a school to appoint its first assistant teacher. Unfortunately, however, irrespective of whatever improvements may have been effected to the staffing schedule, many schools would not have benefited because the decline in enrolments is so significant.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at Newtown national school on 30 September 1996 was 22 pupils while the enrolment at Shronnell national school was 20 pupils. This enrolment warrants the staffing for the 1997-8 school year of a principal only for both schools. Therefore, the first assistant posts at both schools will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.  The above agreement may be deviated from in two circumstances only: first, where the school experiences rapid growth in enrolment &mdash; broadly rapid growth is defined as an increases in enrolment in one year, relative to the previous year, of 25 pupils &mdash; and, second, where the school is in breach of a maximum class size guideline &mdash; a maximum class of 28 applies in the case of one-teacher schools with four or more standards. If the managerial authorities at Newtown national school and Shronnell national school are unable to manage the enrolment in September 1997 within the recommended guidelines mentioned above, it is open to the authorities to contact the Department on this matter.</P>
      <P>The long-term survival of a national school is determined by rule 36 of the Rules for National Schools.  That rule states that, <i>inter alia,</i> where there are fewer than eight pupils enrolled in a national school for two consecutive school years, the Department will cease to pay grants to the schools.  Unless enrolment in the schools mentioned falls below eight pupils for the specified period, the Department will continue to recognise the two schools involved.</P>

Ceapaim gurb é seo an seans deiridh a bheid agam sa Dáil seo ceist faoi chúrsaí oideachais a thógaint ar an athló agus is ar éigean gur féidir liom cuimhneamh ar uair amhain fiú go raibh an tAire féin i láthair. Ón bhfreagra a thug an tAire Stáit is cosúil gurb é an nós atá ann ná na ceistenna seo a fhreagairt de réir róta éigin atá leagtha amach.  Níl sé sin sásúil.  Níl sé sásúil do na gasúir, do na tuismitheoiri nó do na múinteoirí sa scoil.</P>
      <P>Scoil Chroí Íosa, in Galway city, had 209 students on the roll last September.  The school was told by the Department that there would be a reduction of one teacher from September next. No doubt I will be told that is in accordance with guidelines and agreements made with the INTO and so on, and that may be so, but it is unsatisfactory. There are 220 pupils in the school at present, an increase of 12 pupils over the number on the roll last September.  Of that number, 41 are from traveller families.  There are two resource teachers in the school to deal with those students who have special needs.</P>
      <P>A further seven children from traveller families have applied to attend the school next September. In addition, a large number of children in the area come from homes that experience various difficulties.  All the surrounding schools, have been granted disadvantaged status.  Despite the fact that in the region of one fifth of the students in the school come from traveller families, it is not considered disadvantaged, which is extraordinary. Even more extraordinary &mdash; this problem arises constantly as a result of the guidelines drawn up, for which at the end of the day the Minister is responsible &mdash; is that the secondary school attached to this primary school is considered disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Of the 40 children in junior infants in this school, 12 are from traveller families and of the 31 children in senior infants, six are from traveller families.  Considering the demographic trends, the school's requests are not unreasonable.  It seeks to retain the present level of staffing in view of the enrolment in the school and the problems faced by it.  It also requests that the school be afforded disadvantaged status, like the other schools in the area.  If that request was acceded to, however, it would not be possible to have 40 pupils in junior infants and 31 in senior infants.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing which has been entered into between the Government and the INTO.  Arising from that agreement, a staffing schedule is drafted annually. The schedule sets out the relevant enrolment which schools must have attained on 30 September of the previous year to qualify for extra staffing.  Likewise, the schedule specifies the minimum enrolment required to have been attained to retain posts.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education has amended the staffing schedule for the 1997-8 school year.  In accordance with the amended schedule, the retention figure for the seventh assistant teacher has been reduced from 222 to 215.  Unfortunately, the school to which the Deputy refers achieved an enrolment in September 1996 of 209, six pupils short of the retention figure for the seventh assistant post.  Accordingly, the seventh assistant post at the school will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.  The most junior assistant teacher in the school has been offered panel rights but has deferred same to take up a temporary post in the school.</P>
      <P>Since becoming Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach has included an additional 104 primary schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  This brings the total number of primary schools in the scheme to 320.  The scheme was last expanded in 1994 when an additional 54 primary schools were newly included.  The case put forward by the school in question was considered at that time.  Unfortunately, when regard was had to the relative levels of need among competing schools, the needs of the school in question were not considered to be of such priority as to warrant its inclusion on that occasion.  Traditionally, schools have been selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of socio-economic indicators.  The indicators in question took account of such factors as levels of unemployment, medical card holding and local authority housing occupancy among the families of the children concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in 1995 the Minister for Education commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Reasearch Centre to conduct a detailed review of current approaches to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage.  The Minister's decision to commission this study arose from a concern to ensure that supports were properly targeted and children with real need were in a position to benefit from the scheme. The criteria used in selecting schools for special support and the nature of the supports provided were among the issues addressed in the study. Among the key issues raised by the study was a concern that under the current selection criteria, the scheme did not have due regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage.  It was recommended that the criteria used in selecting schools for support <Col N="304" /> be amended to better reflect educational disadvantage as manifested in rural as well as urban settings.  It was also recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The report considered that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  In this regard, it was noted that the current scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    <P>In response to these findings, the Minister recently launched a targeted initiative which aims to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  The urban phase of the initiative focused on primary schools which were designated as disadvantaged in the urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  The rural phase of the initiative focused on schools throughout the country with fewer than five teachers.  All eligible schools were invited by the Education Research Centre to apply for inclusion in the initiative.  Unfortunately, the school in question was not eligible because of its size.  The Education Research Centre selected schools for inclusion on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of criteria it had devised.  A total of 33 urban and 123 rural schools has been selected to participate in the breaking the cycle initiative.  Each school is required to prepare a five year development plan which will identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets to address the problem of educational disadvantage in the selected areas.</P>
    <P>The operation of the breaking the cycle initiative is being closely monitored by the Department's inspectorate and the project will be evaluated by the Education Research Centre.  The outcome of this evaluation will provide a basis for considering future developments in supports for disadvantaged areas.  In the event of any such developments being undertaken, the needs of the school to which the Deputy refers will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the extremely generous way he has facilitated me tonight and for permitting me to raise with the Minister for Education the need for the Department to immediately allocate funding for the provision of a new school at St. Cronan's, in Bray, County Wicklow.  I thank the Minister of State for attending in the House at this late hour to debate with me this very important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saddened and more than a little angry at the lack of attention my constituency of Wicklow has received in recent years in the area of education. I have spent a considerable period complaining that the economic boom is passing County Wicklow by and nowhere is this more evident than in the area of education.  We were building schools and school extensions in County <Col N="305" /> Wicklow in the lean and hungry years of the late eighties and early nineties.  Now, in these affluent times when the economy is booming, no funding for education is coming Wicklow's way.  It is an extraordinary situation and impossible to comprehend. It is also unacceptable.</P>
    <P>As regards St. Cronan's, a number of simple factors have combined so that children of a modern town are educated in conditions which bear more resemblance to the era of the hedge schools than to what one might expect would be provided by the Government in a modern developed economy. If our children are our future, then surely we should be prepared to invest in them, not just with a view to reaping a reward, but to nurture them and give practical meaning to the noble aspirations of our Constitution.  The case is simply put, so I do not intend to allow my message to be lost in a long winded speech.</P>
    <P>St. Cronan's has 333 pupils and 13 teachers: ten class teachers, one remedial and one resource teacher and the principal.  Some six classes are in prefabs, the newest of which is about 14 years old, the oldest more than 20.  There are only four proper classrooms.  Urine leaks from the first floor toilets to the floor below.  There is no fire exit from upstairs classes.  The staff room was built for eight teachers and now accommodates 13.  It is also the venue for cookery classes and is used to receive any visitors who come to the school. There is only one teacher toilet at which teachers frequently have to queue.  The equipment storage room is a shed, which is not overburdened because the school has no proper PE equipment as the hall is too small.  These are but a few of the worst problems affecting the school.  The situation is aggravated by the fact that much of the school comprises temporary accommodation in dire need of improvement.  Repairs, however, would be futile as most of this accommodation is beyond repair.  In any event, funding for these critical repairs is not forthcoming from the Department because the school is included in the capital programme. This is a dilemma.</P>
    <P>Although this school is in the garden county of Wicklow, improvements in road infrastructure in the past ten years mean it is effectively in a suburb of Dublin where the population has mushroomed. The demographic picture in south Bray is one where there are hundreds, if not thousands, of new houses.  These are occupied for the most part by young couples who will probably have school-going children in a few years.  The current need is pressing but demographic projections and the rate at which progress has been made to date suggests a crisis will shortly arise.</P>
    <P>I do not seek to engage in political point-scoring but only wish to use this opportunity to bring to the Minister's attention the dire need to provide accommodation at St. Cronan's and to <Col N="306" /> ensure it lends itself to expansion in future to meet the projected needs of the area in the next five to ten years.  I also seek an unqualified commitment from the Minister that the necessary funding will be provided without further delay and that she will formally announce this commitment now or before the Dáil adjourns this week.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the parents and staff at the school who have done all that is humanly possible to ensure that, despite the deplorable conditions, the children receive the best possible education.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be given the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department's position regarding St. Cronan's boys' national school, Bray, County Wicklow.  The school has a staffing of a principal, 11 assistants and one remedial teacher with an enrolment of 334 pupils. It is currently located in an old four classroom school with six prefabricated classrooms.  The Department fully accepts the school's requirement for a new building.</P>
      <P>For that reason a project to build a new school was included in the 1995 capital building programme. It will be located on parish land adjacent to the existing school.  The accommodation brief consists of 16 classrooms and ancillary accommodation. The project is being dealt with in-house by the Department's architectural service.  A fire safety certificate was obtained on 20 November 1996 and a notification of full planning permission was received from Bray Urban District Council on 3 March 1997.  The detailed design documents are currently being prepared and it is expected to have the tender documents ready by June 1997.</P>
      <P>When my colleague, Deputy Bhreathnach, became Minister for Education in 1993, she was faced with a very difficult backlog of 300 urgent major school projects.  These had accumulated because of the substantial cuts in the capital funding of primary schools in the period 1988-92.  In the past four years, the Government increased the capital funding of schools significantly and substantial progress has been made in reducing the backlog.</P>
      <P>The project at St. Cronan's is a sizeable one, not least because the site is difficult.  While it is not possible to give a definite timescale for construction at this stage, I assure the House the Minister for Education is committed to solving the accommodation needs of schools such as St. Cronan's and every effort will be made to allow this project to proceed to construction at the earliest opportunity.  The position was explained to a delegation from the school which ment the Minister recently on 6 March.  The delegation understood the situation and the position now is as I outlined to the House.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 May 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, recognises the value of habitats such as hedgerows for nesting birds and provides protection, subject to certain exceptions, against the cutting, grubbing, burning etc. of any vegetation on uncultivated land during the period 15 April to 31 August. Local authorities are exempt from this provision under section 40(2)(c) but the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department has again written this year to all local authorities seeking their co-operation in ensuring that hedge cutting operations, as far as possible, are only undertaken outside the critical nesting period of 15 April to 31 August.  In general, subject to their safety obligations for public roads, the response <Col N="309" /> from local authorities has been very positive but if the Deputies supply details of unnecessary hedge cutting, I will raise the matter directly with the relevant local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have written to my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, Minister for the Environment, asking for his support in this matter.</P>
    <P>The provisions under section 40 against the cutting, grubbing, burning etc. by private individuals are enforced by the NPWS ranger staff and it is the policy to prosecute offenders when the necessary evidence is available to bring a prosecution under the Act.  However, tracing the source of fires and catching offenders in the act make the enforcement of these provisions difficult.</P>

      <P>I am committed to policies that will ensure that all arts facilities funded by my Department are accessible to people with disabilities. Following consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, I included as one of the basic conditions governing support for projects under the cultural development incentives scheme (CDIS) initiative the requirement that project promoters should ensure that all facilities within the building and grounds of the premises are fully accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The manner in which these facilities are made fully accessible is the subject of detailed discussions between officials from my Department and the project developers on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>In addition, the extent to which any group seeking support have engaged the challenge of access for disabled people in their overall development plans, has been an important consideration when deciding which of the many projects seeking support were eventually successful.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the CDIS initiative is spearheading the development of our arts infrastructure by its support of almost 40 projects throughout the country.  Clearly its encouragement of a positive attitude to the challenge of access for people with disabilities will be of immediate benefit in the projects directly involved and it will also set the standards for future developments.</P>

      <P>In November 1996 the chairperson of the Heritage Council informed me that a committee of the council had met representatives of the <i>Asgard</i> Restoration Project Ltd. in connection with their proposals in relation to the <i>Asgard</i> and that the council supports the proposals. These proposals involve the restoration of the vessel to a seaworthy condition, its use as a floating exhibit with the possibility of bringing her occasionally by sea to particular events.</P>
      <P>In restoring the <i>Asgard</i> to a seaworthy condition, the approach would have to be to remove and replace all components which are damaged or degraded regardless of historic significance. Such an approach would be contrary to established conservation practice which, in view of the vessel's historical significance, should take precedence.</P>
      <P>The future permanent location of the vessel is under consideration at present and in this regard one of the options being considered is its location in the new National Museum complex in the former Collins Barracks.  It is not possible to say that it will be located there or the manner in which it would be displayed until the report of consultants appointed to examine the use of areas of the complex has been received and considered.</P>

Recommendation 52 stated that public liability insurance costs should be deemed an operating expense against which full taxation relief may be claimed in respect of buildings qualifying for tax relief under section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the Government's proposals for broadcasting legislation contained in the document Clear Focus which was laid before the House on 18 March 1997.  My purpose in proposing the definition contained in Clear Focus was to set out clearly the type of broadcasting service which is to be funded by the licence fee.  While recognising the public value of certain strands of programming on independent radio services, the important distinction here is between the concept of a public service <Col N="313" /> broadcaster with a statutory remit to serve minority as well as mainstream tastes on a national basis and the provision of segments of public service programming within a broadcasting schedule.</P>

      <P>I have received Government approval for a package of compensation measures to be co-funded through my Department with co-financing from the EU.  EU approval has yet to be obtained.</P>
      <P>Following extensive negotiations, agreement was reached with the farming social partners on a scheme of compensation for losses arising as a result of Special Area of Conservation designations.  In the context of Partnership 2000, it was agreed that a fair and proper level of compensation shall be paid having regard to the level and extent of restriction and all reasonable losses arising as a result of SAC designation and to the difference between the value predesignation for environmental purposes and the subsequent value of the land consequent on designation as an SAC.</P>
      <P>Landowners-occupiers, part of all of whose land is designated as an SAC, may opt for either of two alternative compensations packages as follows:</P>
      <P>Option 1</P>
      <P>Compensation Scheme administered by the Department of Arts, Culture, and the Gaeltacht:-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  This package will be offered to those who decide not to participate in the <Col N="314" /> rural environment protection scheme (REPS) administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Under this scheme farmers will be required to farm their SAC land in accordance with an agri-environment plan prepared by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The farming conditions that will apply in the Burren, blanket bogs, heaths, and upland grasslands in SACs have already been agreed by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Teagasc, private farm planners, farming organisations and other interested parties. These habitats account for over two-thirds of the land area to be included in SACs.  Arrangements are in hand to discuss and agree other affected habitats in the same way.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Farmers will be compensated for all losses of income including headage or premia or its alternative.  Farmers will also be compensated for any additional costs or losses which arise as a result of complying with the farm plan.</P>
    <P>All such costs, including capital costs, shall be identified, quantified, and agreed between the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the farmer concerned in advance.</P>
    <P>(v)  In exceptional cases, including hardship, <i>ex-gratia</i> payments may be made or outright purchase considered.</P>
    <P>(vi)  Where agreement is not reached on the amount payable, independent arbitration will be available.</P>
    <P>Option 2</P>
    <P>Rural environment protection scheme (REPS) administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>Farmers with land in an SAC, who opt to join REPS, will be eligible for the following payments in addition to those already available under the existing REPS scheme:</P>

      <P>One of the main recommendations of the FORTE report which was launched by me in December 1996 is the establishment of an Irish Music Board.  One of the most interesting aspects of the proposal is that it envisages that the music board would be a partnership between the industry and the State sector and jointly funded.  As the Deputy will appreciate this is a complex proposal and could have implications for other State bodies and agencies.  Discussions with representatives of the music industry are ongoing on this and other issues and I will be defining my approach to the question of the music board and the other recommendations in the light of my ongoing dialogue with the industry.</P>

      <P>The development of programmes to help the rehabilitation of people in prison is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The existing Prison Education Service consists of a partnership between the Department of Justice and a range of agencies, including An Chomhairle Ealaíon, which supports the Department of Justice in implementation of the artists-in-prison and the writers' workshops for prisoners scheme.  These schemes allow artists and writers to work with prisoners in one of the State's prison-detention centres for periods of up to ten days.</P>
      <P>Artists and writers who are interested in these schemes are invited to apply to an An Chomhairle Ealaíon and all applications are carefully considered by both An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the Department of Justice.  A panel of artists and writers is drawn up and as opportunities arise within the prison system an appropriate artist or writer may be called upon to undertake a project within a particular prison.</P>
      <P>Any modification or extension of these two schemes would be a matter for An Chomhairle Ealaíon, in consultation with the Department of Justice.</P>

The Deputy will also be aware that during 1996 I made allocations totalling £13.694 million in respect of 25 projects under the cultural development incentives scheme which I am administering under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.  Of this amount I allocated a sum of £2.67 million in respect of nine projects which are being directly promoted by community arts groups.  With regard to the <Col N="317" /> other 16 projects which were allocated funding in 1996, I am confident that all will be accessible and available for use by local communities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also appreciate that in addition to the funding allocated by my Department to community arts groups during the period 1993-96, substantial funding was also made available by An Chomhairle Ealaíon for projects in this area.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>With European Union partners, Ireland is concerned to see a comprehensive, peaceful and lasting settlement to the conflict in Abkhazia.  Both in its political dialogue with Georgia, and in co-operation with the United Nations and the OSCE, the European Union has been working to promote a negotiated solution.</P>
      <P>United Nations military observers were sent to Abkhazia under the UN Security Council resolutions 881 and 892 of November 1993 and January 1994.  Recently, the mandate of the UN mission (UNOMIG) was extended until 31 July 1997. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the UN, Ambassador Edouard Brunner, has been in constant contact with both parties to the conflict, and has spent considerable time on the ground in the region.  The OSCE has also been active in promoting dialogue between the parties.</P>
      <P>In recent times, Russia has played an important role as a &ldquo;facilitator&rdquo; in encouraging dialogue.  A peace-keeping force of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is in place in Abkhazia, where it operates alongside the United Nations Observer Mission.  The mandate of the CIS peace-keepers has also been extended until 31 July 1997, following agreement at the CIS Summit on 28 March this year to intensify efforts towards a solution to the conflict and the return of refugees and displaced persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the ceasefire between the two parties, agreed in July 1994, continues to hold, concerns remain regarding the humanitarian situation, acts of lawlessness, including the attacks on members of the peace-keeping force and observer mission, and the safety and security of the local population. The unilateral decision taken by the Abkhaz authorities to hold Presidential elections in November 1996 was considered a serious deterioration in the peace process.  Under the Irish Presidency, the Union made clear its view that such elections should take place only in the framework of a comprehensive political settlement which would include the determination through negotiations of the political status of Abkhazia, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally <Col N="325" /> recognised borders, and with the guaranteed possibility of full participation of all refugees and displaced persons.  The Union also fully supported the statement made by the President of the UN Security Council that the conditions for the holding of such elections were not present at that time.</P>
    <P>However, notwithstanding the setback arising from the presidential elections, bilateral contacts between both parties are continuing.  The Secretary-General of the UN, in his most recent report, noted that both sides seem determined to continue these direct contacts and to broaden their bilateral relations.  He considered that there was no better recipe for progress than the current contacts, and noted that it was now less likely that either side would resort to force to attain its objectives.</P>
    <P>The proposal by the Secretary-General to extend UN involvement in Georgia is a welcome development.  The new special representative to Georgia will be a resident envoy, and will be based in both Tbilisi and Sukhumi, the capital of Abkhazia.  The UN will also strengthen its political involvement through the deployment of additional offices throughout the UNOMIG area. A particularly significant step has been the opening of the UN office for the protection and promotion of human rights in Abkhazia.  This new office has begun its work and has been receiving the co-operation of the Abkhaz authorities.  The Secretary-General intends to convene a meeting of the two parties to the conflict in the near future where it is hoped that concrete political progress can be made.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the European Union strongly support the efforts being made to achieve a lasting political settlement to the conflict, and will continue to work, both with the Georgian authorities, and in the framework of the United Nations and the OSCE, to achieve this objective.</P>

    <P>*The figures for post-budget estimate and net receipt of income tax under PAYE in 1994 exclude the yield under the 1993 tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>The figure for PAYE covers more than tax on wages and salaries.  For example, tax paid by directors of close companies is included, as is the tax on other income of employees such as rent and other investment income.  After adjusting for these factors, tax on wages and salaries normally represents about 67 per cent of the take from income tax, excluding deposit interest retention tax.  The figure for PAYE also includes the tax paid on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 69 and 70 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 18 of the Ireland-UK double taxation agreement is concerned with the taxation of governmental employees and it generally provides that they should only be taxable in the State of the government for which they work.  To qualify under this Article, the employees must be rendering services to the Government or a local authority and must be discharging services of a governmental nature.  Not all public service type employments would involve the discharge of services of a governmental nature.  It was affirmed by a decision of the High Court that a health <Col N="335" /> worker employed by a regional health board in Northern Ireland is not covered by the Article.  In that case it was held that &ldquo;functions of a governmental nature&rdquo; means related to governing the country, which would include the functions of the ordinary Civil Service and of local government administrators, but would not include everyone paid out of the public purse.</P>
    <P>In recent years, mainly as a result of changes in local government structures in Northerrn Ireland, problems have arisen concerning whether teachers who are employed by local education boards can be regarded as rendering their services to the UK Government or to a local authority. The UK tax authorities took the view that they were not and were accordingly not covered by Article 18.</P>
    <P>I met Chancellor Gordon Brown in Brussels on Monday, 12 May at an ECOFIN meeting.  I discussed this matter with him.  He has undertaken to look at the issue following my representations.</P>
    <P>Discussions are currently in progress at official level between the Irish and UK tax authorities on the scope of Article 18 and whether it should be amended to make it clearer what categories of employment are covered by the said Article.</P>
    <P>While a number of other technical difficulties have been raised by the UK authorities, it is hoped that these discussions will be concluded satisfactorily shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>While all cases of E-coli 0157 infection in Ireland have been sporadic and there have not been epidemics of the infection here, I believe, nevertheless, that it is imperative that the medical profession, the public, and all persons engaged in food preparation are aware of E-coli 0157 and of the simple measures by which infection can be prevented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For several years now, my Department has recognised the potentially serious implications of E-coli 0157 infection and has taken steps to increase awareness of it.  A report on the matter by the Food Safety Advisory Committee was circulated to all health boards in October 1994 with an instruction that it should be brought to the attention of all officers engaged in food control operations.  A reminder to this effect was issued <Col N="338" /> in July 1995.  A further reminder issued in December 1996, this time to all directors of public health in the health boards.  The directors were asked to remind doctors and laboratories to be particularly vigilant in reporting cases of food poisoning, with a view to identifying any possible cases of the E-coli 0157 infection.</P>
    <P>More recently, following advice from the Food Safety Advisory Board, the Health Promotion Unit of my Department has prepared a leaflet for distribution to the general public on this matter. The leaflet advises, in particular, on the importance of properly cooking meat products, on the need to properly wash raw fruit and vegetables before eating, and on the importance of observing good food hygiene and personal hygiene practices to prevent and control outbreaks of E-coli 0157 infection.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy has mentioned in his question, the UK authorities recently published the report of the Pennington Group which was set up to examine the circumstances leading to the 1996 outbreak of E-coli 0157 infection in Scotland, the implictions for food safety and the lessons to be learned.  I am now having the Pennington report considered by the Food Safety Advisory Board and I will keep the Irish situation under review in the light of the board's advice to me in the matter.</P>
    <P>One of the conclusions of the Pennington report is the need for improved surveillance of E-coli 0157 and other foodborne diseases.  At the moment in Ireland there is a legal requirement, under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1989-96, for the notification of cases of food poisoning including E-coli 0157 infection.  The Deputy will be aware that, in addition to this notification system, I have now accepted the need for a national communicable disease surveillance which will provide a comprehensive broad based approach to the prevention of disease, including foodborne diseases.  My Department is currently considering the organisational and structural issues involved in conjunction with the relevant agencies and professional interests, and is also meeting with the Food Safety Advisory Board on the matter.</P>
    <P>On the issue of meat retailing outlets, the <Col N="339" /> hygiene standards to be observed in premises engaged in the provision of food services to the public are set out in the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950-89.  These regulations are enforced on a day-to-day basis by the environmental health services of the eight health boards through programmes of inspection, sampling and monitoring. Where the hygiene standards in a food premises are found not to be in accordance with the regulations, there is provision whereby the relevant health board can take a prosecution for breach of the food hygiene regulations against the proprietor of the premises or the undertaking operating in the premises, as appropriate.  Where a health board considers a food premises to pose a grave and immediate danger to public health, the health board can apply to the District Court for the immediate closure of that food business. In addition, a health board has the power to seize, remove and detain food which is suspected of being diseased, contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy has indicated in his question, the environmental health officers in the health boards are currently pursuing a limited form of industrial action in connection with legislative measures introduced since 1981.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the environmental health officers are still carrying out inspection and monitoring of food premises.</P>
    <P>The Deputy refers to the state of animals when presented at marts, abattoris and meat plants.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, in conjunction with Teagasc &mdash; the National Agricultural Advisory Service &mdash; is endeavouring to raise awareness among the farming community of the absolute necessity to present animals in a clean condition at meat plants and abattoirs.  Furthermore, I understand that the maintenance of high operational standards during carcass dressing and, in particular during hide removal and evisceration is being re-emphasised in all cattle and sheep slaughter plants.</P>
    <P>The landspreading of wastes, including slurry spreading, are subject to pollution controls put in place by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, with whom the Deputy may wish to pursue this aspect of his questions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I assure Deputies of my strong commitment to the question of food safety.  Deputies are aware that the Government has agreed to the establishment of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland which will be dedicated to ensuring compliance with the very best food safety and hygiene standards.  The preparation of the necessary legislation is under way but, meanwhile, the interim Food Safety Authority of Ireland is proceeding with putting in place the necessary structures and administrative systems to ensure the statutory board will be able to make a strong and immediate impact in this area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The plan for the development of mental health services is based on the recommendations of the report of the study group on the development of the mental health services &mdash; Planning for the Future &mdash; which was published in 1984 and which has been accepted as mental health policy by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>The report recommended the restructuring of mental health services through the development of services located in the community as an alternative to institutional based care.  Acute psychiatric units at general hospitals, day hospitals, day centres and community residential accommodation are now being provided by health boards to replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>This shift in the provision of services from the traditional institutional-based model of care to a community-based care setting has been widely accepted as providing a more comprehensive service for patients and a much improved quality of life for persons who were former patients of psychiatric hospitals.  I am committed to the continued development of mental health services in line with this policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Services for children and adolescents, including services for eating disorders, are generally provided by child and adolescent phychiatric services in child and family centres.  A family-centred approach is adopted and the majority of cases are dealt with on a non-residential basis. Residential care, where required, may be provided at a residential facility for children and young people, at a paediatric department of a general hospital, at a phychiatric unit of a general hospital or at a psychiatric hospital.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been significant expansion in child and adolescent psychiatric services in each health board with additional recruitment of child psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers.  I regard the child and adolescent psychiatric services as one of the priority areas for development and in this regard my Department is currently in the process of formulating a policy for the further development of the service which will include an identification of areas of particular need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> Consideration is continually given by health boards to ways in which services provided by private-voluntary agencies might integrate with the boards' services.  The priority for the boards, however, must be the continued development of their own services and the retention of services provided by private-voluntary agencies must be viewed in the light of this priority.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Unter the Pharmacy Acts, pharmacists have responsibility for compounding and dispensing medical prescriptions and other products controlled under those Acts.  Accordingly, community (retail) pharmacists play a key role in the health services in regard to the dispensing of a full range of drugs and medicines.  Drugs and medicines are dispensed to general medical services scheme patients who receive their prescription medicines free of charge and to private patients who may be reimbursed in whole or in part for their medication under a range of community drug schemes.</P>
      <P>The Department has recently concluded an agreement for provision of community pharmacy service under the Health Act, 1970.  This agreement places a major emphasis on the professional role of the pharmacist and, in the context of the patient-pharmacist relationship, establishes standards to be expected in the delivery of a quality community pharmacy service.  The agreement also provides for improved accountability in the dispensing of medicines under all publically funded schemes.  Under this agreement pharmacists are obliged to:</P>
      <P>&mdash; exercise professional judgment with due diligence and care,</P>
      <P>&mdash; ensure that the quality of medicines dispensed meets a specified minimum standard,</P>
      <P>&mdash; maintain at the practice, proper and sufficient accommodation, up-to-date reference texts, equipment and stocks.</P>
      <P>&mdash; prior to the dispensing of each prescription, ensure that the medicine therapy of the patient is reviewed, including screening for any therapeutic problems which may arise, and an examination of the rational and cost-effective use of medicine prescribed.</P>
      <P>&mdash; offer to discuss with the patient or his/her representative, all such matters as the pharmacist, in his-her professional judgment, deems significant following the review outlined above, including the giving of advice and the counselling of patients in their use of medicinal products,</P>
      <P>&mdash; ensure that there is sufficient and appropriate pharmacist manpower available in each pharmacy to fulfil the terms of the contract, including the availability of a supervising pharmacist having appropriate experience,</P>
      <P>&mdash; facilitate the development and use of appropriate information technology and telematic services for the effective management of the publicly funded schemes,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" />&mdash; facilitate inspections of the pharmacy by the health board or Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland,</P>
    <P>&mdash; provide all necessary information to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board on the community drug schemes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new arrangement will considerably enhance the role of community pharmacists in the provision of a safe, quality driven, cost effective service to the public, in dispensing a comprehensive range of medicinal products.</P>

      <P>The Bill incorporates a provision to enable claimants at the tribunal to establish an entitlement to aggravated or exemplary damages.  The Government has decided that claimants after establishing their claim for damages &mdash;i.e. general and-or special damages-at the Compensation Tribunal, will have two options: they can seek to establish their entitlement to aggravated or exemplary damages at the Compensation Tribunal or accept a payment from a special reparation fund which will be established by the Government.  This payment will amount to 20 per cent of the total amount of the award of damages &mdash; i.e. general and-or special damages made by the Compensation Tribunal.  The reparation fund would have the following advantages for the claimant; simplicity; ease of calculation, certainity of result and early conclusion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 7 December 1993 and 20 January 1995 the Government decided on the costs and funding of Teilifís na Gaeilge.  The total capital cost of the construction of the transmitter network, the link network and the presentation and programme transmission facilities was estimated at £16,100,000.  The capital programme has been funded in the main from the Exchequer and from moneys accumulated and retained by RTE in <Col N="360" /> excess of the revenue limit imposed by the broadcasting Act, 1990 i.e. the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; moneys.  In 1995 and 1996 RTE received grants-in-aid from the Vote of my Department of £3,600,000 and £12,200,000 respectively.  The balance of £300,000 is funded from the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; moneys.  RTE reports that cumulative expenditure on the capital project to 10 April 1997 amounts to just under £16 million.</P>
    <P>Regarding the running costs of Teilifís na Gaeilge, in 1994, a grant of over £565,000 was paid to RTE from the Vote of my Department. In respect of 1995, in accordance with the Government decision of 20 January 1995, a grant-in-aid of £2,500,000 was paid to RTE.  The Government also decided that in 1996 a contribution of £10,000,000 would be made &mdash; £3,250,000 by way of grant-in-aid and the balance from the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; money's retained by RTE &mdash; and that in 1997 and thereafter the Exchequer would contribute £10,000,000 annually for running costs adjusted upwards to take account of the fact that the original estimates were at 1993-94 prices.  In 1997 a grant-in-aid of £10,204,000 is provided for and to date £1,500,000 of this has been paid to RTE in respect of the running costs of Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>The moneys allocated to Teilifís na Gaeilge do not include any EU moneys.</P>

      <P>I confirm that my Department has had initial discussions on the acquisition of some land owned by the Holy Faith Order adjoining the national Botanic Gardens which would be considered beneficial but not crucial for the development of the gardens.  These discussions are at a preliminary stage, and I wish to make it clear that the area which is of interest to my Department is not included in the lands recently put on the market by the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union Habitats Directive requires member states to protect their most important natural areas by designating them as special areas of conservation, or SACs.  Under the terms of the European Union (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, of 26 February, 1997, I, as Minister, have power to control farming or other activities which will have a significant damaging effect on the ecology of these natural areas.  Ownership rights are not affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Designation proposals for County Galway were published in local newspapers in the week ending 14 March 1997 and every effort has been made to inform affected landowners-users of SAC designation <Col N="362" /> proposals.  In every case where ownership-user details were available to my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service individual notices were sent, giving details of the extent of the proposals, and explaining that farming-land use in these areas will have to be in accordance with approved individual farm plans, that objections-appeals are possible and how to do this, and that compensation will be paid for any losses arising from farmers-land users as a result.</P>
    <P>Because the data available on land ownership was incomplete, designation proposals were advertised in local newspapers and on local radio: these advertisements included details of where additional information could be obtained.  A series of public meetings, with NPWS staff in attendance, has taken place around the country, and this process will continue.</P>
    <P>Persons who feel that they may be affected by SAC proposals should contact the nearest office of the NPWS.  Local staff will be happy to confirm whether proposed designations affect the person concerned, and will explain the implications of designation for farming and other activities in these areas both in the short and long term. Alternatively they can ring a freephone number 1800-405-000 for more information.</P>
    <P>With specific regard to turbary, areas of raised and blanket bog are included in proposed SAC areas because these habitats are defined as priority habitats in the Habitats Directive, and as such must be given the highest level of protection. However, in protecting these bogs, the approach of NPWS is that restrictions of traditional use of these areas should be at the minimum level that will allow Ireland to meet its international obligations. Cutting that will not cause significant damage although it is only fair to say that use of the &ldquo;sausage machine&rdquo; system is likely to be very damaging.</P>
    <P>NPWS local staff will be looking at the kind of turf cutting going on in each area and will make every effort to agree a mutually acceptable arrangement with the land users in question.  In cases where restrictions on cutting represent the only way to protect these bogs, full compensation will be paid.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific tubary plot owners referred to by the Deputy, I will be glad to arrange for officials of the NPWS to meet the persons involved if the Deputy wishes to supply me with the names of the appropriate contact persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of national lottery funding made available to my Department for the years 1994-97, which is already specified in the relevant appendices of the annual volumes of the revised Estimates for Public Services, is outlined in the following Tables 1-3.</P>
      <P>The allocations to Bord na Gaeilge provide for the administrative expenses of the board and for assistance provided by it to various organisations and projects.</P>
      <P>Ciste na Gaeilge provides support for a number of Irish language voluntary organisations and for miscellaneous Irish language projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> Details of grant-in-aid allocations to the national cultural institutions sourced from national lottery funds are contained in the relevant volumes of the Revised Estimates for Public Services for the relevant years.  As these allocations represent the basic funding to meet the day-to-day operations of these institutions, any additional programmes and developments do not therefore arise.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Council provides financial assistance to persons and bodies in respect of matters related to its functions and this is provided for in Subhead P2.</P>
    <P>The National Gallery of Ireland receives a grant-in-aid from national lottery funds under Subhead B of Vote 43 in respect of acquisitions and conservation.</P>
    <P>The national lottery funding allocated to An Chomhairle Ealaíon in the period 1994-97 has enabled An Chomhairle to develop a wide range of policies and programmes designed to provide financial assistance and other support services for individuals and organisations involved in the arts and generally to create an environment in which the arts can develop and flourish.</P>

      <P>The National Museum, conscious that Collins Barracks is the longest continuously occupied barracks in Europe, wishes to acknowledge and maintain the strong links with the military aspects of the facility.  The Defence Forces has made its military history collection available to the National Museum for display purposes. The National Museum has therefore committed itself to incorporating in its displays and the temporary exhibitions to be included in Phase II of the Collins Barracks project, material of a millitary history nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> A functional brief and exhibition strategy for Phase II of the Collins Barracks project is currently being prepared by a firm of museum consultants in association with the National Museum. This firm is examining the needs of the museum and the possibilities of meeting those needs within the confines of the Barracks and the budget available.  Items of military history interest will be dealt with in the context of these issues.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 61 of 30 April 1997, in which I stated in response to his query regarding the cost of photography to my Department that a number of staff are engaged in photographic duties in the heritage service and in the national cultural institutions under the aegis of my Department.  The costs associated with those duties are provided for in the administrative budget of my Department and I did not consider that the time and expense necessary to extract the detailed information required to respond to the Deputy's query could be justified.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's specific query in regard to ministerial photography, the position is that the cost to my Department of engaging private photographers for official purposes was of the order of £3,200 in 1995 and £3,400 in 1996.  A large number of such engagements involved the launch of reports and other important departmental initiatives at which the presence of a photographer was necessary for official record purposes.</P>

    <P>On 8 May 1997, I approved the preliminary resport for stage 1 of the Ballinasloe regional water supply scheme.  I also announced that I would be authorising Galway County Council to prepare contract documents for the extension of the scheme to serve the Laurencetown and Eyrecourt areas.  I wrote to the Laurencetown-Eyrecourt group on the same date advising them of my decision to provide their scheme with an alternative source of water from the Ballinasloe public supply; a meeting with a deputation should not therefore be necessary at this stage.  My Department informed the county manager of my decision and further details relating to the specific works involved will be communicated to the county council shortly.  My Department does not make annual capital allocations for individual <Col N="373" /> water schemes, but makes payments as required, on foot of certified expenditure on approved schemes.  The Ballinasloe scheme will be financed on this basis out of my Department's overall allocation for water and sewerage schemes in 1997.</P>

A lengthy and comprehensive review of the national road system was brought to a conclusion in July 1994 with the making of the Roads Act, 1993 (Declaration of National Roads) Order, 1994.  I do not propose to make any major changes in the national road network in the near future.  Traffic patterns will, however, continue to be monitored in order to identify any long-term changes which might have implications for the classified system.</P>

    <P>Under the EU co-financed scheme of specific grants for non-national road improvement projects which are of economic benefit and help to generate employment, £2.25 million has been provided to Cork County Council since 1994 for the improvement of sections of the R572 Glengarriff to Castletownbere Road.  In addition, £100,000 was provided to the council in 1996 for Kealincha Bridge on the R571 Castletownbere to Kenmare Road.  It will be open to the council to <Col N="374" /> submit applications for consideration for further funding of improvement works on these roads under this scheme in 1998.</P>

      <P>Article 16.1.2º of the Constitution provides that all Irish citizens and such other persons in the State as may be determined by law shall have the right to vote at Dáil elections.  Section 8 of the Electoral Act, 1992, extends the right to vote at Dáil elections to resident British citizens.  It also provides for extending the Dáil franchise to nationals of other EU member states on a reciprocal basis.  The United Kingdom is the only member state which extends the right to vote at parliamentary elections to resident Irish citizens and there is, therefore, no scope under existing law for extending the Dáil franchise to nationals of other member states resident in Ireland.  I have no proposals to amend the law in this matter.</P>

      <P>The ballot papers for the next general election will not contain photographs of candidates.  The European Parliament Elections Act, 1997 provides that ballot papers at a European Parliament election may include a photograph of each candidate and subject to resolving technical problems which are under consideration at present, the intention is that candidates' photographs will be included on ballot papers at the 1999 European election.  The question of including photographs on other election ballot papers will be considered in the light of experience at the European Parliament elections.</P>
      <P>Under the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1996, each returning officer is required, where practicable, to provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users.  The Act also requires a returning officer to make arrangements at polling stations to facilitate the marking and placing in the ballot box of ballot papers by voters who are wheelchair users.  These requirements have been brought to the attention of each returning officer by my Department.</P>

      <P>There is a voluntary scheme of registration of driving instructors which was established jointly by the two national associations representing motor schools and driving instructors, in association with the Irish Insurance Federation and with financial assistance from both my Department and the insurance federation.  In order to become a qualified instructor under the scheme, it is necessary to pass a three-part examination. It is my intention to monitor the progress of this scheme for a period of time before deciding whether to establish more formal regulation of driving instruction.</P>

      <P>The White Paper <i>Charting Our Education Future</i> states that the Government affirms the centrality of the arts within education policy and provision, particularly during compulsory schooling.  A substantial part of the existing curriculum for primary schools is devoted to the arts.  This curriculum <Col N="382" /> is being reviewed at present by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in the light of the policy statement on the arts contained in the White Paper.  The revised curriculum will have elements on all aspects of the arts including music, the visual arts, dance, drama and literature. These will be an essential part of the curriculum for primary schools and a programme of in-career development will be provided to support implementation in schools.</P>
      <P>At second level, the White Paper states that each school will be expected to provide students with experience in arts education.  The new junior cycle curriculum affirms that the creating and performing arts are distinctive and intrinsically valuable educational disciplines and have an important role as part of the whole school curriculum. In addition to the recently revised syllabi in music and art, craft and design, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is devising full courses in drama and dance for the junior certificate curriculum.  The promotion of the arts is also encouraged through participation by students in various competitions and activities involving school choirs and orchestras organised by the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers was formed in September 1996 as a result of an amalgamation. My Department provided grant-aid of £24,000 during the summer of 1996 in order to have essential works done to facilitate the amalgamation. The school has requested that an additional schedule of works be executed during the summer of 1997.  This schedule includes an extension, refurbishment and provision of playing facilities.  The requested works are relatively costly and money has not been allocated for the project in the current financial year.  Officials of my Department recently met with the school management to discuss the matter.  My Department will be in touch with the school.  At this stage, I am not in a position to state when the work will be done.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, other than European Social Fund (ESF) aided courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved third level institutions.  The pharmaceutical technician course does not come within the scope of the free fees initiative as the first year of the course is aided by the ESF as a post-leaving certificate course and is pursued in Coláiste Íde, Finglas, which is a second level college. Furthermore, the remainder of the course consists of six months practical work experience with the final six months taking place in Trinity College.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the universities recoup tuition fees in respect of students attending courses which come within the eligibility criteria, from the Higher Education Authority. I understand that students on this course in 1995-6 were inadvertently included in the free fees initiative.  When the question of this course's inclusion within the free fees initiative was brought to my Department's attention, my Department advised that the course did not meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the initiative.</P>

      <P>The project, titled &ldquo;Schools IT 2000&rdquo; will run over five years until the year 2001.  It will involve the development and implementation of an exciting programme to support every Irish school in making the best possible educational use of ICTs. The programme will build on the expertise and creativity which is already in evidence in Irish classrooms.</P>
      <P>The project will target actions in three key areas: (i) teacher training and support; (ii) classroom resources and infrastructure and (iii) policy research.  Details of the project have been communicated to schools.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of a television, the capitation grant is intended to meet the cost of such items.  In that context, I should point out that since taking office I have made significant improvements in the level of funding for primary schools.  The standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from a level of £28 in 1992 to its present level of £45 per pupil, an increase of more than 60 per cent.  The matter of further increases in the grant is kept under constant review.</P>

In the past four years, the Government has increased the capital funding of schools significantly and substantial progress has been made in reducing the backlog.

      <P>Indeed, I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved unprecedented improvements in the level of support services available to children with disabilities attending mainstream schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have to date allocated 241 remedial teacher posts and 39 resource teacher posts to primary schools, bringing the total in the system to 1,188 and 46 respectively.  I am, in addition, currently considering the allocation of further remedial and resource teacher posts to primary schools.</P>
      <P>In addition, the White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, sets out the Government's policy for the provision of suitable education services for pupils with a disability, in either special educational facilities or in an integrated environment.</P>
      <P>The fundamental objective of the commitment in the White Paper is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area and within the ordinary school system.</P>
      <P>While the degree to which integration can be achieved will depend on the specific and evolving capacities of the individual children, the measures set down in the White Paper will maximise that possibility.</P>

      <P>The maximum class size of 15 pupils to which the Deputy refers is part of a special support package being made available to schools selected for inclusion in the urban element of the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  The initiative was launched in response to detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Education Research Centre, which was charged with devising selection criteria and selecting schools for inclusion in the initiative, concluded that the initiative should have an urban and a rural focus.  It further recommended that the urban element of the scheme should focus on <Col N="399" /> schools in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford areas and that the rural element should focus on all schools with fewer than five teachers.</P>
    <P>All eligible schools were invited to apply to the Education Research Centre for inclusion in the initiative and all applicants submitted detailed data on the level of disadvantage among their pupils under a range of headings.  The centre selected schools on the basis of priority of need as reflected in the data submitted.</P>
    <P>A total of 33 urban schools and 123 rural schools were selected for inclusion in the scheme. Based on its enrolment and staffing level, the school in question was not eligible for inclusion in the initiative.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Breaking the Cycle initiative is being closely monitored by the Department's Inspectorate and the project will be evaluated by the Education Research Centre. The outcome of this evaluation will provide a basis for considering future developments in supports for disadvantaged areas.  In the event of any such development being undertaken, the needs of the school in question will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike most of the structures which it is proposed to establish under the Education Bill, 1997, there is no requirement that the appeals committee be representative of the partners in education.  Such a requirement, in my view, would run counter to the primary aim of the appeals system that not only should it be fair and objective but that it should be seen by students, parents teachers and boards of management to be fair and objective. For that reason.  I do not propose to amend the Education Bill to provide for a representative of teachers on the appeals committee, any more than I propose to provide for a representative of partents or patrons on the committee.</P>
      <P>In considering the composition of the appeals committee it should be borne in mind that the Bill provides for equal representation of all the partners in education on the education boards themselves, including, of course, teachers in schools in the education region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keogh should also note that I have proposed an amendment to the Bill, No. 286 in the published list of amendments, which provides that the Minister, in prescribing the criteria for appeals at board of management level and at education <Col N="400" /> board level, must consult with the patrons of schools, national associations of parents, and recognised trade unions and staff associations representing teachers.</P>
    <P>This will give all the partners a central involvement in determining the appeals structures at what I consider to be the more appropriate policy level.</P>
    <P>While this is my considered view of what is appropriate in the interests of students, parents and schools, I am, of course, prepared to consider carefully any arguments Deputy Keogh may wish to put forward as the Bill is debated by Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>There is a school-based psychological service provided by my Department to second-level schools in counties Sligo and Leitrim.  Two psychologists are currently assigned to these schools.</P>
      <P>The psychologists from this Department who serve second-level schools carry out assessments as the resources of time and personnel allow. They give priority to pupils whose difficulties are perceived to be acute, and do not operate a formal waiting list.  Most pupils may, therefore, be seen without undue delay.  Where necessary, the schools psychologists refer pupils to the appropriate specialist agencies of the health authorities for further assessment and treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, responsibility for arranging for the psychological assessment of children in national schools, where such is deemed necessary, is a matter for the regional health boards through the appropriate director of community care.  The <Col N="401" /> question of waiting lists for assessment is a matter for the relevant health board.  However, I am pleased to have been able to provide a psychological service by my Department for the first time to a number of schools which serve disadvantaged areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>When it becomes possible to have further expansion of the Department of Education's psychological service, the needs of children and of schools in counties Sligo and Leitrim and in other areas, will be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>An application for special examination arrangements was received by my Department on behalf of the candidate referred to by the Deputy.  This application was made by the candidate's school and requested extra time for the junior certificate examination, which he is due to take this year.</P>
      <P>Extra time is allowed only in the case of visually impaired candidates, those who need the help of a scribe and those who would be unable to make adequate use of mechanical aids for recording their answers.</P>
      <P>Because the candidate was unable to make adequate use of mechanical aids, ten minutes extra time per scheduled hour of each question paper was approved.</P>

      <P>In relation to the regulation of private third level colleges, the White Paper, Charting our Education Future, provides that such colleges, which run courses which receive State certification, will be subject to new control regulations.  These regulations will be introduced in order to guarantee the academic integrity and quality of the courses and qualifications on offer, prescribe institutional norms and to protect the financial investments of students and their parents.  The White Paper provides that the new regulations will be the responsibility of TEASTAS &mdash; the Irish National Certification Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in the area of formulating educational standards in private colleges.  Under the provisions of the 1995 Finance Act, tax relief is available for fees paid to private colleges which satisfy the Codes of Standards laid down by the Minister for Education. <Col N="410" /> These Codes of Standards were developed by a working group on third level private commercial colleges which I established to advise on the appropriate criteria for recognition of colleges and courses including admission and quality standards.</P>
    <P>The working group was representative of TEASTAS, my Department, the NCEA and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>The working group was also asked to consider the question of academic and financial bonding and consumer protection.  Following careful evaluation of the advice available to it in relation to possible provisions for academic and financial bonding and consumer protection, the working group concluded that such provisions should not be included in the Codes of Standards but should be addressed by my Department in association with TEASTAS and the NCEA and in discussion with the private colleges.  My Department is currently engaged in discussions with the relevant parties in this regard.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment of Ballyconnell national school on 30 September 1996 was 117 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and three assistant teachers for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the fourth assistant's post at the school will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.</P>
      <P>I should remind the Deputy, however, that since I took office I have reduced the pupil teacher ratio at primary level from 25.2 to 1 to 22.2 to 1 in the current school year.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, as St. Kevin's national school does not have the required number of teachers, it is not possible to sanction the appointment of a full-time caretaker to the school.</P>
      <P>I should point out to the Deputy that, as teachers on the substitute panel are based in a particular school mainly for administrative purposes and service the needs of a number of surrounding schools, they are not taken into account when determining the school's eligibility for a full-time caretaker.</P>
      <P>Security arrangements for the school secretary and-or any other person employed in the school are a matter for the board of management as the employing authority.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1997 candidates were not permitted to bring preparatory sketches into the leaving certificate art examination in design.  They were, however, entitled to a mark for sketches of a preliminary nature prepared during the examination itself.  Following consideration of a request by the Art Teachers' Association, the Department decided to allow candidates to bring an A2 page of preparatory sketches into the examination centre as a memory aid on the day of the design examination.  This is seen as a logical extension to the decision to allow candidates sight of the paper seven days prior to the examination.  No marks will be allocated for the prepartory sketches made by candidates prior to the examination. Preliminary sketches and the final drawing carried out during the examination will continmue to qualify for up to 20 marks as in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These quite limited changes were communicated to schools by circular letter on the 28 April 1997 prior to the advance issue of the examination paper to candidates.  As is the norm this circular also listed, for the benefit of students and teachers, the materials which students should <Col N="418" /> bring with them to the various parts of the art examination.  The Department did not at any stage communicate to schools a decision to the effect that preparatory sketches prepared in advance of the examination would in themselves attract a mark.</P>

Of the 115 divorce applications only one divorce has been granted to date.  This divorce was granted in Castlebar Circuit Court.  The Proceedings issued from Castlebar Circuit Court Office on 5 March and the Order was made on 13 March 1997.  In no other case have the necessary pleadings required to enable a divorce application to be listed for hearing in court been filed in the Court Office.  Therefore none of the remaining 114 divorce applications is ready for hearing at this stage.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a prisoner of 82 years who is feeble was bound by wrist breaker handcuffs for a three and a half hour journey from Cork Prison to Arbour Hill Prison, Dublin 7, in view of the fact that he is non-violent, has never attempted to escape and cannot even climb stairs.</Quest>

      <P>If the account presented by the Deputy was accurate there would be reason to question the procedure followed in this case.</P>
      <P>My information, however, is that the picture presented is not, in fact, correct.  By way of background I should say that last year following a number of serious incidents involving prisoners escaping from prison escorts, I ordered a major review of the arrangements in place for prison escorts.  Arising from this review a new type of restraint was introduced into service.  These restraints are more secure than older types while at the same time allowing prisoners ample freedom of movement.  It is incorrect to imply that these restraints are excessively restrictive and certainly quite wrong to describe them as &ldquo;wrist breaker handcuffs&rdquo;.  They are a necessary protection for the public and for the officers who have to escort prisoners, no more or no less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Deputy may, of course, query the use of any form of restraint in the case of an elderly prisoner, he will appreciate that these are operational decisions made by prison staff involved <Col N="426" /> whose job is to weigh up all the relevant considerations in arriving at their decisions.  If the form of restraint being employed involved serious discomfort, then there would be reason to question its use in the case of an elderly offender. However, as that is not the case and the offence was quite serious, I believe it is reasonable that the operational decision required should be left to those whose job it was to make it.</P>

This figure related exclusively to the Minister for Justice and there was no expenditure incurred from my Department's Vote by Minister of State Currie or Minister of State Burton.  No expenditure was incurred for the period from 16 December to 31 December 1994.  However, a sum of £1,660 was expended on ministerial photography from 1 January to 15 December 1994.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 256 and 259 together.  My Department has a programme of regular customer surveys, conducted internally by Department of Social Welfare staff, to ensure on an on-going basis that our services remain relevant and responsive to the needs of our customers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Department commissioned Market Research Bureau of Ireland (MRBI) to conduct an independent survey of both our direct customers and also the general public.  The purpose of the research was to (i) determine the nature and levels of service provided to Social Welfare recipients; (ii) highlight areas of service where improvements are required, and (iii) measure the knowledge of and attitudes towards the Department of Social Welfare and its services among the general public.</P>
      <P>The main fieldwork was conducted in the period February 1996 to June 1996 and the total cost of this survey, including VAT, amounted to £48,006.75.</P>
      <P>The findings of the survey are in the main very positive.  They show that my Department is achieving high levels of satisfaction, both among its direct customers and the general public, regarding the quality of services it delivers.  Customers indicated an overall satisfaction rating of 90 per cent with my Department's services and 85 per cent considered staff to be courteous and polite.</P>
      <P>Of the members of the general public who had contacted my Department in recent years, 69 per cent considered the level of service to be good, 81 per cent would be happy to contact my Department directly when seeking information and 75 per cent believed that there was some element of fraud attached to Social Welfare payments. This was the only survey commissioned by my Department since December 1994 and I can confirm that questions in relation to support for political parties were not included in this research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultation is the key to understanding the perceptions, needs and expectations of the people <Col N="428" /> we serve whether they are direct customers or taxpayers.  My Department, through regular consultation, will continue seeking further improvement in the quality of the services that it delivers whilst also ensuring that our systems and procedures minimise the risk of fraud and abuse and provide value for money for the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Photography services form part of the Department's media and advertising strategy aimed at improving public awareness of the various social welfare schemes and services and supporting the efforts of local community groups to promote their activities.</P>
      <P>The practice for many years has been that when schemes or services are being launched or promoted by the Minister or Minister of State or where conferences-seminars on social welfare issues are held and where the Minister or Minister of State is invited to promote the activities of a local voluntary organisation's services the Department engages the services of a photographer to assist with the publicity associated with such events, some of which the Minister, Minister of State or both may attend.  Several hundred such invitations are received each year and the costs of such photography cannot be regarded as `ministerial' photography as suggested by Deputy Callely.</P>
      <P>On assuming office I took a conscious decision to limit such expenditure.</P>
      <P>The total costs for each of the years 1993-96 for photography services was:</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for diability allowance on 6 November 1996.  At a medical examination conducted on 18 February 1997 the medical assessor considered that the person concerned did not satisfy the medical criteria for receipt of disability allowance and a deciding officer made a decision disallowing the claim.</P>
      <P>The person's appeal against the decision was received at the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 14 April 1997 and he was examined by a different medical assessor on 28 April 1997 who also considered that he did not satisfy the medical criteria necessary for receipt of the allowance.  The person concerned has been notified of the result of the latest medical examination and he has been invited to submit any further evidence he wishes in support of his appeal.  On receipt of this the case will be referred to an appeals officer for consideration.</P>

      <P>The widow's and widower's pension scheme recognises the financial difficulties that may arise for people who are bereaved by the death of their spouse.</P>
      <P>The qualification conditions for a widow's and a widower's (contributory) pension are less onerous than those pertaining to other social welfare pensions reflecting the different nature of the contingencies.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a widow's or widower's (contributory) pension a person may use the full insurance record or the record over the previous three of five years to satisfy the yearly average condition.  Also a widow or widower can qualify on his-her own or their late spouse's record.</P>
      <P>On the 2 January 1997 I introduced a one-parent family payment for one parent families which includes widows and widowers with children.  An earnings disregard of up to £6,000 is available under this programme, which is designed to make employment a more attractive option for those parenting alone, with a view to helping people move away from dependency on social welfare in the longer-term.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 25 February 1997 &mdash; Question No. 250 &mdash; in which I provided details of those measures, which improve the position of widows and widowers, as announced in my budget speech of 23 January 1997, such as: £3.00 a week increase in personal rates and £1.50 a week in the qualified adult allowances from next June; a new widower's non-contributory pension is being introduced on the same basis as that currently applying to widows without children; easing of the means test &mdash; along the lines of the revised assessment for those in receipt on the one parent-family payment &mdash; including the exemption of rental income in certain circumstances; improvements to the free schemes including free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowance and the free travel companion pass; and increase in child benefit for widowed persons with children.</P>
      <P>Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years, or over, and also to certain disabled people under the age of 66.  The other free schemes are available to people, usually 66 or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
      <P>I consider that widows and widowers are treated in an equitable way within the social welfare system.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, he may wish to give me the details so that it can be investigated to ensure that the person is in receipt of his-her full entitlements.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to child benefit.  Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years, regardless of the level of family income, employment or marital status.  Child benefit continues to be paid up to age 19 in the case of children who are still in full-time education and children with disabilities.  The rate of payment is £29 per month for each of the first two qualified children and £34 per month in respect of the third and subsequent qualified children &mdash; increasing to £30 and £39, respectively, from September, 1997.</P>
      <P>The rate of child benefit payable is not determined on the basis of the place of each individual child within the family, but to the number of eligible children in the family.  Where a child is no longer qualified for child benefit purposes, the overall rate of benefit payable is adjusted in accordance with the number of remaining qualified children.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, there are nine children in the family, four of whom are currently qualified for child benefit purposes.  One child will be 19 next month and another child will finish in full-time education in June.  Accordingly, there will be two children who will remain qualified for child benefit from July.  The rate of child benefit payable to the family will, therefore, be the rate appropriate to a two-child family, i.e. £58, increasing to £60 in September.</P>
      <P>One of my main priorities, since taking up office, has been to assist low income families and, in particular, larger families.  This has been achieved by increasing the higher rate of child benefit, payable in respect of third and subsequent children from £25 in 1994 to £39 this year.  In addition, the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first and second child, has been increased from £20 in 1994 to £30 this year.  This represents an overall increase of £10 (50 per cent) in the rate payable in respect of the first two children and £14 (56 per cent in the higher rate payable in respect of third and subsequent children since this Government came to office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 264, 265 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>The day-to-day management of new claims for payments and their subsequent review incorporates a developed structure of measures designed to prevent and to detect cases of abuse and fraud. These procedures and practices consist of general checking of applications and claims in payment, and targeted inspections of certain high-risk categories and groups of claimants.  Such practices would not suggest the levels of abuse referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In 1996, a total of 27,200 new claims from deserted wives, lone parents and widow(er)s were received out of which 164 were rejected on grounds of co-habitation following investigation. A further 6,500 claims in these categories were reviewed during 1996, where there were grounds for suspicion.  Just over 1,000 of these claims were terminated due to cohabitation equivalent to 16 per cent.  The scale of cohabitation identified in these reviews is not considered to be indicative for the lone parent client group as a whole because the reviews were targeted at cases where there were grounds for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of proving desertion was always a contentious and difficult area.  Before a claim from a deserted wife was allowed, it had to be established that desertion had occurred, in that she had been living apart from her husband for at least three months, that her husband had left her of his own volition and that she was making appropriate efforts to seek maintenance from him.  This invariably required detailed investigation <Col N="433" /> by local officers of the Department, involving interviews with the wives concerned and with their husbands where they were traceable.  This often proved difficult and in many cases led to renewed personal difficulties between the spouses concerned.  The new one-parent family payment which commenced on 2 January 1997 no longer seeks to prove desertion as a qualifying condition but instead provides income support on a needs basis for parents with dependent children who are separated, unmarried or widowed.</P>
    <P>There are 100,000 social welfare clients in receipt of a living alone allowance, the vast majority of which are elderly or widowed people. The rules allow pensioners living in specific housing arrangements such as &ldquo;granny flats&rdquo; or certain types of sheltered housing complexes to qualify for the allowance.  Over 8,000 old age and widowed pension claims were reviewed by the Department in 1996, as part of a general reassessment of their continuing entitlement to pension. These reviews normally encompass a reassessment of household composition in order to verify ongoing eligibility for various free scheme supplements and the living alone allowance where payable.  These specific reviews resulted in cessation of living alone allowance in just 335 cases during the year (4 per cent).  Overall, nearly 3,200 living alone allowances were terminated during 1996 for a wide variety of reasons, including routine review and change of pensioner circumstances, including the death of a pensioner.</P>
    <P>A sum of £15.2 million savings on deserted wife's benefit and allowance and on lone parent's allowance were made in 1996.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that all steps necessary are taken to ensure that payments are confined to those who are legally entitled to them.</P>

      <P>My Department issues cards at present to certain persons in receipt of unemployment and disability payments and lone parent allowances. The card is used to facilitate payment of benefits. It is not an identity card, does not contain evidence of age and would not, in its present form, be suitable for the purpose referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>However, an old age pensioner is issued with a free travel pass which should normally suffice to prove that the person concerned is a senior citizen. If any further verification of his or her status as a pensioner is required my Department will provide such verification on request.  In the context of future developments in card technology the question of the provision, on an automated basis, of the type of information referred to will be examined.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the changes, if any, he will make to the rules of the qualifying schemes run by the Department whereby a mentally handicapped person on a disabled person's maintenance allowance and a disability allowance for 15 years, who will receive a private pension of £83 per week when his father dies, will lose his disability allowance, in view of the fact that it will mean that the family will not be eligible for a carer's allowance since this person will not be on social welfare benefit or payment at that time.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Disability allowance, formerly disabled person's allowance, is a means-tested payment for people with long-term disabilities.  The means test takes account, with certain exceptions, of any income which the person may have, including pensions from other sources.  Since taking over responsibility for the administration of the scheme from health boards in 1996 I have made a number of improvements in the means test which have extended entitlement to the allowance to people who would not previously have qualified for the scheme.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is payable to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain disabled persons such as recipients of disability allowance, with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been progressively expanded and improved since its introduction in 1990.  In 1995, for example, it was extended to include carers looking after people aged 66, or over, other than those in receipt of social welfare type pensions, such as occupational pensioners.</P>
      <P>Further improvements in each of these schemes as they apply to people with disabilities will be considered in a budgetary context.  In this connection particular account will be taken of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which made a number of specific recommendations in relation to income support for people with disabilities and their carers.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the ongoing problems with workers on the C45 system and their lack of PRSI contributions; the progress, if any, which has been made in regularising this matter; if any special scheme for construction workers can be introduced as was done with fishermen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In accordance with the Income Tax (Relevant Contracts) Regulations, 1996 introduced by the Revenue Commissioners, the C45 system applies in situations where both the employer and the person being employed have completed a declaration confirming they have satisfied themselves that the contract they propose to enter into is not a contract of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> Self-employed workers under the C45 system, in common with other self-employed workers, are compulsorily insurable under the Social Welfare Acts through the payment of Class S social insurnace contributions.  They are eligible for benefits as follows:</P>
    <P>Widow's/Widower's (Contributory) Pension</P>
    <P>Orphan's (Contributory) Allowance</P>
    <P>Old Age (Contributory) Pension.</P>
    <P>Contributions as self-employed persons, Class S do not reckon for any short-term benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  To extend the range of benefits payable would mean an appreciable increase in the rate of contributions.</P>
    <P>The issue relating to fishermen is a distinctly different issue.  This was a situation where the work of sharefishermen and women, were classified as contracts of work and thereby dealt with as self-employed.  This classification arose due to Government decisions on the matter.  They are now treated as employees, where it is clear they are not partners in a boat.  This reclassification came about due to a European Court of Justice decision on the issue of sharefishermen.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy has a related question tabled for written answer today by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The figures contained in the reply to that question only serve to confirm what was already widely understood, namely that the multinational sector is a very substantial contributor to this country's total merchandise exports.  This contribution is a very welcome one, in terms of jobs and wealth created, both directly and indirectly. However, the focus of my Department, and the State agency responsible for trade promotion, An Bord Tráchtála (ABT), is to encourage the indigenous sector to continue to improve its export performance.  This focus on indigenous firms is reflected in the market development sub-Programme of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development, 1994-99 which, in turn, is the basis for the activities of ABT.</P>

      <P>The issue with which this group is concerned relates to whether the use to which a portion of land sold recently by the IDA for use as a waste site will constitute a threat to the health of the residents of Ballaghaderreen or to its economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the purchaser of the site in question applied to Forfás some time ago for space on a serviced site &ldquo;for recycling <Col N="443" /> purposes&rdquo; in line with current Government conservation and recycling policy.  In the view of IDA Ireland this is an industrial undertaking meeting the criteria set out in the relevant legislation. Markets have been identified for the final product both in Ireland and the UK.</P>
    <P>A contract for the sale of this site has been entered into between IDA Ireland and the purchaser in respect of his industrial undertaking in Ballaghaderreen.  Planning permission for the proposed development has been received from An Bord Pleanála and there is therefore no basis on which IDA Ireland could withdraw from its agreement.  At my meeting with the group on 30 April I reiterated my position which is, essentially, that in the circumstances in which all legal and planning requirements have been complied with by the purchaser, but residents continue to feel there are grounds for concern about the use and location of the site, the most constructive way forward is to establish at local level whether or not any mutually acceptable alternative site is available.  I urged the group to allow some space for such a possibility to be explored by the interested parties and I have reiterated my direction to the IDA to do everything within its power to facilitate a mutually acceptable outcome.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 292 together.</P>
      <P>In my reply during Oral Question Time on 22 April, I gave full details of the written commitments I received from the chief executive of Tesco Plc. by letter dated 4 April.  Since then I have had further discussions with Tesco following which Tesco has also committed itself to an action plan for the Republic of Ireland that includes a number of key undertakings as follows:</P>
      <P>Benchmarking &mdash; Forbairt and Bord Bia have been invited by Tesco to action a benchmarking audit to identify the level of existing Irish sourced products by sector and supplier size.  Tesco intend to invite the ESRI to play a role in this process as an independent organisation.</P>
      <P>Transition Planning Group &mdash; will be established with Forbairt and Bord Bia to advise Tesco on the implementation of their proposals to strengthen and grow the market.  The group will draw on the expertise of the industry and any other relevant State body.</P>
      <P>Annual Targets &mdash; Tesco's development plan, to be completed within eight weeks, will have annual targets by which purchases from Irish companies based in Ireland will increase; the targets to be reviewed regularly in conjunction with Forbairt and Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>Head Office &mdash; will be maintained in Dublin as a base for Republic of Ireland business.  This will act as a buying office for the vast majority of Irish sourced products for the Irish market. Functions such as buying, marketing and pricing will be under the authority of senior management based in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small Businesses &mdash; as part of the supplier development programme, the company will establish a technology transfer team of Tesco technologists based in Ireland to assist the Irish food industry in capacity building measures to <Col N="445" /> enable Irish suppliers, particularly SMEs, to compete in the wider European food market.</P>
    <P>Own Label &mdash; in expanding its own label products, Tesco will foster close relationships with Irish suppliers to develop their competitive capability and meet the company's requirements in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Resources in Republic &mdash; Tesco's commercial Director for Europe has been deployed with responsibility for the Irish market and the development of supply opportunities for Irish suppliers in Ireland and within Europe.</P>
    <P>The action plan to which the Deputy refers includes a number of important initiatives to ensure close and independent monitoring of performance.</P>
    <P>As indicated above, Forbairt and An Bord Bia have been invited by Tesco to action a benchmarking audit to identify the level of existing Irish sourced products by sector and supplier size. The ESRI will be invited to play a role in this process as an independent organisation.</P>
    <P>The Transition Planning Group to be established with Forbairt and An Bord Bia to advise Tesco on the implementation of their proposals to strengthen and grow the market will draw on the expertise of the industry and any other relevant State body.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive development plan will be completed in close consultation with Forbairt and An Bord Bia by the end of June.  The plan will incorporate annual targets by which purchases from Irish companies based in Ireland will increase.  These targets will be reviewed regularly in conjunction with Forbairt and An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>Tesco has also agreed to have the progress towards these targets and initiatives reviewed by me.</P>
    <P>Details of the undertakings have been publicised in the usual way.  It is not normal practice for Ministers to lay correspondence received from individuals and companies before Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that voluntary bodies who train persons with disabilities have suffered a loss in income due to the effects of Irish pound and ECU currency variations on human resource fund transfers from the ESF; the measures, if any, he will take to alleviate this problem; and if he will undertake to safeguard such transfers against currency rate variations.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that ESF draw-downs on behalf of many current Irish ESF beneficiaries, disabled and otherwise, have been impacted negatively by IR£-ECU exchange rate movements over recent months.  Irish ESF commitments are made in ECU and the attention of all beneficiaries is drawn at the time of commitment to the fact that the value in IR£ of particular payments made on foot of their programmes or projects will vary in line with the IR£-ECU exchange rate at the time of the relevant draw-downs.</P>
      <P>The general principle applicable in ESF-funded projects over the years has been that the exchange risk is carried by the beneficiary and not, for example, by the Exchequer through my Departments' Vote or that of the other Ministers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though I am aware that adverse exchange movements present concerned programme and project managers with difficulties, I am not in a position to undertake to safeguard such transfers <Col N="447" /> through assuming the exchange risk.  Exchange rates by their nature vary; indeed in recent years all Irish ESF beneficiaries benefited unexpectedly from more favourable exchange rate movements relative to the time of commitment.  Quite apart from the major exposure to the Exchequer which would arise in offering to meet all exchange risks on ESF receipts which in 1997, I expect to come to some 425 M-ECU, the Deputy will appreciate the practical problems which would arise in attempting to identify the sum required before the year in question.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that voluntary bodies providing training services to people with disabilities have experienced a 10.5 per cent reduction in their income due to current Irish pound and ECU exchange rates and that this has cost them £700,000 so far in 1997; the plans, if any, he has to alleviate the problem; the reason the State passes on the exchange rate losses to the voluntary bodies; the changes, if any, he proposes to make to safeguard this income against exchange rate fluctuations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that many current Irish ESF beneficiaries, disabled and otherwise, have been impacted negatively by IR£-ECU exchange rate movements over recent months.  The degree of impact on particular beneficiaries would depend however on the IR£-ECU exchange rate obtaining on the date payments for their programmes or project were received from Brussels in comparison with the rate obtaining at the time the commitment of support was given.</P>
      <P>Since all Irish ESF commitments are issued in ECU and the attention of beneficiaries is drawn to the fact that the IR£ value of particular payments made on foot of them will vary depending on the exchange rate at the time of those payments, the IR£-ECU rate mentioned in letters of commitment is quite expressly, an indicative rate only.  While I understand the Deputy's concern and acknowledge that the experience of more than a few current ESF beneficiaries obtaining payments over recent months has yielded smaller IR£ sums than the indicative amounts mentioned in commitments letters may have lead beneficiaries to expect, I can assure him that the full ECU amount of all such commitments have been, and continue to be, met.</P>
      <P>The State has over the years, issued ESF commitments in ECU as this is the currency in which the funds are received.  The implications of doing otherwise would leave the Exchequer open to significant exchange risk exposure in the event of adverse movements in the IR£-ECU exchange rate relative to the date of commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that ECU denominated commitments have equally over <Col N="448" /> other recent years yielded unexpected significant benefits to beneficiaries in IR£ terms due to subsequent rate changes.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to change the present system of using ECU commitments for ESF operations or to assume the exchange risks arising.  Quite apart from the significant Exchequer exposure which would arise on the State assuming exchange risks associated with Irish ESF receipts which my Department currently estimates at some 425 M-ECU in 1997, the Deputy will also appreciate the practical and other problems which would arise in attempting to identify the sum required before the year in question.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make changes to the distribution of EU moneys from the Human Resources Fund of the European Social Fund to give voluntary bodies who provide training to people with disabilities better information as to the amount and date of payment in order to alleviate the losses in income so far encountered due to Irish pound and ECU exchange rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The distribution of funding across the measures in the Human Resources Development Operational Programme was negotiated and agreed between Ireland and the EU Commission in 1993 to apply over the 1994-99 funding period. While this distribution can be changed by the decision of the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee which is representative of the Commission and the range of Irish public and private bodies involved, the Deputy should note that all measures in this Operational Programme are equally affected by exchange rate changes and again that EU Regulations preclude from eligibility for ESF costs associated with offsetting exchange rate movements.</P>
      <P>European Social Funds commitments in Ireland are issued in ECU and, at the time of their commitment, the attention of the agencies and beneficiaries involved is drawn to the fact that the IR£ value of payments drawn-down made to them from time to time will vary in line with changes in the IR£ ECU exchange rate. While this has meant that over recent years beneficiaries typically receive either more or less in IR£ than they had expected, it would not be accurate to describe recent outcomes as income losses since the only commitments given were nominated in ECU and are paid in full.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for me or my Department to forecast future exchange rates such that Irish ESF beneficiaries, whether disabled or otherwise, could be assured of certain IR£ amounts on certain dates.</P>

      <P>From the details supplied with the question, the following organisations were funded by my Department: Combat Poverty Agency; Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed; National Women's Council of Ireland; National Youth Council of Ireland; National Youth Federation; and Pavee Point.  The following table shows details of the payments to these organisations. The 1997 column of the table reflects the payments position as at 12 May 1997.</P>
      <P>The table below also includes details of allocations in 1997 which are earmarked for distribution to the organisations listed from the European Social Fund, except that in the case of the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed the amount includes a provision of £63,000 in my Department's 1997 Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed and the National Women's Council of Ireland, both of which received additional moneys directly from the Exchequer, payments were made to the above organisations through the European Social Fund (ESF).  This funding was made available by means <Col N="450" /> of the Employment Initiative.  The aims of the employment initiative are to promote social solidarity and equal opportunities, to contribute to the development of human resources and to improve access to the labour market.  The initiative is targeted towards people experiencing specific difficulties in the labour market and seeks to promote their integration through developing new systems and structures, providing new forms of training and through creating employment.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer funding provided to the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed (INOU) in 1996 amounted to £66,000.  Of this, £31,000 was provided for administrative expenses and £35,000 was provided towards the organisation's costs in organising a conference of the European Network of the Unemployed.  The 1997 Exchequer allocation to the INOU is £63,000 of which £33,000 is for administrative expenses and £30,000 is towards the acquisition and refurbishment of a building by the INOU.  Exchequer funding of £6,458 was provided to the National Women's Council in 1996, under the Support Structures for Employment and Adapt Community Initiatives Subhead of the Department's Estimates, for technical support and monitoring of projects.  The funding or grant allocations made by agencies under the aegis of my Department are a day to day matter for the agencies concerned.  The Deputy should accordingly contact these agencies directly for the information which she requires.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in Forbairt's policy towards funding assistance for small Irish companies manufacturing computer parts. Distribution as a discrete activity is not and has never been eligible for funding assistance.  Both Irish owned and overseas owned companies must meet with the same qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>In order to assess each company's application adequately and to determine its eligibility for grant aid, Forbairt assesses each application on its merits.</P>
      <P>In the case of the company to which the Deputy refers, a series of meetings and discussions were held with the company and with the sectoral specialists within Forbairt to determine the degree of manufacturing, engineering and the level of proprietary technology involved in the company.  Following a first contact in February 1997 and the receipt of information from the company, it was informed on 2 April that the process to which its application referred did not meet these qualifying criteria.  In order to assist the company, a further review was carried out and additional information was provided by the company. This further investigation indicated that the original assessment remained valid and the company was informed of this decision on 8 May 1997.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate the company in every way possible, Forbairt has arranged for one of its Electronic Linkage specialists to meet with the company to determine whether any elements of the project could be further developed to work towards manufacturing status and thereby become eligible for assisstance.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the lack of inward investment to the regions in general, including the Border region.  That is what prompted the Government earlier this year to caterogise regional jobs policy as a priority area for attention.  On foot of this, I announced last March that I had asked IDA Ireland to press ahead with the implementation of a new regional policy for employment growth in locations outside the larger urban centres.  IDA Ireland has committed additional resources at senior executive <Col N="452" /> level to oversee this new focus on the regions which will involve financial incentives will now be biased in favour of smaller regional locations, with higher grant levels as appropriate to each individual case; with the involvement of private sector investors, stimulating and supporting a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key regional locations and working in partnership with local authorities to have available quality, serviced sites at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the decision as to location is ultimately made by the incoming industrialists.  While this will continue to be the case, I feel the new regional policy to be administered by IDA Ireland will give an added bonus to smaller locations.</P>
      <P>On the specific question of the Border region, the Deputy may be interested to know that the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department were actively marketing the region for investment even before the announcement of the new regional policy focus and a certain level of progress has been achieved.</P>
      <P>In the last year, IDA Ireland, for example, issued a number of press reports regarding inward investment and job creation-expansion in the Border counties.  Following is a random sample of such announcements&mdash;</P>

    <P>Forbairt, for its part, with its mandate for promoting the food and natural resource based sectors, has also been busy in attracting investment to the Border region.  The large Heinz facility in Dundalk, secured under the inward investment programme for the food industry, is one of the agency's notable successes in the area.  The forest products sector is another good example of Forbairt's commitment to the area &mdash; the impact of the Masonite project on Leitrim and surrounding counties has already been substantial and the company hopes to increase its employment level to 330 by next year.</P>
    <P>The Border counties are also being assisted by the operation of a number of programmes which have been established with the specific aim of encouraging and developing partnerships between Irish companies in the six Border counties and firms in the US.  I refer the Deputy to Question No. 27 of 6 March last Volume 43, No. 1, columns 112-115 in which I detailed progress under these various programmes and initiatives. To date, 13 partnerships have been secured under these programmes and discussions are ongoing with a number of other companies.  The ultimate <Col N="453" /> aim of these programmes is to strengthen the management and profitability of Irish industry through the provision of training, access to technology and the formation of strategic alliances.</P>
    <P>While not directed at the Border counties specifically, the latter are also likely to benefit from work which is ongoing on the development of a Dublin-Belfast economic corridor.  The joint business council of IBEC/CBI Northern Ireland is currently developing a business plan and longterm strategy for the corridor area aimed at complementing, rather than replacing, existing cross-Border initiatives.</P>

      <P>A community enterprise centre programme has been in place since 1989.  Launched by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in that year, the programme is designed to support community groups which wish to establish enterprise centres in their locality.  I will arrange for an information sheet to be sent to the Deputy giving details of the programme and outlining the criteria with which applicant groups must comply in order to qualify for assistance.</P>

    <P>To date, 52 community groups throughout the country have been assisted to develop an enterprise centre in their particular area.  A list of these groups and the year of approval will issue to the Deputy.  Forbairt is keen to support communities establishing enterprise centres and is, therefore, very committed to the programme. The agency considers the programme has been very successful to date &mdash; already a number of phase II developments have been supported.  Forbairt's regional offices are in discussion at the moment with a number of local groups regarding <Col N="454" /> the possibility of establishing further centres around the country and a number of applications for potential new centres is under consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306, 334, 359, 361, 362, 363, 367 and 369 together.</P>
      <P>During my visit to Egypt last week, I met the Egyptian President, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and Supply and the Minister for Agriculture.  All indicated a political willingness to reopen the Egyptian market to live cattle from Ireland, which I am satisfied would not have been achieved without my visit.  I agreed with the Egyptian Minister for Agriculture that arrangements would be made immediately in regard to finalising a Protocol on the technical conditions under which trade could be resumed.  In effect these conditions would guarantee that the cattle supplied from Ireland were steers not over 30 months of age.  I have already transmitted proposals to Cairo for a memorandum of understanding to cover the trade and I am confident of an early reply.  I cannot give a precise date for resumption of the trade; this will depend on how quickly the details of the Protocol can be finalised.  Once the market reopens, I would hope that, based on previous levels of exports to that market, supply levels in 1997 will be close to 100,000 head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the details of my recent visit, I was in Egypt at the invitiation of An Bord Bia to participate in the Cairo Agro Food Fair.  The ministerial party comprised myself, the Secretary of my Department, the deputy chief veterinary officer, the information officer and my private secretary. The outward journey was undertaken in the Government jet, the return journey at executive class fares on Egypt Air and Aer Lingus.  Internal <Col N="458" /> travel within Egypt was arranged either by the Embassy or by An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>The cost of the visit to the Department included airfares, hotel accommodation, travel and subsistence expenses at civil service rates and gifts for the Egyptian Ministers.  Given that the visit took place only recently, the precise cost to the Department has not yet been computed but I will let the Deputy have this information as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia were represented by its chief operations officer, the director international markets and an exhibitions officer.  An Bord Bia met the travel and other costs in respect of four journalists.  Costs incurred by An Bord Bia in participating in the food fair and in staging a promotion on a major market for Irish beef are a matter for that organisation.</P>
    <P>In so far as Libya is concerned, following an undertaking given during my visit to Tripoli, I recently received a technical delegation from Libya who were in Ireland to observe our controls first hand.  I understand that they were impressed with the measures we have in place and that they made a favourable report to the authorities in Tripoli.  I have written to my opposite number in Libya to impress upon him the need for an early and favourable decision and my office is in regular contact with the authorities there.  I hope that trade will resume later in the year.</P>
    <P>As regards Iran, since I received an Iranian veterinary delegation in October last, a number of contacts at both political and technical level have been made with the Iranian authorities.  I met with an Iranian parliamentary delegation in November and I availed of the opportunity to discuss the current restrictions.  In addition there has been very regular contact through the Irish Embassy in Tehran and the Iranian Embassy in this country.  The current position is that discussions are continuing with a view to agreeing a mutually acceptable veterinary Protocol.</P>
    <P>Trade in beef with Russia is covered by a veterinary Protocol concluded last October.  Although under this Protocol, beef from eight Irish counties is currently excluded from the Russian market, supplies continue to flow unimpeded from other countries.  Exports to date in 1997 exceeed 21,000 tonnes and quantities in excess of 100,000 tonnes are expected to be delivered in the full year 1997. I am in constant contact with the Russian authorities regarding the operation of these restrictions. A high level delegation from my Department visited Moscow in January and I envisage having further discussions with the Russian authorities on the issue when the Russian Deputy Minister for Agriculture visits Ireland next month.</P>

      <P>I put forward a proposal to the EU Commission last year for a top-up premium in member states where the average price was below a certain percentage of the EU average.  This proposal was not accepted by the Commission because of the budgetary implications and the fear that such a mechanism might effect a downward pressure on market prices in the knowledge that producers' incomes would be boosted by the top-up premium.</P>
      <P>I should point out that both Irish and EU market prices for lamb have been at record levels so far this year, and the overall average price in Ireland to the end of April is only 7 per cent below the EU average price.  However, I will pursue this proposal in the appropriate circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of a review of the EU sheepmeat quota regime in 1996, I proposed to the EU Commission that the opportunity should be availed of <Col N="460" /> to examine the wider aspects of the sheepmeat regime.  As part of my submission I raised the question of the payment of an extensification premium on sheep.  However, the Commission consider that sheep production is an extensive farming system and that such a premium would be extremely costly.  Under the REPS programme there are very generous levels of aid available to producers who may have to reduce their flocks size for environmental reasons.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to pursue this issue.  However, it should be recognised that the matter is being considered against a background of record prices prevailing for most of the year and concern about the cost of the regime.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 310 and 377 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of Council Regulation 1323/90 sheep farmers are eligible for payment of the rural world premium if at least 50 per cent of the holding is located in a disadvantaged area and if that area is used for sheep production.  Any increase in the premium or extension of its application would therefore require a proposal from the EU Commission and the approval of the Council of Ministers.  This is unlikely in a year when market prices for lamb have been at record levels.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal to adjust the 16kg, technical coefficient used for the calculation of the ewe premium has been put to the EU Commission on an <Col N="461" /> informal basis.  The Commission pointed out that such an adjustment, even if agreed by member states, would force a differentiation of the premium between northern member states and those in the south where light lamb production predominates. Such a change could lead to a lowering of the premium paid for heavy lambs, reflecting the better market returns for that lamb, in order to avoid an increase in budgetary expenditure for the sheepmeat regime.</P>

In view of this I believe that the application period adopted in 1996 and 1997, with a closing date early in January, is the earliest date which will allow the maximum number of ewes to qualify for a premium. The experience of 1997 and 1996 would indicate that the current arrangement provides the best option for Irish sheep producers.</P>

      <P>The individual to whom the Deputy refers submitted an area aid application in 1996 <Col N="463" /> in which he declared 30.26 hectares of forage area.  On inspection of his holding it transpired that only 16.96 hectares were available as forage area.  The remaining 13.30 hectares were planted with forestry.  According to EU regulations governing the scheme, if the declared area is found on inspection to be greater than the found area by more than 20 per cent then the area declared is reduced to zero leading to no payment of area linked aid under the relevant livestock schemes.</P>
      <P>My Department has carefully examined this case, but given that the overclaim amounted to just over 78 per cent it has no option but to wit-hold livestock scheme payments for the year in question as laid down by the regulations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 317 and 371 together.</P>
      <P>Under the revised arrangements for the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes which were introduced from 1 April 1996 following agreement with the representative farming bodies, responisibility for arranging and paying for the first herd test in each calendar year was devolved to farmers.  My Department will pay for any subsequent herd testing including subsequent contiguous tests in the calendar year.  All contiguous brucellosis testing in 1997 is being paid for by my Department.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that farmers would henceforth meet the cost of a significant part of the testing programme, the diseases levies were reduced by about two thirds from 1 April 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farming organisations have made representations to the effect that my Department should bear the costs of TB tests in circumstances where farmers have already paid for tests in a <Col N="464" /> recent period.  These representations are being considered.</P>

      <P>The background leading to the proposed changes to the compensatory headage payments was outlined in detail to the Deputy on 7 May, Questions Nos. 218 and 219.  As regards the particular proposals to disallow headage payments to farmers who are over 66 years of age in receipt of a contributory pension on 1 January 1998, the position is that such farmers are not eligible to participate in the scheme in accordance with the terms of Council Regulation 2328/91 which states that &ldquo;expenditure in respect of compensatory allowances shall not be eligible for part-financing by the fund where the farmer is in receipt of a retirement or early-retirement pension&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>National standards regarding good livestock management have been in existence for many years and were set by my Department following consultation with the Department of the Environment.  They are designed to ensure that there is minimal risk of pollution arising from livestock production.  The general conditions are set out in the Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates published last year by my Department and the Department of the Environment and also in advisory material for participants in the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme.  Therefore pollution risk assessments of individual farms are not carried out by my Department nor are farmers participating in pollution control schemes operated by my Department required to carry out such assessments.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the control of farm pollution scheme, now suspended, is to enable farmers to construct buildings, waste storage, and fodder storage facilities so as to avoid the risk of pollution from all farmyard wastes including silage effluent and to meet local authority waste storage requirements.  The construction of intensive bovine slatted developments is limited to the production capacity of the holding at a level not exceeding two livestock units per hectare.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>However, it will be appreciated that the success of an initiative of this nature will be dependent not only on the circumstances and timing of its presentation at EU level, but also, of course, on the position taken by the United Kingdom authorities.</P>

      <P>However, I have had the data relating to Monaghan re-examined, and a number of areas have been identified which were not considered during the appeals panel's initial examination.

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to an article in the &ldquo;New Scientist&rdquo; publication concerning a report prepared by Mr. Bewers of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Halifax, Canada. The full report which, I understand, has yet to be published, refers to the detection of the effects of Sellafield discharges in the Arctic waters of Northern Canada.  My Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will study this report closely when published.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly stated that any contamination of the Irish Sea by radioactive discharges from Sellafield is objectionable and unacceptable. The RPII, which publishes the results of its marine radioactivity monitoring programme in regular reports has also stated that it is objectionable that contamination of our marine environment from radioactive discharges should result from the operations of nuclear installations.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, I am at present particularly concerned about the increased technetium-99 levels in the Irish Sea and I have made representations to the UK authorities in that regard.  In addition, Ireland will be represented in London this week at the heads of delegations meeting of the OSPAR Convention on marine pollution of the North East Atlantic, including the Irish Sea.  The Irish delegation will be presenting a specific recommendation concerning radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea from Sellafield and calling for the immediate reduction and elimination of technetium-99 marine discharges.</P>

      <P>The circumstances in which the courts may order the confiscation of a fishing vessel are set out in section 14 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1994.  Such confiscation may arise on conviction for serious breaches of fisheries law.  In particular courts may order a vessel to be confiscated on a first conviction if the offence is considered to have been a serious abuse of conservation measures.  The courts may also order a boat to be confiscated in respect of a second or subsequent conviction committed on board the same boat within three years of the previous offence subject to detailed rules on continuity of ownership which are laid down in section 14.</P>
      <P>It is of course a matter for the courts to determine and impose the penalites available under the law.  While confiscation of vessels has been requested by the State and bonds have been required to be lodged in respect of those vessels, the courts have not applied the penalty of confiscation to date.</P>

      <P>Certain categories of large trawlers are prohibited from fishing within 12 miles of base lines.  It is not <Col N="487" /> realistic to ban all trawling activity in every area where crab pots or other static gear are deployed. The Department has consistently encouraged a non-confrontational approach to resolving problems and has actively promoted dialogue between both sides.</P>
      <P>The Department introduced a mutually agreed code of practice for both local fishermen and trawlermen which is designed to minimise the risk to crab and lobster pots from trawling activities.</P>
      <P>The adoption of the code of practice has widespread support and has been effective in substantially reducing the levels of lost or damaged gear. The Killybegs Fishermens Organisation and the North West Lobstermens Association were both involved in the negotiation of the code of practice and supported its introduction.</P>
      <P>These arrangements offer the fishermen concerned scope for peaceful co-existence and acknowledges the rights of all sides to expect that their legitimate interests will be respected and their livelihoods protected.  The situation will be kept under review and if there are particular incidents needing attention, they will be carefully investigated with a view to facilitating fair and equitable solutions.</P>

      <Quest>the protection, if any, which can be given to the fishermen at Porturlin, Ballina, County Mayo, from the Navy to prevent large trawlers entering their 12 mile zone and damaging their pots.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain categories of larger fishing vessels are precluded from fishing within 12 miles of the base lines.  For example, all vessels licensed under the special whitefish scheme are prohibited from fishing within 12 miles of the base lines.  This restriction also applies to the refrigerated sea water (RSW) boats operating mainly out of Killybegs, except during the horse mackerel fishery.</P>
      <P>It is neither practical nor realistic to ban all trawling activity in every area where crab pots or other static gear may be deployed within the 12 miles limit.  There have been a number of incidents over the years which have resulted in damage or loss of gear owned by lobster and crab fishermen as well as static gear employed by driftnetters.  This has been the cause of considerable tension between local crab and lobster fishermen and trawlermen.</P>
      <P>The fishery protection service is responsible for the enforcement of sea fishery regulations in Irish waters, including inside the 12 mile limit.  The Naval Service is aware of the restrictions on large trawlers, and vessels are liable to be detained if found engaging in illegal fishing activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue raised by the Deputy highlights the need for all concerned at local level to respect the rights of other users of the shared marine resource.  This is a co-management issue which is best resolved through co-operation and dialogue <Col N="488" /> within the framework of an established code of practice which has been worked out between the parties.  The Department will continue to play its part in facilitating that process.</P>

These development works are under way at present.</P>
      <P>Following extensive site investigations and a hydrographic survey carried out in 1996, dredging requirements are being reassessed by the Department, in consultation with the users of the harbour, with a view to drawing up an agreed dredging programme.  The Department is also costing and assessing pier resurfacing proposals in consultation with the users with a view to undertaking these works as a priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The developers, Malahide Marine Village Limited, applied for a permit under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996 to dispose of dredged material associated with the marina development at a site some 35km east of Malahide inlet.  Following assessment of extensive surveys of both the dredge spoil and the proposed dump site as provided for under the OSPAR Convention (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) guidelines, the Department's marine licence vetting committee was satisfied that the dumping operation would have no significant impact on the marine environment and permits were duly issued for the period up to 31 March 1997.</P>
      <P>Due to bad weather and difficulties experienced with the dumping vessel which proved to be unsuitable for the journey to the dump site, the operation was not completed within this timescale and the operators applied to have the permits extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new permit was recently granted to the <Col N="492" /> developers and it is expected that disposal of the spoil heap will be completed by the end of next August.  The delay in issuing this permit was due to the fact that the dumping vessel selected for the project lacked the necessary certification and required to be surveyed.  The vessel has now been surveyed and the necessary certification has been supplied.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the disposal operation will be closely monitored by Department engineers to ensure that permit conditions are complied with and that there will be no adverse impact on shellfish breeding grounds.</P>

      <P>The policy in respect of the national fishing fleet has been to direct EU grants towards the modernisation of fishing vessels.

      <P>In addition to the modernisation programme, following a review of the fleet policy and a recently published consultancy report, I have announced my intention to introduce a pilot scheme for grant aiding the introduction of a number of 24 metre plus all-weather whitefish vessels.  The detailed criteria of the pilot scheme are being finalised and will require EU Commission approval.</P>
