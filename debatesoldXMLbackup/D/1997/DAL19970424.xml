      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is already made.  As this, effectively, is the last week of the House according to the business agreed by the Whips last night, there is no point in asking about legislation other than the 12 or so Bills which are being rammed through next week.  We will facilitate that so that we can move into the general election next Wednesday or Thursday.</P>
      <P>What is the Government doing to avoid the rampant chaos in the health service?  As we conclude this week's business we know that radiographers are likely to join thousands of other paramedics.Will the Minister use his role as Minister for Finance with responsibility for the public service to try to get the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court to involve themselves in this matter?  I have not raised this matter in the last few days but it is getting very serious for many people with disabilities.  It should be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As we adjourn until next Tuesday, it is important that we invite the Minister to indicate what ongoing negotiations are taking place to alleviate the current situation.  All <Col N="435" /> Members of the House are becoming increasingly concerned that it is unconscionable that stroke victims and other helpless and vulnerable people are facing into their second week without essential therapeutic services.  I invite the Minister, in a non-confrontational manner, to reassure the House and the people that moves are afoot to resolve this dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not be aware that the medical laboratory technicians are also balloting next week.  If they join this dispute it will put the entire health service in chaos.  Will the Minister inform us what progress Fine Gael backbenchers have made with the unions whom I understand they have met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations have taken place with the health management authorities and representatives of the workers involved to ensure an adequate level of emergency cover is provided in the course of this dispute.  I want to allay any possible fear that these health workers, whom we all respect, are being irresponsible in regard to their overall duties.  References to stroke victims and other categories of people can be misconstrued.I was somewhat saddened that the Leader of the Opposition, a former Minister for Labour and Finance, should refer to what he called &ldquo;the rampant chaos&rdquo; in the public services.</P>

      <P>The Government, for its part, is prepared to enter into negotiations to have the dispute considered under the process clearly outlined in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  All we ask of any of the social partners is that they observe the terms of the agreement to which they were signatories.  The Government wants to see this dispute resolved in a manner which respects all of the contracts entered into and commitments made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out to the Taoiseach yesterday that, in respect of any matters outstanding under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> the Labour Court is the guarantor as it has been in respect of all national agreements negotiated over the past ten years.  Therefore, whenever a dispute arises out of those agreements, as happened in the case of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> it is the responsibility of the Labour Court to endeavour to resolve it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the reference by Deputy Callely I said in reply to a question from a journalist that this country has the prospect of sustained economic growth over the next five to ten years. However, if we are greedy that prospect will be put at risk.  I refute the allegation which has been repeated: I did not accuse any individual worker or any individual category of workers of being greedy; I referred to &ldquo;all of us&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The lesson of the past ten years, which various Governments have built on, is that sustained negotiation and pay moderation, matched by tax reduction, has provided the kind of success we have all experienced.</P>

Given that radiographers and laboratory technicians are now threatening to go on strike next week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now that it has been acknowledged by the Government that the position is deteriorating rather than static, will the Ceann Comhairle give further consideration to my Private Notice Question?  I understand it was not possible for you to accept it yesterday on the basis of an Adjournment Debate the previous evening and your ruling that there had not been a serious deterioration in the interim.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 77:</P>
      <P>In page 12, to delete lines 22 to 33.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete section 16 which, in effect restricts the ability of a civil servant when giving evidence to express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government.  This is a section with which we had severe difficulty on Committee Stage.  Basically, civil servants who might come before committees are muzzled as to whether in their opinion a policy outlined by Government was a good one.  We had fairly detailed discussion on this item.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are we not taking them together?  My proposal is to delete this section because civil servants should be like other people coming before committees.  I said previously, and I fully accept, there may be civil servants who have, for one reason or another, a gripe with a Department over a pension; for example, a former civil servant.  However, I understand this section refers to an actual civil servant or a member of the Permanent Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána.  Maybe one of those people would have a gripe with their employers, in effect the State, and might be called before a committee of this House to discuss an issue which could involve whether they could express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the Attorney General or the objectives of such policy.  If there was a rare occasion where a civil servant was vexatious that would be quickly found out by the committee and the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, it would be preferable if civil servants had the right to give such evidence, particularly as they might need to defend themselves where their own circumstances might be put into difficulty.  We saw this to a certain extent in the beef tribunal when a Deputy was asked a question and was willing to answer it but was disallowed from doing so <Col N="442" /> because of Cabinet confidentiality.  Similarly, a civil servant before a committee might wish to offer an opinion on the merits of a policy because he or she might believe it necessary to protect and vindicate his or her rights.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposal in this section relates to one of the core elements of the Bill to which we objected when it was introduced.  The Government claimed it would change the institutions of the State and make them more accountable, but in this Bill, with some exceptions, it has continued a policy that is less open, transparent and accountable.  The objective of the Bill as drafted was to put restrictions on committees.It was amended slightly on Committee Stage but the idea behind the legislation from the Government's point of view was that committees should be restricted from asking questions of the various elements of the State apparatus.  That is why I propose the deletion of those lines.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State would outline what the Government proposes in its amendment to the section.  It appears to be convoluted.  It would be the view of all Members of the House, if it were possible to have a free vote on the matter, that a civil servant or a member of the Defence Forces or a garda who might come before a committee should be entitled, within certain restrictions that might be imposed by members of the committee or its chairperson, to express an opinion on a Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's first point.  I am not sure why we cannot discuss amendments Nos. 77 to 83, inclusive, together since they relate to the same topic.  However, I am bound by the rules of the House.  I will deal with some of the Deputy's points when we discuss the next group of amendments.</P>
      <P>I have a different understanding of the objective of the Bill.  However, we can expect political interludes of electioneering in the next couple of weeks.  The objective of the Bill is to allow Members of the House, through committees of the Houses, to address matters of major public concern and that is what it will achieve.  It has been discussed extensively in the Select Committee on Finance and General Affaris whose members represent all sides of the House.  The objective is clear and let us not play politics with it.  The Bill will be an extremely important tool in the armoury of Members to investigate matters of major public concern.  It does not deserve to become a political football just because 1997 is an election year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 77, 78 and 79, while I accepted the points made on Committee Stage that the extent to which the prohibition on civil servants commenting on the merits of Government policy should be specified, I also indicated that the Government had decided that the central point of the section should remain. While Government amendments Nos. 81, 82 and 83 specify when and how the prohibition is to be <Col N="443" /> applied, the prohibition will remain and therefore I cannot agree with the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 78 would prevent a public servant from being compelled to comment on the merits of Government policy when giving evidence to a committee.  However, it would allow public servants to make such comments if they chose voluntarily to do so.  As this could undermine the traditional neutrality and political objectivity of public servants, I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 79, Deputy Michael McDowell said on Committee Stage that it could be reasonably argued that the subsection could prevent a substantial document, such as a report on an area of Government activity, being provided to a committee simply because it contained a few sentences in which policy was questioned.If one were to take a malign view of public servants, he said, it could be alleged that such comments could be included in a document simply to ensure that it could not be made available to a committee.  Amendment No. 79 would limit the exemption from compellability to only those portions of such documents which contained expressions of opinions of public servants on the merits of Government policy.</P>
    <P>Government amendments Nos. 81 and 82 provide for documents containing comments by civil servants on the merits of Government policy to be provided to committees, once those parts of the documents which contain the comments have been removed.  The Secretary of the relevant Department shall be responsible for the removal of such portions from the documents.  These amendments are in response to the points made by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage and provide for the principle of his amendment. There is, therefore, no need for a separate amendment and I cannot agree to it.  I am incorporating the thrust of the Opposition's request on Committee Stage in my amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister of State's view of the legislation.  There are a number of areas in the Bill where there are restrictions on committees.  The Bill does not serve the Members of the House or members of committees and its exceptions and restrictions serve to lessen the ability of committees to inquire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the day the Bill was published the Government set out to make it difficult for committees to make inquiries, although there was some loosening of its provisions on Committee Stage.  The question of whether civil servants should be allowed to express an opinion on the merits of Government policy is an historical issue and has been a source of much concern over the years, particularly outside the Oireachtas.  It has also been a matter of concern for Civil Service and public service unions that, in some instances, their members have been constrained from defending themselves.  The Government's inclusion of this section restricts members of the Civil Service, the Garda Síochána and the Army <Col N="444" /> from not only assisting committees but also in defending themselves on occasions where, perhaps, their silence on the merit of a policy would in effect point the finger at them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 81:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(2) (a) Notwithstanding <i>subsection (1)</i>, where</P>
      <P>(i)  a specified person is directed by a committee to produce or send a specified document to it or to attend before it to produce a specified document to it, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the appropriate person is satisfied that a part, but not the whole, of the document consists of questioning by a specified person of, or the expression by a specified person of an opinion on, the merits of such a policy, or such objectives, as aforesaid,</P>
      <P>the appropriate person shall direct the specified person in writing to produce or, as may be appropriate, send to the committee a copy, prepared under the supervision of the appropriate person, of so much of the document as does not consist of the part aforesaid and the specified person shall comply with the direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  A document prepared pursuant to paragraph (a) shall be signed by the appropriate <Col N="445" /> person concerned and shall contain a statement to the effect that it is prepared pursuant to this subsection and is a copy of so much of the specified document to which the direction concerned relates as does not consist of the part in which the merits of such a policy, or such objectives, as aforesaid are questioned, or an opinion thereon is expressed, by a specified person.</P>
    <P>(c) A document that is produced or sent to a committee pursuant to a direction of the committee and purports to be a document prepared pursuant to this subsection and to comply with paragraph (b) shall be deemed, unless the contrary is shown, to be a copy of so much of the specified document to which the direction relates as does not consist of the part in which the merits of such a policy, or such objectives, as aforesaid are questioned, or an opinion thereon is expressed, by a specified person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that an appropriate person can direct a public service witness called before a committee to provide the committee with a document which contains Civil Service comments on the merits of Government policy when the portion of the document containing such comments has been excised.  The appropriate person shall sign any such document stating that he or she has directed production of the document less any portion containing comments by civil servants on the merits of Government policy.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this and the following amendment is to prevent a situation, as pointed out by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage, where an entire report would be withheld from investigation on the basis that a few sentences contain civil servants' views on the merits of Government policy.  To ensure consistency across Departments, secretaries of Departments are being given responsibility for deciding which portions of documents should be removed and, therefore, exempt from compellability.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 82 specifies that the appropriate person for the purpose of determining what portions of documents containing comments by civil servants on the merits of Government policy should be deleted is the relevant Secretary for civil servants, the Secretary of the Department of Defence for members of the Defence Forces and the Secretary of the Department of Justice for members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see this as a major move.  The Government is proposing that a Secretary of a Department will judge which portions of documents to be given to a committee should be removed.  The committee which investigated the events surrounding the fall of the last Government in 1994 tried time and again to get the Attorney General to come before it to discuss the Brendan Smyth extradition file but he refused. On his instructions, we were not shown a portion <Col N="446" /> of the file.  If memory serves me correctly, it was agreed that counsel for the committee would look at the file to see, whether in his opinion, members of the committee should see it.  This defied logic. It transpired, ultimately, that its contents were not earth shattering but we wished to investigate the sequence of events which led to the seven months' delay in those extradition proceedings.</P>
      <P>While I accept secretaries of Departments will appear before committees to explain why documents were excised, I foresee difficulties in that civil servants will remain faceless &mdash; perhaps the position will change under the SMI.  We will be caught in a maelstrom.  It might be better, therefore, not to include this section in the Bill.  It is so convoluted as to be unworkable.  It is a matter of regret that no one outside the House seems to be worried about what we are doing here to make this a better Bill.  What is being done will be to the detriment of the House in that Members' duty under the Constitution and rights, as elected representatives, to hold the Government, in particular the permanent government, accountable for actions carried out in the name of the people are being restricted.</P>
      <P>While the Minister of State is addressing a particular issue raised on Committee Stage, this section provides further confirmation that the permanent government, assisted by the rainbow coalition which promised openness, transparency and accountability, will not be held accountable. Committees will not have the power to compel witnesses to answer questions to get to the core issues.  Such a system is in place in America.  This amendment does not take that route.  For that reason, I will oppose it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to the efforts made to gain access to the Brendan Smyth file in the Attorney General's office.  In previous discussions I made clear my position and that of the Government.  I underlined the fact that individual cases handled by the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions should not and would not be subject to discussion by committees under this legislation.  If Members stopped and thought about it they would not want individual cases to be debated by committees.  The legal system is well established and independent and there is also the issue of natural justice.  The Deputy gave as an example the Brendan Smyth file and the efforts made to gain access to it.  As the matter was dealt with by the Attorney General it perhaps was not the best example to underline the case he made.</P>

      <P>With respect, the Deputy was talking to Deputy O'Malley and did not hear my response to his last remarks.</P>
      <P>We discussed the Government's view on earlier stages and passed the sections dealing with the Attorney General and the DPP.  I understand the Deputy's views which he clearly expressed at the time.  However, the example given by him is one of the reasons the line adopted by the Government in relation to the Attorney General and the DPP is very sound.  We do not want a committee of the House to discuss named individual cases being dealt with by the Attorney General or the DPP.  This is not the role of the House, it is the role of the legal system.  If a committee was to discuss such cases serious questions would arise about natural justice and due process.</P>
      <P>On the example given by the Deputy, fact will always be compellable before this House.  What we are talking about is the preclusion of general comment on Government policy by civil servants giving evidence before a committee.  Fact can be stated at any time.  Deputy Ahern said that Secretaries of Departments would act as judges in deciding what information should be excised from a document before it is brought before a committee.  I am confident this is the correct role for secretaries or secretaries general, as they are called under the Public Service Management (No. 2) Bill, who are unlikely to certify anything improperly as they will be liable to questioning by existing or future Ministers of any political hue.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister's comments about the Brendan Smyth case as it was a unique case.  One of the core issues in that case was the extradition file, which we were not allowed to see.  We were treated like little boys and girls at the committee in that our counsel was allowed to see the file but we were not. This is the way it will continue to be at committees.If it is found that a secretary or secretary general excised information from a document produced at a committee he will be called before the committee to explain the reasons for this decision.  This will give rise to more delays in terms of the committee's deliberations.  I am opposed to these amendments as they will take away from Members of the House the power to decide what should be heard and give it to someone outside the House.</P>

      <P>In 35 minutes time the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will make a personal explanation to the House and apologise for the seriously wrong information given to me on 26 March in reply to a parliamentary question. Deputy Ahern and the Minister referred to the problems which arose in relation to the Brendan Smyth file.  Given one's experience, one could equally validly refer to the difficulties which have arisen in respect of export refund files in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry where a serious cover-up has gone on over a long period.  Not only was this House given untrue information but the Secretary of the Department gave untrue information to the Committee of Public Accounts on these matters on more than one occasion.  This issue will be partly cleared up by the statement by the Tánaiste but I will invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to make a personal statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>These problems cannot be solved by allowing the secretary of a Department to excise information from a file.  I am very concerned that after the enactment of the Bill a Department could be even more obstructive than it is at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I say this as it will have statutory grounds for refusing to give information whereas up to now it did not have such grounds and merely did it as part of a cover-up to assist who I call &ldquo;the usual beneficiary&rdquo; and to refuse to recover the substantial amounts of money improperly paid to him at the expense of the Exchequer and European Union funds.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister has made a gesture in meeting the concerns expressed by Deputy McDowell and others but more is needed.  These amendments are unsatisfactory.  I agree with Deputy Ahern that no committee of the House will ever be able to properly investigate any matter because the procedure will be long-winded and there will be constant references back to the courts and other authorities such as the Secretaries of Departments.  The new procedure envisaged is hopelessly complex, will bog down any meaningful inquiry and is a bonanza for those who want to constantly resort to the courts.

      <P>If this was Committee Stage I would ask the Minister to look at the matter before Report Stage.  We will not have a further opportunity to debate the Bill, unless it is amended in the Seanad.  If a general election is called the Bill cannot be referred back to the Dáil and will not be passed.  I am not sure if it can come back to the Dáil after the general election.</P>

      <P>I would not like to have to start again on this Bill, certainly not on the basis on which it now stands.  We should start again with a properly drafted Bill that is far less complex and gives clear powers to committees of the House rather than have all these out clauses, which these two amendments represent.</P>

      <P>I noted carefully the comments of the last two contributors and I would like to clarify some points.  Deputy O'Malley said Departments will have statutory grounds to refuse to give information, which is even worse than the current position, and that it strengthens the secretary's hand in terms of refusing to give information.I disagree with that.  Secretaries of Departments, under this section, will not have the power to excise material from files.  They will have the power to prevent sections in papers or documents being presented before a committee if those sections contain comment on Government policy.  They cannot do away with those sections completely; I want to make that quite clear.  This is important.  Public servants are subordinate to their relevant Minister and it is the function of Ministers to decide policy.  Elected Members can criticise that policy.  Civil servants must be, and must be seen to be, politically neutral and this amendment precludes them from commenting in public on Government policy.  One of the major tenets of our public service for decades has been that civil servants were politically neutral in public comment on any Government's performance or policy.  None of us would want to see that change.  To ensure that aspect is preserved we are excluding comments on Government policy from being brought before the House in documents that may have been the subject of discovery, or even voluntarily produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Civil servants are subordinate to Ministers and to the Government of the day.  It is not the role of a civil or public servant to comment on the merits of Government policy.  Their role is quite specific &mdash; to implement the policy of the Government of the day.  Our public and civil servants have managed to do that, whatever the political complexion of the Government in power.  They have moved from one Government to another and served them and the people extremely well.  Deputies will agree there have been very few occasions where accusations were made of public or civil servants behaving politically.Their private views on Government policy are sometimes well known but it is not their function nor are they employed to comment publicly on Government policy, and that is as it should continue to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated before Deputy O'Malley came into the Chamber, these amendments are in response <Col N="450" /> to the points raised by Deputy McDowell.  They will ensure a one line comment on the merit of Government policy in a 60 page document does not prevent the entire document being brought before a committee.  Secretaries General will be allowed to excise the one line which refers to Government policy so that the remainder of the document can be put before the committee in question.</P>
    <P>We have gone a long way towards resolving a problem correctly pointed out by the Opposition on Committee Stage.  The amendment will also ensure that a mischievous one line comment on Government policy &mdash; people quickly get to know how to use techniques in these Houses &mdash; will not prevent a document being brought before a committee in the future.  We are addressing the problem highlighted by Deputy McDowell by allowing the Secretary General to excise from the document being produced before the committee the line referring to Government policy.  The Secretary General cannot literally excise it from the material on file, unless he or she is behaving with massive impropriety.  We cannot legislate for that, we can only assume our public servants will continue as they have to date and behave with propriety.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to comment on what Deputy O'Malley said about the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the beef tribunal. I note his comments.  It is not my position to comment on that today.  Others will probably resolve that matter on another occasion.</P>
    <P>The general experience has been that our public servants behave with propriety at all times.  We cannot assume otherwise when we are producing legislation.  Secretaries of Departments in particular, the most senior public or civil servants, have a very responsible position.  The Government does not have any difficulty with the function being given to Department secretaries to excise from documents being produced to the committee any comment on Government policy.  All facts on documents are compellable, even those stated by public servants.  The Government is of the view that public servants should not comment on Government policy in the first place and should not be discussed at these committees.  It has never been the place of public servants, and I hope it never will be, to comment on Government policy. If we allow that, the apolitical nature of our public service will be gone with the stroke of a pen and the passing of legislation.  That is not the intention.  I hope Deputies understand the intent of this amendment.  We are responding to a legitimate point raised on Committee Stage and the power being given to Secretaries of Departments in relation to it is quite narrow.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Malley. The reason I opposed the last two amendments is because of my general view, in regard to section 16 as it was put into the Bill originally, that the whole rationale behind this secrecy is wrong, even though the Minister was inclined to put in an amendment.  I refer the Minister to amendment No. 81 where it is left to a secretary to decide whether a comment on a policy is a comment on its merits.  This whole area is fraught with difficulty.Why is the Minister excluding the Director of Consumer Affairs but not the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; I accept that he is dealt with separately, but there are other categories?  Could somebody from the Revenue Commissioners be called before the committee, and would there be a difficulty in that case regarding the ability of the committee to get him or her to comment on matters of policy?  What about the appeals commissioners?Under this legislation the staff under the Comptroller and Auditor General are regarded as civil servants.  Might there not be difficulty in asking any of them before a committee because they might also be exempted from this legislation and prevented from commenting?  The Comptroller and Auditor General would, in effect, be able to excise comments from a document in relation to policy.  While I welcome the exclusion of the Director of Consumer Affairs, I question why others are not included.  Like Deputy O'Malley, I am suspicious of the fact that we were not given an exhaustive list of those who might or might not be involved in this legislation. We can think of only a few while we debate in the House.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is not a civil servant, but his staff are civil servants. This, again, is a problem.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputies O'Malley and Ahern, I want to clarify the effect of this amendment.  This amendment exempts the Director of Consumer Affairs from the prohibition in the previous sections on civil servants commenting on the merits &mdash; I emphasise merits &mdash; of Government policy.  All civil servants can comment on Government policy, but not on its merits.They may not express their personal view as to whether it is good, bad or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference, and it is done.  Deputy O'Malley mentioned the Ombudsman.The Ombudsman is not a civil servant so he does not need to be exempted under this amendment from the prohibition on civil servants from commenting on the merits of Government policy. Effectively, he is compellable as is anyone else, if the committee feels it wants to call him.  He can actually comment on Government policy because, if he is not a civil servant, he cannot be exempted.  Similarly, the Governor of the Central Bank is not a civil servant, but could be compelled under this legislation to attend a committee if the committee found there was a need to compel him to do so, and this amendment would not apply to him.  Similarly, the Data Protection Commissioner is not a civil servant.  Neither is the Comptroller and Auditor General who is dealt with under separate legislation, but his staff are civil servants.  The Revenue Commissioners, being civil servants, also come under this, as do appeals commissioners who are public servants. This amendment, which exempts the Director of Consumer Affairs, is mentioned specifically because he is a civil servant, but he should be able to comment on the merits of Government policy as it impacts on the customers of public services generally.  I hope I have made clear the distinction between the different categories.</P>

    <P>There is very little difference between our views and those of the Minister on this matter.  I would ask the Minister, rather than propose her amendments, to accept those of the Opposition because they provide for increased fines.  Unfortunately, in amendment No. 88 the Minister has reduced the maximum term of imprisonment.  To accept the Opposition amendments would emphasise the toughness with which we as Oireachtas Members wish those who commit an offence under this Bill to be dealt with by the law.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for facilitating me to make a statement.  I wish to correct the record in respect of my written reply of 26 March to Question No. 94 from Deputy O'Malley. On further examination of this matter and in the light of information which arrived after the reply was delivered, I have ascertained that that reply was erroneous in two important respects.  It was not my intention to mislead Deputy O'Malley or the Dáil, and Deputy O'Malley acknowledged that fact in his comments at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday.</P>
      <P>In his Dáil question Deputy O'Malley asked me about documentation, a signature on which was authenticated by the embassy in Baghdad on 5 March 1990, which referred to Irish beef exported to Iraq.  I stated in my reply that no fine was imposed by the European Commission on foot of any certificate in the batch authenticated by the embassy on 5 March 1990.  This information was based on a misunderstanding of background material supplied to my Department by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. The disallowance imposed by the European Commission involved four certificates from 1989 which had been included in that batch.  I also stated in my reply of 26 March that only one of the documents authenticated on that occasion had been signed &ldquo;C. Peyron pp T. Gurney&rdquo;.  I have since learned that two other certificates in that batch bore the same signature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The records of the embassy in Baghdad were destroyed at the time of evacuation during the Gulf War and were not available for reference in researching the reply to the Deputy's question. As the Deputy had not provided me with a copy of the certificate to which his question referred, I based my reply on a batch of 23 certificates from Bureau Veritas, which had already been provided <Col N="458" /> by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I understood this batch to contain all the certificates in question.  I now know it did not include two further certificates signed &ldquo;C. Peyron pp T. Gurney&rdquo;.  They were in a batch of three brought to my Department's attention by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry on 7 April and supplied, I understand, to the Committee of Public Accounts on the same day.  One of them was also sent to my Department by Deputy O'Malley the following day.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has confirmed that it did not pay export refunds on foot of any of those three certificates. It has stated that as far as it can establish at this stage, all the Bureau Veritas certificates submitted to that Department by AIBP in regard to beef exports to Iraq have been located, but given the age of the files concerned &mdash; up to nine years &mdash; and the fact that most of the associated files are no longer available, it cannot be absolutely certain of this.  It is important to emphasise that the function of the embassy in this matter was to authenticate the signature of the Bureau Veritas commercial manager in Baghdad, Mr. J. Lopuszynski, and that this was the only signature authenticated by the Ambassador.</P>
    <P>Irish diplomatic and consular officers abroad routinely authenticate signatures and seals on foreign documents for use in Ireland.  Their sole function in these cases is to certify the authenticity of the signature or seal on the document, not the genuineness, legality or credibility of the document or its contents.  The normal practice is that officers may certify that a signature on a document is genuine if the person signing appears before them, establishes his or her identity and either signs the document in the presence of the officer or acknowledges that the signature on the document is his or hers or they know the signature on the document to be genuine, for example, by comparison with a specimen signature in his or her possession or from personal knowledge.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley wrote to me about this matter on 8 April mentioning, among other points, the Bureau Veritas stamps which appear on certain documents.  The then Ambassador in Baghdad has confirmed that he authenticated only the signature of the Bureau Veritas commercial manager, Mr. J. Lopuszynski, and the word &ldquo;seal&rdquo; was crossed off for this reason.</P>
    <P>I regret the error on the day I answered the question.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 85:</P>
    <P>In page 12, line 42, to delete &ldquo;£1,500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£3,000 or a term of imprisonment of not less than 1 year or both such fine and term of imprisonment&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell expressed concern on Second and Committee Stages that financial penalties alone would be inadequate to guarantee attendance by wealthy, but reluctant, witnesses who would be prepared to pay the fines rather than discuss sensitive information.  Provision for custodial sentences, both on summary conviction and indictment, has been made and this should overcome reluctance of wealthy witnesses to appear.  As it is the prospect, rather than the length, of incarceration which would most likely encourage co-operation, it is felt that a one year maximum on summary conviction and a two year maximum jail sentence on indictment are long enough.  With the possibility of jail now being provided for, increasing the maxima of fines is less important and the financial penalties are not being changed.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 85 would provide for an increase in the fine on summary conviction from £1,500 to £3,000 &mdash; which brings it outside the jurisdiction of the District Court &mdash; and for a term of imprisonment of one year.  For this and other reasons I have stated, a maximum fine of £1,500 is adequate and I cannot agree to the amendment that would provide a higher figure. As Government amendment No. 86 provides for the same level of imprisonment as proposed in this amendment, this element is being met and there is no need for a further amendment on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 86, subsection (1) of this section provides penalties for witnesses who fail to obey a direction to appear before a <Col N="460" /> committee, who refuse to answer questions if they do appear or who refuse to provide documents or do anything before a committee that would amount to contempt of court, if done in a court of law.  The penalties include a maximum fine of £1,500 on summary conviction and £20,000 on indictment.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the circumstances in which offences are committed and provides the penalties for them.  Prosecution of alleged offenders would, of course, take place through the courts in the normal way.  There is no question of Oireachtas committees fining or imprisoning anybody.A fine of £1,500 is the correct maximum as is the current maximum applied by the District Court on summary conviction.  Also, a maximum custodial sentence of 12 months is a sufficient deterrent for reluctant witnesses who would be prepared to pay a fine rather than answer potentially embarrassing questions.  The prospect of incarceration should be sufficient to loosen many reluctant tongues.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 87 would provide for an increase in the fine on indictment from £20,000 to £50,000 or a term of imprisonment of not less than five years.  For the reasons I stated regarding Government amendment No. 87, it is not felt that a greater fine or maximum period of imprisonment would encourage co-operation any more than the amount set out in that amendment. Therefore, I cannot agree to the levels suggested in amendment No. 87.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 88 would provide for a fine on indictment of £20,000 and-or a maximum of two years imprisonment.  As I indicated in regard to amendment No. 86, given that it is the prospect, rather than the length, of incarceration that would encourage co-operation and loosen reluctant tongues, a two year maximum sentence is ample for the purposes of overcoming reluctance in witnesses.  It is felt that increasing the fine beyond £20,000 would not matter greatly to wealthy witnesses.  The threat of incarceration would have a greater effect in lossening tongues.  Therefore, it is not proposed to increase the amount in my amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 3 (7) provides that witnesses who fail to obey a direction to attend before a committee, refuse to answer questions when they do attend, refuse to provide a document to a committee or refuse to obey any other reasonable request of a committee or commit the equivalent of contempt of court shall be guilty of an offence.  Section 3 (8) makes a similar provision for the equivalent of perjury.  This subsection provides that a person may not be punished twice for refusal to comply with the same direction, they may be punished under section 3 (7) or 3 (8), but not under both in relation to the same direction.  They may, of course, be punished for offences committed under both subsections in relation to different directions.  This amendment was tabled in response to comments made by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage that there was a danger of double jeopardy if both subsections were strictly applied in regard to the same direction. The amendment removes that danger.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)(a)  If either House of the Oireachtas by resolution so declares, this Act, in so far as it applies to that House, the Chairman and members of, and committees appointed by, that House, subcommittees of such committees and the joint staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, shall come into operation on such day as may be specified in the resolution.</P>
      <P>(b)  If each House of the Oireachtas by resolution so declares, this Act, in so far as it relates to committees appointed jointly by both such Houses and subcommittees of such committees, shall come into operation on such day as may be specified in the resolution.</P>
      <P>(c)  If either House of the Oireachtas by resolution so declares, this Act, in so far as it applies to that House, the Chairman and members of, and committees appointed by, that House, subcommittees of such committees and the joint staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, shall cease to be in operation as on and from such day as may be specified in the resolution.</P>

      <P>This amendment provides for the Oireachtas, either by resolution of either House in relation to committees or subcommittees of one or either House or by joint resolution for joint committees or joint subcommittees, to fix the date by which the Bill may come into operation.  A similar procedure is provided for in relation to the Act ceasing to operate.  This amendment preserves the right of each House of the Oireachtas to regulate its business by making a resolution of each House essential to bring it into force in respect of that House of the Oireachtas by allowing each House to terminate its application.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 91 provides for the coming into force of the Bill as decided by either House of the Oireachtas subject to the Standing Orders of either House.  As amendment No. 90 provides for enactment by resolution by either or both Houses, I deem it unnecessary.</P>

      <P>The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Privileges, Compellability and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill is one of the most important reforming legislation to come before this House in recent years.  It is part of a programme of legislative change which is transforming the business of the public services, including the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a modernising Bill.  By providing the powers contained in this Bill to committees of the Oireachtas we are catching up with parliaments in other jurisdictions which exercise powers of compellability similar to those set out in this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill enhances the institutions of democracy in the State.  Elected public representatives meeting in a national assembly ought to be involved at the centre of the action when questions of major public concern need to be addressed.  Now we will have the means to act effectively on such matters. It is a challenging Bill; it challenges members of the relevant committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas to use these new powers to demand answers, to seek the truth and to present the facts to the Oireachtas, Government and the citizens of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the significance of the work we are doing today.  Empowering certain committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas in a manner which will allow them to get to the heart of substantial issues of public interest and concern has the potential to transform the role of the Dáil and the Seanad in public life.  In many respects we have moved into uncharted waters with this Bill.  Members on all sides who have been closely involved in the debate on Committee Stage understand the scope and potential of the Bill.  They also understand the difficulties and the sensitivities we have had to tease out in relation to this Bill, but that is not necessarily the case for those outside this House.  The full effects and implications of the provisions of the Bill will not become clear to the general public until the Houses of the Oireachtas develop the practice and techniques of investigating matters under the compellability powers provided in this legislation. When these implications become more widely known and the powers conferred by the Bill come to be exercised, some greater application of the <Col N="464" /> valuable work done in this House today will be more widely acknowledged.</P>
    <P>In our work on this Bill we in Government have been at some pains to emphasise that in no way do we mean to jeopardise the rights of individuals under the Constitution or in terms of natural justice by conferring these compellability powers to Oireachtas Members.  In a nutshell, compellability has to be balanced realistically and meaningfully by authority to confer immunity and privileges.  In certain fairly narrow instances it has been necessary to include restrictions and exemptions in relation to compellability power. These restrictions and exemptions are there to make this Bill workable and to ensure that nothing is done to undermine the right conduct of public affairs, the courts or the security of the State.  The restrictions are not there to provide cover for any person or organisation who should legitimately be subject to compellability on the same basis as every other citizen.</P>
    <P>In presenting this Bill, if we ignored the arguments for limited but prudent and necessary constraints on compellability included in its provisions, no one would thank us &mdash; least of all the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Moreover, as I said in my opening remarks last week, this is not simply a Government Bill presented in a partisan way to the Dáil.  As will be clear from a reading of the Bill following Report Stage, this is a much changed Bill compared to the Second Stage text.  I have already acknowledged the tremendous contributions of Deputies on all sides during the Committee Stage debate. This process, while sometimes difficult for both sides, has given us a better statutory mechanism for addressing the core issues than would otherwise have been the case.  As a result of this debate, it is a Bill which now fairly reflects the broad range of views and opinions across the House on the main provisions.  It is a credit to the Members of this House and to the committee system through which the Bill was examined that so many Deputies have been willing to make such a commitment of time and effort into developing these complex proposals and honing a positive legal basis for facilitating the investigative role of Oireachtas Committees.</P>
    <P>I particularly thank Deputy Ahern, the Whip of the main Opposition party and his party's spokesperson on this Bill for his contribution which demanded a good deal of extra time and effort on a day when he has an extremely busy timetable.  I thank him for his consistent commitment.Apart from myself, he is the only Member who was present at all times during the protracted debate on all Stages of the Bill.  I also thank Deputies O'Malley and McDowell for their contributions.Deputy O'Malley might convey my thanks to Deputy McDowell for his particular interest and his specialty which contributed to the Bill considerably at different Stages, as I indicated as we went through different amendments.</P>
    <P>I undertook to return to a number of matters raised, particularly some of those raised by <Col N="465" /> Deputies Ahern and McDowell during last week's debate.  First, on a point raised by Deputy Ahern, I want to clarify more precisely which committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas we envisage will act under compellability.  The option of compellability provided for in the Bill is to apply only to those committees which have powers to call persons and papers specified in their terms of reference.  I am advised that the committees which at present have such powers are: the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, the Committee of Public Accounts, the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, the Joint Committee on Sustainable Development, the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services, the Joint Committee on the Family, and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and each subcommittee of that committee.  I should point out that this power is qualified in relation to the foreign affairs committee to the extent that information need not be provided if a member of the Government certifies in writing that such information is confidential or that its disclosure would be prejudicial to the State's international relations.</P>
    <P>In general the select committees, such as the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, the Select Committee on Social Affairs, the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, and the Select Committee on Legislation and Security Committee, do not have powers to send for persons and papers, nor do functional committees such as the restaurant committee.</P>
    <P>Amendments to Oireachtas Committees' terms of reference is rightly the responsibility of the relevant House of the Oireachtas.  Moreover, it is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide when these amendments should be made.  Deputy McDowell raised in this House last week a question which was not ventilated when the Bill was under consideration by the subcommittee of the Committee on Finance and General Affairs nor, so far as I know, was it raised by the Senior Counsel which that Committee engaged to assist it in evaluating the provisions of the Bill.  The Deputy drew attention to the fact that the powers and immunities the Bill proposes will be exercisable on the same terms by an Oireachtas committee which meets certain specified criteria irrespective of whether that committee is established by this House, Seanad Éireann or is a joint committee.  In this, Deputy McDowell gave an accurate statement of what the Bill contains and it reflects accurately the intentions of the Government.  I am aware the Constitution makes clear distinctions between the functions of each House and that in the crucial areas of financial affairs, the making and unmaking of Governments and the pursuit of Ministers through parliamentary questions, the role of the Dáil is unique.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell conjures up the possibility that the Seanad may at some point decide to establish committees which either duplicate those established by this House or which trespass upon <Col N="466" /> matters which are in essence appropriate only to the Dáil and that conferral of compellability on such committees could result in organs of the two Houses reaching different or even conflicting conclusions.  The first is theoretically possible even now &mdash; but I am not aware that at any time since 1937, Seanad Éireann attempted to establish a Committee of Public Accounts.  Public disputes between upper and lower Houses in other countries are not unknown but I am not aware of one here since the eighteenth century.  I am subject to correction on that.</P>

      <P>I do not deny that in the malign scenario constructed by Deputy McDowell, the parallel exercise of the new powers in relation to the same subject matter by committees of two distinct Houses could enhance the possibility of such conflict.  A man so professionally attuned to the litigious bent of our fellow countrymen and women knows &mdash; as would every Senator &mdash; that the exercise of the new powers against that background would put any exercise of such power in a manner which trenched upon the prerogatives of this House in jeopardy.  There is a well-established tradition of co-operation between the two Houses in our jurisdiction influenced, no doubt, by the regular interchange of personnel between them.  I hope none of us present will change House in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>In line with that tradition, and having regard to the independence of each House, I will, on the enactment of the Bill, draw the attention of the Committees of Procedure and Privileges of each House to the desirability of their entering into a concordat on the manner in which they will operate it.</P>
      <P>Both the Government and I appreciate the work of Deputies of this House who have together crafted this Bill.  We have done a good day's work.  I thank my officials and advisers in the Department of Finance for their commitment, support and advice which was over and above the call of duty on many occasions.  I thank you, a Leas Cheann Comhairle, the Ceann Comhairle and the staff of the House for their co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the passing of this Bill.  I thank the Minister for her comments, particularly those regarding me.  I thank her for her attendance on Committee Stage and her endeavours to substantially amend parts of the Bill between Committee and Report Stages &mdash; all parties believed these amendments were necessary.  This Bill has huge implications and ramifications for Oireachtas Members and our future lifestyles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill when passed will make our lives more difficult.  The terms and conditions, including pay, of Oireachtas Members will have to be looked at <Col N="467" /> in the implementation of a Bill of this magnitude. The staff of the House will have to be upgraded if this Bill is to mean anything.  They are already working overtime and to the pin of their collars. The powers which this Bill confers will place an even greater burden on them.  If this Bill is passed &mdash; I appreciate it will take some time to go through the Seanad &mdash; it is important that the necessary back-up be given not only to Deputies and Senators but also to the staff of the House.</P>
    <P>Despite the amendments made, this legislation has not gone as far as it could have.  I regret it does not protect the division of power between the Oireachtas and the Executive.  When we considered this Bill for nearly a year before it was dealt with on Committee Stage, we thought there was too much of an onus on the protection of the Executive as opposed to the power of the Oireachtas Members to make the Executive accountable.  When I finish my Oireachtas career &mdash; I hope it will not be in the coming weeks &mdash; my participation in this Bill will not rate as one of my great achievements, if I have any.  With all due respect to the Minister, we could have gone further than we did.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and her officials for their co-operation.  The Bill was publicly contentious.  I thank the Minister for her comments at the start of Report Stage.  She countered what was said on the airwaves by a Labour Deputy by saying that I and my cohorts were not filibustering this Bill. We endeavoured to make this Bill better than the one originally published.  I cannot say it is much better, but with the passage of time we will see how it works in the committees of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the media are probably not interested, but the passage of this Bill is an important event for those who are concerned about parliamentary manners and powers.  The principle that inquiries can be made by the Oireachtas is an important one.  Theoretically that provision has always existed, in practice, perhaps apart from the Committee of Public Accounts, it was not utilised.</P>
      <P>While the principle is important the method of its implementation in this Bill is deficient and inadequate.  As Deputy Dermot Ahern said, there is too much protection of the Executive.  The Bill is riddled with exemptions, exclusions and opportunities for people who might be investigated by committees of the Oireachtas to go to court to hold up the procedure and inquiry for long periods of time.  One of the consequences of this is if these committees are to operate as envisaged in the Bill, some Deputies will have to sit on them almost full-time.  I do not think this House has come to terms with this.  It will have to.</P>
      <P>Some excellent work was done in the consideration of this Bill, especially by Deputies Dermot Ahern and Michael McDowell who had to devote a great deal of time to it.  Unfortunately the nature of our system is such that they will get no thanks or recognition for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> Equally, those who will sit on the committees established under this Bill will have to devote considerable time, much of it privately, and for which they will get no thanks.  We will have to think about how this Bill will operate if those who operate it in the spirit intended and in the spirit of the Constitution will suffer huge electoral penalties for doing so.  Unhappily, because of the nature of our system and the manner in which it is reported, that is how it will work.  Those who make the greatest effort in the House are frequently penalised to the greatest extent and those who hardly look in on the House reap the electoral reward.  I blame, at least in part, the media because they skim the superficialities of parliamentary activity rather than look at the reality of it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is notable because it scarcely bears any resemblance to that introduced on Second Stage.  That is to the credit of the Minister of State and those who took part in the debate.  The Bill has been greatly changed because when it was introduced in the House it was appallingly deficient.  I now regard it as deficient and not appallingly deficient.  The Bill, once implemented for a relatively short time, will have to be amended because a number of difficulties will arise.  Even on Report Stage, a quarter of an hour ago, we identified situations which could arise.  It is almost impossible with legislation in virgin territory to cover every eventuality.  We have dealt in detail with some of the eventualities but I am afraid we have ignored others.</P>
    <P>An issue which will give rise to much difficulty in the two Houses, particularly in the Dáil, is the fairly arbitrary list of committees which will enjoy these powers and the equally arbitrary exclusion of others which will not enjoy them.  It is hard to understand the basis for that distinction.  If, for example, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and each of its sub-committees will be conferred with the powers, as the Minister of State suggested, why exclude the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs which is a type of parallel committee dealing with much the same issues?  If the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Family, which is hardly one of the more important committees, will be given these powers, why is the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs excluded?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The House decides.  The Bill does not confer those powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it decides to confer powers to send for people and papers, the House, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, should look again at the committees which will have these powers.  I do not know why some of these committees should have these powers while others are excluded, particularly the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, which should have these powers.  The Select Committee on Legislation and Security should also have these powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> The Bill will be amended soon after its implementation.I am afraid it will be the subject of much litigation if there are people who have the mentality and the pocket to enable them resort to litigation, and there are such people.  Frequently they are the ones who require investigation.</P>
    <P>We are thinking in terms of outsiders, those outside the House and the public service, being compelled and being given certain privileges and immunities under the Bill.  We have, whether we admit it or not, a serious difficulty with one Department to which I referred earlier.  The Tánaiste was forced to come into the House to make a personal statement of apology, which was probably the first time he had to do so in his career.  He did so because he was given wrong information by a Department and not his own Department.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was also given wrong information which he conveyed to the House and which he should withdraw.  We have a serious difficulty with a small section of a Department.</P>
    <P>When I talk about this Department, I am not referring to its 2,000 or 3,000 employees but to a small number of people who for reasons best known to themselves have, for many years, consistently tried to obstruct investigations and conceal certain matters where enormous financial benefit was conferred on one individual.  One of the by-products of their activities is that the State has been fined £80 million for malpractices by the Department &mdash; and not by exporters &mdash; and for the non-enforcement of European Union regulations.There has been only one beneficiary from that non-enforcement.  While he benefits and gets moneys to which he is not entitled, the cost is borne not by the EU, which would have been prepared to bear the cost if it was found to be irrecoverable after efforts had made to recover it, but by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that this Department should consistently refuse to seek to recover moneys wrongly paid.  This Bill must be judged on how Departments are prepared to react to it and whether they are prepared to co-operate with it in the spirit the House intended.  While the majority of Departments will co-operate, I hope that all Departments will ultimately do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great pleasure in presenting the Public Service Management (No. 2) Bill, 1997, to Dáil Éireann today.  It is the single most important legislative initiative affecting the structure of the public service in a generation.  There are those who might be forgiven for thinking that the question <Col N="470" /> of change and development in the management of the public services is rather esoteric and best left to Ministers, their civil servants and, perhaps, a few obscure academics.  Yet there are few issues which, in their practical effects, have a greater impact across a wider spectrum of our economy and society than the quality and delivery of public services by the institutions of central Government.</P>
    <P>Let us reflect for a moment on the importance of the institutions of central Government to the basic realities of life and work.  Take for example, the vital role of the Department of Finance, where I am Minister of State.  In co-operation with other agencies, including the Central Bank and National Treasury Management Agency, and among a wide range of duties, the Department of Finance ensures the day to day achievement of Government monetary and financial policies. These are manifested in the stability of the exchange rate of the Irish pound, correspondingly low interest rates and inflation, overall control of Government spending and a sustainable configuration of Government borrowing and debt.  The Department of Finance also has direct responsibility for public service management and development and is the lynchpin at official level of the new management initiative across the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Government social policies on health, education and welfare make huge administrative and organisational demands, as do the regulatory and supervisory functions of the branches of the public services administered by the Departments of the Environment and Transport, Energy and Communications.  How many farmers can be unaware of the functions of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and its many responsibilities, such as its role as an intervention agency with the European Union?  Moreover, the fundamental prerogatives of Government in defending the external integrity and interests of the State and internal security and order are given effect through the administration of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Justice.  One could choose many other similar examples.</P>
    <P>The Bill will, in essence, provide a structure for high performance management in the Civil Service.High performance management is the key to the successful delivery of quality services, whether private or public.  In turn, high performance in public service management and value for money in the delivery of public services can only be assured where highly skilled and well motivated staff are working under the guidance of a clear and consistent strategy using effective and efficient systems of administration.  Moreover, these fundamental components of good administration must be brought together within a framework which integrates these various factors. This framework must give coherence to the objectives of the diverse elements of governmental organisation.</P>
    <P>There must be a structure at the heart of the <Col N="471" /> public services which is fully in sympathy with our open, democratic and parliamentary system of government.  At the same time, it must employ best practice in organisational and management techniques to serve the citizens of this State who are the clients and customers of the public services.The new management structure to be put in place by means of the Public Service Management (No. 2) Bill meets these needs.  Getting this structure right is not easy; neither is it a once and for all task.  It demands ongoing commitments at both political and official levels.  On balance, we have not done so badly in this regard.  Notwithstanding some well publicised difficulties in recent years, this country has been well served by our public services.</P>
    <P>The Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, embodies the basic statutory provisions affecting the organisation of Departments of State and the responsibilities of Ministers to Dáil Éireann.  That this Act has remained broadly unchanged for more than 70 years is a tribute to the wisdom and foresight of those courageous men and women who founded this State.  Working with their civil servants under enormous pressures, they crafted the 1924 Act which brought coherence and order to the administrative mess inherited from the British.  It reorganised the complex mix of &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; departments, sections of UK departments, offices, boards and commissions through which the British governed this country into the basic departmental pattern with which we are familiar today.  Although the Ministers and Secretaries Act was drafted and brought through Dáil Éireann in those bitter days during and immediately after the Civil War, the structure and organisation of the Irish public services in 1924 facilitated and supported the democratic and peaceful transition of political power less than a decade later.  One does not need to be a lawyer to see how many of the arrangements for central Government in the 1924 Act are exactly mirrored in the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>The scale and complexity of Government has increased exponentially since the foundation of the State, especially over the past 30 years.  It is time for change.  We must be prepared to manage the changes which need to be made within our own sphere of influence and control.  We must do this because it is certain changes in the wider world which affect us but arise beyond our power of direction are happening apace.  For example, the changes arising from the opening up of the Irish economy have made huge demands on the administration of central Government.  The response of the Civil Service to the growing importance of our relationship with the institutions of the European Union is an example of successful change and evolution in the core areas of the public service.</P>
    <P>The milestones of European integration loom large in any review of this country's development over the last quarter of a century: accession to the Common Market in the early 1970s; founding <Col N="472" /> membership of the European Monetary System in 1979; negotiating the Single European Act in the 1980s and removing the remaining restrictions on trade within the European Community; designing and managing the implementation of two Community support frameworks under which Ireland has received crucial investment funding from Structural Funds; playing a key role in designing the Maastricht Treaty and, more recently, moving towards full participation in economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Adapting to the changes brought by these fundamental building blocks of European law has been among the major challenges faced by Irish political leaders and the Civil Service over the past 25 years.  The success of the Civil Service in meeting these challenges is indicative of an underlying strength based on competence and flexibility in all Departments of State and offices and at all levels of the organisation.  Irish civil servants have made a major contribution in the negotiations at Council working groups on key EU directives, whether on tax law, environmental policy and employment and social policies.</P>
    <P>The management of the Presidency of the European Union by Ireland has been recognised widely as highly productive and successful, notwithstanding our limited resources compared to larger member states.  During our most recent Presidency last year, the zeal and dedication of officials across the Civil Service which contributed to achieving the goals set by the Government for the Presidency programme was fully appreciated and acknowledged.  I am confident the contribution of the Civil Service towards the building of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the EU over the next few years will be no less competent.</P>
    <P>In considering these successes I would not want to ignore the fact that real problems have emerged in relation to some aspects of central Government administration.  Given the pace and magnitude of the changes in the environment affecting the public services, it would have been more surprising if difficulties had not arisen. Nevertheless, I remain confident the process of renewal in the public service is being built on firm foundations with respect to basic structures, administrative systems and the skill and dedication of the personnel involved.  Much depends on how we respond to the evident difficulties and, in this respect, there are good grounds for confidence.</P>
    <P>The new management initiative, known as the strategic management initiative, of which the Public Service Management Bill is an integral part, forms the cornerstone of the Government's response to the needs of public service reform and development.  This process involves a critical self-examination of roles and mandates, analyses of strengths and weaknesses and, crucially, identification of clients and their needs.  Following the formal launch of the document, <i>Strategic Management Initiative,</i> by the then Taoiseach in 1994, three key objectives were set for Departments <Col N="473" /> and offices of the Civil Service: to make a greater contribution to national development; to provide excellent services to the public and other clients and to make best use of available resources.  In essence, the strategic management initiative requires each Department and office, under ministerial direction, to take stock of what it is doing, to determine what it should do in the context of its mandate, Government objectives and client needs and to identify what steps or strategies it should pursue to that end.  This process of searching self-analysis is intended to ensure ongoing improvements in efficiency and effectiveness in Civil Service management.</P>
    <P>This is not a once-off exercise but an ongoing cycle of questioning what public service managers are doing, assessing how well they are performing, asking what changes should be made, setting and reviewing objectives and measuring their achievement.  This new focus on a strategic approach to addressing management issues, in conjunction with work carried out a by a co-ordinating group of Secretaries, led to proposals for a major programme of change in the Civil Service. This was set out in <i>Delivering Better Government</i> which was formally launched by the Taoiseach in May last year.  It sets down a framework for change within an overall vision for the Civil Service which embraces a series of interacting, interdependent initiatives which collectively will improve the management and performance of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The fundamental objective is to meet the needs of Government and the public more efficiently, effectively and economically.  Under Delivering Better Government, working groups, involving senior civil servants and non-civil servants, have been set up to develop initiatives in the areas of service delivery, openness and transparency, regulatory reform, human resource management, financial management and information technology.A working group was also established to advise on legislation required to underpin the change process.  This group provided valuable assistance in drafting the Public Service Management Bill.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the importance of this legislative dimension of the strategic management initiative. Earlier, incomplete phases of public service reform lacked the cutting edge of legislation. Legislation is important for many reasons but the primary benefit is that it provides a basis in statute for the assignment of authority and the creation of mechanisms of accountability within the structure of Civil Service management.</P>
    <P>As Delivering Better Government states: &ldquo;It has long been recognised that the existing structures and reporting systems promote a risk-averse environment where taking personal responsibility is not encouraged and, equally, where innovative approaches to service delivery have not been developed&rdquo;.  Indeed, it is fair to say that long-standing practice has tended to demand detailed accountability from Ministers in relation to matters in which they may have no direct or immediate <Col N="474" /> involvement.  As a result, in some cases the mechanisms of accountability have come to seem almost detached from reality.</P>
    <P>A main reason for this lack of clarity is that the role of civil servants under current law, including that of Secretaries, is inadequately addressed. This has given rise over time to a tendency for decisions to be taken at too high a level and for authority to become unduly centralised.  This, in turn, has resulted in structures which do not always ensure optimal levels of efficiency and effectiveness.  Under the provisions of the Public Service Management Bill this will be changed decisively.</P>
    <P>When the new management structures being provided for in the Bill are in place, the ground work for making public service organisations more accountable, more efficient, more effective and more responsive to the needs of the public will have been laid.  The purpose of the new management structure is quite explicit: it will enhance the management, effectiveness and transparency of operations of Departments and offices and increase the accountability of civil servants.  At the same time the discretion of Ministers in relation to the administration of their Departments is virtually unchanged and the responsibility of Government to Dáil Éireann is preserved.</P>
    <P>This qualification is needed to conform to the demands of democratic accountability of members of the Government as provided for in the Constitution.  The Bill provides a legal basis for assigning, under a Minister, specified tasks to Secretaries of Departments who are now to be designated Secretaries General.  These assignments will allow Secretaries General a greater degree of operational autonomy in the day-to-day management of Departments of State.</P>
    <P>The matters which may be assigned to Secretaries General and other civil servants are dealt with in detail in sections 4 and 9 of the Bill.  In essence, these core sections provide that Secretaries General will be given formal responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Department. This will involve implementing and monitoring policies, delivering the goods and services of the Department to its customers and clients and giving advice to the Minister in relation to the wider concerns of his or her Department.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are matching the needs of effective internal management in the Civil Service with the constitutional requirement that the Government be answerable to this House and that individual Ministers be &ldquo;in charge of&rdquo; their Departments.  That has involved, in crucial sections of the Bill, a very careful balancing act between these two requirements.  What will be done under those sections will be in the context of ultimate ministerial accountability to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Bill leaves three areas where the involvement of Ministers will be unmistakable.  First, strategy statements will be drawn up in the context of policies set by the Minister.  Second, strategy <Col N="475" /> statements will be approved by the Minister with or without amendment and he or she will have the responsibility to ensure that they are adjusted to changing circumstances.  Third, Ministers will retain in all assigned matters a power to issue directions in writing.  These arrangements ensure that the Bill comes within the parameters of constitutional propriety where ministerial responsibility is concerned.  They also identify the points within the administrative process in which the personal input of the Minister is required. The Minister will retain the full legal responsibility for what is done within his or her Department and will remain answerable to this House.</P>
    <P>However, we hope that as assignments are made and publicised and other accountability mechanisms for Civil Service management come into play, the House itself may see its way to modify its Standing Orders in a manner which reflects the new structure, but that, I stress, is a matter for decision by the House, not by Ministers.</P>
    <P>Strategy statements are unequivocally the key instruments in ensuring the success of the process of change under this Bill.  They have a significance not just for civil servants, Ministers and Ministers of State.  The strategy statements are also a means of empowerment for Deputies and a form of service guarantee for customers and clients of Departments and offices.</P>
    <P>Strategy statements are important for civil servants because they will provide the basis for them to exercise greater initiative in the administration of central Government.  Through the strategy statements, staff in all Departments and offices will have a clear and consistent understanding of precisely what is expected of them in their particular jobs.  They will give Ministers and Ministers of State a clear and unambiguous account of how the policy objectives set by Government are to be achieved.  Members of Dáil Éireann will have laid before them formal statements of strategy from every Department and office across the Civil Service.  Together, these will form a comprehensive programme of objectives and outputs comprising the business of the public services.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, the strategy statements will provide valid and accessible standards for judging levels of quality and performance in the delivery of public services to the general public.  Under the impact of these strategy statements, the new management structure will expose the organisation, role, functioning and operation of the Civil Service to investigation and evaluation and to public accountability, effectively and democratically.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, a Secretary General will be responsible for examining and developing means to improve the provision of cost-effective services and ensuring that the Department's resources are used appropriately and with respect to value for money.  These latter responsibilities are consistent with the functions of Secretaries General as Accounting Officers, who are required to appear <Col N="476" /> before and account to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>A further provision is the requirement that the Secretary General will make arrangements in relation to cross-departmental matters.  This is a crucial provision in that it recognises a key structural deficiency in the way we address issues of major political importance and public interest which cut across the responsibilities of more than one Department.  Matters such as the protection of children or the drugs issue have raised questions which can be resolved only through the closest co-operation between different agencies, offices and Departments.  By giving these arrangements a basis in statute, this Bill will give greater focus and a renewed impetus to policies in these matters.</P>
    <P>Subject to existing legislation, Secretaries General will also be given responsibility for appointments, performance, discipline and dismissal in relation to staff of their Departments below the level of Principal.  These responsibilities will be exercised in addition to the functions which a Secretary normally exercises at present in the routine management of all staff in his or her Department. Section 9 of the Bill further provides that the Secretary General will assign responsibility downwards through the organisation to other officers or grades of officer in the Department.</P>
    <P>The exercise of these responsibilities by Secretaries General and other civil servants will ensure that work done in the various parts of the Civil Service will be performed in a more focused way and in a manner which more clearly delineates the responsibilities of individual civil servants.  I have no doubt that over time this new structure will provide better value to taxpayers for the amount of public expenditure allocated to running Departments of State.  It will also provide the basis for a better standard of service to the customers and clients of Departments and offices.  In addition, and no less improtantly, it will enhance the job satisfaction and, therefore, the performance of civil servants.</P>
    <P>Why are we making provision for the appointment of special advisers?  We are doing so because the Bill is concerned with how Departments and offices are managed.  At the core of the Bill is the arrangement that Secretaries General will be responsible for the internal management of their Departments: staff in the Department will be answerable to them for their work. Without the specific provision under which special advisers are accountable to Ministers or Ministers of State, they would fall within the Secretary General's domain in that respect.</P>
    <P>Given that the function of special advisers is to provide an independent and more politically focused source of advice to officeholders &mdash; a role which may require them to act as devil's advocate on proposals made by a Secretary General or his or her senior personnel &mdash; such a line of accountability seems inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The changes introduced by this Bill will have <Col N="477" /> resonances well beyond the core Civil Service and fit into a broader programme of development and renewal.  Indeed, as Minister of State with responsibility for public service reform, I have been busy in other crucial areas.  One area where real progress is already being made is in customer services in the commercial State sector.</P>
    <P>As many Members will be aware, I launched a code of practice on 15 January this year which consists of a commitment by the State companies on customer service in a number of crucial areas. These include quality, consultation, information, choice and proper complaints mechanisms.</P>
    <P>The code sets out basic commitments to be met by all of the participating companies who have subscribed to this code of practice.  Each State company is different, of course, and their customers' needs vary.  Thus, they are free to draw up their own customer charters to cater specifically for the needs of their customers provided they adhere to the fundamental principles set out in this code of practice.  Both Telecom Éireann and the Electricity Supply Board, involved in the drawing up of this code, have since published their own customer charters.</P>
    <P>My intention is that all the State companies will not only meet but surpass the requirements of this code.  I know public companies have the capability to do this.  It will mean public companies must take the issue of customer service as seriously as they take that of financial performance.Any company that takes its customer service seriously will perform well.  In the private sector it is virtually axiomatic that good companies have high standards of customer service.  It is all the more important in the public sector that customer service is afforded a high priority as, in most cases, the State companies are the sole suppliers of the particular service.</P>
    <P>About this time last year I spoke here at some length on the subject of customer service in the commercial State companies and promised to return to the House a year later to update Members on developments in this area.  I will take this opportunity to elaborate on some of the customer service improvements which have been introduced by State companies.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has implemented the code of practice in full.  Posters and brochures are well placed around airports.  New &ldquo;opinion meters&rdquo;, a computerised survey, are being placed in strategic locations around airports to gauge customer opinion and reaction to the service being offered.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board published a new customer charter in February last &mdash; including service guarantees backed by payments to customers where the ESB fails to meet guaranteed service level.  A customer complaints procedure and a national call centre are being developed by the ESB in addition to a major network renewal project in rural areas costing £230 million over five years to improve the quality of supply to some 150,000 customers.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus improved seating, gold circle parking in Dublin and the introduction of a premier <Col N="478" /> service on continental European services.  All were initiatives introduced in 1996.  In addition, a new check-in at Dublin Airport for Aer Lingus commuters will open in July 1997.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna plans to launch a customer service charter in September 1997 and a code of practice has been implemented throughout the organisation.  Bord na Móna intends to involve distributors in the formulation of a customer service plan for their retailers and customers.</P>
    <P>The Bord Gáis Éireann code of practice has been implemented and improvements effected in all areas.  Networks have been extended and its customer service programme strengthened by senior management appointments.</P>
    <P>A national computerised customer database is in operation and a national telephone system networked for ease of contact.  A directory of services is being drafted and its complaints and redress system is under review.</P>
    <P>At present Córas Iompair Éireann is working on punctuality and reliability, cleanliness, customer comfort, information, communications, facilities for people with mobility difficulties and other problems.  It is intended that specific targets be set in each area and performance subject to periodic &mdash; I suggest annual &mdash; independent audit.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann launched a customer charter in May 1996 which included guarantees on line installation and maintenance with credits to customers for non-compliance by Telecom Éireann. Use of customer panels has been expanded and telephone support has been improved by the use of special access numbers.  An appointments system for installation and repairs has also been introduced, in addition to which planned initiatives include the establishment of a fully integrated complaints procedure in 1997, a revamp of the customer charter and further development of the appointment system.  I must re-emphasise the importance of these legislative proposals.  As the House will be aware, the Bill has already been improved in a number of important respects in its passage through Seanad Éireann.  I take this opportunity to thank Senators from all sides for their very positive response to the Bill and for the lively debate on its provisions and fundamental principles enshrined therein.  One of the most significant improvements adopted in Seanad Éireann was that in relation to the limitation on the numbers of special advisers appointed by Ministers and Ministers of State under section 5. That provision had not been included in the original text but a very convincing case was made for it particularly in the course of Committee Stage in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The positive response of the Government to proposals for improving the Bill in this and other respects indicates that this Bill should not be seen in a partisan or adversarial light.  Administrative efficiency and effectiveness concern Members in both Houses.  Our citizens have a right to expect the highest standards of management in the operation of the public services.  The specific provisions <Col N="479" /> of this Bill, and the wider strategic management initiative of which these legislative proposals form such a crucial part, deserve all of our commitment and support.  Collectively, the measures encompassed by the Bill will deliver the most positive and constructive changes in the conduct of the public services in a generation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, particularly its main thrust, which gives greater delegated authority and responsibility to senior civil servants.  It is important this authority should filter through Civil Service ranks since it is civil servants who, in practice, undertake most of the work.  That is one of the key issues in this area.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill constitute very important steps with enormous implications for the country as a whole and its public services.  We are very fortunate to have an excellent, intelligent, bright, capable Civil Service whose members have demonstrated their abilities in the performance of their duties, particularly within Europe since we joined the European Community, where they have consistently strongly upheld our stance on various issues as they arose, endorsed by respective Ministers at Council of Ministers meetings.  Without their continuous, dedicated work it would have been very difficult for us to have achieved what we have in Europe, to have been recognised or commanded due respect within that wider community forum.</P>
      <P>The same can be said about many other spheres of the operations of the Civil Service since the foundation of the State.  There is a great need for more openness and interaction with the community, business people and people in the wider public service.  A good deal has been done over the years but it is time for a more mature approach.  That will require different characteristics from civil servants.  In many respects they will be less protected from all the difficulties, even the ethical ones, which will arise as they work more closely with business and the community.Our objectives must be clear and pursued with great vigour.</P>
      <P>That we should debate this Bill now is strange. In the past Sean Lemass and TK Whitaker, Secretary of the Department of Finance, worked jointly and openly in developing the Irish Civil Service and in promoting the concept of development corporations within Departments.  That was far seeing vision long before its time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Devlin report of 1969 attempted to build on that vision and create two separate areas within the service &mdash; the Aireacht and the Executive.Almost 30 years later we are putting flesh on the bones of the Aireacht and the Executive and dealing with that issue in a practical and detailed way.  It is regrettable that more progress was not made sooner.  That is not to suggest Devlin was right in everything he said in his voluminous report which I am sure most civil servants <Col N="480" /> are aware of if they have not read it in detail.  Some were not born when he published his report.  It was a far seeing report, and looked down the road to what we are doing now.</P>
    <P>In the meantime some Departments have gone a long way towards the Executive operation and have hived off many functions to either semi-State bodies or executive operations within the Departments.  For example, in the Department of Health the health boards were established and a great deal of the day to day work went to the health boards.  The Department of Social Welfare, with which I was particularly familiar, created the social welfare services office to deliver the service and ultimately created a director general of that office and assistant directors. By and large that has worked extremely well.  It is an interesting model given our discussions because there are sensitive and important issues we must address in this context, such as access by public representatives to problems and issues which arise.  Urgent matters may be raised in the House, and responses will come through to the House.  We are aware of the difficulty in relation to commercial semi-State bodies which by and large are overseen in their policy performance but their day to day operation is left to the semi-State body.  That is as it should be, but in some areas it is important that we have access to them in the House quickly.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Bill is right.  The delegation of authority and responsibility is particularly important.  An important principle in all of this which must not be missed is the principle of co-ordination.  That principle provides that where there is authority there must be equal responsibility.That has been one of the problems in the Civil Service.  Frequently one has responsibility without having the authority.  It is important to maintain a balance between the two.  While that may be an important management principle it is often neglected when we come to the operation of our public service because of the hierarchical system and the vesting of so much of the power in the secretary and the top staff of the Department.That inhibits the staff down the line from implementing quickly and effectively the decisions they would take.  That issue will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>We refer to the new powers being given to the secretary of the Department &mdash; or the new secretary general &mdash; but we have to realise that will be of little benefit if we do not equalise the authority with the responsibility down the line.  That equalisation would generate a vibrant and effective service which would certainly deliver the optimum service for the citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>In most businesses nowadays each individual is a manager and we have to recognise that in the Civil Service.  We have highly qualified, skilled and dedicated people at different levels in the service and do not fully recognise that each of these people is a manager of certain areas of activity.</P>
    <P>While the general thrust of the report is right and it is important that it be proceeded with <Col N="481" /> urgently along with the whole process of modernising our public service, there are important issues I would like to mention.  When making these changes we must make provision to ensure adequate safeguards for the interests of the citizens.We are not simply dealing with a financial return from a business.  A business has to have its social concern and most successful businesses exhibit a social concern in one way or another, and try to make a contribution on a wider basis than in its moneymaking operation.  However, the public service has a special responsibility to citizens not just today but for the future.  Decisions made in the public sector can have a long time-span for implementation.  The public service is not chasing the quick buck or the medium term buck, but looks after the interests of citizens from the cradle to the grave.  The full effect of decisions one makes today may not be evident for five or ten years.  One must therefore be more careful. One must research the position and know what one is talking about.  It is a classic difference between business and the public service.  In business one makes a decision and gets on with the job.  If it goes wrong, one can change direction immediately to another which will yield profit at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The public sector is different because one's decision will influence the lives and well-being of people throughout the country not just for forthcoming weeks but for many years in the future. We have seen that mistakes in the public sector can have devastating effects which can affect people for many years.  We do not want to discover that we have become efficient in doing our business and then have our successors discover we forgot the effects which would emerge in the future.  People involved in public administration understand that this is an important issue.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the buck should stop with the Minister.  Difficulty arises if certain activities are hived off.  Let us take activities in the area of social assistance, where people live in poverty and under great stress.  One might have effective officials who get the job done and deliver results at the end of the year.  However, after some time one might discover those officials were leaning hard on people who were not in a position to defend themselves.  Our system is particularly effective at picking up such situations and reporting them to the Dáil or to the Department. A good client relationship exists in the Department of Social Welfare.  Ministers must address these cases as urgent priorities.  A Minister cannot claim to be busy launching a major poverty strategy document if 100 people are in acute distress and need his or her attention.  He or she cannot claim they are a minor matter in comparison with the policy document.  The Minister will have to account to the House and that aspect of the operation of the public service is crucial.</P>
    <P>Some changes in the Bill have been imported from other countries.  The Minister of State has <Col N="482" /> referred to visits to Australia, New Zealand and other countries.  Some of the changes were previously imported from New Zealand to the UK by Margaret Thatcher.  However, the way we use the changes is most important.  We must have our own way of implementing them.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to separate policy from day to day operations in a Department.  That is fine. One does not want the Minister to be involved in daily operations or interfering with the operation of a Department.  People must be free to deliver the service and in many cases they are and deliver the service particularly well.  The separation of policy and daily operations can improve performance in terms of efficiency.  Delegation of authority and responsibility to a secretary general will introduce greater clarity into the workings of Departments.  Nevertheless, where Departments deal with highly sensitive matters which affect citizens, the Minister must be in close contact not only with the policy area but also with the practices as they affect people.  It is particularly important we do not lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Secretaries Act provides that the Secretary is the Accounting Officer or treasurer of the Department.  He or she accounts for spending and other financial matters to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is a vital function that is generally well done by the Secretaries. The Minister has the role of managing director while the Secretary has the role of general manager, if one is to make a comparison with the business sector.  That means the Minister must be familiar and in touch with everything that happens in the Department.  One might claim a Minister cannot do that, but if one is dealing with sensitive areas such as health and social welfare &mdash; two Departments in which I served &mdash; the Minister cannot operate effectively unless he or she is in contact with the factory floor, as it were.</P>
    <P>People who participate in management studies or management programmes in America, Ireland or other countries are always told that top class managers must be in touch with the factory floor. If one is not in touch with the factory floor, one will not know what is happening each day.  How many times have management conferences been presented by renowned personalities at international and national venues, which are attended by hundreds of people, in which the lecturer has said simple things such as: &ldquo;If one is not in touch with the factory floor, one will not know one's business and if one does not know one's business one is not doing one's job&rdquo;?  That applies to a Minister as much as it applies to a business manager because the Minister is given the seal of office and responsibility for the Department by the President.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State emphasised that point when she told the House that a Minister will retain full legal responsibility for what is done within his or her Department and will remain answerable to the House.  While arrangements might be most effective, I cannot envisage a way in which the Minister is not ultimately responsible <Col N="483" /> for everything that happens in his or her Department.Great effort is being made to separate the functions.  It can be done by assigning responsibility and authority at different levels.  If a member of the Civil Service is a higher executive officer, for example, he or she has specific responsibilities and authority that cannot be evaded.  He or she must, therefore, be answerable for those responsibilities.</P>
    <P>However, as far as the people are concerned, the Minister is responsible for overall operations and policy.  There cannot be policy without practice and one cannot talk about policy in a vacuum.There is no point is saying the policy is somewhere in Leinster House where the Deputies talk about it and we have plenty of nice reports.  The committees can do that, but the Minister's job is to be in touch down the line as far as the customers or clients.  In other words, the Minister must keep in contact with the factory floor.  The buck still stops with the Minister and that is particularly important.  Perhaps the way in which we measure the buck should be more sophisticated.  If someone with authority and responsibility at a particular level fails, it will be clear where the breakdown occurred and that must be recognised and identified.  This issue will be tackled under the system the Minister of State proposes to put in place.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not work unless the Official Secrets Act is changed.  Every civil servant has to sign a circular which binds him or her to secrecy. Unless they are freed from this requirement the culture of secrecy and the inhibitions which prevent openness, transparency and an outward looking service will remain intact.  If we want an interactive service under which civil servants work with members of the community and business, they should be able to make decisions in their own right and feel free to communicate information without big brother looking over their shoulder and carpeting them when things do not work out.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Bill should prove helpful in this regard.  The Minister of State concerned, however, ran away from the issue of the Official Secrets Act and said it would be considered later.  A committee of the House impressed on the Government the need to change that Act urgently.  Unfortunately, the issue has been put on the long finger.  Fianna Fáil proposed as an alternative a limited confidentiality list covering essential security and legal matters.  This would allow more interactive management and replace the bulk of the Official Secrets Act.  The all-embracing circular which civil servants are required to sign is outdated and undermines what the Minister of State is seeking to do in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a need for greater flexibility.  One of the restrictions which prevent the effective operation of the Civil Service is the vertical and hierarchal structures in place.  In tackling the major problems of drugs and disadvantage in communities, there is a need to establish interdepartmental <Col N="484" /> project teams.  As the Minister of State mentioned, the Bill contains a welcome measure which provides for cross-departmental activities. This is of vital importance as there is a need for lateral thinking.  The Civil Service is badly structured for such activities.</P>
    <P>I battled for years to have interdepartmental teams established to tackle the drugs problem. Thankfully, that is now beginning to happen by consent and agreement.  The support structures, however, are inadequate.  This raises the question of promotions and rewards within the Civil Service.Those who do excellent work on the ground are not rewarded.  To win the war against drugs and disadvantage there is a requirement to delegate authority and responsibility to interdepartmental project teams headed by a project leader. The Bill must provide for this as well as for performance measurement and rewards based on the achievement of specific objectives.  Civil servants who achieve success in developing disadvantaged communities must be adequately rewarded by way of promotion.</P>
    <P>There must be assurances that the newly appointed managers will not abuse their powers. Secretaries general will have the right to hire and fire staff.  There is a need to clarify the new powers being given to secretaries general, assistant secretaries and principal officers, of which there are 290.  There are approximately 31,000 civil servants.There must be adequate safeguards to protect the interests of assistant principals, higher executive officers and all other grades from abuse of the new powers being granted, unfair dismissal and the prevention of promotions in particular cases.  These powers will have to be the subject of considerable consultations with the trade unions.</P>
    <P>While higher officers will welcome these new powers and argue that this will make for a more efficient service and that certain members of staff are not performing, they will have the power to promote staff &mdash; the people they chose.  There is a need, therefore, for further consideration before the Bill comes into operation.  It is more important than ever before to ensure there is no favouritism or abuse.  We have to be aware of the potential dangers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions under which a limit will be placed on the number of special advisers who may be appointed.  I accept the points made by the Minister of State in this regard.</P>
    <P>This is interesting and important legislation which is vital to the achievement of our objectives.I hope the incoming Government will carry on the good work as the country as a whole will benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taken aback by the Bill.  It is not as great as the Minister of State claims.  Its terms raise many more questions that they answer.  The Bill does not herald the new golden age for the public service implied by the Minister; rather it could imply a very serious set of problems for the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the public service needs <Col N="485" /> to be reformed but it is beyond dispute that we are putting in place a &ldquo;model&rdquo; of public service reform which is less than satisfactory.  We should have looked to New Zealand in devising a proper system of accountability, reform and performance in the public service.  The New Zealand state services commission has a very different role <i>vis-á-vis</i> its public service than is thought appropriate for this country.  New Zealand and Ireland are similar economically and culturally and we have similar legal and parliamentary systems.  Yet it has gone down a completely different route in relation to public sector performance and accountability.</P>
    <P>In New Zealand the public services commission, on behalf of the public, does a deal with the management of a Department, sets out performance criteria, is involved in the appointment of heads of Departments, demands compliance with the contract and remunerates the head of the Department and his staff in accordance with the level of compliance with specified targets in the contract.  We need a similar system.  We do not need a strategy document drawn up by the Minister, we need a much better system under which, say, the management of the Department of Social Welfare work to a contract entered into with it on behalf of the public by a body which sets performance criteria and remunerates the head of the Department according to his capacity to discharge his contractual obligations.  That is the type of radical reproach we need.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a terrible disappointment and does not go down this road.  We would have had a much better Bill if the New Zealand model had been followed.  This would offend the ideology of the left wing parties who decide every matter in Government but it is the only way to turn around the role of the public service in society and remunerate and reward well those in the public service who do such a good job, as the great majority of public servants do, on behalf of the public.  I am profoundly disappointed with the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 will not have the effect canvassed for them.  The Bill is not a charter for ministerial responsibility for the 21st century.  Section 4 will prove problematical and difficult for Ministers.It is worth quoting the provisions of section 4(1):</P>
    <P>Except as otherwise directed by the Government or provided by or under any other Act, the Secretary General of a Department or Head of a Scheduled Office, as the case may be, shall, subject to the determination of matters of policy by the Minister of the Government having charge of the Department or Scheduled Office or by the Government, have the authority, responsibility and accountability for carrying out the following duties in respect of the Department or Scheduled Office.</P>
    <P>These duties include management, the provision of advice, the preparation and submission of a <Col N="486" /> strategy document and the carrying out of disciplinary and staff employment functions.</P>
    <P>It will not be easy for a future Minister to take control of his Department when the legislation is enacted.  Despite the provisions in section 3, Ministers will be pushed to the edge of their Departments.This will be regarded by the secretary general of the Department as a mandate for autonomy.  I accept that the Bill provides for written directions &mdash; I will deal with this point in more detail later &mdash; but I am not happy that section 7 is an adequate statement of what I should be in a position to do if I was in a Department.</P>
    <P>By giving the secretary general of a Department the very extensive disciplinary and personnel functions set out in sections 4(1) (h), immense power is centred on one person.  This power may yet come back to haunt us.  By creating a structure of this kind where the secretary general is effectively the boss of the Department with hire and fire powers over the lower echelons there will be a reign of terror in some Departments and those who want to blow the whistle or believe that what the secretary general is doing is not appropriate will not be able to have the matter reviewed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the directions the Minister can give to his secretary general under section 7 specifically exclude any direction in relation to a disciplinary matter.  This means a secretary general will effectively be in the position to dismiss civil servants or threaten them with disciplinary action against the wishes of the Minister.  This is a very serious matter.  Section 7 provides that the Minister can give directions to the secretary general of a Department.  However, what obligation does a secretary general have to comply with these?  Why does section 7 not include a subsection which states that the secretary general shall comply with the directions given to him?  I am surprised that this provision has not been included in the Bill.  The Minister can give directions but there is no statutory obligation on the secretary general to comply with them.  The formalisation of written directions will, in certain circumstances, create a very poor working relationship between Ministers and secretaries general and will enable secretaries general to bully Ministers by, for example, saying &ldquo;put it in writing, Minister&rdquo;.  I am not happy with this position.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be the boss of the Department and somebody &ldquo;beneath him&rdquo; should not be beside him or above him.  We are doing to the Civil Service what the county management legislation did to local authorities.  We are creating an autonomous Civil Service and pursuing strategy documents which are laid down from time to time when full political accountability should be the hallmark of the public service.  I believe in old-fashioned political accountability.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy O'Malley speaking on the radio this morning about the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the different agendas pursued by that Department, even to the <Col N="487" /> point of giving Ministers misleading information for which they had to make personal statements in the Oireachtas and its committees.  Whose agenda is being served in such circumstances? What is the relationship between a Department and Ministers when they are misled by their own civil servants into making misleading statements in the House?  The corporate agenda of the Department not to be embarrassed seems to take precedence over the political imperative of truthful accountability in this House.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a charter for a bad relationship between Ministers and their Department, one in which the Department's position is encrusted with autonomy.  Ministers will be like jockeys getting up on very wilful horses.  They will find out in future that running a Department is a process whereby the boss is no longer the boss.  The Bill is a sad response to the issue of strategic management.Ireland did not get it right in regard to the strategic management initiative.  The New Zealand notion was a better one.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a rather sad response to the whole question of performance in the public service and accountability of Ministers under the 1924 Act. Far from reforming the public service, the Bill will deform it and make it less accountable.  The relationship between Ministers and Departments will be problematic hereafter if the Bill becomes law.  It needs to be extensively tested in a good debate in a committee of this House and not rushed through as if it were a good measure in its own right.  Many Members of this House should apply their minds to the contents of the Bill and tease out the implications of every section.  The idea that it could have gone through all Stages today because it is uncontroversial is a worrisome notion.  I am glad it seems to have been hit on the head.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised by certain features of the Bill.  Section 10 states: &ldquo;The Secretary General of a Department or Head of a Scheduled Office or any other officer of the Department or Scheduled Office who is designated for the purposes of this section by the aforesaid Secretary General or Head and to whom the relevant responsibility for the performance of functions has been assigned, shall, when requested to do so in writing by a committee of either or both of the Houses of the Oireachtas authorised in that behalf to make the request in connection with the subject-matter before the committee, appear before the committee...&rdquo;.  One might think that should be the end of the matter, but it is not. Section 10 further states: &ldquo;...in relation to any strategy statement that has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas under section 5 (2) in respect of the Department or Scheduled Office&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I thought we were moving towards a compellability mode but we now see that the Secretary General or a designated officer shall appear before a committee in respect of one item, that is, the strategy statement.  Why is that being specifically provided for?  Surely people will come <Col N="488" /> before a committee and answer questions extensively.I am concerned about section 10.  I do not know how it marries with the compellability provisions already in place or with much of the debate that took place in the select committee on the compellability Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not know the reason section 11 is cast in the terms it is, but I strongly object to the proposition that the number of special advisers in the case of a Minister, other than the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the leader of a political party registered in the register of political parties, shall not be greater than two.  What is that all about?  What is the limit on the appointment of special advisers to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or Minister De Rossa, since this is obviously tailor-made for him? Why are ordinary Ministers being limited when the heads of political parties can have their own kitchen cabinet or &ldquo;politburo&rdquo; of an unlimited size to advise them?  Has that been teased out? The provisions in section 11 (2) as to the functions of a special adviser, while they appear to be enabling, are meant to be delimiting.  Are they such a great step forward?</P>
    <P>I do not know the purpose of giving corporate status to the office of the Tánaiste, but it is a ridiculous idea.  What is the function of the office of the Tánaiste?  The existing office of the Tánaiste should be abolished.  The Tánaiste is supposed to be a Deputy Prime Minister, not a second Taoiseach.Why is it proposed in the Bill that a body with corporate status and a seal should be established for the office of the Tánaiste?  What kind of empire building is going on here?</P>
    <P>The implications of these bodies corporate have not been clearly thought out.  For instance, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is being given corporate status in the Bill.  Anybody who knows anything about the prosecution of offences is well aware that we need a unified prosecution system, not a further development of the autonomy of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I do not know the reason being tendered for corporate status.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State departed from the usual form of Second Stage speech by not detailing and justifying each section of the Bill. Instead we had a great deal of flimflam of an introductory kind followed by much flimflam in the peroration about codes of practice.  The contribution was, at best, a light dab of the feather duster on each of the issues that arise in the Bill.  If this was the answer to the problems of the public service I would welcome it, but it is not even part of the solution and may create more of a problem.  I would be quite happy to have a strong secretary general running a Department if there was a New Zealand arrangement whereby that person made an agreement with the State by which remuneration and tenure of office were decided.  If there is to be a strategy statement for a Department, it should not be put in place by the process envisaged in this Bill.  This is the wrong way to approach it, and I am very fearful that the Bill is being pushed <Col N="489" /> through in the last minutes, in terms of parliamentary lifetime, of this Dáil without adequate consideration as to its terms.  It should not be rushed through, and there is no reason to do so. It should be extremely carefully considered.  A number of other possibilities should be considered by the committee which is given the task of revising the detailed content of this Bill.  There is no hurry to have this legislation in place.  There is every reason for having the most far-reaching debate on each and every provision as to functions of secretaries general, for instance, and in relation to the mode of delegation of such functions.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that this Bill is a Trojan horse.  It appears to be all about improving public service management, but it is in fact about making management by the political head of a Department more difficult and making the Department less responsive to the person who should be in charge, the Minister.</P>
    <P>Something that ought to be considered is the creation of ministerial cabinets which have a definite relationship with the Department and are not solely centred around the Minister.  The Devlin model, although it may have had some deficiencies, may have had something to be said for it.  The least I would expect is a proper debate on whether to go for cabinet style delivery of services by Ministers who are politically responsible in exchange for what is proposed here.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill was written by political people who want to govern the country but that it was written largely by public servants who want to govern the country without too much interference from politicians.  It goes in the wrong direction.  I strongly believe in the old-fashioned notion that somebody who is elected by the people in a democracy, who, under the Constitution, is given charge of a Department of State and who has an individual responsibility for that Department should be seen not merely as somebody who lays down broad strategies and occasionally communicates directions in writing to his secretary general but as somebody who is in fact the boss in terms of delivering services, taking responsibility for what happens in the Department and making sure the Department does a good job.  I do not see this Bill as strengthening political accountability but as diminishing it.  I do not see the Bill as enriching the relationship of a Minister with his Department but as one which will estrange the Minister and the top public servants in his Department and put them at arms' length in which the loser will be political accountability.</P>
    <P>I am dismayed by the contents of this Bill.  If it is supposed to be the charter for a revolution in the management of our public service, I do not see that it is a very significant revolution.  It is a revolution in a cabbage patch, as was stated about the Fenian rebellion.  It does not deal with the fundamental issue of how to get public servants to perform to decent standards.  What the New Zealanders did was to put in place something <Col N="490" /> which exacts performance from the public service.This is aspirational.  The strategies are set out in the usual anodyne vague-minded language of all strategic documents; they are mission statements, the usual waffle and, at the end, there is no mechanism to ensure compliance, no method for setting targets, no method of ensuring compliance with targets and no personal accountability.This is a tired legislative gesture on a fundamental problem.  It is nothing to be proud of. There is much to worry about in this Bill.  I must record my deep sense of disappointment with it. It is not a charter for something better.  It is an excuse for something which needs to be made a lot better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions in response to the Bill, which were quite different in tone.  Deputy Woods wants assignments to go down the ranks, and I agree with him.  If the SMI is to provide the benefits we are seeking from it this will have to be done, and the Bill imposes an obligation on the secretary general to do so.  We are meeting the need for transparency of responsibilities already in publishing as my Department has a directory setting out who does what and those strategy statements which have been published in advance of this legislation give similar details.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods mentioned the lost opportunities of the past, Lemass, Devlin.  We are now revisiting what they proposed in the light of experiences such as his in the Department of Social Welfare.  We have also looked at and taken lessons from what has gone wrong in Departments and State bodies, and we are still retaining the essential overlordship and answerability to this House of the Minister.  I agree with Deputy Woods that that is essential.</P>
      <P>This Bill is part of a larger exercise, the fundamental requirement of which is that staff at all levels know what they are doing, why they are doing it and, most of all, are clearly told what is expected of them.  Because we are moving this Bill simultaneously with the system of performance management, which in his last remarks Deputy McDowell appears not to be cognisant of, we are giving all our staff an opportunity to benefit from it and an incentive to work the new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods is correct in identifying the need for greater interaction between civil servants and business.  The Culliton group indicated a particular need to ensure a greater degree of familiarity with the business world within Departments with responsibility for industrial policy. Several Governments have tried for some time now to have greater mobility between civil and public service and the private sector, the business world, a two-way flow.  What has happened in effect is that the private business sector has cherrypicked the best brains from the public sector, and we have been less effective, perhaps because of our pay structure or career paths within the <Col N="491" /> public service, in cherrypicking the best from the private sector and bringing them into the public sector.  The theory is good but in practice I am not sure that the public service is benefiting as much as the private sector.  I take the point that we need people who are fully versed and experienced in the business world generally particularly in industrial policy areas within the public service.</P>
    <P>The Public Service Management Bill is directed towards providing a more dynamic and accessible structure which will be open to the tough commercial world of business.  I agree with Deputy Woods about three fundamentals.  We do not see the preparation of the strategy document as the end of the matter.  It must have a focus on the short or medium term and the longer term.  We are imposing statutory obligations in this regard. We are not going along with the rigid policy-execution divide advocated by Devlin.  We have made modifications to ensure the Minister has an input at crucial stages and he or she will have a clear power to intervene.  Secretaries have a clear statutory obligation to provide a quality service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods said the Bill would not work unless the Official Secrets Act is changed.  We have on the Statute Book a Freedom of Information Act and my Department, under my direction, is about to launch an internal programme within the Civil Service to secure its effective implementation.  The directories and guides which that Act requires Departments to produce will, over most of the Civil Service, break down a culture of secrecy, which has already started to crumble.</P>
    <P>Deputies Woods and McDowell referred to the question of dismissals.  At present all Civil Service dismissals go to the Government.  That delays action and leads to attempts to personalise or politicise decisions in this area.  When this arrangement commenced decades ago, such were the numbers that it was possible for Ministers to know virtually all their staff and their work, but expansion has changed that.  Today Ministers may know only a small number of their staff, generally those at higher management levels of Departments.Transferring the functions of dismissal to secretaries general will not remove the protections which have been given to staff by the courts, by employment law or under the Constitution. There is no change in those areas.  There will be consultation with staff interests and the arrangements will not come into place until the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, is amended.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell commented on the risk of a reign of terror by a secretary general who cannot be directed by a Minister in this area.  The Deputy is aware of the strength of public service unions and of accessibility of the courts to aggrieved employees, including civil servants.  He suggested the Bill will cause problems for the Civil Service and said we should look to the state services commission in New Zealand as an alternative model of public service reform.  The Deputy surprises me.  We have most certainly looked at developments <Col N="492" /> in New Zealand and elsewhere, including New South Wales in Australia, Canada, the United States and Britain.  I hope we will be in a position to piggyback on the experience in other jurisdictions, particularly those which are basically similar to our &ldquo;Westminister&rdquo; model, which would be most suitable in terms of the type of administration with which to compare.</P>
    <P>We have looked at developments in New Zealand and examined the lessons to be learned, of which there are many, from their experience of reform.  Some good resulted from that examination.New Zealand took the &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; approach to reform and it was carried out in the teeth of fiscal disaster when they literally could not write cheques to pay civil servants.  The operation of a reform programme in the teeth of financial disaster may concentrate the mind in that if a person is told he will not be paid on Friday his choices are different from those that exist during &ldquo;peace time&rdquo; when a more planned and programmed approach may be adopted to change. That does not mean the radical or &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; approach will not occur in a selective way. Despite the best efforts of those involved and the labour relations machinery that exists, difficulties will possibly arise in some areas and there will be a battle of wills.</P>
    <P>If the progress of reform is reduced to an unacceptable pace, if we are not moving forward at a realistic pace, as a Government we will not be shy in pursuing a selective radical approach in certain areas.  That has the benefit of sending a signal if one is needed &mdash; I doubt it is &mdash; that the Government is serious about public sector reform.  Ideally reform in peace time &mdash; I use that term in the sense that we are not reforming in the face of fiscal disaster &mdash; is carried out in a planned and programmed way, with full consultation with unions and staff involved.  That system has progressed extremely well, and I thank public sector unions for their support to date.  Much more consultation is needed, particularly in the area of performance measurement, to which Deputy McDowell alluded.  Without a performance measurement system in place this measure will not work, but that is not what we are discussing.I agree fully it is an essential tool for the legislation to be effective.</P>
    <P>I have every respect for the decisions made by other Governments in terms of their public sector change programmes, but I do not accept the New Zealand approach provides the way forward for us.  Unlike New Zealand, we are an independent, sovereign and constitutional State.  The role, duties and functions of members of the Government are set out specifically in the Constitution. Our Constitution requires that a Minister is in charge of his or her Department.  It further requires that a Minister should be responsible for administering his or her Department.  That is a right and proper basis for democratic accountability.</P>
    <P>It is not the purpose of this legislation to try to take the Minister out of the loop, which is definitely <Col N="493" /> part of the New Zealand approach advocated by Deputy McDowell.  To advocate the New Zealand approach while expressing concerns about accountability seems slightly contradictory. Creating accountability mechanisms, as was done to try to detach the Minister in New Zealand, did not work, as was made clear by visiting New Zealand academic, Professor Jonathan Boston, in presentations made last week to the IPA.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to section 12.  That section specifically excludes the Office of the Tánaiste from the section as it provides that the Government may declare any office to be a corporation sole.  Having referred to performance management, which is an essential tool for success in public sector reform, I have broadly answered the questions raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 12, 17, 147 and 149 together.  I welcome the opportunity afforded by these questions to clarify the Government's position on the future development of Aer Lingus.  My predecessors, in response to similar parliamentary questions dating back to March 1994, indicated that the Government has continued to encourage Aer Lingus to develop appropriate strategic alliances with other airlines as part of its overall development strategy.</P>
      <P>This approach was set out in the Irish Aviation Policy Document published in February 1994 and more recently in my Department's Statement of Strategy launched in March of this year.  This approach is fully consistent also with the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>The statement of strategy identifies two key strategies for Aer Lingus which were formulated against the backdrop of the many challenges facing the Aer Lingus Group as we approach the 21st century.  These are: to continue to operate in accordance with strict commercial criteria and to ensure that, within a three to five year timescale, the operational resources employed by the group and the commercial results achieved, including the return to the shareholder, are such that they benchmark favourably with any comparable private sector airline against which they compete; and to explore the possibilities of entering into a major strategic alliance, with or without the transfer of equity, and to submit proposals to the shareholder by the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>The first strategy is necessary to ensure that the strongest possible commercial focus is upheld within the group.  This will allow the airline to sustain profitability going forward to the next century which is essential to ensure its future.</P>
      <P>The second strategy is necessary to allow Aer Lingus the freedom to examine if there are advantages in an appropriate alliance having regard to trends in the global aviation market. Whether this should be an alliance involving the transfer of equity is a matter which will arise as the examination proceeds and on which the Aer Lingus board must, in the first instance, form a view.  Any decisions arising from this process will be taken by the Government in due course.  This is the position as I conveyed it recently in discussions with the chairman of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember the ongoing challenges and market realities Aer Lingus will face. These include increasing competitive pressures on all routes; Ireland's peripherality and the small size of its domestic market; the anticipated cyclical <Col N="495" /> downturn in the aviation industry; and global trends towards consolidation and alliances.</P>
    <P>Allied to this is the position of the Government and the European Commission that further State aid for Aer Lingus is ruled out.  In these circumstances, it would be wrong to deny Aer Lingus the opportunity to explore the possibilities for developing a major strategic alliance, even if that means denying Deputy Brennan a chance to buy Aer Lingus shares on the stock market here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be nice to me today because this is probably the last occasion when he and I will do battle under this heading before we will change sides of the House. The Minister's closing remark is interesting in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister release the mandate he gave to the board of Aer Lingus? Will he outline what is in it and make a copy of it available to this House?  As taxpayers have put £175 million into this company, it would be disgraceful if the Minister were to sell off shares in that company to overseas interests in the same way as he did with shares in Telecom Éireann. Will he give the House an assurance he will not go down the route he followed with the sale of Telecom Éireann shares on the cheap to overseas investors who have now got back most of their investment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of Deputy Brennan's plea for understanding, and I can understand why he might make it but I would not advise him to hold his breath waiting for the events he is so happily expecting, I regret I cannot agree with him.  It would be interesting if Deputy Brennan were to put on record the opinion I discern is underlying the questions he put forward.  It is that we should not take any action to secure the future of Aer Lingus in view of the market realities and that we should not contemplate the type of action on the part of Aer Lingus which most other airlines in Europe have been forced to contemplate, even those which have been the recipients of very large amounts of taxpayers' money in their respective countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the mandate to the board of Aer Lingus, I will happily send the Deputy this afternoon a copy of my Department's statement of strategy where the mandate is clearly set out.  It will not surprise the Deputy to hear that I will not give him a verbatim account of my conversations with the chairman or chief executive of Aer Lingus.  The taxpayer has put a large amount of money into Aer Lingus in recent years.  If we do not take action of the kind I set out here in broad terms, Aer Lingus will find itself again in very great difficulty, but this time without the <Col N="496" /> possibility of another rescue package being put in place.</P>
    <P>On the Deputy's remarks about Telecom Éireann, he has consistently refused, because it suits him politically, to acknowledge the full meaning of the Telecom Éireann strategic alliance.  We have brought in two major strategic partners which will greatly strengthen that company.They have paid an entry fee of £180 million and a final addition to that will be 60 per cent of the increase in the value of the company between the date of the shareholder's agreement and a valuation date of some time around the third anniversary of that agreement.  If Aer Lingus chooses to go a similar route and the Deputy chooses to oppose it, he would condermn Aer Lingus to extinction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will oppose it if the Minister tries to do what he did with Telecom Éireann because I am on the record as predicting that will turn out to be a disastrous deal.  So far the figures available in the public arena show it is heading in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is coming out of the profits. Within a year and a half the overseas interests who bought that company will get their money back.  Meanwhile, the Minister has seen to it that nobody in this country can buy a single share in Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If a 20 per cent shareholder has got their money back in a year and a half, then the Irish taxpayer has benefited by four times that amount.</P>

      <P>On Aer Lingus, will the Minister comment on the statement by SIPTU that the Minister has broken key commitments contained in the PCW, Partnership 2000 and those given by the Government?  SIPTU seems to feel that what it calls the Minister's &ldquo;adversarial&rdquo; approach is unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not broken any commitment in the context of the PCW.  I am not directly involved in industrial relations in the company and, therefore, have not given commitments which I could break.  As far as plans for the development of Aer Lingus are concerned I am happy to say we have put in place a partnership <Col N="497" /> and consultation arrangement between the unions and management.  This has been carefully looked at.  All the matters we have spoken about in relation to the development of Aer Lingus will go through that same process.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The most up-to-date published accounts for Dublin Bus relate to 1995.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the financial performance of Dublin Bus until the publication of the 1996 accounts which is not due until next June.  We will have an opportunity to discuss them then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's question may be prompted to some extent by the fact that an extraordinary general meeting was convened by the directors of <Col N="498" /> Dublin Bus on 16 April 1997.  Dublin Bus was formed and registered under the Companies Acts.  This legislation includes a requirement that when a company's assets are less than half of the amount of its share capital, an extraordinary general meeting be held to bring the company's financial situation to the attention of the shareholders.I understand that this situation arose during 1996 in relation to Dublin Bus, chiefly as a result of the need to make provision for the cost of severance payments provided for in its cost reduction plan, with a new policy of depreciating vehicles on a 12 year rather than a 16 year basis.</P>
    <P>While the conveying of the extraordinary general meeting was occasioned by the need to comply with the terms of the Companies Acts, it serves to underline the erosion of the company's balance sheet and the need to tackle its problems sooner rather than later.  In common with the rest of the CIÉ Group, Dublin Bus is not generating sufficient revenue to cover its costs.  The only realistic approach to this problem is to reduce costs.  Increased fares, or an increase in the financial support provided by the Exchequer, will not address the problem of costs.</P>
    <P>Fares increases of the order which would be necessary to make a substantial impact on CIÉ's finances will simply drive customers away to other modes of transport, including the private car, which is Dublin Bus's principal competitor. Increased subvention does not offer a real solution either.  The subvention to CIÉ for 1997, at £105 million, represents an increase on the 1996 figure of over £5 million.  However, the Exchequer is not in a position to indefinitely underwrite excessive costs in the CIÉ Group. Moreover, the provision of additional taxpayer's money to CIÉ would only mask in the short-term the group's underlying problem of excessive costs.  This problem would very quickly again surface, proving even more difficult and more painful to resolve the longer its resolution is deferred.</P>

      <P>CIÉ approached my Department in June 1996, seeking a fare increase of 10 per cent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  As I indicated to the House on 15 April when I announced the introduction of a new UHF multi-channel television licensing scheme, my officials will now start drafting the legislative basis for it.  I envisage that regulations drawn up under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, will be necessary to allow for the operation of the scheme.  I regret I cannot be precise as to when these regulations will be published but I am due to take Questions Time in the House next month, so perhaps the Deputy might ask me again at that stage when I might be in a position to give him a definite answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Minister's last Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident it is not nor is it the last occasion I will have the pleasure of addressing the Deputy from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy is mistaken in inferring from <Col N="500" /> my statement to the House that it would take six months to draft the regulations.  The import of what I said was that despite the substantial amount of preparatory work that would have to be done I was hopeful that it would be possible for applications to be received by the autumn.  I am now hopeful that date might be brought forward.</P>
    <P>In addition to drafting the necessary regulations, there is a range of other preparatory work to be done.  One major task will be the need to prepare and publish a comprehensive national frequency list to help applicants in their selection of frequency channels.  The selected channels must not cause interference to the national programme services which is why the frequency list is of importance.  Work has already commenced in my Department in preparation for the operation of the scheme and it will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I made it clear when I announced the scheme that it will not operate as a nationwide one.  I am surprised, therefore, that Deputy Noel Treacy is raising the question of nationwide coverage.  I will repeat what I said in my statement:</P>
    <P>The new systems will be licensed to operate in those parts of the country where appropriate frequency space can be identified by suitable applicants.  Because of the shortage of frequency space the UHF scheme is not intended for, and will not provide, coverage to all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Thus I can give no guarantees that sufficient frequencies will be available in all parts of the country for which there is an intending applicant. The areas to be covered by the scheme will depend on applicants who meet the criteria set out in the scheme being licensed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy should know that contracts have not been awarded for the provision of multi-channel television by MMDS.  What have been awarded are licences to operate MMDS.  The actual licences are not public documents and are considered to be confidential to the licensees concerned and to my Department.  The format for each licence is contained in the schedule to the Wireless Telegraphy (Television Programme Retransmission) Regulations, 1989.</P>
    <P>I intend to see that the principles of fair competition will be observed in the award of licences under the new scheme.  I do not accept the inference that these principles would be better served if I excluded MMDS and cable relay operators from participation in it.  The essence of competition is a large number of participants.  I cannot see how it would be fair to exclude potential participants.It is not the case that cable relay operators or anyone else will be licensed to provide service under the scheme in cable relay areas as these areas are expressly excluded from the scope of the scheme.  I made this point perfectly clear in my statement to the House on the matter. In contrast, all non-cable areas of the country are licensed for MMDS service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> There is no question of the UK authorities exercising a veto over the award of licences.  The point I tried to make in my statement in plain non-technical language is that there are complex co-ordination rules and procedures in place under international agreements which make it incumbent on Ireland, with all other parties to these agreements, to co-ordinate the use of frequency assignments with neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>That is how the UK comes into the picture.  If applications are received with proposed frequency characteristics which fall into the category of those which require co-ordination, it is only right that I should make applicants aware now of Ireland's obligations in that regard.  The co-ordination process can be lengthy and there is never a guarantee of a successful outcome.  There is nothing new in that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy should also know that Teilifís na Gaeilge has been operating on an all-UHF basis since its inception.  Likewise, although it is not yet on air, TV3 intends to operate only on UHF.  While RTE has submitted a proposal to move its remaining VHF high power stations to UHF, in respect of the broadcasting of RTE 1 and Network 2, I have not taken a decision on that yet.  This decision will be taken on the merits of the proposal and with due regard to the furtherance of national broadcasting policy rather than retransmission policy which is the subject of the new scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister propose to introduce primary legislation or secondary legislation by regulation?  Will he tell the House what he meant when he said in his statement of 15 April that the new scheme which he will bring forward will be a basic secondary service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat what I said in my statement.The legislation which I will bring forward will be regulations drawn up under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, which is secondary legislation.The scheme I propose will be for a secondary service.  For the reasons I made clear in my statement, I must give primacy to our national broadcasting services.  That means their needs for UHF frequency channels must receive the first priority.  Therefore, any other service provided, such as the new one I propose to license, will have to fit into the available space and will be a secondary service, as proposed by the consultants appointed to advise me on Cork community television's application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If all that is required are regulations, why is there such a delay?  The Minister said in response to Deputy Séamus Brennan and in his statement of 15 April that he has given this matter long and detailed consideration.  Now that we know regulations are required, why is there a delay in introducing them?  Although the Minister gave a commitment to this House on 15 April, we have not yet received the EBU consultants' report on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that we are procedding by way of regulations rather than primary legislation does not mean it is easier to draft the legislation. The regulations will contain a number of complex issues and a number of matters must be settled and finalised before the regulations can be brought forward.  Had it been possible to bring the regulations before the House last week or earlier, I would have done so.  Last week and again today I set out in some detail the volume of work which needs to be done before this can be brought into operation, something which the Deputy should not underestimate.</P>

These are licences to broadcast on the public airwaves and, <Col N="503" /> in so far as anything is public property, they are public licences for public activity.  Why not publish them?  In most countries, matters of this sort would be published.  Why not here?  I did not deduce from the Minister's long reply why it takes an estimated six months to draft the necessary regulations for what is now proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>These licences have always been considered to be confidential documents between the licensee and the licencer.  That has been the case and, while I know that is not a reason for it to continue, until a different decision is made, that is the approach I will take.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is wrong in deducing it will take six months to publish the regulations. I did not say that.  I said the scheme will be based on regulations which will be based on the provisions of the 1926 Act.  There might be a hiatus in the work of drafting the regulations.  There is nothing I can do about that.  I will enjoy the hiatus and will be back here afterwards.  The regulations will be published as soon as possible but much work must be done before they can be finalised. It will take some time after the regulations have been published to put the licensing system in place.  It would be unrealistic to make decisions on applications before the regulations have been made available to all potential applicants.</P>

It is still not there and he said it will not be until tomorrow at the earliest.  Any Minister who gave such a commitment to this House was obliged on that day or the next to ensure the documentation was available.  There is something seriously wrong when this is the position.  It is obvious the Minister rushed out this document in response to Deputy Brennan's statement of 14 April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know why the Minister has put a 31 December 1999 time limit on the licences which he proposes issuing to the deflector operators.  Is he aware legal experts say he cannot do this?  Is there a time limit on the licences of existing MMDS operators?</P>

    <Col N="504" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot do anything about Deputy Treacy's propensity to fantasise about these things.  I said why I was not in a position to immediately lodge that report in the Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure it is lodged there and that information a company and potential applicant for a licence regards as confidential is deleted from it.  I must respect the wishes of that company although I do not respect their full wish in the matter.</P>
      <P>I do not know what legal experts are informing Deputy Treacy.  We could entertain each other for a long time swapping stories about legal experts but I will forego that temptation.  I clearly explained on 15 April that I put an indicative termination date on the licences because, by the time we reach the year 2000, developments in the use of the UHF band by national services, the migration of RTE from VHF to UHF and the consequences of the advent of digital television will make it necessary at that time to have a complete review of the licensing system.</P>
      <P>That is linked to the last part of the Deputy's question.  Most existing MMDS licences date from 1991 and 1992.  Strictly speaking, those are annual licences which can be renewed up to nine times, so there is a ten year cycle.  The first of those licences will come to the end of that cycle in 2001 and the bulk in 2001 and 2002.  A natural break will then appropriately occur during which we can fundamentally review how we organise the provision of television services.  It is for that reason the new licences I will award will last up to that point.  I cannot anticipate what the content or direction of that review will be.  Neither should I say anything which might prejudge decisions on licensing in the light of that review.  That is the reason I prescribed that time limit because it is important anyone entering this area should know what is facing them.</P>

Since the Minister cannot release that advice, will he paraphrase it and tell the House what it said about the issue of deflectors and compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the Minister's scheme does not start until autumn or perhaps 1998 or 1999, will he estimate for the House the number of blank screens there will be in the summer when the High Court cases shut down the deflector companies?  If these were shut down in Donnybrook or Ranelagh, people would protest outside the House and considerable <Col N="505" /> pressure would be applied.

      <P>In relation to South Coast Community Television, are we getting the worst of both worlds? How can the Minister defend the removal of the court's protection from the company?  Can Cable companies now take legal action against it and close it down?</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the quality of reception will deteriorate up to 1999.  Is he concerned that, for people to obtain a licence before then, they will have to get their affairs in order? This group has been involved in a costly High Court case.

      <P>Deputies opposite have been carping about this scheme since I announced it on 15 April.  On that day Deputy Brennan said he did not think it was a good idea.  He deducted from what he heard a week before that he would be left behind and that he should issue a statement. There was a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench on the Wednesday of the previous week because they were afraid I was going to move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies opposite have been running as fast as they can to keep up with this issue. It is about time they stopped carping.  Are the Deputies in favour of this scheme, even if I am the first to introduce it?  That probably sticks in their gullet because they never got around to introducing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputies prefer me to do nothing?  If they keep on carping we can only conclude they are against licensing deflector systems.</P>
      <P>I have had lengthy discussions with representatives of South Coast Community Television.  I had to refuse the application which was the subject of the court hearing.  That was the legal advice given to me.  If I had delayed the decision any longer to give them the continued protection of the court, I might have laid myself open to legal action.  I had no option but to refuse the application for reasons which I will not go into now.</P>
      <P>That decision removes the court's protection from South Coast Community Television.  It is worried about the situation but I have no control over the matter.  I am not a principal, party, instigator or defendant in any of those proceedings. Deputy O'Keeffe and South Coast Community Television know this is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also referred to my remarks that the quality of picture will tend to deteriourate. That is true.  We are dealing with a finite resource so that the more of the spectrum used by the <Col N="508" /> national services, the less there will be available for others and the more they will be prone to interference.  Deputy Batt O'Keeffe and South Coast Community Television know that.  I have good grounds for saying that they are probably better placed than any other deflector operator to take measures to protect themselves against interference in their operation.</P>
    <P>Then the Deputy complains about the other measures accompanying this provision, such as the payment of royalties, and the requirement to get their affairs in order.  Is he telling me that I should not regulate these matters, that I should not require that people pay royalties?  Is he telling me I should continue a system under which I give people licences to rebroadcast television services without paying those who produce the programmes?</P>

      <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell was not Minister in 1988 or 1989.  I must compliment the present Minister on tackling this problem and his predecessor on inviting consultation.</P>
      <P>Since there are approximately 50 such deflectors in Donegal &mdash; some parts of the county are in a unique position in that deflectors are also used to transmit RTE 1 and RTE 2 &mdash; will the Minister bear that in mind and meet the Donegal group to discuss the problem with them?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second issue raised by Deputy McGinley, I had a long meeting last evening with the national representatives of the deflector groups in the course of which I suggested to them that, if they found it useful, I would organise a series of briefing sessions with officials of my Department who could go into the details of my announcement <Col N="509" /> of 15 April.

    <P>I told the representatives of the deflector groups last evening that, while I will be specifying an entry fee &mdash; I envisage imposing a small charge of approximately £50 for an application &mdash; I will not be requiring any deflector group to pay an amount in the same order of magnitude as the £20,000 which each MMDS licence applicant had to pay.  I told them I envisaged an annual fee, comparable to the 5 per cent of gross turnover the MMDS operators pay by way of annual licence feet to my Department.  I am delighted to assure the Deputy that there did not appear to be <Col N="510" /> any great fues about that fairly reasonable provision.</P>
    <P>I should warn the Deputy in the most friendly spirit possible that it is very unwise of him to give any credence or support &mdash; given the fact that he appears to be so friendly with South Coast Community Television &mdash; to what we are reading about intentions to seek back money.  He might sometimes find that silence is golden.</P>
    <P>On the matter of legal advice, the Attorney General is very meticulous about how he carries out his duties.  In this case he was absolutely meticulous.  The advice obtained for me was not advice that came directly from the Attorney General but arranged by his good offices through a totally separate track.  None of the issues involved has been discussed by me with the Attorney General.However, with his good offices, I have obtained as much legal advice as possible.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the scheme I announced on 15 April is to give people in rural areas a choice between subscribing to an MMDS system on the one hand or to a licensed deflector system on the other, a choice between a system which can provide them with up to 11 channels or another which, in most cases, will provide them with a maximum of four channels at a correspondingly lesser cost.  I will do that as soon as I can, as soon as I can bring in regulations which will allow applicants apply for a lcence in the proper manner, have them examined and decisions taken thereon.  It is not within my compass to do that today, tomorrow or before late summer or early autumn at the earliest.</P>
      <P>I hope I will be back in this House in a position to announce that this scheme is coming into operation.That is my intention and the absolute maximum I can do.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to privatise Cablelink.  Any decision to disposed of Telecom Éireann's interest in Cablelink would require the approval of all the shareholders in Telecom Éireann, these being the Minister for Finance, the Strategic partners, PTT Telecom and Telia and me.</P>
      <P>No such decision has been taken.  Government policy for Cablelink requires that its network be developed as a platform for a range of communications services, which would be open to a variety of competitive service providers.  A plan for upgrading the network is currently being prepared by Cablelink.</P>
      <P>During consultations in the second half of 1996 between officials from my Department and the EU Commission concerning the liberalisation timetable and clearance of the strategic alliance, the future of Cablelink was discussed.  The outcome of these consultations was the approval of the alliance, with commitments, in line with stated Government policy, that Cablelink would be developed and upgraded to a state of the art multi-media platform at the same rate which would apply if the company were owned by a third party and that the network would be subject to open and non-discriminatory access obligations.</P>
      <P>In addition, during the consultation phase before the adoption of Commission Directive 95/51/EC of 18 October 1995, the Commission indicated it intended to make an assessment in member states of the impact of the joint provision of cable and telecommunications services by a single operator, with a view to reaching conclusions on the matter by end 1997.  This is recorded in the Recitals to that Directive.</P>
      <P>The Commission has now engaged consultants to assist in analysing the issue and officials of my Department met the consultants recently: the meeting was a fact-finding one.  As the exercise is currently ongoing, any discussion regarding the possible conclusions is entirely speculative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Department carried out an evaluation of what Cablelink would fetch on the open market?  When the Minister said he had no plans to privatise Cablelink, does that <Col N="512" /> mean he has no plans prior to an election?  Is he concerned about the number of job losses likely to occur in Cablelink were it to be sold off?  What would be the total cost of investment in Cablelink to upgrade it to a state of the art multi-media platform?  Given the liberalisation policy, does he believe he may be forced in future to privatise this company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have no plans to sell Cablelink but most certainly the EU has plans to force him to sell Cablelink.  Is that the position?  While the Minister may have no plans, does he have a view, a Government policy or an opinion as to whether it should be privatised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do not think it should be privatised and the Government takes the same view.  It is for that reason the Government has taken the view also that Cablelink should be developed to the point where it becomes a state of the art communications platform to which access should be available freely and on a non-discriminatory basis.  In September 1995 Telecom Éireann received a request from the European Commission for information about the company's plans for developing the cable network including, presumably, its operations through Cablelink. The company has responded to that request and so far as I know there has been no comeback from the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware the British Government recently received a sum of £200 million to issue a licence to a company operating in Northern Ireland which wished to have the licence to cable Northern Ireland or as much of it as it could?  There is no cabling in Northern <Col N="513" /> Ireland.  It has to put in the entire network, the entire infrastructure, but still considers it worthwhile to pay £200 million to do that.  In the circumstances will the Minister agree Cablelink is worth a great deal of money if it is now sold?  It is particularly important that it should be sold given that it is controlled by Telecom which is deliberately not developing it in order that competition with Telecom can be avoided?  Will he bear in mind we have had three reductions in telephone charges by Telecom in the past year or two, all of which were on the international side where they are subject to competition.  There has been no reduction on local or internal trunk calls, where there is no competition, and there will be none for as long as Telecom Éireann is allowed retain its present privileged position of controlling its only possible competitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley seems to be good at reading reports about what is happening in other countries but not quite so good at reading reports about what is happening here.  It is simply not true that there have been no reductions in Telecom's internal charges.  Since that is the subject of a further question I look forward to elucidating these matters for the Deputy when we get to that question.  It is interesting that somebody thinks it is worthwhile to bid £200 million to cable Northern Ireland.  If the Deputy's suspicion is true then it seems to me we have in the ownership of Telecom Éireann and, therefore, of the State shareholder and the alliance shareholder a valuable asset.  For that reason it is a matter of even greater importance to this House that the Government and Telecom and the strategic partners in Telecom should have taken a decision that Cablelink should be developed and upgraded to be a state of the art multi-media platform.  What the Deputy is saying indicates we have a valuable asset.  It is interesting to note there is a wide divergence of views on this strategic matter between the two putative partners in Opposition.</P>

      <P>The Minister is engaging in an economic somersault.  I have heard him speak many times on the need for competition.  It is interesting that his partners in Government have influenced his thinking given that he tells the House it is his opinion the company should remain with Telecom Éireann.  I put it to the Minister this company is already part privatised.</P>

      <P>I admire his ingenuity.  It is a pity he does not put it to more constructive use.  Competition can bring many benefits.  That is why the Government issued a second mobile telephone licence and why I expect to announce at the end of this year a competition for a third mobile telephone licence.  The Government has also provided that, as and when Cablelink is developed to a multi-media platform, there will be open and non-discriminatory access for third parties to the Cablelink network to ensure competition in the provision of services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Preparation for the implementation of EU directives in the transport field by the three operating companies within the CIÉ group is a matter for the board and management of CIÉ.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of Council Directive 91/440, railway undertakings are entitled to limited access and transit rights across the frontiers of member states.  The directive provides for rights of access and transit for international passenger and goods services operated by international groupings of railway undertakings.  It provides the same access and transit rights for railway undertakings operating international combined transport goods services.  The access provisions of the directive were transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument 204 of 1996.</P>
      <P>Two further directives have been adopted supplementing Directive 91/440.  These related to the licensing of railway undertakings, the allocation of rail infrastructure capacity and the charging of fees for infrastructure use.  Both directives are due to come into force on 28 June this year.  The method of transposal of these directives into Irish law is being examined by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these directives, my Department is pursuing the transposition of Directive 96/49 <Col N="515" /> concerning the approximation of the laws of member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail.  In effect, that directive enshrines in EU law the provisions of an international agreement on the regulations governing the transport of dangerous goods by rail, usually known as RID.  It requires that the RID standards should also apply to domestic rail operations.</P>
    <P>Two instruments in the bus sector are currently going through the EU legislative process.  These are a proposed regulation replacing Regulation 2454/92 on cabotage in international bus operations and an amendment to Regulation 684/94 concerning the rules for international bus passenger operations.  These proposals provide for a further limited measure of liberalisation in international bus transport.</P>
    <P>While the degree of liberalisation to date in the public transport sector is limited, it is clear from repeated statements by the Commission and from its 1996 White Paper on the revitalisation of the community's railways, that the coming years will see a step by step liberalisation and intensified competition in the public transport sector generally.</P>
    <P>Liberalisation is well established in the aviation and road haulage sectors and is proceeding rapidly in the telecommunications sector.  Significant progress towards liberalisation is also being made in other sectors, including energy.  The public transport sector cannot hope to avoid similar liberalisation and there is no reason it should.  It is essential, therefore, that the CIÉ group prepares itself adequately to meet these changing circumstances.The Government has set out its mandate for CIÉ very clearly, most recently in my Department's statement of strategy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this earlier during our discussion about Dublin Bus so I will not take up the time of the House and anticipate supplementary questions by elaborating further.  I have indicated the measures being taken to bring the relevant provisions of European Union law into operation in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Minister so reluctant, in this area as in many others, to introduce and permit liberalisation provisions, expect when forced to do so by the European Union?  Why is the Government always dragging its feet and fighting change, progress and competition when other countries are anxious to achieve them in the interests of their populations?  Why will the Minister not encourage competition in bus services in Ireland?  It could be implemented rapidly if the legal opportunity were provided.  Why does he wish to preserve a situation, by way of annual public subsidies, that would not be preserved in any other country?  Dublin Bus was recently obliged to hold a statutory EGM because, under the Companies Acts, it is regarded as having deteriorated so much financially that the shareholders should be allowed to decide whether they wish it to continue in existence.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley was not present when we discussed the Dublin Bus EGM.  Rather than repeat my reply, perhaps he would look at the text when it becomes available in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In some areas we have proceeded with liberalisation more rapidly than is provided for in European Union directives.  That is particularly the case in relation to gas and electricity.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and I have a Bill at an advanced stage of preparation which will introduce a further element of competition in bus transport.  It will be adapted to the needs of our market and will go a great deal further in terms of liberalisation than required by European Union directives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already a degree of competition in the bus sector that is not contemplated by EU directives and might not be for a long time.  Deputy O'Malley expressed disappointment at the slow pace of liberalisation not only here but in the European Union, and I share his view. I hope the Deputy will have at least one more term in Opposition preparing the unholy alliance with Fianna Fáil to prepare members of that party for the benefits of competition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are privileged to be living in a democracy.  Unfortunately, democracy has been undermined in recent weeks and it is vital that public confidence is restored.  I was fortunate to be elected to this House in 1989 and have been a Member ever since.  I will be putting my name before the electorate of South Kildare, probably next month.  I am very conscious of the honour they have bestowed upon me.</P>
      <P>Being a Member of this House brings with it many privileges, rights and responsibilities.  We have a duty to give leadership to the people.  Certain standards must be kept.  In seeking contracts advertised by local authorities or State agencies, an individual or company is required to hold a tax clearance certificate.  While this change created problems initially, it is now accepted as the norm in business.  It is understood that in seeking to do business with any arm of State, one is required to have one's tax affairs in order. Before one can fill potholes for Kildare County Council it is necessary to have a tax clearance certificate.The same applies to bookmakers and publicans in renewing their licences each year.</P>
      <P>We are all expecting the general election to be called next week.  I cannot understand why the same demand is not made of those seeking election to this House.  We should not make demands of others that we are not prepared to make of ourselves.  I call on the Government to introduce a measure that would make it compulsory for all candidates seeking election to this House to hold a tax clearance certificate.  That would be one way of showing the people that we mean business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All parties in the House have at some stage been accused of low standards.  It is important that we set and keep standards.  At public meetings I attended recently people claimed that they did not trust politicians and accused them of being on the take.  I have no doubt, however, that the vast majority of Members live respectable lives and pay their dues.  It is important that we do not fall into the trap of pointing the finger and blaming one another.  We are honoured to be <Col N="519" /> Members of this House, it is a privilege we should not take for granted.</P>

      <P>Eligibility to stand as a candidate in a general election or by-election is governed by Article 16.1 of the Constitution which states:</P>
      <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of twenty-one years, and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by this Constitution or by law, shall be eligible for membership of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Section 41 of the Electoral Act, 1992 lists the disqualifications for membership of the Dáil.  They are: that a person is not a citizen of Ireland; has not reached the age of 21 years; is a member of the Commission of the European Communities; is a judge, advocate general or registrar of the Court of Justice of the European Communities; is a member of the Court of Auditors of the European Communities; is a member of the Garda Síochána; is a wholetime member of the Defence Forces as defined in section 11 (4) of the Act; is a civil servant who is not by the terms of his or her employment expressly permitted to be a Member of the Dáil; is a person of unsound mind; is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for any term exceeding six months imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State or is an undischarged bankrupt under an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State.</P>
      <P>Section 42 provides that, on incurring a disqualification for Dáil membership or on appointment to a disqualifying position, a person who is a Member of the Dáil ceases to be such Member. The section also provides that if a Member of the Dáil is appointed Comptroller and Auditor General, a post declared by Article 33.3 of the Constitution to be incompatible with membership of the Oireachtas, he or she automatically ceases to be a Dáil Member.</P>
      <P>Any change in the disqualification criteria for membership of the Dáil would have to be given detailed consideration because it goes to the heart of our democracy.  It is a matter in which it would be desirable to proceed, as far as practicable, on the basis of consensus.  It was for this reason that the Minister for the Environment forwarded some time ago a list of electoral matters to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs for its consideration.  These matters include certain of the disqualifications set out in section 41 of the 1992 Act.  While the question of tax clearance certificates was not on the list, there is not prohibition on the committee considering that matter, along with the other electoral items, and the Minister would take full account of any recommendations made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that neither the report of the Constitution Review Group nor the first progress report of the all-party committee on the Constitution recommend any change in the disqualification criteria <Col N="520" /> for membership of the Dáil.  I will, however, bring the Deputy's contribution to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I feel a sense of loss at the Ceann Comhairle's impending departure.  While Members on either side of the House did not always agree with every decision he made, he will be missed.  He is a formidable figure.</P>
      <P>In 1981 Dublin City University, which then had the status of an NIHE, took in the first students to its campus in the north side of Dublin city.  The current student population of the university is approximately 5,500.  The campus site was probably inadequate to meet the ambitious development plans for the university and over the years the land bank was used for new buildings.  These buildings are well designed but unfortunately there has been a steady erosion of the land available for recreational facilities.  Planning permission has been granted for a new chemical science building in the near future.  Following this development, which is by no means the final one, there will be one playing pitch for the 5,500 students.</P>
      <P>Having obtained substantial support from the private sector, DCU purchased from the Eastern Health Board St. Clare lands on Ballymun Road which are adjacent to the campus.  The local community were delighted with this purchase as they were concerned that the site would be used for a housing development.  DCU obtained planning permission from the local authority for the development of this land as a major sports facility not only for the university but also the entire community.  The university has a track record of making its facilities available to the public.  Even though it is a university, it received grant aid in the past because it guaranteed access to its facilities to the local community.  It has honoured this commitment.</P>
      <P>It has been argued that this kind of project should not qualify for a sports grant under the national lottery.  However, DCU was allocated £500,000 for its sports complex because it would also be used by the local community.  Three or four sporting groups in the area are anxiously waiting the development of this site as they do not have facilities of their own.  Planning permission was granted last year but the project has come to a halt due to a lack of funding.  Having obtained so much private funding, the university rightly believes that it deserves some support from the State.  The Minister should make a special allocation to the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This local good news story is becoming a bad news story in that the site is not being developed and there is a problem with security.  The local community are becoming cynical about whether these lands will be developed.  Given the success of the college in acquiring private funding to purchase this major site, favourable consideration <Col N="521" /> should be given to its request for funding.  This facility will be to north Dublin what the Belfield campus is to south Dublin.  I could not agree strongly enough in favour of Government support for this project which will make a valuable contribution to the local area.  Dublin Corporation cannot meet the needs of local sporting clubs and it has discussed with DCU the possibility of using this new facility to meet these needs.  I look forward to a favourable response from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy has raised this matter as it gives me an opportunity to explain the position.  The Department of Education received a submission late last year from Dublin City University in which it requested £1 million in national lottery funding through the Sports Capital Programme which is administered by the sport section of the Department.  The submission relates to the development of 35 acres of land, within 100 metres of the university, which is part of a 37 acre parcel of land purchased by the university from the Eastern Health Board at a cost of £4.3 million.  I understand that funds derived from the private sector were used in this purchase.</P>
      <P>The land is to be used to develop outdoor sporting facilities for the university.  Dublin City University has pointed out that as the number of buildings on the campus had to be increased to cater for the increased number of students attending the college the available land for outdoor sporting activities has decreased to the stage where it is inadequate.</P>
      <P>The development of the recently acquired land will consist of seven pitches to enable GAA games, rugby, soccer and cricket to be played. One of the pitches will be a floodlit, all-weather pitch.  There will be future provision for track events around one of the other pitches.  Suitable car parking will be provided and there will be pedestrian routes traversing the site.  The cost of developing these facilities is estimated at £1.7 million.  This is an exciting project and I appreciate the vision of, and effort made by, Dublin City University in acquiring the land and in developing the project.  I also understand that the university has sold on two acres of the land to the North Dublin School Project for a sum below the original purchase price.  This reflects the ongoing commitment of the university to the part of Dublin in which it is located.  There is also very considerable public use of the existing indoor sports facilities at the university which were part funded through a grant of £500,000 under the Department's Sports Capital Programme.  I fully accept that the existing outdoor facilities at the university are inadequate to meet the needs of the university and the surrounding areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the submission from Dublin City University will be considered under the major facilities scheme of the Department's Sports Capital Programme.  This programme now comprises over 140 major projects <Col N="522" /> with total grant allocations amounting to more than £40 million.  An amount of £4 million is available for allocation to projects under the major facilities scheme this year.  However, while the demand for funding under the scheme is very high only limited funding is available.  The Department has more than 1,000 applications for funding under the Sports Capital Programme at any one time and the overall value of the grant aid requested ranges from £75 million upwards. Each application is reviewed on its merits in accordance with the criteria of the scheme and the grant allocation process is monitored by the Irish Sports Council.  The Minister of State with responsibility for sport will give the submission from Dublin City University every consideration when decisions are being made on grant allocations this year.</P>
    <P>The Sports Strategy Group, under the chairmanship of John Treacy, has reported to the Minister.  Its report, &ldquo;Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland&rdquo;, which was launched last February sets out a strategic approach to sport in Ireland during the period 1997-2000 and beyond.  It has recommended a revised approach to the provision and funding of sports facilities in the future on the basis of the development of a national plan for community facilities and for national and competition facilities.  Work on the development of this plan is under way.</P>
    <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to congratulate Dublin City University on its achievements to date in providing for the development of high quality outdoor sporting facilities.

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the need for other EU member states to tighten their laws on the use of drugs and the action taken by the Government in this regard.  There is considerable concern that less stringent drug laws in other EU countries, such as the Netherlands, are facilitating the trafficking of addictive and dangerous drugs. I am sorry the Minister for Justice is not present as she has adopted a soft approach to this matter.</P>
      <P>The French President, Jacques Chirac, recently indicated that the French Government intended to put pressure on Holland to tighten its tolerant drugs policy in view of its implications for other EU member states.  An organisation in Holland, Concerned Citizens, has expressed considerable disquite about their government's tolerant policy. Recently, in the city of Hulst, a local referendum indicated that 96 per cent of the population rejected the tolerant policy which allowed cannabis to be sold in coffee shops.  The mayor of Hulst will be hosting an international seminar at the end of this month on the need for Holland to recognise its obligations to other EU states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Dutch currently hold the EU Presidency, I strongly urge the incoming Taoiseach, <Col N="523" /> the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Justice to support our French counterparts in bringing pressure to bear on the Dutch.  We read daily in our newspapers about Irish drug barons operating from Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Drugs trafficking is an international problem which requires a firm international response.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote the following from a document published by Concerned Citizens:</P>
    <P>One of the urgent matters to be discussed by the EU during this period [the Dutch Presidency] is drug control.  The Dutch Government have continued to maintain their permissive attitude towards drugs for years now, and they have promoted their policy as both `human' and `successful' whenever possible within the EU.  At the November 1996 meeting of the EU Council of Minister [Ireland had the Presidency at that time], the Dutch Government were given a `green light' to continue their drug policy.  This `success' was greeted in the Dutch Parliament as a `victory' for the Dutch position.</P>
    <P>Bowing to international pressure, the Dutch Government have recently `sharpened up' their policy, e.g. by closing down a number of `coffee shops'.  In practice, the Dutch Government have allowed new `coffee shops' to be opened. Also, they have given an `allowance' of 500 grams of cannabis... to be stored in the shops.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many grammes are used to make a joint, but if a quarter of a gramme is needed for one joint, we are talking about 2,000 joints being lawfully sold in these coffee shops. The document further states:</P>
    <P>This is a very important step towards `legalising' the local sale of cannabis.  Previously, there was no formal `allowance'.  Further examples can be given of how the Dutch Government will say one thing to satisfy international demands for more restrictions on drugs and do something else at home.</P>
    <P>As time is limited I cannot detail the other useful points in this circular, but the Concerned Citizens project has the following aims which the people of this country would share: to put drug control policy issues at the top of the EU agenda; to prevent the spread of permissive attitudes within the EU, particularly during the Dutch term of the EU Presidency; to check the facts on the domestic drug problem presented by the Dutch Government and, whenever possible, to present sound, scientific, epidemiological or legal evidence to show the seriousness of the problem; and to co-ordinate the efforts of EU member states to achieve a common restrictive drug policy based on the United Nations international drug conventions.</P>
    <P>In a letter dated 29 November 1996 to the head of an organisation in Holland, Mr. Karel Gunning, President of the Landelijk Comite Drug-preventie, a drugs prevention committee, the Minister for Justice stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> Dear Mr. Gunning,</P>
    <P>I write to thank you most sincerely for the information concerning the harmonisation of European drugs policy for the meeting of EU Justice Ministers.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to receive all such information from your organisation and look forward to hearing from you again.</P>
    <P>There would be nothing wrong with that letter were it not for the fact that the Minister presided over a meeting of EU Justice Ministers from which the Dutch came away with more liberalisation rather than less.  I would like some comment from the Minister or her Department regarding our policy on this issue.  Ireland should fully support the French position, along with other EU member states, in bringing pressure to bear on the Dutch Government.  Drugs are not dangerous because they are illegal &mdash; they are illegal because they are dangerous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and Deputy Briscoe for affording me this opportunity to reply to the debate on behalf of the Minister for Justice.  As the Deputy is aware, the European Union places great priority on the fight against drugs.  During the Irish Presidency of the European Union, the Minister for Justice, as President of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, placed great emphasis as a national priority on the need for positive and coherent action in dealing with all aspects of the drugs problem and in pursuing an extensive programme of measures to tackle this issue.</P>
      <P>The Cannes European Council, in establishing a strategy for European Action against Drugs, agreed a medium term plan over a five year period, from 1995 to 1999, and also the Community Action Programme on the Prevention of Drug Dependence in the Field of Public Health.  That Council established an Expert Group on Drugs which was instructed to submit to the European Council meeting in Madrid an analytic report accompanied by proposals dealing with the issues in these two plans.  The Madrid European Council approved the Report of the Drugs Expert Group which analysed the drugs situation in the European Union and made proposals aimed at reducing demand, combating trafficking and enhancing international co-operation.  The Union was mandated to report to the Dublin European Council on the action taken on those proposals and the substantial progress made since Florance was warmly welcomed by Heads of State at that meeting in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has been achieved under the Third Pillar during the Irish Presidency, specifically with regard to action to tighten legislative measures on drugs.  A series of joint actions were agreed which provided for the approximation of legislation and practices between member states, customs services and judicial authorities with a view to combating drug addiction <Col N="525" /> and preventing and combating illicit trafficking in drugs.</P>
    <P>A number of resolutions were also agreed on sentencing for serious drug trafficking offences, combating drug tourism and on drug production and cultivation.  In addition, agreement was reached in many areas of practical co-operation such as forensic science information exchange on chemical profiling of drugs, exchange of operational skills, training, knowledge and expertise among law enforcement agencies and the Judiciary, all of which supports in real terms the ongoing legislative work of the Union in this field.  A pluri-annual programme of funding, including training, exchange of personnel and research in the law enforcement area was also agreed.  Because the Europol Drugs Unit plays an increasingly dynamic role in this ongoing work, the completion of the Implementing Regulations for the Europol Convention were well advanced during the Irish Presidency.  On 11 February 1997, the Government approved the drafting of a Europol Bill which, when enacted, will enable Ireland to ratify the Europol convention and its subsequent Protocol.  Work on the drafting of this Bill is progressing well and publication is expected in the near future.</P>
    <P>Judicial co-operation and its legal basis has also been strengthened by the adoption of an EU convention relating to extradition and ongoing work on the Draft Mutual Assistance Convention.  The work on the examination of further harmonisation of laws, having been given such momentum during the Irish Presidency, will continue through cross-disciplinary co-operation between the First, Second and Third Pillars, focusing specifically on the growing scourge of synthetic drugs and the continued highlighting of the problem at all levels within the Union's external relations.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the important legislative developments which have taken place in this jurisdiction to tackle the problem of drug related crime, which has been debated at length in this House.  Part VII of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 was brought into effect by order of the Minister for Justice on 15 November 1996.  The provisions in Part VII are essential for Ireland to play a full part in international co-operation and to discharge its obligations under a number of conventions this country has recently ratified.</P>
    <P>On 3 September 1996, Ireland ratified the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.  As a party to this convention, Ireland can play a full part in international co-operation against drug trafficking, ranging from practical co-operation on drug trafficking at sea to judicial co-operation in obtaining evidence and in confiscating the proceeds of drug trafficking.  The Department will act as the central authority in this jurisdiction for the purposes of international co-operation under the convention.</P>
    <P>In December 1996, Ireland also ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, and the additional Protocol <Col N="526" /> to that Convention, which came into effect as regards Ireland in February 1997; and the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime, which came into effect as regards Ireland on 1 March 1997.</P>
    <P>The conventions require convention states to afford each other extensive criminal law co-operation, as well as to put in place certain domestic criminal law provisions.  The co-operation covers the service of foreign judicial documents, the obtaining of statements or other evidence for use in criminal proceedings abroad, and the execution of foreign court orders confiscating the proceeds of crime or forfeiting material associated with crime.  Under these conventions Ireland not only provides assistance to other participating countries but may also seek assistance on these matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, together with her colleagues in Government, is totally committed to taking whatever action is necessary to tackle the drugs problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of up to 400 Irish Life employees who have been out of work for over ten weeks.  Not alone are they out of work, they are not in receipt of any payments apart from a stipend of £30 a week from their union.  Most of them are married and have commitments, for example, mortgages, and most of them have children and the ongoing costly financial obligations that a family brings.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has a golden share retained in Irish Life which brings with it a moral imperative to directly intervene if things are going radically wrong, and they plainly are.  I find it strange that yesterday we had the launch of an antipoverty strategy while at the same time a huge number of people have been out of work and are in receipt of only £30 a week.  I have been engaging with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment about this matter for a very long time to get him to intervene and do something.  It is fine to have strategies about everything, but the everyday strategy of the Government is to ignore the plight of this great number of people.</P>
      <P>There must be a reason that number of people would stay out of work for so long.  In previous times one Minister and then another made special arrangements for workers in Dunnes Stores and workers in the <i>Irish Press</i>.  In particular regulations were drafted to enable those people to obtain social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad a Minister from the Department of Social Welfare is here to give me a direct response.  I put it to him that in a country in which the Government says everybody is doing well, there are huge numbers who are not.  In this case <Col N="527" /> there are between 350 and 400 employees who have had only £30 a week to live on for the past ten weeks, people with homes, obligations and families.  Can special arrangements and regulations be put in place to enable those employees to receive social welfare benefits to help them to keep body and soul together?  In the wider governmental context, it is a disgrace that ten weeks have gone by and each Government Minister to whom I have addressed the issue has said that it is not his business, that he will not intervene or do anything, and these are Ministers in a Government supposedly committed to helping those in difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Rourke and the Chair for affording me an opportunity to speak on this matter.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that, as a general rule, persons involved in a trade dispute are not entitled to receive unemployment payments for the duration of the dispute.  Persons whose employment may be affected by the dispute but who are not participating in or directly interested in it are exempt from this disqualification.</P>
      <P>At the onset of the dispute between the Manufacturing Science &amp; Finance Trade Union and Irish Life Assurance PLC my Department was in contact with the union and the company in relation to the position of the workers.</P>
      <P>An application from an employee of the company for unemployment benefit was selected as a &ldquo;test&rdquo; case and submitted to a deciding officer. This was done with the agreement of the workers and their representatives and is a practical way of obtaining an early and uniform decision on all applications.  On Tuesday 18 February 1997 the deciding officer determined that the applicant had lost his employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute and was, accordingly, disqualified from receipt of payment for as long as the stoppage of work continued.Any person who has been disqualified for benefit may appeal the decision to an appeals officer.  The decision was not appealed in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social Welfare legislation also provides, however, that a person involved in a trade dispute <Col N="528" /> who is dissatisfied with the decision in their case may apply for an adjudication of the matter to the Social Welfare Tribunal.  The tribunal investigates cases where it is alleged that a person was unreasonably deprived of his or her employment by an employer who failed or refused to utilise the negotiating machinery normally available for the settlement of disputes.  Having taken into account all the circumstances of the stoppage of work and the trade dispute which caused it, the tribunal may decide that a person was unreasonably deprived of his or her employment and, notwithstanding the decision of the deciding officer or appeals officer, may decide that the person is qualified to receive an unemployment payment.</P>
    <P>Following an amendment which the Minister introduced in 1996, a person may seek an adjudication by the tribunal directly following the decision of a deciding officer and without the necessity for an appeal.  This procedure was followed in this case.  An application for an adjudication by the tribunal in this case was made on 20 March 1997.  An adjudication hearing has been scheduled for 22 May 1997 and all interested parties have been notified.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, it is open to any dependants of employees affected to claim payment of a supplementary welfare allowance from the health board.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked that special measures be taken.  The procedure being followed in this case is identical to the procedure followed in the other cases.  The only thing that concerns us is the time lag in its determination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>My main concerns in relation to Sellafield and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, include the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at the THORP plant at the Sellafield complex, the ageing Magnox reactors at the site, the facilities for the storage of high level radioactive liquid waste and proposals for establishing a Mox Plant at the site.  I also strenuously objected to proposals by UK Nirex Ltd for a nuclear waste repository near the Sellafield site.</P>
      <P>Since I assumed responsibility for nuclear matters, there have been numerous contacts with the British authorities in relation to Ireland's concerns regarding their nuclear industry by myself and officials of my Department.  Specifically in the past six months I have highlighted the following:</P>
      <P>I wrote in December 1996 to the relevant UK Ministers expressing my concerns and requested that they use powers available to them to order the immediate and complete cessation of the discharge of technetium-99 from Sellafield into the Irish Sea.  The response up to now has been that they are not prepared to do so; however the UK Environment Agency will be obliged to consider technetium-99 as part of BNFL's application for a revised discharge authorisation.</P>
      <P>In February I met at my request, with the British Ambassador.  I conveyed to her the Government's concerns about the recent reports of incidents at the Sellafield complex, our concerns about the possibility of an accident at the high level waste tanks at Sellafield, which the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has identified as a major accident risk, and our objections to proposed further developments by UK Nirex Ltd of a nuclear waste respository near Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 7 February my Department wrote to the Environment Agency outlining our concerns in <Col N="530" /> relation to the application by BNFL for a variation in the discharge authorisations for the Sellafield complex.  Principally we are concerned that the projected effects on Ireland are not clearly stated and that BNFL should speed up proposals for abatement equipment to reduce technetium-99 discharges.  I reserved the right to give further detailed comments once the Environment Agency issues its proposals on the discharge authorisations.</P>
    <P>In March this year I submitted a document to the UK Department of the Environment detailing Ireland's concerns with the Nirex proposal to establish a rock characterisation facility near Sellafield and commenting on additional information that had come to light recently about the proposal.  On 17 March, the UK Secretary of State for the Environment decided not to grant permission to the Nirex proposals for the Sellafield area.  In reaching his decision he took account of the concerns expressed by the Government and agreed that the people of Ireland have a legitimate interest in any proposal to locate a nuclear repository for radioactive waste near the Irish Sea.  This was a major victory over the British nuclear Industry.</P>
    <P>In April I forwarded a strongly-worded submission to the UK Environment Agency stating that a proposal by British Nuclear Fuels for a new mixed oxide (MOX) fuel manufacturing plant was not justified.  British Nuclear Fuels is now actively promoting the idea of disposing of surplus plutonium by manufacturing a new nuclear fuel called MOX for conventional reactors, which is a mixture of plutonium and uranium.  The bulk of the plutonium for the MOX plant is expected however to come from the fuel reprocessed from the UK's Magnox reactors at Sellafield and from the new THORP plant.  A more sensible approach to the oversupply of plutonium would be to cease all spent fuel reprocessing activities at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>It will be evident from the above that I am committed to pursuing all realistic and effective courses of action to convey to the British authorities the concerns of the Irish people about the British nuclear industry.</P>

      <P>Since the coming into force on 1 January 1997 of the Telecommunications Tariff Regulation Order made on 16 December 1996 in accordance with section 7 of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, Telecom Éireann is obliged to effect overall reductions in the basket of tariffs covered by that order of at least CPI-6 per cent annually for the next five years.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the implementation of these obligatory reductions will result in substantial real price decreases for customers.  The price cap order sets minimum tariff reduction levels which must be achieved over the next five years but competition may well force prices down further in that time.</P>
      <P>The level of the price cap is related to the business case underlying the strategic alliance transaction which in turn takes account of the pace at which the company expects to bring its cost base into line with efficient norms.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Telecom Éireann recently announced an £80 million price reduction package to be phased in over the next 12 months.  This latest package brings to £210 million the value of price reductions introduced by the company since 1995 and demonstrates Telecom Éireann's firm commitment to continuing price reductions, within the framework of the price cap.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any recent decision by the EU Transport Council to introduce Community support for combined transport initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be referring to Council Regulation 543/97 of 17 March 1997, the purpose of which is to renew until 31 December 1997 subject to certain amendments, the terms of an earlier Council Regulation 1107/70 which expired at the end of 1995.  The latter regulation sets out the legal framework within which member states are permitted to provide aid for transport by rail, road and inland waterway.  Under the original regulation, member states were allowed to provide aid as a temporary measure to facilitate the development of combined transport through <Col N="532" /> investment in infrastructure, transhipment facilities and dedicated transport equipment or through support for the operation of combined transport services in transit across Austria, Switzerland and the states of the former Yugoslavia. The new regulation does not introduce a system of EU support for combined transport measures. It is simply extends the terms of Council Regulation 1107/70 until the end of 1997, deletes the reference to Austria and modifies notification requirements in relation to such aid.  These amendments have little practical relevance to Ireland.</P>
    <P>A proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the granting of Community financial assistance for actions to promote combined goods transport is still under examination at Council. The proposal envisages, in effect, a new programme to run from 1997 to 2001 with a total budget of 35 million ECU.  It builds on an existing programme called PACT, Pilot Actions of Combined Transport, the objective of which is to encourage increased use of combined transport through the provision of support for preliminary and feasibility studies and for the implementation of innovative measures.</P>
    <P>As we welcome any measure which will enhance the competitiveness of transport operations given our peripherality and distance from the European market, Ireland is in favour of the proposed new regulation.  Our aim is to ensure that the text of the regulation, as eventually adopted, will be such as to maximise the benefits of the measure from an Irish perspective.</P>

The second well will be drilled on completion of the first well and will be tested over a 15 day period. The appraisal phase is planned to be completed by the end of July 1997 and is expected to be self-financing.  If the test results produce positive conclusions regarding the amount of oil in place and the productivity of the wells, Statoil would hope to be in a position to declare the field commercial in August and apply for the necessary consents to develop the field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming a favourable outcome from the appraisal programme, Statoil intend to exploit the field as a &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; development with start-up <Col N="533" /> of full production by about 1 June 1998.  Current projections indicate that up to nine additional wells might be drilled for production purposes.</P>
    <P>Four offshore petroleum authorisation holders are expected to undertake drilling programmes in the Irish offshore during 1997.</P>
    <P>Both Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Ltd. and Total Oil Marine plc intend drilling exploration wells in the Porcupine Basin under their frontier exploration licences.  It is likely that Total will commence drilling in the Porcupine Basin in mid-June and they have already carried out a site survey over their proposed drilling location in block 35/17.  Marathon are expected to commence their drilling programme in late May in block 35/30.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Oil plc. have indicated that they arc preparing to drill an exploration well in the Kish Bank and are expected to seek approval shortly to drill in Augusts.</P>
    <P>Further exploration wells may be drilled this year but no proposals have yet been made by the companies to my Departments.</P>

      <P>The EU Transport Council in June 1996 approved a mandate for the Commission to enter into negotiations with the US on the possibility of concluding an agreement on an EU-US common aviation area.</P>
      <P>The first round of negotiations between the Community and the US took place in Washington on 30 and 31 October 1996 and a second round took place in Brussels on 3 April.</P>
      <P>To date the negotiations are concentrating on regulatory issues such as competition rules, ownership and control, code sharing, leasing, computer reservations systems etc.  The mandate does not yet allow for negotiations on traffic rights.</P>
      <P>I expect that at the next transport council in June, the Commission will be reporting on the outcome of the negotiations to date.  It is too early to assess how long the development of any draft EU-US multilateral agreement may take or to speculate as to future council decisions in the matter.</P>

      <P>The details are in the table which I am circulating to Deputies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may recall that, in October 1994, Shannon Airport Marketing was set up to coordinate the marketing activities of Aer Rianta and Shannon Development in respect of Shannon airport.  Prior to that, each of the bodies marketed the airport separately.</P>
      <P>Funding for the new body in 1995 was provided by means of a grant from my Department.  In the course of that year, it became apparent that the new structure was not optimal and, in October 1995, my predecessor announced that sole responsibility for marketing Shannon airport was being transferred to Aer Rianta.  A grant-in-aid was provided by my Department in 1996 for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Since January 1997, Aer Rianta has been funding the marketing of Shannon airport direct from its own resources.</P>

      <P>The following are the more important of these agreements which have been signed by Ireland. The agreements were made following meetings of the International Telecommunications Union and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations of which Ireland is a member.  To distinguish these agreements from each other it is conventional to cite the city in which the meeting was held.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot go into the reasons for the refusal of any particular licence application. These are matters which are confidential to my Department and the applicant concerned.</P>
      <P>However, he will be aware, from my announcement in this House on April 15 last, of my plans to introduce a new scheme for the use of the remaining capacity in the UHF hand for re-transmission services such as those of South Coast.  I have invited South Coast to submit an application under that scheme.  I have decided as a matter of policy, that those who apply for a licence under the new scheme will have to fulfil certain criteria.</P>
      <P>In reaching a decision on the South Coast application I had to have regard to all the relevant factors involved.  Among these are the technical considerations.  The Deputy will know that my Department engaged consultants to examine, among other things, the technical aspects of this application.  I received that report only two months ago and considering the complex issues raised by it I think that the decision in this case was taken in very timely manner.</P>

    <P>* Because of the difficulty in providing details of all types of uniforms provided by the GSA the stock levels shown for the GSA in the above table relate only to service officers' uniforms.</P>
    <P>The level of stocks held depends on a number of issues including the date of delivery and date of issue to officers.  The level of stocks held can vary from a full stock, following delivery, to a basic maintenance stock, to meet ongoing requirements following the annual issue of uniforms, These ongoing requirements arise for a number of reasons such as new appointments and the replacement of damaged uniforms.</P>
    <P>Because of the range of items of clothing which are supplied as part of various uniforms, there is a wide range of materials used.  Among the items of clothing supplied are shirts, pullovers, tunics, ties. trousers, skirts and anoraks etc.</P>
    <P>While I am generally satisfied that the uniforms provided by my Department and the bodies <Col N="541" /> under the aegis of my Department arc adequate for the purposes for which they are provided, my Department is shortly expected to enter into discussions with the Federated Union of Government Employees and the Government Supplies Agency regarding the possible redesign of uniforms provided to service officers.</P>

Routine dental treatment is currently available under the scheme to persons aged 16-34 years and to persons aged 65 years or over.  Routine treatment will be phased in for the remaining age cohorts according as resources are available to me.  Persons requiring routine dental treatment must make application to the health board in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The establishment of an independent living fund has been proposed as a means of funding a personal assistance service to enable people with disabilities to live independently in the community.The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended the introduction of a cost of disability payment which would enable people with disabilities to meet the additional living and medical costs of having a disability, including the provision of a personal assistance service.  This recommendation is currently being considered by the Inter-Departmcntal Task Force which was set up to report in June to Government on the commission's report.</P>
      <P>Currently, personal assistance services are being provided through the Irish Wheelchair Association which has been allocated £518,000 in 1997 for this serviee from the Eastern Health Board and by the Centre for Independent Living through FAS Community Employment Schemes. I am making £1 million available this year for the development of support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including personal assistance services.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, made recommendations on a wide range of issues, including the development of services over a five year period.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I understand that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, has confirmed that the child referred to by the Deputy is on its waiting list for cardiac surgery but that it is not possible at this time to indicate when she will be admitted. I hope the Deputy will understand that admission for cardiac surgery in the public hospital service is determined solely on the basis of the patient's condition and not the length of time spent on the waiting list.  As priority is given to urgent and emergency cases, some patients may be on the waiting list for a considerable time.  If the child's parents feel that her condition warrants more urgent attention they should contact their family <Col N="544" /> doctor who would be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of the case to the consultant directly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to state accurately the overall prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease in the elderly as studies using different diagnostic measures and different types of samples produce different figures.However, the World Health Organisation estimates a rate of the severer degrees of dementia, which would include Alzheimer's Disease, 5 per cent to 8 per cent among those aged 65 years of age and over.  Applying these rates to the present elderly population in Ireland, suggests that between 20,000 and 32,000 people are suffering from dementia.  While it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the number of Alzheimer sufferers in each health board area, it is safe to assume that as the elderly population increases, so too will the incidence of Alzheimer's Disease.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's Discase has recently been the subject of an application for a product authorisation to the Irish Medicines Board.  Before any new drug can be made available on the market for human use it must receive a product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board who must be satisfied as to the quality, safety and efficacy of the product.  If, and when, a product is granted a product authorisation from the Medicines Board, it is then a matter for each clinician, in consultation with the specialist involved, to decide, based on the particular individual's medical condition and needs, whether the product should be prescribed for that person.</P>

      <P>Efforts to resolve the impasse continued on an informal basis culminating in a formal meeting under the auspices of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board on 25 June 1996.  On Wednesday 26 June 1996, I met personally with IMPACT and a delegation of environmental health officers to explore whether or not the provision of the joint Government-ICTU statement of 15 May 1996 could usefully be applied to resolving the current impasse in negotiations.</P>
      <P>On 5 July 1996, with the assistance of a facilitator from the Labour Relations Commission, an informal meeting took place between management and the union.  The meeting was of considerable assistance to both sides and as a result negotiations continued up until quite recently when IMPACT took the decision to escalate the work-to-rule.</P>
      <P>Following renewed contact between both sides the Health Service Employers' Agency and IMPACT met on 26 March 1997 with a view to re-opening discussions.  As a result the threatened escalation in the work-to-rule did not take place.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>An overall review of the urban renewal schemes, as they have operated to date, has been in progress for some time.  As part of the review, a consultants' study on the impact of the schemes in economic, social and architectural terms has been completed and published.  Submissions were invited from interested persons and organisations in relation to the study's conclusions and recommendations and the consultative process culminated in a conference in Dublin Castle on 25 March last.  A framework for future urban renewal policy is currently in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals at this stage to extend the present urban renewal scheme to any additional areas.  It would be inappropriate to consider what new areas, if any, might be suitable for designation as part of any future scheme until general policy in relation to the next phase of urban renewal is determined in the light of the review.</P>

      <P>At present Kilrush community school is operating on a split site within the town while awaiting the construction of a single campus.  Currently, there are ten general classrooms, a physics room and a science laboratory located on the CBS campus. However, I am satisfied that there is sufficient existing accommodation in Kilrush to cater for all the pupils seeking second-level places in the interim.</P>
      <P>Architectural planning for the proposed new extension is proceeding and the planning and building unit of my Department has received the developed sketch scheme, stage 3 for the project within the last two days.  The Department expects that consideration of stage 3 will be completed this week.  A meeting with the design team is scheduled for earlier next week with a view to expediting the remaining stages of planning.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the urgent need for additional accommodation at the school and for this reason the project was designated as a priority and included in the 1997 building programme.It is the intention of my Department to ensure that construction of the new building will commence at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The policy outlined in the Government White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, envisages the expansion of the schools psychological service to all schools, both primary and post-primary.  Provision of this service will be a function of the proposed education boards.  This service will be developed on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>At present, it is the responsibility of the appropriate health board director of community care to arrange for psychological assessments for children in national schools where such are deemed necessary.  It has been drawn to my attention that, in recent years some of the health boards and voluntary bodies have ceased to provide assessments for what they consider to be purely educational purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further expansion of the psychological service has not been possible since 1995 because of the need to limit public spending.

      <P>In July 1995, the Government approved the establishment of the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute.  A steering committee to plan this development was set up in October 1995.  The Institute will be run on the basis of a distributed campus with a core centre located in Thurles, a second in Clonmel and an extended network of outreach centre located around the county.  Planning of the Thurles campus is proceeding satisfactorily and it is intended to seek tenders for the project shortly.</P>
      <P>The original proposal for the Clonmel campus was based on the refurbishment of vacant second level accommodation.  However, the premises continue to be required for the provision of second level accommodation and are not available for use by Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute.  Alternative sites have been examined and a proposal recently received from County Tipperary South Riding Vocational Education Committee is being considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>The implementation of this legislation involves a number of detailed measures on which work is well advanced.  These include the preparation of regulations, the recruitment of staff, securing accommodation, dealing with the present backlog of applications and setting up a system of legal aid for asylum-seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office of the Attorney General is working with my Department on the development of a series of implementing regulations up to 12, of varying degrees of complexity, which are needed <Col N="563" /> to give practical effect to the Act's provisions. These include an order to give effect to the Dublin convention.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commissioners are in the process of recruiting the refugee applications commissioner, and it is expected that an appointment will be made shortly.  Steps are also being taken to secure the additional staff necessary to assist the commissioner in the performance of his or her functions under the Act.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been put in place, in conjunction with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with the aim of reducing to a manageable level the amount of work to be taken on by the commissioner once the Act is commenced.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding as quickly as possible so as to achieve my objective of having this legislation in effect at an early date.  My assessment is that this can be achieved during this Dáil session.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware, of course, that since the legislation was enacted there has been an enormous increase in the number of applicants for asylum in the State.  The impact of this increase is being examined in so far as it will have effect on the setting up of the new structures.</P>

      <P>At the present time, there is one case relating to an offence in the nature of extortion before the courts, and three persons have been charged with offences under Section 17 of the Criminal Law (Public Order) Act, 1994.  These offences relate to incidents alleged to have occurred in 1995 when money was allegedly demanded from an individual for his protection.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy I am fully aware of what the drug culture involves.  I am aware of the devastating effects of drug abuse on communities where many young people have become involved with drugs, where many have died from disease associated with drug misuse.  Drug misuse blights individual lives, undermines families and damages whole communities.I am aware of the fact that Ecstasy is a part of youth culture in certain areas and of the fact that young people have died as a result.  I am also aware of the implications for society as a whole arising from the vast sums of money which can be made from trafficking in drugs and from the involvement of organised crime.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured of my total commitment to dealing with this problem and the fact that I am working tirelessly to deal with the issues of drug related crime and organised crime.  Tackling the drugs problem is a long-term process, to which I attach a high priority.  I am determined to see to it that the drug dealers and traffickers who seek to profit from fear, distress and death are dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have provided me with the following statistics on the drugs problem in Dublin for 1995.  The figures for 1996 are still provisional but the numbers prosecuted are about the same as for 1995.</P>

    <P>I do not consider that it would be appropriate to give a breakdown of the cost of individual uniform items.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that this is commercially sensitive information and that to provide such detailed information could have a detrimental impact on future tender competitions for the supply of uniforms to the Prison Service.</P>
    <P>A new prison service uniform has been introduced in recent years following an extensive consultation process between my Department, the Government Supplies Agency and staff representatives.This ongoing process has also acted to ensure that uniform items are of high standard and meet the requirements for which they are designed.  The new prison uniform and its distribution also accounts for the increase in figures from 1994 as in 1994 stocks were being run down pending the introduction of the new uniforms.</P>

As regards the Garda Síochána and traffic wardens, the information sought cannot be compiled in the time available.</P>
      <P>In relation to prison officers' uniforms, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 87.  Due to time constraints, it is not possible to provide the value of stock on hands for such uniforms.</P>
      <P>Services officers' uniforms are supplied by the Government Supplies Agency of the Office of Public Works.  The gowns for ushers and criers and the uniform for the hall porter, Four Courts, are supplied directly by a commercial firm.  My Department does not maintain stocks of gowns or uniforms or details of materials used.  No complaints have been received about the quality of the uniforms supplied.</P>

      <P>The community employment scheme, operated by FÁS on behalf of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, was established in March 1994 and provides part-time employment opportunities for unemployed people with a view of their re-integration into the labour market and <Col N="569" /> also provides a resource for local development and for voluntary and community sectors.</P>
      <P>The criteria for participation in community employment (CE) is a matter for the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  As the Deputy will be aware, the criteria established by that Department involves a requirement to be on the live register or on lone parents allowance.</P>
      <P>Recipients of deserted wife's benefit (DWB), are facilitated in switching to LPA if they wished to participate in community employment.</P>
      <P>Since the abolition of deserted wife's benefit and with it the requirement on women to prove desertion, the option to switch back to deserted wife's benefit no longer exists except for those who switched before the commencement of the one parent family payment.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, DWB recipients wishing to participate on a CE scheme after 2 January 1997, are being advised by my Department that they can apply for the new one-parent family payment in order to meet the CE qualifying requirements, but that they will not be able to transfer back to DWB at the end of the CE.</P>

      <P>Following a review of his entitlement, it was established that the person concerned had a gross annual income from self-employment in 1996 of £1,970.33.  Based on this figure, a deciding officer assessed his weekly means at £38 from 1 April 1997.  This assessment entitles him to payment of unemployment assistance at the reduced weekly rate of £26.50 from that date.</P>
      <P>It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision and a form for this purpose may be obtained from his Social Welfare local office in Belmullet.  His case will then be forwarded to the independent social welfare appeals office for consideration.</P>

    <P>The significant increase in costs in 1996 arose because in that year, for the first time, jumpers were supplied as part of the Service Officer uniform and full uniforms were supplied to Service Officers serving in all locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The CORI part-time job opportunity programme is a three year pilot programme providing 1,000 part-time opportunities in the social economy and was scheduled to end in June 1997. Given that there will be wind down issues and that some individual projects did not start on time it will be the end of September before the programme is completely finished.  CORI's involvement with the programme will cease at the end of May, as is their wish.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of the pilot programme has been completed and considered by the Government. The evaluation points to a number of positive outcomes from the proposal such as allowing participants to remain on projects for three years and the introduction of spousal entitlement swops. These aspects have already been mainstreamed into community employment.  Other innovations of the CORI concept which might be mainstreamed such as the &ldquo;rate for the job&rdquo; approach have been under consideration, in consultation with CORI and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.  The rate of the job approach has already been adopted in the pilot whole time job initiative programme.</P>
      <P>With regard to the existing sponsors and participants in the pilot programme, the Government have decided that: (1) all suitable CORI sponsors who wish to convert to community employment will be allowed to do so, (2) participants receive special guidance and counselling before the project comes to an end to help them get employment in the open labour market, and (3) that the option of allowing participants a further year on community employment be maintained if it becomes necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> I have received a number of representations from public representatives and others requesting that I meet representatives of supervisors of CORI projects regarding their rates of pay.  While FÁS provides grant-aid to CORI in respect of supervision costs, supervisors of projects are employees of the sponsor and their terms and conditions of employment are matters for negotiations between individual supervisors and sponsors.Accordingly it would be inappropriate for me to intervene.</P>

      <P>Where persons connected with the greyhound industry are alleged to be involved in the blooding of greyhounds, Bord na gCon has wide-ranging legislative powers to undertake investigations and, following this, to exclude any person from participating in the racing or public sale of greyhounds by means of a special exclusion order.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in order to reflect public feeling on the question of cruelty to animals, I recently increased significantly the penalites for cruelty under the Protection of Animals Act, 1911.</P>
      <P>The new penalties are: a fine of up to £1,500 and-or six months imprisonment on summary conviction and a fine of up to £10,000 and-or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</P>
      <P>I believe that these tougher measures will be supported by the vast majority of people and will act as a greater deterrent against acts of cruelty to all animals.</P>

      <P>It is expected that the area planted to potatoes in 1997 will show a decrease over 1996 when approximately 24,300 hectares were sown.  While it is possible to make a reasonable estimate of production tonnage for the crop, based on a normal growing season, prices obtained by growers are determined solely by market forces.</P>
      <P>The quality of the 1996 crop was generally quite good at harvest and, using suitable handling equipment and refrigerated storage, that high quality can be maintained until the new season potatoes come onto the market in June-July. There is little scope for further expansion in the domestic market for potatoes and the industry must seek out new export potential if growth is to be achieved.  In addition there is ongoing effort to develop new and innovative products to help secure the production base.</P>

      <P>The number of payments made in 1996 under the various headage and premia schemes was 1,010,092.  The value of payments made in 1996 was £788 million.  These figures include balancing payments under 1995 and earlier years' schemes as well as payments made under the 1996 schemes in the 1996 calendar year.</P>
      <P>To date over 665,000 payments valued at £683 million have already issued under the 1996 schemes.  The estimated amount outstanding under these schemes is £87 million which includes £62 million in respect of extensification premium and £6.5 million in respect of October 1996 suckler cow premium.  It is expected that payments under the extensification premium will commence in May in line with the commitments given in the Charter of Rights for Farmers and with EU requirements.  Payments under the October 1996 suckler cow premium scheme will commence in early May when the six month retention period has expired.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the outstanding payments involve all schemes but principally 20 per cent balancing payments under the special beef premium scheme.  These are largely problem cases including area aid linked issues and payments are continuing as problems are resolved.</P>

      <P>A total of 6,327 tonnes of intervention beef with a value of IR£26,135,554 has been distributed throughout Ireland between December 1987 and November 1996 under the European Community's scheme for the supply of food for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community.</P>
      <P>Three hundred and fifty seven tonnes of intervention beef have been allocated to Ireland for 1997.  Approximately 47.6 tonnes to a value of IR£192.089 have already been distributed to various charities in the first quarter of this year under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department remains in close contact with all the charities involved and it is intended that <Col N="577" /> as much as possible of our 1997 allocation will be distributed by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>The following table gives a breakdown of all the costs orders made by the chairman of the beef tribunal and in the cases where the Taxing Master has made orders it shows the amounts paid to date by this Department.  The claim from the legal representatives of Deputy O'Malley has been taxed by the Taxing Master and objections are being prepared.  No bills of costs have been presented for taxation in any case other than those shown in the table.  My Department has no outstanding claims for witness expenses from civil servants.  The question of an appeal to the High Court in relation to the recent ruling by the Taxing Master in the Laurence Goodman, Goodman International and Subsidiary Companies claim is being considered.</P>

      <P>Significant progress has been made in the area of organic farming.  The number of farmers engaged in organic farming is close on 600 compared with the position in 1990 when there were only 165 organic farmers in Ireland. This increase is due in the main to the attractive financial incentives available under the rural environment protection scheme to farmers who convert to or continue to farm organically.</P>
      <P>Additionally a special scheme for the development of the organic farming sector has been provided for under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-99.  Under this scheme grant-aid is available in respect of marketing and promotion as well as capital investment projects.  This scheme was introduced in 1995 and to date 12 projects have been grant-aided.  Applications have also been received under the 1997 tranche of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should also be aware that in 1996 to further the development of the organic sector, my colleague Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, established an organic consultative committee to advise him on all aspects of the organic agriculture and food industry.  This committee is chaired by the Minister of State and has representation from State and private organic interests.</P>
      <P>Finally, my Department has organised a symposium on organic farming, the aim of which is to enlighten existing and potential organic farmers on all aspects of the organic farming sector, in Portlaoise tomorrow.</P>

      <P>Products having oestrogenic, androgenic, gestagenic and thyrostatic action, as well as beta-agonists, have been known to be used illegally for growth promotion in livestock.  The Deputy will be aware that the Animal Remedies Act, 1993 prohibits the use of any substance for growth promotion, unless specifically authorised for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that extensive monitoring is carried out by my Department to detect the use of illegal substances.  Such monitoring indicated that there has been a reduction in the use of such substances.  I remain determined to eliminate the use of all prohibited substances.</P>

      <P>Monitoring carrried out by my Department indicates that there has been a significant reduction in the use of clenbuterol also known as angel dust in the past few years.</P>
      <P>In 1993, for example, 3.77 per cent of samples were positive for clenbuterol.  This level has declined each year since and in 1996, 0.14 per cent of samples were positive for clenbuterol.  I would like to stress my continuing commitment to using the full rigours of the law with a view to eliminating the use of all prohibited substances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The calculation of the UNITS for grant purposes takes into account all of the farm enterprises including average stock numbers, ERAD test reports etc.</P>
      <P>In this case the actual assessment was done on the basis of 55 weanlings plus 55 other livestock, 1.5 years @ 0.6 UNITS, 68 Sheep @ 0.15 UNITS, and 4.56Ha cereals @ 1 Unit making a total of 80.66.  The grant rate of 30 per cent on the investment ceiling of £45,000 applies.  On this basis, the applicant was advised of the maximum grant payable in the Department's approval letter of 31 July 1995.</P>
      <P>In subsequent Teagasc reports of 25 November 1996 and 16 December 1996, incorrect data was used in that the sheep were completely omitted in the first and the correct total was not used in the second.</P>

      <P>A report published by the European Commission this week suggests that the rate of self-sufficiency in the EU beef sector will be approximately 112 per cent in 1997.  Taking account of the export possibilities under the GATT ceiling and imports from third countries, the net surplus of beef on the EU market this year is expected to be approximately 300,000 tonnes or 4 per cent of production.</P>
      <P>The beef surplus should decline from 1998 to 2000, because of a gradual recovery in consumption and a fall in production as a result of the measure taken by the Agriculture Council last October and the continued implementation of the over 30 months scheme in the United Kingdom. The measures adopted by the Council include the calf slaughtering scheme and the early marketing scheme which, together, are aimed at diverting one million calves per annum from beef production with the overall objective of reducing beef production by approximately 350,000 tonnes per annum.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy is the Mid-Term Evaluation of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry under the Community Support Framework for Ireland (CSF) which was completed by independent consultants in January 1997.  That evaluation included a review of the dairy hygiene scheme and it was in this context that the evaluators made the remarks about the scheme having a significant impact on dairy farm development.  In fact, they were making the point that the scheme, as designed, covered investments which went beyond enabling the farmer comply with the Dairy Hygiene Directive 92/46/EEC.  They went on to question whether, because of limited resources, any new scheme should be biased more in favour of the hygiene elements only.</P>
      <P>The scheme was suspended in October 1996 when all available funds had been fully committed.Under Partnership 2000, the Government has indicated its intention to re-introduce, as a priority, this scheme and the scheme for the control of farm pollution if additional funds become available at the mid-term review.</P>
      <P>The report is confidential at present as it is a first step in the overall review of the CSF.  The ESRI are carrying out the evaluation of the CSF as a whole and it is expected that decisions on any reallocation of funds will be made at the CSF Monitoring Committee meeting in July 1997.</P>

      <P>The EU funded BSE compensation package which was the subject of agreement in the Agriculture Council last October was not formally adopted until December 1996.  In the interests of administrative convenience, I have decided to implement this package in conjunction with the agrimonetary compensation package which was adopted by the Agriculture Council in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount of aid under both measures is approximately £50 million and will be allocated as follows: (1) suckler cow premium: A top-up of approximately £20 in respect of each suckler cow which qualified for a premium under the 1996 scheme; (2) special beef premium: A top-up of <Col N="586" /> approximately £10 in respect of each male animal which qualified for a premium under the 1996 ten and 22 months special beef premium schemes; (3) deseasonalisation slaughter premium: A top-up of approximately £10 per head for those animals which qualified for the 1997 deseasonalisation slaughter premium payment of the top-up in respect of animals slaughtered after 1 April is subject to proof that the applicant owed the animals in question on 1 April 1997; (4) special cases: A payment of approximately £20 per head to (a) producers (i) who have had male cattle slaughtered at meat export plants or exported live outside the EU between 10 June 1996 and 31 December 1996, and (ii) who owned the male cattle prior to 20 March 1996, and (iii) did not claim any premium on the male cattle in question, and (b) producers who sold finished heifers which they owned prior to 20 March 1996 to meat export plants, local abattoirs or marts between 1 July 1996 and 31 December 1996.  In the case of heifers sold through marts a minimum liveweight of 450 kgs applies.</P>
    <P>The precise levels of payments will be determined as soon as the overall number of animals qualifying is known.</P>
    <P>In the case of (1), (2) and (3) above it is intended that the top-up payments will be made automatically during May 1997.  In the case of the deseasonalisation slaughter premium it is intended that the top-up to be paid in May will be in respect of those animals for which a basic deseasonalisation slaughter premium has already issued &mdash; generally animals slaughtered in the period January to 31 March 1997.  Top-ups in respect of animals slaughtered afte 1 April will be paid as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>In the case of (4) above the closing date for receipt of completed application forms was Wednesday 16 April 1997.  The applications are currently being processed in my Department and it is intended that payments will issue during May 1997.</P>

      <P>At the Council of Ministers meeting on 17-19 March I secured agreement to the payment in 1997 of EU funded compensatory aid to producers in the milk, beef, cereals and sugar sectors.The compensation will amount to £46.1 million in 1997, £30.7 million in 1998 and £15.4 million in 1999.  This compensation is for income <Col N="587" /> losses suffered by producers as a result of price support reductions following the green rate revaluations of 8 November, 1996 and 11 January this year.  I am planning for the payment of this compensation to producers in May.</P>
      <P>On 29 March 1997 there was a further revaluation of 2.765 per cent in the Irish green rate.  The Agrimonetary Management Committee meeting in Brussels on 23 April agreed additional EU compensation aid in respect of the March revaluation, amounting to £25.4 million in 1997, £16.9 million in 1998 and £8.5 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the green rate applicable to the CAP reform premiums, including payments under the accompanying measures, was not affected by any of these green rate revaluations.</P>
      <P>As regards funding from the national Exchequer, £17 million will be paid to the beef sector because of the particularly adverse market conditions being experienced by that sector.  The scheme of payments requires Commission approval but my aim is to have payments made as quickly as possible.  The position in relation to national funding for other sectors is under review.</P>

      <P>In the context of a review of the EU sheepmeat quota regime in 1996, I proposed to the EU Commission that the opportunity should be availed of to examine the wider aspects of the sheepmeat regime.  As part of my submission to the Commission I raised the question of the payment of an extensification premium on sheep. The Commission replied that sheep production was deemed to be an extensive farming system and that such a premium would be extremely costly.  However, under the REPS programme there are very generous levels of aid available to producers who may have to reduce their flock size for environmental reasons.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to pursue this issue.  However, it should be recognised that the matter is being considered against a background of record prices prevailing for most of the year for sheepmeat and concern about the cost of the sheepmeat regime.</P>

      <P>In order to redress these grievances, it was decided to set up an appeals panel to examine the case for including additional areas.  This panel invited interested farmers and groups to send in appeals, and my Department carried out a 100 per cent survey of farmers in all the areas from which appeals were received.</P>
      <P>The appeals panel examined the survey data and recommended the inclusion of some new areas as disadvantaged.  After discussions with the EU Commission, a further 128,000 hectares were approved for designation as disadvantaged, details of which I announced in May 1996.</P>
      <P>This fifth review of disadvantaged areas was conducted by an independent appeals panel.  All non-disadvantaged areas in the country were eligible for examination, and the data used in the area evaluation was provided by the farmers in those areas.  In view of this I am satisfied that all eligible areas have now been included in the disadvantaged areas, and with almost 75 per cent of the land area of the country designated as disadvantaged, I have no plans to initiate a new review of areas in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>Under the 1996 BSE compensation package the person concerned was entitled to BSE related top-up payments of £22.40 per animal in respect of 21 cows which qualified for payment under the 1995 suckler cow scheme and £19.08 per animal in respect of 19 steers which qualified for payment under the 1995 special beef premium scheme giving a total entitlement of £832.92.  When payment of these top-ups was being made an amount of £790.83 was inadvertently deducted from the person's entitlement and a cheque for £42.09 issued on 8 October 1996.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the aerial maps which issued to farmers this year for use in completing their 1997 area aid applications are accurate reflections of the positions shown on the maps submitted by farmers in earlier years and that there is no particular problem relating to drumlin areas.  The land parcels shown on those maps submitted by farmers were validated against aerial photography taken in early 1995 which was orthorectified subsequently so as to accurately overlay Ireland's national grid.  My Department and Ordnance Survey co-operated fully to ensure satisfactory quality control over this task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot guarantee absolute up-to-date accuracy of any mapping system, however. Changes in roads, rivers, building sites, land parcels, crops sown etc. may have taken place between 1995, when these aerial photographs were taken and 1997 &mdash; and the accuracy of the maps my Department issues in any particular year depends to a large extent on the accuracy of the information provided to us by farmers in previous years.  This is why in a letter accompanying each set of maps issued, my Department has asked farmers to make any corrections necessary on those maps and return them <Col N="593" /> with their 1997 area aid applications as amended correspondingly.</P>

      <P>Operators of mobile telephony services are required to hold a licence, granted by my Department, under section 111 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  These licences authorise the provision of service and the building of the necessary telecommunications infrastructure including masts and cell sites.</P>
      <P>The licences also require that operators comply with the internationally accepted standards in relation to emissions of non-ionising electromagnetic radiation.  The Director of Telecommunications Regulation who will be appointed shortly pursuant to the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996 will, in the context of his/her function of ensuring compliance with licence conditions, have responsibility to arrange monitoring of such emissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, section 3 of the Wireless Telegraph Act, 1926 provides that no person may keep or have in his possession, instal, maintain, work or <Col N="594" /> use apparatus for wireless telegraphy except in so far as this is done in accordance with a licence granted by my Department.  The purpose of this prohibition is to ensure effective use of the radio frequency spectrum, which is a limited national resource, and to avoid interference between radio systems.</P>
    <P>The radio apparatus associated with mobile phone masts and cell sites must, therefore, be licensed.  Licensing conditions imposed in licences are confined to issues relating to the orderly use of the radio frequency spectrum and prevention of interference.</P>
    <P>The licences referred to above do not, <i>per sé</i>, relate specifically to individual masts or cell sites. The location is a given site may be identified in a wireless telegraphy licence where this is necessary for radio frequency planning purposes because of the type of radio transmission operated from that site.</P>
    <P>These licensing requirements do not absolve the licensee from any requirement in law to obtain whatever additional consents, permissions, authorisations or licences which may be necessary for the provision of the service.</P>

      <P>The strategic alliance shareholder's and Share Purchase Agreements were signed on 20 December 1996 between the Irish Government, PTT of the Netherlands and Telia of Sweden.  The transaction provides for PTT and Telia to acquire 20 per cent of the share capital of Telecom Éireann for an initial payment of £182.9 million.  The agreement also provide PTT and <Col N="595" /> Telia with an option to acquire a further 15 per cent of Telecom Éireann for £200 million in three years' time.  In addition the State will receive 60 per cent of the increase in value of the strategic partners investment above a certain threshold in three years' time.  The total proceeds for the 35 per cent stake are expected to exceed £500 million.</P>
      <P>The agreement also provides for the transfer of significant strategic benefits to Telecom Éireann. While the details of specific strategic initiatives are commercially sensitive, in general they cover the full range of businesses segments.</P>
      <P>This transaction was completed following a thorough selection process which was designed and managed by Morgan Stanley, investment bankers.  Nine companies which had expressed an interest in the alliance received an information memorandum in the first phase of the process. Three of these potential partners participated in the final phase as two competing entities.  The final selection was made on the basis of predetermined evaluation criteria covering financial, strategic and legal requirements.</P>

      <P>I have some difficulty in understanding what the Deputy is actually asking here.  In the absence of any clarification, I will assume that he is referring to the demand for MMDS service.  This is something that is difficult to assess due to the presence in the market of unlicensed UHF operators who are in a position to supply multi-channel television service at significantly less than true cost.  The current take-up of MMDS service is in the order of 80,000 subscribers but in a truly competitive environment it might be considerably higher.</P>
      <P>The Wireless Telegraphy (Television Programme Retransmission) Regulations, 1989, is the relevant legislation governing the operations of MMDS licensees.  I have no plans at this stage to bring forward any further legislation with regard to MMDS.</P>

      <P>The details sought in regard to the cost of items of uniform for the Defence Forces are not readily available from my Department's records.  The information is, however, being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Materials specified for use in the manufacture of items of uniform are of a high quality.  The quality and type of all items of uniform procured for the Defence Forces are closely monitored by the military authorities to ensure suitability for use and comfort to the wearer.  Any adjustments to quality, pattern or materials considered to be necessary in the light of usage and the experience of military personnel are introduced as required.</P>
      <P>The cost of uniform and protective clothing issued by my Department for the use of local authority Civil Defence organisations for each of the three years in question was as follows: 1994, £135,288; 1995, £44,805; 1996, £111,533.</P>
      <P>All items of uniform and protective clothing are issued to local authorities immediately after purchase; hence no stock is held in store.  The quality of the materials used in the making up of these items is monitored by the technical services in the Government Supplies Agency.</P>

      <P>Naval Service officers from all branches of the service have served and continue to serve both in UNIFIL and with many UN Observer Missions.  Naval command must be conscious of an officer's suitability, experience, length of service, courses completed and overall career structure prior to nominating such an officer for overseas service.</P>
      <P>In the case of Naval Service nominations for UNTSO, ship command has always been deemed to be an additional desirable criteria.  Only officers of the executive branch are qualified to take command of a State ship at sea, and as such, only officers from this branch have received nominations for UNTSO to date.  It should also be stressed that very few Naval Service officers have served with UNTSO &mdash; only seven since 1983.</P>
